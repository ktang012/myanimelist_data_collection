            "content": "TLDR: Inverted Parabola. Starts out all right, gets better towards the middle, crashes and burns at the end.\r\nPsycho Pass made a huge splash in 2012 as a successful Urobutcher series. Its creativity, style, and execution flowed into an enjoyable and imaginative show - albeit with some missteps. Without Urobuchi at the helm, Psycho Pass 2 tries to take his universe and tell a unique story and, honestly, fails pretty hard.\r\nIf you've seen the first season, you probably wonder where the plot for this dystopian thriller could go. After all, much of the original Psycho Pass was an introspective exploration into the world it created. Where,given all the plot developments of the first seasons, could this new series explore?\\n\\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, nowhere. Striking similarities to the first season become quickly apparent and there's an overlying feeling of deja vu throughout the entire series. The story revolves around the same conflict debated in the first series and doesn't add anything new. As the plot progresses further, it desperately tries to distinguish itself through forced and melodramatic plot twists that ultimately amount to a bizarre and nonsensical finale with a confusing, out-of-left-field take-home message.\\n\\n\r\nMost annoying is the lack of continuity from the initial series in characters. In some ways, Psycho Pass 2 doesn't feel like a sequel so much as a parody of the first series. Development seems to only really carry over for Akane; she is the only one in the cast who feels right. Ginoza, the other main protagonist from the first series, takes a backseat role. No, not like the backseat of a car; if Psycho Pass 2 was a Boeing 747, Ginoza would be sitting in the rear flight attendant's area. His developments from the previous season are ignored and he receives something like...15 lines of dialogue? \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Psycho Pass 2 introduces Shimotsuki, one of the most infuriating characters to watch on screen. Her backstory is left unexplained and viewers are left to decode the infinite mystery that is her decisionmaking logic. Tougane, on the other hand, exhibits the makings of a good character and is certainly the most entertaining aspect of Psycho Pass 2. Unfortunately, the last few episodes don't really capture the potential of his character, instead bogging him down in the far less interesting main story.\\n\\n\r\nKamui, the main antagonist, is a washed-up recycle of Makishima with essentially the same character traits and demeanor. These similarities make it incredibly difficult to appreciate him as a stand-alone character. While he may have had some distinguishing features, the resemblance to Makishima in both his methods and his goal detract from an otherwise decent antagonist. Psycho Pass 2 tries to throw in some twists to make him more interesting, but the show can't escape the shadow of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a much weaker cast than the original Psycho Pass, which wasn't even that great to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the animation and sound of Psycho Pass 2 reflect the budget. Animation more or less matches the original show - perhaps slightly better given an 11-episode length compared to 24-episodes. The soundtrack is good, but worse than the first season. Ling Tosite Sigure offers a serviceable opening; however, not nearly as catchy as their work in Psycho Pass's first OP and Tokyo Ghoul. The ending song is my easily favorite song of the show and accents the ending of each episode nicely. The removal of the \"Dominator\" insert song brings down the score a full point, however.\\n\\n\r\nI really wouldn't recommend watching this show if you've seen the first season. Even if you haven't, just watch the first season instead and leave it at that. Episodes 1-6 build up suspense and anticipation that Psycho Pass 2 fails to deliver on. Everything you'll see about the Psycho Pass universe occurred in the first season; Psycho Pass 2 doesn't offer anything dramatically different. It's simply a less interesting version of the first season that leaves you with questions like:\\n\\n\r\n\"What the fuck is wrong with Shimotsuki?\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n",

            "content": "I suspect that the writer for Psycho Pass 2 created the script after surfing through conspiracy theorist sites written by potheads, followed by using the most hackneyed checklist of what constitutes a \u2018dark, edgy thriller\u2019: Somewhat sympathetic villain. Devoted, eye-patch wearing female accomplice in a red cleavage-baring outfit. Innocent puppies being killed mercilessly. Mutilated human faces hanging on walls. People being burned alive while \u2018Nessun Dorma\u2019 plays in the background. (No, I am not joking about the last one.) \r\nPsycho Pass 2 is a terrible sequel. By \u2018terrible sequel\u2019, I do not mean a mediocre sequel that paled in comparison to the original but servedas a solid continuation of the story otherwise. I mean a sequel that ripped out all the things that made the first season interesting, shoved the pieces up its ass, and proceeded to take a dump on its predecessor\u2019s corpse.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the distinguishing factor of the Psycho Pass universe: the Sibyl System. An utilitarian system that valued the collective happiness of everyone, viewing certain strong emotions as impediments to its ideals. Although it suppressed free will and denied space for self-actualization, it was successful in creating a stable society that escalated levels of happiness. It was not evil, it simply prioritized values differently. However, the Sibyl System in Psycho Pass 2 is clearly evil. Its once cold, calculating nature has been replaced with a comically wicked persona that involves itself in all sorts of conspiracies for selfish reasons. It might as well be a maniacal, moustache-stroking dictator plucking sandwich crumbs from his beard.  \\n\\n\r\nThe writing decision to make the Sibyl System act too human ruptured the thematic axis built up by Season One. The chaos did not stop there, the show abandoned its allegory on individual-society relationships and delved straight into a conspiracy thriller plot. The result was a mess of nonsensical conspiracies that ignored the rules established in the previous season. The writer seems to think that the more complicated the villain\u2019s scheme, the better the story. The main villain, Kirito Kamui, is an expert programmer, hacking into several security systems, pulling convoluted tricks on the police, brainwashing people into becoming his cult followers, carrying out multiple organ transplants, and God knows what else. The twists and new details created too many logical gaps in the story to keep the viewer\u2019s investment. It only got more pretentious towards the end with all the theories that have no substantial contribution towards the show\u2019s themes.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the main Inspector Akane Tsunemori started off promising and confident. However, she displayed no real growth by the end of the series, even after all the tragedy she witnessed, after how Sybil System was revealed to be a corrupt dipshit. Her pacifist beliefs did not shake one bit, neither did she offer any new insight. The new characters were nothing interesting either, although Sakuya Tougane, the Enforcer with the highest Crime Coefficient ever recorded, had potential. Of course, he eventually descended into self-parody along with the show. There\u2019s also Mika Shimotsuki, the new Inspector whom everyone wanted to electrocute since episode 1. It was obvious that the show was trying to make her a poster child of the Sibyl System, but her character was utilized very poorly. Lacking initiative, useless, with cow manure for brains, it is hard to imagine how she even qualified for the job. Even after witnessing violent accidents that were partially her fault, she did not come to any realizations, her behavior painted her more like a caricature than an actual person. Yet, the show continued to focus on her childishness, which only served to annoy the audience further instead of articulating any interesting points.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the art and music departments, the animation is passable, although it took a slight dip in quality compared to the first season. I\u2019ll give extra props to the music department though, for giving us the comedic gold that was the \u2018Nessun Dorma\u2019 scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Psycho Pass 2 had me questioning if the writer paid any attention to the first season at all. In fact, the show seemed to undermine its audience\u2019s intelligence with the sheer stupidity of its plot and made-up fictional details, every episode in the second half did a good job of destroying half of my brain cells. To put it straight: Psycho Pass 2 failed to add anything meaningful to the original. It tried too hard to be \u2018deep and edgy\u2019 by throwing in shock and violence, even though it lacked thematic resonance of any sort. It\u2019s like trying to improve the taste of burnt buffalo wings by pouring a bucket of hot sauce on it: not only does it still taste terrible, you are probably going to end up with a bad case of diarrhea, idiot.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n\"The law doesn't protect the people, it's the people who protect the law.\"\r\n\"It's not society that determines the future of its people, it's the people who determine the future of their society.\"\r\nPsycho Pass 2 is best described as a political / moral discourse about the right and means of judgement, thrown into a thrilling plot and a cast of underdeveloped characters. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved season 1 of this series, but I thought that while season 2 was an interesting extension of what happened in S1, it didn't do it enough \"justice\" (oh the puns).\r\nI have come tothe conclusion that I should judge Psycho-Pass 2 collectively, and not individually as a standalone series (hence, the rating does not go below 5).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\n+ Strong main character\\n\r\n+ Good moral discourse towards the end\\n\r\n+ Sensible resolution\\n\r\n+ Great animation and art\\n\r\n+ Great background music builds suspense\\n\r\n+ Gripping and exciting plot development\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Mess of underdeveloped supporting characters\\n\r\n- Useless and stupid supporting characters\\n\r\n- Unnecessary and unimportant plot events\\n\r\n- Many, many unexplained plot holes\\n\r\n- Overpowered antagonist character\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is split into 3 main plot arcs, excluding the introductory arc, and they are the mental care facility arc, the drone base arc and the final train hostage arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe introductory arc starts off very well, cutting right to the chase in the middle of a crime investigation where we begin to see all the new characters being introduced (Shimotsuki, Togane and Hinakawa). While the criminal was apprehended very easily, we begin to see traces of how this crime is not as simple as it initially seems, from the final scene of episode 1 where the main antagonist reveals himself and manages to kidnap an inspector and kill off one of her Enforcers. (+1 for excitement)\\n\\n\r\nThings start to get really interesting from there as Akane, the main protagonist, begins to get clues about this \"ghost\" known as Kamui, who apparently bypasses all cymatic scans and can live in society without actually existing. One particularly scary / exciting part was when Akane, in the midst of searching for clues, finds the words 'WC?' scratched on the wall of her apartment building - a very shocking revelation. Later on, it is revealed that this does not mean that Kamui cannot find a bathroom, but that Kamui is asking Akane, and subsequently Sibyl, what colour they are, and further on, what colour he himself is (since he can't be scanned by Sibyl). (+1 for development)\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of depth that they actually put into the thought process behind Kamui is actually very impressive - from how he was the lone survivor of an airline crash to becoming part of an experiment to join 184 different body parts (aka personalities) together to form a human being that essentially represents a collective group of people, the only other collective group being Sibyl itself. While it would be obvious to point out that joining 184 body parts together to create a live working human is far from possible, at least the anime itself points this out by expressing Saiga's doubt so I'm not deducting any points for that plot flaw. Kamui then proceeds to represent these 184 different people, and begins to start his grand plan of \"making everybody clear\" which is actually better phrased as \"going to judge Sibyl\". I found that the amount of moral and political discourse about omnipotent beings, collective judgement and perfection / ideals within the anime  is quite substantial so kudos for that. (+1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the main idea of the story was quite simple - put a collective entity in the system so that Sibyl must judge itself, so nothing too complex there. A collective Psycho-Pass would mean that groups of people could be judged as dangerous even though each individual was clear, or that people's Psycho-Pass could change when within different groups, or like the twist at the end with Kamui - who claims that the person holding the Dominator becomes collectively part of Sibyl when pointing it at Sibyl itself. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this twist doesn't make much sense no matter how you look at it. If Kamui points at Sibyl and Kamui is part of Sibyl, and it shows a value of zero, why would Akane, who is much clearer than Kamui, make the result any greater than zero? This would most likely make Sibyl go into the negative, if anything. Nice try, but that twist doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while there is an overarching plot, the 3 main plot arcs within didn't make sense. All Kamui really wanted to do was to point a dominator at Sibyl and to force them to judge themselves. There was honestly really no need for all the subsequent killing after he got a hold of Shisui's Dominator during the first episode, and there was nothing else stopping him from walking right up to Sibyl's front door except explaining to Akane why he needs to do so. And, I believe, Akane would have immediately obliged, seeing as how she did so at the end of the anime anyway. So, everything that Kamui plotted, all the people he killed after the first episode, in my opinion, was grossly unnecessary and only serves to heighten the \"suspense\" that would end up turning on itself at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot attempts to explain that all of the other crimes were to \"test\" the functions of the Dominator - whether it could judge inspectors, other enforcers - and then to whether he could use it with the inspector's eyeball, then to just getting more Dominators for accomplices he didn't need, to carry out the train hostage taking plan that he didn't really have to carry out. The mental care facility arc was apparently to see if an inspector could be judged, but with Kamui's intelligence, this could have been done simply by pointing the gun at Shisui. The final train hostage arc was to overload Sibyl system and hence find out where Sibyl actually was - but in the end Akane brought him there so that was plain useless. So basically the plot could have been shortened to just episodes 1 and 12.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, we look at Kamui's incredible powers of persuading people through the use of drugs and holos, arguably his two main skills in this anime (aside from teleportation of course, but we'll get to that later). I'm fine with Kamui being an expert in a certain field, but in multiple fields, this becomes less and less likely. So we start with Kamui being an expert at Psycho-Pass-reduction drugs, that make people be able to kill anybody they want after taking some injection or aerosol medication. Sure, but Kamui can also program holograms of himself. Not only that, but it seems like he has 184 different holograms, all of whom are himself, and all of whom are \"aged-up\" versions of his dead friends. Okay, let's suppose he can do that, what about being able to hack into the Ministry of Defence and MWPSB's systems and to take control of ALL their drones? Okay, what about being able to find escape route for a mental care facility that was supposed to be locked down already? Can he teleport now? Oh wait, I forgot that he is also a bomb expert who can program his bombs to be overridden and controlled only by him. Next, he can also apparently produce synthetic retinal layers so that his accomplices can use Dominators under Shisui's name too, without any background in materials science. He also happens to be a drone expert and can remove the impact absorbers of drones cleanly. Amazing! Really, the amount of things that this guy can do is so over the top, it's a mystery why this man hasn't managed to locate Sibyl yet with all the time he seems to have on his hands, learning about all these things.\\n\\n\r\nNext, one of the key things I really hated about the plot this time around was about the whole Togane Misako and Togane Sakuya plotting to turn Akane black. We already know that this is not possible. While Akane is not criminally asymptomatic, from S1, we know that her Psycho-Pass NEVER gets clouded, not ever. And if anything, Sibyl should already know this. The entire plot twist about Togane being the secret antagonist and trying to cloud Akane's Psycho-Pass was incredibly unnecessary and annoying. While it did add some dimension to the plot, it didn't have any convincing motives whatsoever - all Togane said was \"This is my reason for existence\" - and neither did it progress the plot in any meaningful way. So Akane's grandmother was killed for no reason whatsoever, that's just sad and cruel and doesn't do justice to one of my favourite characters of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOther huge plot holes include Inspector Shisui, who changes very suddenly from having her eyeball taken out to becoming super loyal to Kamui, as can be seen clearly in the final two episodes where she fights almost to the brink of death for Kamui's cause. The only possible way to explain how a person who was kidnapped, then strapped to a chair with a gun pointing to herself, then seeing her own eyeball outside of her body, change so suddenly to having so much affection for her kidnapper to the point of saying \"You can use my body as well\" (during the drone base arc) or to even agreeing to kill / endanger her own former partner, Aoyanagi, is that she was brainwashed with some of Kamui's drugs - but this was not even mentioned, so it's definitely a plot hole. Not to mention that I know Kamui is an expert at drugs but it just because he himself went through 184 body part surgery doesn't mean that he is anywhere near skilled enough to perform eye surgery in the first place (oh wait, I forgot he has an infinite set of skills).\\n\\n\r\nThere were also a whole load of other unexplained plot junk like Kamui's killing of a lot of \"illegal aliens\" during a dinner banquet, Shimotsuki suddenly having the freedom to go and expose Togane's secrets to set the audience off on a red herring that everyone in the audience knows is fake, Akane's grandmother having her ear cut off instead of being killed in the first place (and then getting killed again eventually), Kamui getting help from so many people, Sibyl able to identify inanimate objects like drones based on their threat level and them killing people, but still having immense trouble figuring out whether a person who just killed another person is a \"threat\" based on cymatic scan. All of this is glossed over in the anime and simply overlooked, as if the writers hoped nobody would ask questions and just accept them as it is.\\n\\n\r\nNext, character behaviour during some plot events were unnatural. Shimotsuki's reaction to learning about the Sibyl system, plus Sibyl choosing to reveal the reality to her in the first place didn't make any sense whatsoever. Togane mentioned that Shimotsuki could be used as a \"test subject\" to see how citizens would react if faced with the reality of Sibyl, but Shimotsuki's reactions were that of a person in denial and that is by no means a valuable test subject. If I were Togane, I would have simply killed her immediately because she adds no value to the society, and even less to the plot (but more of her uselessness later - see character section).\\n\\n\r\nStill, at the very least the key premise of the plot made sense - that Sibyl needed to change to accommodate the collective identity of Kamui, as well as itself. It prides itself on \"evolving\" continually to improve but honestly it was all Akane's doing and persuasion that convinced Sibyl that anything needed changing at all. I'm horribly saddened that a collective of 100+ brains could not see this and needed Akane to give it a lecture. Then again, aristocracy is not perfect, so whatever. (+1 for believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nI do have on final note on the interesting sniper-dominator weapon that one of the protagonists from Division 3 used during the second arc to \"shoot through\" the wall and accidentally hit Aoyangi, basically killing her. This calls into question the design and specifications of the Dominator in the first place, as it is a key plot device that is never really touched on or explained. We do know that it does have a fixed number of shots, thanks to Togane's random quibbling about how there are only 3 Destroy-Decomposer shots during the drone base arc, but other than that we still have no idea, after two seasons, of what exactly it fires and where it gets it's power/ rounds from since there obviously isn't any reloading going on. They definitely need to get down to some explaining of how this thing really works, and then on to explaining how it's actually possible for such rounds / pulses of energy to be able \"shoot through\" walls and if so, what material / how thick and how reliably so? Plus, the cymatic scan is shown many times to be able to \"bypass walls\", so honestly why can't it bypass humans as well (all the countless of times the psycho-pass clear people block a Dominator by standing in front of an enforcement target) - especially when the human isn't technically completely blocking the person behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot really suffers this time around, not so much because of the main plot line but because of the general incoherence and unnecessary twists and events that felt very pointless at the end of the entire anime. I did, however, like the conclusion because at least it sensibly resolved the entire conflict in the most reasonable way possible. (+1 for overarching, resolved conflict)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art design and concept behind this anime is just so good. \\n\r\nOP Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nAnimation: 3/3\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme: 1/2 - this OP really suffered from all the horrible high pitch vocals, though the backing track was very upbeat and exciting\\n\r\nED Theme: 2/2 - good ED theme in general\\n\r\nBackground Music: 4/4 - very good background music that really built up suspense throughout\\n\r\nAdditional Themes: 0/2 - There were no additional themes, so no points here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character definitely has to be Shinya Kogami. Lol. Even though he wasn't even featured as a main character throughout S2, his cameo appearances were enough to make me love him because his lines are always impactful and game-breaking. And he is so cool! :D\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, we move on to the main protagonist, Akane, who has grown from being just an innocent, fresh police inspector to a mature, sharp, quick-witted and decisive woman who is pretty much the best boss anyone could ask for. She's understanding, calm, efficient and she gets her hands dirty when she needs to. While she doesn't show much growth throughout the anime (she's already grown a lot S1), her character development continues to pull through - from her recent smoking habit to the way she handles her new, annoying colleague Shimotsuki, to her talking with Saiga and her final face-off with Sibyl and Kamui. Akane is a character with such strong presence and courage that it's hard not to like her. She's also the one-of-a-kind natural master of her own psycho-pass. (+1 for bravery, +1 for uniqueness)\\n\\n\r\nMany people didn't like how Akane's only reaction to her grandmother's death was just one scream - but just hold that thought a while. The way Akane recovered from the initial shock and emotion, and finally went to rationalizing the whole thing - realizing that it was not possible that Kamui would target her grandmother - was not simply because of \"her nature\". The specific cutscene shows Akane remembering Kogami's words, \"This is unlike you... didn't you try to stop me (from killing Shogo Makishima) because you believe in (the law)?\" Akane was clearly distraught but she managed composed herself by recalling her past experiences in S1. Since I view S2 in light of the events in S1, I know that it's not that Akane is emotionless or lacks any human feeling in her, it's that she bravely makes the decision to suppress them to uphold the law, and to protect all of society, not just the people important to her. (+1 for character depth)\\n\\n\r\nThe next pretty damn cool character is Saiga, the one everyone is slightly afraid of because of rumours that anyone he talks to gets a clouded Psycho-Pass. But he's actually a pretty friendly and straightforward guy who's also so sharp that he basically unravels most of Kamui's intentions just by looking at him. He is also one of the best partners to Akane because she is immune to his \"clouding Psycho-Pass\" effect and becomes a caring mentor to her whenever she turns to him for advice and help on the case. (+1 for intellect) Too bad he's also just supporting cast so he doesn't get much attention.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, at this point we have to mention Kirito Kamui, the main antagonist who is basically going the huge roundabout way of doing things. We get to see a lot of his backstory before the final arc, when his surgeon talks about how he was patched up from 184 different body parts, and his subsequent life and motivations from there, so that was really good and was actually believable - the idea that he could become so invisible that he basically felt non-existent, which drove him to ask the question \"WC?\" in the first place. I loved how this thoroughly explained his motives behind the overall plot, even though it didn't really justify all that killing. It's also great to see how he actually has good intentions to change Sibyl system as a whole, and was willing to sacrifice himself for his cause. (+1 for depth, +1 for courage)\\n\\n\r\nThe other main antagonist of course, Togane, was just a mass of bad intentions and poor plot points. Sure, he had some backstory, but they basically said that he was synthetically created, had a mother complex, and likes to kill people by turning their psycho-pass black. None of this is remotely human enough to make me consider him as a character, he's more like just there for 2 key reasons, a) a deus-ex-machina to make a uselessly complex plot and b) to remind Akane of Kogami. Akane should have just let Kamui killed him when he had the chance - he totally deserved to be disintegrated for beating up a poor old granny like that.\\n\\n\r\nI was very sad that I didn't get to see Ginoza much though, because he definitely grew a lot from S1 too, but the writers didn't let him get enough screentime and demoted him to a supporting character. In fact, it's depressing that so many of the supporting characters just got sidelined and none of them were developed to any considerable degree even though I could tell that they were really interesting characters - people like Yayoi, Hinakawa, Shion and even Aoyanagi (who really didn't deserve to die in such a horrible fashion).\\n\\n\r\nThe character that I really, really hated though, definitely had to be Shimotsuki. She has got to be the number one most useless tryhard character ever. From the beginning, she gets on the nerves of everyone in Unit 1, she annoys the audience constantly by trying to get Akane removed as an inspector, her lack of understanding and naivety to every situation leads to most of the time spent \"on standby\", and her lack of any form of courage continues throughout the anime, even to the end where she continues to remain in denial. She has minimal growth despite having so many chances to change and become more mature, and she has also ZERO backstory (nobody really knows where she comes from) and she also has minimal character development - she exists just to be an obstacle and a hindrance to the overall plot and to Akane. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to justify Shimotsuki's necessity within the anime by referring to her as the \"ideal citizen\" that would accept Sibyl's true reality when the time comes for the secret to be revealed to the rest of society. While that is a good attempt of representing the useless people in society, that's not main character material! If she was just a supporting character, I would be fine with it, but nope, she has more screen time than the other cooler characters like Ginoza and Saiga. She really doesn't deserve the main character status if the reason she's there is to merely represent the unthinking, passive portion of society.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have to talk about Sibyl as a character. Sure enough, Sibyl manages to get a bit of growth, essentially killing off it's more \"insane\" minds such as Togane Misako and keeping only the select few who were less criminally chaotic in nature, which is basically the most sensible thing to do. Sibyl does have so many flaws however, that it is insane to think how it can live with itself knowing that it has this many flaws all this while. (+1 for slight growth) I really loved how Sibyl turned its back against Togane Misako at the end though, that mess of a character totally deserved some punishment.\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, most of the character really lacked growth and development, though I think Akane as a character really stood out among everyone. Too bad it was only Akane and everyone else kind of just fell short of what it truly means to be a solid character. The entire plot was basically being carried by Akane alone, and that can't ever really be a good thing, can it?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I hated the plot and I despised many of the characters, I have to say that I was excited enough to watch through the entire S2 in one sitting, so that probably means that it did well in the suspense department, especially in the initial few episodes of the anime where they kept with the lingering question on whether it was really a ghost or not. (+2 for suspense) I also felt that the action scenes were fast-paced enough to enjoy amidst all the crime-solving excitement that really kept my blood pumping. (+2 for excitement).\\n\\n\r\nThe gore in this anime is also really one of its key characteristics - to be able to show all that blood and chaos, all the face smashing and beating and to treat it as a natural outcome in the eyes of Sibyl. This is really one key feature that keeps you transfixed to the screen and constantly telling yourself \"Something is really wrong with this screwed up system.\" (+1 for thrill)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there was good pacing and not once did I feel bored. The action scenes were clear, sharp and crisp, while all the slower scenes did not feel too dragged out. I also felt that all the moral discourse with Saiga, Akane with herself and finally with Kamui, all of it actually made a lot of sense. It was especially interesting to think about the idea of Sibyl \"judging itself\" as an \"omnipotent\" being that was achieving omnipotence and absorbing anything that it didn't have power over. (+3 for pacing)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime receives a bonus 1 point for not having any filler episodes. (+1 bonus point)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really fell short of my expectations for it. My rating for the previous season was a 9, so dropping 2 points really means a major disappointment, but at least it was an enjoyable watch for me nonetheless. At this point though, I'm pretty certain this anime is not complete without Kogami Shinya as a main character.\\n\\n\r\nReviewer's Comments:\\n\r\nAfter reading through many of the Psycho-Pass 2 reviews on this site, I was shocked to see how many people have rated this anime so low just because of the hate and disappointment they felt from having their expectations of this show crushed. I honestly do not think this show deserves any less than a 5 (the bare minimum), despite the sub-par plot and character development. The show was, on the animation and screenplay side, pretty solid and I think we should at least give credit for that. I also believe that the only reason it's getting so much hate is because many people's \"Psycho-Pass\" is being clouded by their own emotions. I will stick to my score of 7 because just like Akane, if you remove your emotions from the picture and think clearly, rationally, you will no doubt pass fairer judgement.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sibyl, what is your colour?\"",

            "content": "Truth be told, after Season 1, I am highly disappointed as of Episode 5. While I understand the aspect of mystery, most of events that take place in the anime and the story itself don't make a lot of sense.\r\nNot only it goes against the logical nature of the first season of the show, it also overuses previous themes, such as the faults of the Sybil System, at the same time paying no respect to them... Because one of the faults of the system was its over-control of human life... control, that now somehow vanished, apparently for the sake of the plot.\r\nThe premise of theworld itself was police investigating incidents in the world in which machines can read a person's mind and judge it. However, none of it is left. Instead, everyone focuses on some kind of \"ghost\" who uses abilities more akin to magic or at least methods working with magic-like efficiency.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier, it was pure logic and psychology, with some action. MWPSB tried to discover the culprits behind crimes and hunt them down. To do that, they investigated crimes that occurred, looking for leads - something like this barely occurs now that the show focuses on a single mystery of a ghost, and every criminal is suddenly clean.\\n\\n\r\nChanging someone's Crime Coefficient regardless of their thoughts, tendencies and motives is illogical ability - because Crime Coefficient itself was a measurement and judgment of thoughts, tendencies and motives. It's like changing a measurement on thermometer without changing temperature.\\n\r\nIt's obvious it will be explained, but the execution of the idea is done rather badly, if instead of interest, it causes aversion to the writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe new season also seems to easily disregard some parts of the world we saw in the first season. For example, eye scanning was outdated technology in Season 1, but for some reason, it's used by Dominators to work in Season 2. Similarly, anti-hacking measures in drone factory were particularly tight, while nothing of it was reflected in latest, drone-related episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season had criminals trying to work their way around the system, they were still fragile to it once found out. This new season however disregards ordered nature of the world completely, dumbing down its safety and security, while severely overpowering criminals and making them immune to most attempts of enforcement.",

            "content": "There\u2019s no easy way to describe the Psycho Pass franchise. To put it together it simply, the story becomes a complex tale to tell in a dystopian world. Just think about it: imagine if you feel like being watched 24/7 in a Big Brother style surveillance society. How would you feel about that? Fearful? That should be a normal feeling considering every person is measured by a state of being known as \u2018Psycho Pass\u2019. It tells the limits of a person\u2019s mental state and their probability to commit a crime. This may sound all cool and dandy but in reality is a system with somany possibilities. Psycho Pass 2 serves as the direct sequel of the first season to bring those possibilities into chaotic levels.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season revolves around several changes. Technical wise, Production I.G. is no longer in charge of the project (oddly enough, they are still involved with the movie production). Instead, we get Tatsunoko Production directed by Kiyotaka Suzuki. Secondly, the series only runs approximately half the length of the first season. That\u2019s right. 11 episodes and apparently, the show is confident enough to craft a story based on the setup of the premise and what it has shown us from the first season. Make no mistake though, certain characters do make returns while new ones are added. Finally, there\u2019s an absence of Shinya Kogami. There\u2019s obvious reasons why he doesn\u2019t appear in this sequel especially for fans who have seen the first season. In regards to these changes, this sequel brings a different picture to view. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the start, the second season offers a story involving a new mysterious case. To end, it also adds a host of new characters as well as returning ones from the first season. Protagonist and inspector Akane  Tsunemori returns after learning the truth about the Sybil System. Her choice is to obey the system by following a philosophy of doing the right thing is in her mind. Joining her includes Ginoza, Yayoi, and Shion as part of the new police unit. They also get some new helping hands including six new characters who plays a variety of roles in the second season. While the show still retains their state of duty, the season is left without Kagami, a man who dealt pivotal blows against the system. At the same time, the Sybil System itself reveals startling new revelations that may change the story forever. For Akane, this season is also about her own personal battle and against another mysterious individual. This can easily be seen at the conclusion of the first episode as we meet Kirito Kamui, a mysterious antagonist who tampers with the Sybil System.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get a few other things out of the way. The absence of certain characters is something that season 2 suffers from when it comes to expansive development. Fans who have become attached to Kogami will surely feel disappointed with his lack of presence. And to make it worse, we no longer have Makishima Shougo (for obvious reasons). He was a complex character with a dark personality and a difficult antagonist to replace. It\u2019ll take time for people to get used to a guy like Kamui despite their similar dark personalities. Still, there\u2019s also a mistake about the second season with the addition with Mika when it comes to her characterization. The first episode leaves no time to depict her character as someone who is literally a complainer desperately trying to defend the Sybil System. Her ignorance and opposition against her own boss Akane is something to that can be on the line of hair pulling annoyance. At some point of the show, it would come as no surprise if most viewers label Mika to be an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the additions of such a foil character, the new season still has enough to keep fans involved and eagerly await each episode. I can say this with confidence as some episodes leaves off with thrilling cliffhangers after a built-up of events. It\u2019s also easy to interpret the show that is shrouded in mystery with secrets and foreshadowing. There are also parts during the season as we witness Kamui commence with his plans in secret with hidden motives. It\u2019s easy to tell that he is the type of man who is careful with his moves after he kidnaps and seemingly brainwashes Mizue Shisui, an inspector from Division 2. His smooth talking tells us that he is quite a manipulative character who uses words as his primary weapon to get people to join his side. Not only that but he seems to be personally interested in Akane, a contrast to Season 1\u2019s Makishima Shougo where he is disappointed at her actions. Like I mentioned before, Akane fights on personal terms with her internal struggles as his friends, family, and comrades are put in danger. Season 2 exploits many points with twists of fate with a grim sense of purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThere are definitely some problems with the direction of the episodes in this season. In particular, one episode introduces a group of new characters from another unit; a direction that I feel as inappropriate with the lack of characterization already on the current roster. But let\u2019s make this worse. This one particular episode turns into a sour blood fest after some choices are made based on the behavior of the Sybil System. And if you want to guess, Mika is as useless as ever while Akane herself does little to secure the problem. What we get in the end is nothing more than more exposition and graphic violence to add to the shock factor. There\u2019s also the situational \u2018cat and mouse\u2019 gimmick that returns in this season as the new police unit begins to hunt down Kamui. Guess who is Tom and who is Jerry. Still, the main part of the show\u2019s problem revolves with Kamui\u2019s methods to manipulate people. A part of his past connects with events of the present that deconstructs the way the Sybil System work. Unlike season 1 that is focused on the flaws of the system, it now becomes a shallow writing with terribly mishandled concept. Honestly, if that is the method that Kamui uses to manipulate people, then this season is doomed. You\u2019ll have to watch it yourself to discover the stone cold truth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter relationships are of minimal impact and nothing on par with Akane and Kagami\u2019s development from season 1. There are also strange twists thrown in revolving around with Tougane as well as Mika learns of a terrible fact. Otherwise, most of the other new characters lacks any depth with their characterization. Even Ginoza becomes less interesting despite his initial impressive introduction in this season. I say this with a potential romance angle that was doomed from the very start. Finally, don\u2019t forget about Mika. Or perhaps, I think it should be in best of interests to forget her as much as possible since she is so focused on her own ideology. (even after being exposed to the truth) It\u2019s hard for anyone to feel sorry for her to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll warn you right now. This show can be a bit of a pain to the stomach at times to watch. If you\u2019re not used to gore and blood fests, then some of the episodes will not be suitable enough. For shock value and blatant attempts to illustrate the grim society of this show\u2019s world, we get graphic violence. With total uncensored footage, there\u2019s bodies exploding with blood raining down that makes this Fall Season\u2019s Terra Formars\u2019 violence look like a joke. On top of that, the show\u2019s visuals downgrades a bit on some episodes with character expressions. You won\u2019t notice it much since it\u2019s not as explicit as the actual violence. Nonetheless, the artwork is only decent with the setting and character designs. I do give some praise to the action sequences though except some parts that are lazily coordinated. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is perhaps a stronger aspect of the sequel. While it doesn\u2019t surpass season 1 in any way, there\u2019s a good measure of coordinating the cryptic OP song to illustrate its themes. Not only that but the OST remains top notch during key moments in this season. Unfortunately, character voice mannerisms becomes a concern at times especially with people like Mika and Sho. The season\u2019s soundtrack does rebound this back though with some of the expressive tones during climatic moments, usually thriller endings that makes the audience hunger for more.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this season, I scratch my head to wonder what went wrong with the second season. It had a good momentum from the beginning with the introduction of new characters and antagonists. We also found out more of the season\u2019s motives especially involving Akane. Then somewhere down that road, the season decided to turn into bloated writing of its former self. It becomes a shameless example of how not to do a sequel. And in this case, the characters too follow down a road of deconstructing formulation. Now, this season isn\u2019t garbage though especially when it comes to some action and technical features. The initial few episodes in the beginning had a solid momentum and almost every episode leaves with a feeling of thrills; to keep the audience in their seats to look forward to more.  There are moments that makes me hunger for more but in the end, it still remains meh. \\n",

            "content": "I really liked the first season of Psycho Pass. It had everything I wanted in a cyberpunk crime Anime, from the atmosphere to the characters to the setting. So, after the announcement of Season 2, I was really excited. But, after hearing it would be only 11 episodes, I was worried, since I thought it'd be rushed and would be of less quality than the first season. Unfortunately, I was right. I'll move on to my review.Story:-\\n\r\nThis season takes place a couple of years after the events of Pyscho Pass. We are introduced to Akane's new team in the MWPSB, along with some familiar faces. After a brief introduction, we are thrust right into the action, where we at the end see the main antagonist of this season.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, as far as the story is concerned, it was disappointing. The story's really similar to the first season, but never as interesting. With the introduction of the new antagonist, Kamui Kirito, I expected something different. Story is the same old ''Person wrecks havoc in the city, MWPSB must stop him at all costs''. There are a few twists and turns throughout the series that legitimately surprise me, but those really didn't save the story from being a mess, with plot holes and nonsensical things happening just for the sake of progressing the plot. It's a shame, since it was really good in the beginning, building up the tension with each subsequent episode. The series reached its peak at Episode 6, which was really intense and even had me shaking in my boots. But, the Anime ended in a really bad way, which I didn't enjoy one bit. It left me with more questions than answers.\\n\\n\r\n                                                             Art and Sound:-\\n\r\nDefinitely the best part of Pyscho Pass 2. It's just as good as the previous season, if not better. Characters are designed brilliantly, though I still can't get used to Akane's odd eyelashes(they creep me out, man!). The detail in the city, lighting and other such intricate little things just make it better to look at. And as usual, the Dominators look badass no matter how many times I see them being used.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is also great. The Opening ''Enigmatic feeling'' though not as good as the Opening of Psycho Pass 1, is still great to hear. The ending ''Fallen'' is amazing though, best ED I've heard in a long time. It's even on my playlist now. The rest of the sounds for the Anime just get the job done and are nothing special. \\n\\n\r\n                                                             Character:-\\n\r\nOut of the main cast, Akane is the only one who got a decent amount of character development. We see her troubled, on the brink of getting her crystal clear Psycho Pass getting coloured on a few occasions. Rest of the old cast hardly has any development, Ginoza in particular. Really was sad that he barely had anything to do in the Anime, considering he was one of my favourite characters in Psycho Pass 1.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have a few new characters. The new officer, Shimotsuki, who works alongside Akane. Bluntly put, she's a flat out bitch. I didn't liker her from the beginning. She thinks highly of herself and believes she is right all the time. She even looks down on Akane's methods to handling various situations, and she doesn't even have much of a backstory. There's also the new enforcer, Togane Sakuya. I liked him a lot. He provided the season's most entertaining aspects. Sadly, he wasn't used the way I would've liked, in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main antagonist Kamui Kirito, there really isn't much to say about him. He doesn't have the charisma or panache that Makishima possessed. He's just a plain old villain trying to destroy the Sibyl System. He had his moments, some of which were actually quite good, but in the end, he hardly left an impression on me, hence was forgettable.  \\n\r\nOverall, the set of characters in this season are severely underwhelming and not memorable. \\n\\n\r\n                                                          Enjoyment and Overall:-\\n\r\nIt was an okay season. It had spectacular highs and excruciating lows. It's not close to as good as the first season of Psycho Pass. But it still warrants a watch, even if it's just for the sake of watching it in order to see the movie. I really hope the movie makes more sense and ties all the loose ends together.",

            "content": "Sequels have always been expected to fill the shoes of it's predecessors.  And it should go without saying that a great deal of sequels fall short. Either because fans of the 1st season carry high expectations or elements of the 1st season is missing in its follow up. \r\nUnfortunately Psycho-Pass 2 isn't an exception to the rule. It didn't quite live up to the success it garnered back in 2012/2013..\r\nStory: 4/10\r\n    One of the most noticeable flaw starts with unresolved tension build up from season 1. Instead of following up on the friction between the collective entity of  the SibylSystem and Akane, it places in on the back burner. Even going as far as making Sibyl passive as appose to the hands on approach the fans would have been used to. Instead we follow Akane as she investigates the new and rather bland antagonist who stirs up trouble in the system. the 11 episode runtime also further dampers the story, giving it less time to be fully fleshed out. \\n\r\n   With a new writer behind the helm, PP2 feels rather alienated from it's predecessor. The absence of Gen Urobuchi's knack for chair gripping thrill rides is ever present. The new writer isn't bad per say, but lacks the flare for the dramatic that the Butcher is known for. This shift in tone makes the story of PP2 feel more like a run of the mill tv cop drama than a dystopian/cyberpunk neo noir experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLuckily the art for PP2 doesn't go through studio changes. Making the transition with no noticeable hickups. The color pallet also remains the same, which in turn gives the city and surroundings it's familiar atmosphere. But it isn't all well, as there's a obvious dip in aesthetics and cinematics. Some frame shots felt devoid of any substance. These problems won't be something apparent to the untrained eye and shouldn't ruin your experience. \\n\\n\r\nsound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very forgettable. With none demanding any attention of the viewer, they simply play in the background for added effect. The voice actors retained their roles, so those familiar with them won't find any complaints. They also introduce 3 new parties to the cast line up but we'll talk about those later. The opening made for an enjoyable listen and keeps the pace set by the other 2 of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where things go to shit. The new characters introduced range from being bland to borderline annoying (I'm looking at you Mika!).\\n\r\nShou Hinakawa: smart shy guy\\n\r\nSakuya Tougane: deranged lunatic \\n\r\nantagonist (unnamed for spoilers): no personality to speak of. \\n\r\nand then there's Mika Shimotsuki, ohhh God MIKA... for the sake of not going off on a tangent I'll leave it at that. Akane was also a disappointment, her unchangeable plot device \"Psycho-Pass\" holds her back from getting any development and because of that she remains stagnant throughout the show's duration.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOther than seeing the continuation of Psycho-Pass, season 2 dropped the ball. It lost all the charm that made the show great to begin with and I was left more disappointed than satisfied.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom being a show I hold in high regards to one I won't bother acknowledging, Psycho-Pass 2 failed on many levels. If you were a fan of the series and have yet to watch this, I suggest you skip it and go on in ignorant bliss. A decision I wish I had follow for myself.",

            "content": "This second season of Psycho-Pass introduces a new villain in the form of Kamui who is trying to shake things up with the current society in place being ran by the Sibyl System much like Makishima did in the prior season. Akane has a mostly new team of Inspectors and Enforcers to assist her in this case as she tries to figure out Kamui's motives and origins as he manipulates others to join in his cause.\r\nUnlike the first season, Psycho Pass 2 is quite a mess in terms of writing and the amount of time it has to explore things. The first season took itstime with exploring the unique problems that plagued Japan with the Sibyl System running society, fleshing out its cast and unveiling the true nature and motives surrounding Makishima and the Sibyl System. The 22-episode count for it was enough time for you to think about and feel for the problems facing the major characters and those living within the so-called utopia that the Sibyl System provided.\\n\\n\r\nFor this second season though, the writing for the plot isn't as well thought out as a good number of the plot twists and revelations revealed regarding Kamui's origins and his plans in defying the Sibyl System are rushed through and the series relies on infodump expositions at points to fully reveal its story instead of fully showing you what happens. In addition, the majority of new characters introduced in this series either get little fleshing out or are so incompetent that you have to wonder why they were allowed to fill character space. Having this season at 11 episodes greatly limited the amount of time the series could have to explore its plot and characters. Plus unlike its first season, it didn't seem like this series had a clear focus on what it wanted to explore as subjects such as Akane's mental state and the Sibyl System running into some sort of omnipotence paradox are brought up yet either don't get properly developed or they get poorly elaborated on thanks to the show's rushed pace. It seemed like whomever was responsible for directing this season of Psycho-Pass was more focused on highlighting the spectacle of the series instead of the themes it explored from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the only genuine praise I can give this second season to Psycho-Pass is its visual presentation. It isn't much different from the first season meaning the high quality animation is retained here with its highly detailed scenic shots and character designs, fluid and intense action scenes and nicely rendered CG animation used for patrol bots, vehicles and Dominators. For as much of a mess as the story was, Psycho-Pass 2 is still one of the year's best titles in terms of visual quality.\\n\\n\r\nBut putting aside its animation, Psycho-Pass 2 is still among one of this year's biggest disappointments as a follow-up to its excellent first season. Its storytelling was a mess and the 11-episode run of it limited how much time the series could get into with fleshing out its plot and characters without having to resort to info dumping. Will have to see if the upcoming movie for this will be any better than this pitiful sequel to it.\\n",

            "content": "Psycho-Pass was undoubtedly one of the greatest, if not the best, anime of the fall and winter season of 2012. So naturally, when a sequel was announced, people got really excited. They wanted to see more of the mind-games, more of the great characters, and more of the badass detective Kougami. And did this sequel deliver? Not at all.\r\nBefore I get into the review, I\u2019d like to give a warning to those who haven\u2019t seen season one of Psycho-Pass since this review will contain a few spoilers of the first season, also, go and watch the first season, like, right now. I\u2019ll also say that,as much as I don\u2019t want to, I will inevitably draw comparisons between both seasons.\\n\r\nAlso, there\u2019s a TL;DR at the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:-  5/10\\n\\n\r\nOur story continues from about two years after where the last season ended. We see some familiar faces among our main cast, including Akane Tsunemori. We\u2019re also introduced to two new enforcers(Tougane and Hinakawa) and one new inspector who was show at the end of the first season, Mika Shimotsuki(I\u2019ll get into her character later). From there on, the show begins with a new antagonist, (whose name I cannot reveal, so I\u2019ll just call him \u2018K\u2019 for the rest of the review.). The story then becomes a detective story of the police force chasing \u2018K\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Psycho-Pass 2 is nowhere near as good as the first season. The reason for this comes from many different factors. The first, and in my opinion, the biggest contributing factor to the story\u2019s lousiness, comes from the fact that this season is only 11 episodes long, half of the first season.  That is the fundamental reason of why this story is flawed. 11 episodes is usually not enough time to create any detective story, let alone a complex one. This short length results in massive pacing problems which dampened my personal experience of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story aims to do too much in such a short span of time. In fact, it houses 4 arcs, in 11 episodes!\\n\r\nFirst there\u2019s the obligatory introduction that took 2 episodes. Then there\u2019s 3 other arcs, each of approximately 3 episodes(I won\u2019t go into detail since, you know, spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason as to why this story isn\u2019t good, is the change of writers between both seasons. While I won\u2019t blame the new writer for the bland story, I still think that keeping the same writers in both seasons would\u2019ve been the better choice. For reference the writer for the first season was Gen Urobuchi, the man responsible behind such shows like, Fate/Zero and Madoka Magika, while the new writer (for the script) was Jun Kumagai, who definitely did not have the same acclaim as Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I will say that the pacing and writing were bad, the story wasn\u2019t terrible, it had a few positives along with the negatives, for example, a both of the arcs in the middle were pretty good, even if they were rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story had good promise, and it did fine, but the execution did not reach expectations. With 11 more episodes, and a better writer, this problem could\u2019ve easily been avoided.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was something that I cannot complain about too much. The art style of the show remains relatively the same, following the saying the \u201cIf it isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe animation feels very fluent in all the scenes, and in scenes that had some blood in them this show went all out, similar to the first season. All the action and gore heavy scenes were the main highlights in the show, and even in scenes where nothing was really happening, the animation was still good. The opening and ending animations are also very well done.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I do have a few nitpicks. Sadly, the show still has the habit of making some human characters look stoned, mainly, Akane. Then there are the new character designs, which frankly, most of them look average to just bad. Even the main antagonist \u2018K\u2019 wasn\u2019t very threatening at all, far from the brilliantly designed Makashima from the first season. Even the new enforcers, didn\u2019t have that great of designs.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fault I find with the animation, is that the show rarely strays away from its comfort zone, meaning that the show doesn\u2019t take a lot of risks with its animation at all, in fact I\u2019d even go as far as to say that the animation did become a bit bland and tasteless at times.\\n\\n\r\nBut still these are mere nitpicks that aren\u2019t too noticeable, so honestly, the animation of the show is great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Psycho-Pass 2, while bearable, did not rectify the flaws that the soundtrack of the first season had. While I still like the soundtrack for both seasons, they just don\u2019t do that much for me. The soundtrack still lacks any track that I can listen to outside of the anime, excepting one or two tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, while the soundtrack is a bit tasteless; the opening and ending for this season were not.  Paired with some great animation, both the opening and ending are really good song that I rarely skipped over.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also do their jobs pretty well, both in the dub (which is airing currently) and the sub. The main problem with the sub (or dub) was the distinct lack of any outstanding voice actor, the main reason for this being the absence of Kougami and Makashima in this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the soundtrack was good, it wasn\u2019t up to par. The opening and ending are both very well done, and the voice actors are good, but sometimes feel a bit bland.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part where Psycho-Pass 2 lacked the most. The characters in the first season were all very well developed, and even the side characters had proper development. This season just threw that out the window and instead gave no development to any of the characters; aside from the one I hated the most.\\n\\n\r\nA big fault I find with the show\u2019s characters is that none of the side characters were given any respect by the writers. One of the main reasons I loved the first season is because of the side characters and their development, but this season just doesn\u2019t do that. \\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not the biggest problem, far from it. The biggest problem this show\u2019s characters have is the main characters, including the main antagonist \u2018K\u2019. The main characters comprise of \u2018K\u2019, Akane, the new enforcer Tougane, and the new inspector Mika. None of these characters are developed well, at all. \\n\\n\r\n1. Akane Tsunemori:-  Akane is the main character for both the first and second seasons of Psycho-Pass. Her character was first introduced (in the first season) as a young learning inspector. By the beginning of the second season, her character had matured, and she has learned to handle situations much more efficiently. But this leads to the problem in the second season. Her character had already developed to extreme heights. Thus, her development in the second season is practically non-existent.\\n\\n\r\n2. Sakuya Tougane:- Tougane is the new enforcer in division 1 (Akane\u2019s Division). His character acts as a \u201creplacement\u201d for the absence of Kougami. .. And that\u2019s pretty much all I can reveal about him, mainly because most of the rest of his character is a gigantic spoiler. But even though he has a large role in the story, his character doesn\u2019t change throughout the show. His character seems like more of a plot-device than an actual character.\\n\\n\r\n3. \u2018K\u2019:- \u2018K\u2019 is the main antagonist that we learn more about as the show progresses. Now, without spoiling anything, the main criticism I have against him is his goal. His goal, to me, seems extremely basic, and at times I feel that it is uninspired.\\n\\n\r\n4. Mika:- Now, for Mika. Mika is the absolute worst character in this show. By far. Her attitude to both enforcers and Akane herself is complete disrespect, and she believes that all that the Sybil decides is correct. Even to the extent that she would disobey her own superiors. But the most annoying thing about her character is that she was the only person who had potential to improve as a character, but she doesn\u2019t. Her character could\u2019ve easily matured in a way similar to how Akane\u2019s character matured in the first season, and unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, by the end of the show, none of the characters really developed well. The side characters weren\u2019t given any development, and the main characters are either developed very little, or they aren\u2019t developed at all. This lack of development could also be blamed on the short length of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did rag on the show a lot, I must admit that during my time watching it I really did have a good time. Even when the show ripped itself apart during the final arc, I did enjoy it, albeit, for the wrong reasons. The 2 major flaws that dampened my enjoyment, was the hilariously bad story, and the annoying piece of trash, that was Mika.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Brilliant setting\\n\r\n-Very good animation\\n\r\n-Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n-Enjoyable to a certain degree\\n\r\n-The 2 arcs in the middle were very good\\n\r\n-Good opening and ending\\n\r\n-Good Sub as well as Sub\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Disappointment in comparison to the first season\\n\r\n-Bland and hastily written story\\n\r\n-The lack of Kougami could disappoint some people\\n\r\n-The main villain wasn\u2019t good\\n\r\n-Character development is non-existent\\n\r\n-Terrible pacing\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Overall, the show was a huge let-down to people who liked the first season. It\u2019s small number of episodes leads to the bad pacing, as well as the lack of character development. The main villain didn\u2019t have a very interesting goal, and the side characters were completely ignored. For people who are expecting Kougami in this season don\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t even physically appear in the show. The animation of the show is great, and the soundtrack is decent. I enjoyed it while I was watching it, and I think most people will too. As long as you don\u2019t think about it, you\u2019ll at least enjoy it. Thus, this leads me to giving this show a rating of:-\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:- 6.2/10",

            "content": "As a preface, this \"review\" focuses a lot more on the differences and relations between the first and second season, and not so much on this season as its own thing. At the same time, these are my thoughts on why I think a follow-up can never be as good as the first season (it's a long read).\r\n-------------------------\r\nI want to start this off by saying that I absolutely love the original Psycho-Pass. The journey into the human psyche, the dark mood looming over the story itself, and the intense development seen in all the characters all contribute to what\u2019s come to be one of mypersonal favorites of all time. In the same vein, Makishima is one of my favorite antagonists, because he feels like such a real character, especially when it comes to anime in general. His motivations are far beyond that of \u201cjust being evil\u201d, and the sort of intelligent personality he presents is as enjoyable as ever. Then there is the society itself, or rather, Sibyl. As a concept, this is a really awesome sci-fi society, and even in execution, it works surprisingly well. This is, I think, largely because of how Sibyl interacts with Makishima. \\n\\n\r\nIf we momentarily remove Makishima (and any others like him) from the equation, what we\u2019re left with would pretty much be an episodic detective-series, focusing on tracking down individual criminals. This is not necessarily bad, but it lacks the same overarching feeling of grandeur and darkness as with a mastermind connecting each case. However, it technically isn\u2019t possible, because of the way Sibyl works. It could be interesting, and definitely gruesome, but ultimately, I feel like it\u2019d severely lack in terms of writing. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Makishima - the criminally asymptomatic. The entire system is now thrown into chaos. How do you deal with a problem like this, when you are so reliant on the system to do things for you? Should you circumvent the system to remove the threat, even if it means you may slip into darkness yourself? These are all questions asked by Psycho-Pass, and they make for very interesting story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThen comes Psycho-Pass 2, a sequel I think many of us wanted, because who doesn\u2019t want more of their favorite series?, but at the same time something we dreaded, as a sequel would pose quite a few issues in terms of writing. The biggest one, and the one I\u2019m focusing on here, is the fact that they\u2019ve written themselves into a corner, of sorts. It\u2019s not a corner in the sense that they need to do something drastic to get out, but rather that the only way forward is further into the same corner. To clarify, I\u2019m talking about the fact that the original series leaves very little to work with in terms of a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you create such a massive world in fiction, you place upon yourself a responsibility to stick to the rules that you have created. In Psycho-Pass, the highest \u201crule\u201d of all is how Sibyl works, and what it does. If you really think about it, how many (good) scenarios can you come up with, that\u2019s not too similar to that of the original series? Because Sibyl is nearly omnipotent, it creates this setting where only those unable to be judged, in one way or another, are able to act as worthwhile antagonists, which leaves little in terms of variation. What this means, is that we have to ask ourselves \u201care we okay with such a similar setup, or will it simply be too much of the same?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWith Kamui being the antagonist in Psycho-Pass 2, they\u2019ve succumbed to the fact that this is the only way, but have tried to change it up by changing the very way Kamui functions, in contrast to Makishima. Instead of being able to remain at a constantly low crime-coefficient, Kamui is outright unable to even be detected by the system itself. While this, together with the way he operates on his \u201cmissions\u201d, still provides a good story, we\u2019re once again forced to ask ourselves if continuing this series is truly a good idea. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story itself, I want to quote reddit user /u/Redcrimson who I feel really captured the feeling of this season, to an extent. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt's grimdark for its own sake, with twists that undermine its own narrative, and exists just to be violent and shocking with no greater resonance with the thematic throughlines or characters established in S1.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile my opinions on this season may not perfectly align with his, the points he makes are undeniably accurate. When watching this second season, you\u2019ll quickly notice that there are a lot more (gory) deaths spread out everywhere in the show, and as a result, we viewers will (most likely) become sort of desensitized to the deaths of characters, because we simply see it way too much. This, I think, is a huge step back from the first season, where every death got, at least from me, almost the same \u201coh shit\u201d reaction. The deformation, into the explosion, and the remaining characters taking their time to really take in what had just happened. It all felt really well done, and now that there\u2019s death around every corner, it has simply lost that feeling.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is this a bad thing because we don\u2019t care as much about characters dying in general, but it also affects our view of characters directly. Notable mention of Kamui here. Having a character as calm and collected as Kamui, suddenly killing an entire room full of people (albeit not without reason) does not make me fear him as a character. I\u2019m not on the edge of my seat in every one of his scenes, hoping he doesn\u2019t snap and kill the others with him. I think, when a character makes every kill symbolic - actually meaningful in some way - it gives this almost fearful feeling towards that character. Not because he\u2019s scary, but because it makes you fear for the others, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this season does offer a few new things, even if they don\u2019t drastically impact the general gist of the story. Examples here are Tougane and his backstory, Shimotsuki\u2019s rivalry with Akane going too far, and so on. These all add an extra level of tension to the writing, which I think is pretty needed, what with the aforementioned issues. In the same manner, I think the upcoming movie may end up good, since it supposedly doesn\u2019t involve Sibyl in the same way. Though at the same time, it\u2019s hard not to think that maybe that should\u2019ve just been the second season to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I want to say that even with all this, I don\u2019t really think this is a bad season. I definitely think it could\u2019ve been skipped, in favor of the movie, which actually changes things up, and there are a lot of things I think they\u2019ve done much worse (the overly tense writing, too dark for the sake of being dark, and some characters), and it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near as good as the first season was, but if you\u2019re a fan of Psycho-Pass as a whole, I think you\u2019ll still very much enjoy the second season.",

            "content": "*EDIT* I just finished watching so.. I'm here to clarify my final observation of this show. *May contain some spoilers*\r\nI watched Psycho Pass last year and it was damn amusing. It is sure on my list of top anime. Hearing that the second season is airing this year, I was exhilarated. But does the new season offer something of the same value, or even better than the first season? \r\nStory 6/10\r\nShort summary: Our main protagonist Akane Tsunemori has learned more about Sibyl System in the first season of what it really is, how it works, what's behind it. With her partner Shinya Kogami going missing,she worked with new acquaintances in new team formation. As an inspector in the police force, she has to work out solving crimes that causes the Area Stress to increase and threaten people's Hue, but something is off. The culprit, even though they are doing something unethical, are unable to be judged by the Dominator. What is actually happening? \\n\\n\r\nThe second season unfortunately doesn't have the luxury of the first season as the duration has been cut in half - they only got 11 episodes to play with. \\n\\n\r\nI would say this season has too much on its plate. \\n\r\nFirst: there are a lot of new characters, means they need introduction, what is their backstory, motivation, etc. so they will appeal to us. \\n\r\nSecond: the problems in the series are rather complicated, layered and linked to one another. There are inconsistencies with season 1 regarding the facts of Dominator, the scans and Sibyl System also unnecessary plot branches that doesn't make sense (read: the Toganes). If anything, they make a lot of plot holes and makes me confused. \\n\\n\r\nAs the result, I'd say... the ending is not satisfying for me. The last few episodes did answer my questions that rises as I watch the series, you could say \"all is well\". But I think they could do this season so much better. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nYou can expect the same quality of art and animation from the second season. If anything, I find it more colorful. Very rich... compared to the darker palette in first season. I'm not sure whether is it due to the big question \"What color?\" which is imposed again and again in the series. The animation is smooth, sasuga Production IG doing their best again.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOne um.. 3 words: I LOVE IT! The opening Enigmatic Feeling is pumping and catchy, and a revelation: the meaning of the lyrics (the TV size ver.) fits with the theme of the show, mostly about Akane's feeling towards Sibyl System. The ending Fallen is my jam.. It's good to have Ling tosite sigure and EGOIST doing opening and ending for this season as well. It's been a while since I watched the first season, at least they keep the same spirit with the same artists. \\n\\n\r\nSeiyuus are good as well, their voices matches the character they are playing. Still having the same ones for characters from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nAkane has grown. She is cooler, more observant and acting more like a leader now, but she still has heart and cares for the Enforcers. She experienced more emotional roller coaster here, you can see more of her expression.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of events and incidents happened in the first season, eliminating quite a number of the original team formation. Hence, there are a new characters to replace the missing positions. I like some of them (cough Hinakawa~). I'm glad that Saiga-san are still here as well, at least Akane has someone reliable to think and discuss logically. But I really despise the new inspector Shimotsuki. She poses on the different perspective from Akane. Yeah, she's annoying. But she's a realistic character - wants to bring others down but is such a coward. I do know some people who acts like her. \\n\\n\r\nTogane... another character I don't like. He is very gray (not that I don't like people in gray area, but there's this feeling that makes me don't like him when he appears) in most of the show until his true color and who he really is got revealed in the end. This revelation however, makes me despise him even further, like WTF?\\n\\n\r\nBecause Makishima in the previous season is such an intriguing antagonist, the crew for season 2 have the burden to show us a better antagonist. Unfortunately I find the main villain Kamui Kirito is not on par with Makishima, although they make him so overpowered with many specialized skills and complicated issues about his existence. After the past he had gone through, I can understand his objectives for his existence and 'color' to be recognized by Sibyl. But it doesn't justify the crimes he did in this show to test how Dominators and Sibyl System works. I just don't get how he thinks.\\n\r\nHowever the production crew decided to mess things even further, so he's not the only antagonist in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMost, if not all, new characters suffer from lack of development and exploration. Very few (except for Togane and Kamui) has been revealed about their backstory and motivation, making it quite hard to relate and feel for them. Even returning characters Ginoza and Yayoi has very little screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe design are good for some (I like Ginoza without glasses ^^) but erm Shimotsuki's face looks too closely like Akane, just sporting different hairstyle. In the earlier episodes I have difficulty differentiating them if their hairstyles are not seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nDespite holes here and there, inconsistencies (mostly about facts and Sibyl System itself) with first season and lacking in characterization, well, I admit I still enjoyed this show, with its adrenaline pump with gritting cliffhangers. It is an interesting pick on Sibyl System which is not as perfect as it seems (and assumes), and some parts makes me think along. But it's soooo bloody. A freaking level up from the previous season. I'm not a fan of gore, so it comes off as too disturbing at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 + Personal Comment\\n\r\nThe less number of episodes makes the show more straightforward and rushed - cutting down the interaction and time developing on characters, focusing solely on solving the crime and catching the culprit. It feeds us confusion after confusion up to episode 7, but especially in episode 8 explanations and revelations started to be thrown at you. Not the best way to uncover a mystery in my opinion, but rather effective due to their runtime. \\n\r\nIt's still acceptable as a series with such quality animation, but... I prefer the first season.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWell, what started as a massive disappointment was able to somewhat redeem itself towards the end, thankfully, only to completely collapse yet again. I think it's hard to debate that at least the first half of the highly anticipated Psycho Pass 2 was a complete and utter failure; I referred to it as criminal, unbelievable, sickening and disgusting. An absolute butchering. Psycho Pass 2 was on pace to be the biggest disappointment I\u2019ve ever had in my entire anime watching career, and still might be. Of course, I expected there to be some serious growing pains with the staff of this anime consideringthe mass exodus it had experienced since last time, with a massive number of previous team members leaving after the first season (including lead writer Gen Urobuchi). NOTHING, however, prepared me for THIS. The plot is clumsy and shallow, the characters are shadows of their original selves (or gone entirely), and the animation is laughably directed and significantly downgraded. This is the definition of a bad sequel. Ladies and Gentleman: Psycho Pass 2:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: After learning \u201cthe truth\u201d, Inspector Akane Tsunemori continues to try to maintain peace in her nameless utopian society, where a new threat has emerged: A man named Kamui threatens to tear down the Sibyl System once and for all and expose it for what it truly is by turning peace and order into complete chaos.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I normally start a review by discussing the plot, I\u2019m just going to get right to meat of the primary reason why Psycho Pass 2 is had such a different feel to the first which resulted in its inferiority: The characters. The original cast of Psycho Pass was loaded with memorable characters, such as Kougami, Makishima, Ginoza, Akane, and more. This was a legitimately interesting cast because all of them were treated with the time and attention necessary to properly flesh them out. Each had a personality, each had motivations, and each one added a lot the show. However, everything that the original did right, the sequel does very wrong. This anime fails not only to build upon the pieces it had in place, but it supremely fails to show us who any of the new characters are. Until very late. Psycho Pass 2 bombards us with a slew of new faces who we know nothing about, and doesn't cares to let us know who the hell those faces are until it's too late to give the time and attention necessary to make them good characters. This makes the way they think, why they think that way, what their motivations are, their identities, or anything else that we would need to know about a good character all feel half-assed. They feel completely soulless. Hell, the show doesn\u2019t even have the courtesy to give some of them any personalities at all beyond the most basic stereotypes in anime! Now I know what you\u2019re thinking: At least we still have Akane, Ginoza, and Kogami to fall back on, right? Hahaha\u2026 Wrong. \\n\\n\r\nShinya Kougami? Gone. He\u2019s not even in the sequel at all for reasons I can\u2019t even begin to fathom. However, to be honest, I wish Akane and Ginoza weren\u2019t in the show either, because then at least I wouldn\u2019t have to witness them be butchered right before my eyes. Akane Tsunemori, one my favorite female characters in anime, has been reduced to the most boring and uninteresting excuse for a thriller protagonist I\u2019ve seen in my entire life (until very late, I suppose). She has been completely disconnected from the audience. She no longer shows any emotion what so ever and has a personality comparable to a ham sandwich. I know that she was supposed to become a colder character because of her development in the first season, but she has become so distant from the viewers that we simply have no clue what is even going through her head anymore, making it impossible to relate to her. Remember the intriguing inner monologues we got from her in season one that made her really likable and sympathizable? Gone. The only inner monologues she gets this time are plot related and exist only to spew exposition or explain plot events. Not ONCE does the show touch on her inner conflict and how she can\u2019t decide what to make of the Sibbyl System! Let me repeat that using more clear phrasing: THE MOST VITAL ASPECT TO BOTH THE PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FROM THE FIRST SEASON IS GONE ENTIRELY. But hey, even worse than that is what the show does with Ginoza, or rather, what they fail to do with him. One of the most dynamic characters in the original might as well not be in this one at all; he has done nothing. Said nothing. Contributed nothing. If he didn\u2019t exist at all, nothing about the show would be even remotely different. The character chemistry between all of the characters in season one? Gone as well. Ginoza and Akane both NEVER have a SINGLE conversation that\u2019s not related to the plot or exposition; not a SINGLE one! Coming off the awesome chemistry between Akane and Kougami, as well as others, this is an unfathomable downgrade. How are we suppose to emotionally connect with anything that happens in the show is we know NOTHING about what the characters are thinking or feeling (again, until very late)? If the characters don\u2019t care, neither does the audience. That\u2019s story telling 101, and as far as we are concerned, the characters don\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nOh hoho, but I\u2019m STILL not done ripping this cast of characters new one. That\u2019s right: THREE paragraphs dedicated to characters alone. That\u2019s a new record. The one thing I haven\u2019t talked about yet is the antagonist: Kamui. Stepping in for Shougo Makishima, one of the most compelling antagonists in recent memory, he had big shoes to fill. If you\u2019re picking up on the trend that\u2019s occurring here, you can probably guess that he doesn\u2019t even come close to filling them. For more than half of the show, we don\u2019t have the slightest clue who he is, what his motivations are, or even what his end goal is. This is literally the complete opposite of what we are used to; Makishima had clearly defined motivations and goals, making the show a matter of questioning whether or not he was justified. With Kamui, he's just a mystery box until all of his ideals and goals are spunrg upon like some sort of asspull. I don't think it's debatable that the method they used in season 1 was far, far superior. Kamui comes across for quite awhile as just a bad guy wrecking havoc for reasons that we can only guess, and for a show that is supposed to be about grey morality, that's not okay. Even though his motivations and goals are eventually reveled, nothing can change the fact that he was a blatantly awful antagonist for the majority of the anime. When it comes to characters, Psycho Pass 2 stands firmly as a major fuck up.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has also seen a massive downgrade from what we are used to, as the once heart-throbbing thriller feels like nothing but a collection of random violence for the purposes of shock factor in the form of a perpetual attempt for the show to 1-up itself with each passing episode until the final stretch, all under the narrative of a carbon copy of season 1's exact same plotline. While the original Psycho Pass had a lot of time dedicated to world building and character development, the sequel says fuck all that, let\u2019s blow shit up. We see tons of blood, guts, and gore go flying across the screen, this time in quantities exponentially higher than what we ever saw in season one. The problem? \u2026Nobody cares. I find myself unable to give a damn about anything that\u2019s happening on screen, simply because the people dying are a bunch of nobodies. When someone dies in an anime, it\u2019s supposed to be a big deal! It\u2019s supposed to drive the plot forward and seriously affect the characters! Here? Massive numbers of people dying is an every episode occurrence. It\u2019s not shocking anymore, it\u2019s not entertaining anymore, it\u2019s not moving the plot forward, it\u2019s not developing the characters, so WHY IS IT HAPPENING?! Granted, the show eventually does manage to cut this crap out and actually get to the point, but it just feels like too little too late. Honestly, it's almost so jarring when the show gets to the point that it doesn't even feel natural; it comes completely out of left field. This is especially a problem because season 2 tried to shift from a character driven show to a plot driven one, and when a plot driven show has a terrible plot, it can only devolve into a trainwreck. If you can stick it out, you are rewarded with a very solid series of episodes that actually touches upon character motivations and the morality of Sibbyl, y'know, what the ENTIRE show should have focussed on in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I have left to talk about is the animation. The original Psycho Pass had some of the most incredible animation I had seen in my entire life; certainly in my top 3 all time favorite uses of animation. With that in mind, you can imagine my surprise when Psycho Pass 2\u2019s animation looked not better, not the same, but worse. Significantly worse. While it still looks GOOD, I suppose, it\u2019s nowhere near what is used to be, which was GREAT. Whoever the new art director is for this show seriously fucked up. The first thing wrong with the animation is the drastic change in color pallet; it hardly looks like the same show anymore! The original show used a mix of bright blues/whites and blacks for the environments to create a beautiful contrast and really give off the aura of a futuristic, utopian society; it worked beautifully. The second season, on the other hand, is all over the damn place. Sometimes it uses reds and oranges (for some reason), sometimes it uses the old blues, sometimes it uses something completely different. There is no consistency what so ever! The sky will be one color is one shot, and then a completely different color in the next one. There is no attention to detail what so ever! The backgrounds, once bursting at the seams with objects and completely filled out, are now completely barren. It feels rushed, lazy, and passionless. In fact, the shot composition in general is absolutely terrible. So many poor decisions have been made about the angles, lighting, and settings that I couldn\u2019t count them if I tried. Again, the animation is still good compared to other anime, but it is a shadow of its original self.\\n\\n\r\nWell, there's no question that Psycho Pass 2 did not live up to the original. While I may have called this a travesty or a worse-case scenario at some point, it does manage to significantly improve. If you were a fan of season 1, I won't particularly recommend or NOT recommend watch the sequel; it's up to you. Just make sure you go in with low expectations. This anime could have been so much more, but we got we got I suppose. Such is life.",

            "content": "I'll try to keep it short and simple.\r\nStory: 2/10.\r\nThe main antagonist Kamui's motives are never very interesting, and seeing as how that's the whole thing moving the story that is a huge problem.  Not to mention that the ending makes the whole plot irrelevant.  I can't go into more detail without spoiling it, but if Sibyl had just done some upkeep on itself and taken out the trash, Kamui would have never done any of the things he did.  Sibyl is horrifically stupid in this series, reduced from a morally ambiguous but effective system in S1 to an evil and dumb-as-shit systemin S2.  There is nothing to care about except Akane, but we'll get to that in the Character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10.\\n\r\nPassable at best.  While it never had the QUALITY art some of the later episodes of S1 had, it just felt uninspired.  The cinematography was lacking and there was no decent animation of note whatsoever, save the OP.  TatsuPro is clearly an inferior studio to I.G. in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10.\\n\r\nThe OP is really great if you can enjoy that style of music.  Great visuals and a fitting song to boot.  And there's this one scene where opera music is playing and it's ridiculous how seriously the show's taking itself.  But that's about it.  There aren't any memorable tracks from the OST.  At very best they just blend into the background.  I guess the ED is okay too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10.\\n\r\nGinoza is listed as a \"main character\" on MAL's database here.  What a joke.  He has been neutered so much and matters so little to the story at all that they might as well have killed him off in episode 1 for some shock value.  So Ginoza's bland, okay, that doesn't ruin the whole series.  But when your main antagonist is also bland and boring that is problematic.  In fact, there is not a single interesting character in this entire show except Akane.  But Akane is not developed or played with in an interesting way, she's just likable because we got to know her in S1 and they didn't screw her up too badly.  If the best thing you have to say about any one of a show's characters is \"they maintained her status quo\", then that's not great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10.\\n\r\nAt least it wasn't boring enough I wanted to turn it off.  But I'm biased because I really like futuristic settings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10.\\n\r\nIf the plot's crap and the characters are crap and the art's crap and the sound's crap there's not much left to watch for.  If you want to watch the movie when it comes out (which is being done by Production I.G. and written by Urobuchi, unlike this garbage!) then just read a summary of this online to save your time.  Not much even happened so you'll be fine.",

            "content": "Somebody needs to tell these producers that it's not okay to replace character development and a real plotline with blood and brains spewing all over the place. Psycho-Pass 2 was literally gore galore, and I can't say I was too happy about it, either. Honestly, I saw more Lethal Dominator (ab)use in one episode than I did for practically the entirety of the first season, and the exploding heads and bodies things just kind of got lame after the first 30 times it happened... \r\nSo yeah, flying bloody body parts aside, I have to say that Psycho-Pass season 2 was a really big letdown forme. Was there a single aspect of the original series that didn't go wrong in this season? As it turns out, the answer is no. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot continues along the same vein of the first season, but struggles and ultimately fails to encompass new ideas about the Sibyl System. The way things were set up in the first season, I was actually expecting Akane to do something about Sibyl in this sequel. Instead of that, all we got were a bunch of strange paradoxical theories and conspiracies that really had no bearing on the show's themes anyway. Jouji's speeches were so confusing and so incredibly irrelevant to the point that I wanted to spew blood everywhere whenever he started talking. \\n\\n\r\nActually, I take that back. The only part of the show that actually got me seriously wanting to vomit blood was the cast. Half the characters were boring as hell, and the other half were just ... there. \\n\\n\r\nLike, come on: Saiga Jouji makes his reappearance for half of the episodes but it's so obvious that he was just stuck into the story so he could make the plot move. You have Hinakawa, Kagari's completely inferior and practically useless replacement, whose only defining moment was the scene where he called Akane 'big sister'. You have Ginoza, who's a complete disconnect from his character in the first season. He lost his personality along with his glasses, and has a grand total of about 20 lines throughout the whole show. And then you have Shimotsuki Mika, the one character that everybody wanted to strangle to death within the first 10 minutes of episode 1, and really didn't do anything except crap her pants in front of Togane a couple of times and cry a lot. \\n\\n\r\nTogane was actually pretty interesting, up until they butchered his backstory and dragged him down with that mockery of a season finale. I have to admit, I already was slightly peeved at him from the beginning because he was obviously Kougami's replacement (and what was with Kougami's smoke-spectre visiting Akane all the time, anyway?) but besides having the highest recorded Crime Coefficient in history, he didn't actually end up doing anything that interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, let's talk about Akane. Out of all the characters, she was the biggest disappointment for me - her character was stale, predictable, and showed no development throughout the series. Even after seeing her grandmother's ear in a box and discovering just how screwed up Sibyl is, none of her previous beliefs were even slightly shaken. Yeah, I get that she's supposed to be grown-up and badass, but that doesn't mean that she also has to have the emotional range of a rock. I wanted to see her scream, lose her temper, do something besides act like some frigid, stereotypically perfect police officer poster child that is definitely not the Akane that I know and love from season one. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation and sound were all average. The OP was pretty cool, but all it did was get my hopes up for the season, especially after that one shot with Kougami tied to the chair. Not sure what relevance that had to the show, seeing as we never actually saw him. Hmm. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked the first season of Psycho-Pass, I would not recommend watching the second one. Besides feeling clipped due to its 11 episode length and having the most melodramatic season finale I've ever seen for such a hyped-up sequel, the characters are not up to par and the plot is confusing and over-complicated. Unless watching people burn alive to the tune of opera music is your kind of thing, I would recommend steering clear of Psycho-Pass 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: This has some minor spoilers from the first season and this season. Be careful. You've been warned.\r\n\"What colour am I?\"\r\nPsycho Pass, One of my faviroute anime's of all time. I loved the first season and as you see on my list I gave the first season a straight 10! Now the show has returned but this time its not gonna be by Production I.G., the makers of the first which sucks. Instead by TOHO animation, the good news is that a movie is coming soon and thats by Production I.G. (Yay) This meant that the script and animation was gonna be different, which wasbad but shockingly this turned out well... The story was as good and more fucked up whereas the animation....well it got dumbed down which was dissapointing. The characters and developements are good but some characters are left out. And the soundtrack is just amazing as usual.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: 8/10\\n\r\nI gotta hand it to TOHO at first this seemed like S1 with a few changes but instead later on the story progesses and gets more fucked up as we find out more. At first this just seemed like some special but as it progesses it just gets better, like trust me don\"t drop this on its first episode 9(Not saying it was bad.)\\n\\n\r\nThis story takes place a year and a half later after the first one and this time Akane is more calm and has the behaviour like Kougami, it isn't boring in any way but she feels like this MC you can seriously trust. At times we might see glimpses of her either being her old clumsy-self when she started or she gets glimpses of Kougami which help calm her down. This is very intresting and shows that Akane hasn't fully changed.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have a new villain called Kirito and is he evil and loved to hate like Mikishama. Abso-fucking-lutely, He's a more screwed up version of Mikishima, he's not in anyway better but a good replacement. Kirito is a mysterious killer who's a master in drugs and knows ways of making people's psycho passes clear by using well drugs. Remember kids, winners don't do drugs *winks*, now back to Kirito, we later find out things about him that just make the story so much more tense, he's a smartass, he knows what he's doing and that is how he is as good as Mikishima. \\n\\n\r\nSo the gang has to take down this fool before he does more crazy shiz. This is a very intresting plot, We're also introduced to 3 new characters, I'll give some brief stuff about them, first off we have Sakuya, this guy is pretty much Kougami but the evil version, she wants to turn Akane into an enforcer and finds pretty smart ways of attempts of doing this. Then you have Mika, a bitch, she calls everyone either junior, dumb or just an enforcer whn she dosen't know what everyone has been through, she easily hatable and you want her to die badly. Then you have Hinkawa, shy but smart, he's only in the story to help out with the twists which makes him pretty dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nI'm dissapointed in the art here, in the first season we had BUUUTIFUL animation with so much detail, and now we have this meh and average animation, It's not a huge dissapointment but it just sucks that this was more bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is so well done and so memroble. The OP is just orgasms to your ears while the ED is this haunting tune. Easily some of the best openings and endings of this season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment here comes from the tense action scenes with a lot of killing, the plotwists here you will not see coming, like seriously, there are a bunch which will make you just drop your jaw.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the first season of this you'll definitly enjoy this. A movie is coming soon and a 3rd season? We're not really sure. The ending here is pretty good and wraps everything up in a nice little bowtie, it really makes it worth watching the show. This is probably my 3rd faviroute show this season.\\n\\n\r\nRating: My hue has turned pitch black from how tense this was.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first season of Psycho-Pass was a real treat for the eyes and the mind, as it encouraged its watcher to ponder questions of morality as well as who really was the \"good guys\". The follow up to the hit series is no longer penned by Urobuchi, but is the sequel  still able to stand up on its own two feet? This is a mostly spoiler free review, and I will not talk much about the main antagonist due to the high spoiler content.\r\nThe series begins in a similar vein to the original just a year and a half later, it reintroduces the maincharacters and the rules of the  Sibyl System as well as the Dominator, and shows us the new characters for this season. Right away we are introduced to the integral question of Psycho-Pass 2, \"What Color?'. Anyone familiar with the Sibyl System knows that this a particularly intriguing question, as color is everything in this world. Those that lack the proper color are killed or are sent away to facilities to be rehabilitated, where they wish they were dead. This bleak overtone characterizes the Psycho-Pass series as a whole, and continues to the second season. This season also has a significant more amount of bloodshed, as in the first season it was a real treat to get to see someone active lethal eliminator mode, in the the sequel people are firing thar lazer every episode. The antagonist of this season is very similar to Makishima in his behind the scene operations as well as his \"transparency\". I wish they could have fleshed out another type of problem with the Sibyl system instead of going with a very similar plot. The secondary antagonist is actually much more interesting than the main \"bad guy\", and the reveal of what he truly is as well as his actions is kind of shocking to see. The second plot has an overarching theme of science and advancements that have gone too far, and that just because it may be possible to do something doesn't always mean it should be done, and the moral and physical consequences could be disastrous. The story was not as strong as the first and relied heavily on similar themes, but it had high notes specifically during the middle arc of the show where the action and the mystery really picked up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the series once again looks wonderful, but appears slightly more bleak this time, possibly to match the darker tone as well as the accompanying bloodshed. The art of the opening was kind of jarring to watch, and I found myself skipping the opening because its just images repeated over and over. A contrast from the first series, where i thoroughly enjoyed both openings and the endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are Psycho Pass are quite good for the most part, with some exceptions. Akane is back as the lead protagonist, and its nice to see her grow without Kogami helping her out. She still clings to her clear hue and strong sense of morality and justice in the first season, still refusing to activate that Dominator when its in Lethal mode. She shows off her skills as a detective and is pushed to the breaking point several times, but always manages to keep her cool and work towards a morally right decision.  She seems to be cracking a bit, as she has picked up a smoking habit, but otherwise its the a more mature Akane we saw at the end of the first series.\\n\r\nHowever her partner Shimotsuki, who fans of the original will recognize from an earlier arc and the final episode, does not fare as well. I'm going to be frank, she is one of the most annoying characters I've seen in a while. All she does is question Akane and whine for the whole series, and treats her enforcers like crap. She does have some great intuition about one of the villains, but in the end just manages getting herself drawn up into something she can't handle until Akane has to rescue her ungrateful ass. One of the new enforcers Togane is introduced as a competent enforcer who performs well in the field, and is trusted by Akane. It pains me to say that Ginoza's presence is greatly diminished, as his fall from grace in the first season made him an interesting character to watch, and I wanted to see more of his adjustment as an Enforcer. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the second season of Psycho Pass, but it was a very different mindset from the first, which seemed much more thought out and meticulous. I was put off by the first episode, but found that the season recovered and the middle arc was easily the best part of the show, as the ending was a little lackluster after the big reveal. Psycho Pass 2 is a solid series, but unfortunately does not hold a candle to its first series. Its a fun show to watch that will make you think and try to shock you with excessive imagery, both doesn't really try to break through the bar that was set by the first series\\n",

            "content": "TLDR; Solid show, does not live up to first season.\r\nPsycho Pass 2 has me feeling conflicted. As much as I adored the first season, and still enjoyed this one, I'm feeling quite empty about it afterwards. I'm not left with that same feeling of shock and awe like after season 1, and the biggest issue for me is obvious: characters.\r\nI loved the cast of season 1; Kogami (absent in PP2) and Akane were an excellent dynamic duo of complex characters. Instead, Akane doesn't truly have that same counterpart. The complexity of Shogo Makishima is replaced with a promising-but-falls-short Kirito Kamui, who, although seems to bean intriguing antagonist, can't find a proper place in the anime. The development of enforcers is completely lackluster as well; there is no new development in characters like Ginoza, and big bad Togane feels awfully tacked on as a surprise antagonist (as well as Misako). Enforcers like Sho Hinakawa show tremendous potential as character, but receive little to no screen time in each episode. They more serve as plot advancement devices instead of characters. Shimotsuki also feels awfully tacked on in the advancement of enforcer Togane. These reasons all tend to leave me feeling disconnected from the characters and therefore the show.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else, in all honesty, is great to perfect. The unravelling of the grand scheme is excellent, although leaves more to be desired, particularly Sibyl's end resolutions feeling very rushed. Art is beautiful and sound is magnificent. \"Enigmatic Feeling\" is perhaps coming close in my favorite OPs, and the outro is well done as well. Characters and dominators look aesthetically stunning, animation is fluid, and character artwork is unique. The characters themselves, despite my enjoyment of Akane as a protagonist, are the downfall of this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 7. PP2 features beautiful animation and intriguing story which is subsequently thrashed by severe voids in the characters. A fun, but somewhat less memorable installment, especially compared to its predecessor.",

            "content": "Psycho-Pass 2, like many other sequels, tries to top its predecessor with more blood, more torture and more revelations, only to ultimately forget why the audience enjoyed the original in the first place.\r\nTo say that Psycho-Pass 2 didn't have its high point would be false, as the series can still, at the very least, serve as an enjoyable sci-fi action series. However, because the story was constantly trying to shock the audience,  many individual episodes didn't contribute much to the story. The early episodes are almost complete copies of those in the first Psycho-Pass, but on a broader scale. Perhaps the series was tryingto re-immerse the audience in this \"utopian\" society, but as this series came out only a year and a half after the first Psycho-Pass, this seems highly redundant. It tries to make up for the lack of mystery encompassing the setting with new characters and higher stakes, but the gravity of the situation never feels earned. \\n\\n\r\nThese new characters are disappointingly hollow, with only Togane (and arguably Shimotsuki, but the less said about her the better) standing out; to make matters worse, old characters like Ginoza and Shion are side-lined. However, there is one major positive- Akane Tsunemori is now a strong, intelligent and believable heroine. Her actions, be they good or bad, normally feel quite natural, based on her past and present situation. She doesn't act pretentious or egotistic, and her likable character makes this lacklustre cast more bearable. Kamui doesn't approach Makishima in terms of presence, memorability or even intrigue. Lacking in charisma and having to rely on tasteless gore to stand-out, he isn't anything that hasn't been seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of falling short of the original, the animation quality certainly isn't up to par, despite this series being half its length. Generally opting for generic backgrounds and over utilising CGI, this series is quite a disappointment production wise, particularly from the acclaimed Production I.G., though still slightly above average. The colour palette wasn't tasteful either, with an unusual amount of orange (which, as Aldnoah Zero viewers would know, is difficult to like) contrasting the stronger crimsons and blues applied in the first series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was appropriate, with the score generally suiting the scene. The application of bombastic classical music did unfortunately ruin one scene, though that scene's writing was so shoddy that Yoko Kanno probably couldn't have saved it. The opening wasn't too pleasant, with enough jarring repeat shots to induce an epileptic fit. The singer's voice definitely isn't to my taste, and I would have much preferred if \"Nothing Carved in Stone\" returned for the opening. The ending, however, was one of my favourites from 2014, though the lack of visually interesting material prevented it from rising to the level of Zankyo no Terror's ending.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this sequel was watchable. It had a couple of interesting characters, above-average animation and a fantastic ending song. Unfortunately, it squandered its potential with the poor utilisation of its cast, shoving unearned tragedy and gore in the audience's faces, and failing to capitalise on its predecessor's success. It isn't particularly memorable, or intelligent, but those looking for some light, R-Rated entertainment should walk away satisfied.",

            "content": "*Note: Review written under the assumption that readers have watched the original Psycho-Pass. If not, proceed with a spoiler warning*\r\nIn a world where an entity judges your mental condition, there ought to be a couple of problems. Psycho-Pass 2 investigates one in particular, how can you judge a group of individuals when you are the same type of group yourself? If you brand them negatively, doesn't that just mirror yourself?\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nThe MWPSB are working on a case different from anyone they've encountered before. In fact it is a series of crimes all vandalized with the letters \"WC?\" or as we later learn not sofar into the series, \"What color?\". The mystery intensifies as the perpetrators are all connected by one thing - Kamui. They mutter his name under their breath and attribute their crimes under his name. But who is Kamui? What does \"What color\" mean? Who are they asking it to? All questions are (kind of) resolved.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, not bad, but not strong either. The psycho-pass world is very interesting, and I felt that they didn't do it justice as well as they did in the first series. Of course, usually sequels are no match for the original, but this took that difference to a whole other level. The execution of this plot was really....confusing. I personally was not able to understand everything that was going on, and had to look up summaries online after each episode. Many can consider this as only a matter of personal comprehension, but talking to other fans of the series drew many of the same conclusions. Perhaps someone who is quick to understand will probably enjoy the plot itself a lot better than I did.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nAs always, the art in Psycho-Pass 2 was near flawless. Key word \"near\". There were times (especially in the last episodes) where the animators obviously got a little lazy. But it didn't affect my watching of the show. I also noticed that the color of blood (of course there was going to be a vast amount of blood in this anime, what did you expect?) was changed in some scenes to make it seem less gory, which kind of did the trick. I'm not super sure on why some shows do this in general (to me, knowing the blood is not real is enough to make me not feel super queasy), but this minor change is understandable.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the art was probably the best part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nNot going to go super deep into this, but sound in general was fine. The background music wasn't really distinguishable but I could sit through it. The opening was definitely something of my tastes (Ling Tosite Sigure always maintaining that great vibe) and the closing was, dare I say, better than those of Psycho-Pass? Not too much to say about sound this time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nAkane showed the most potential to show character development, and true she did develop some. \\n\r\nI liked how she used Kougami in her head to work out some of the cases (yes, I am a Kougami fangirl, I can't help it), but other than that, her personality was very flat, and only in the end did she show sparks of emotion. The fact that I can't even remember some of her appearances in episodes should say enough about my feelings as of this series towards Akane (note that I did really like her in PP1)\\n\\n\r\nTogane. Oh, Togane. Togane is a new member of the group, and he is an enforcer. I really, really liked his backstory, but as a character himself, he remained pretty stoic until the end ( wow, I'm sensing a pattern here!). Although, he always did have an air of mystery around him that added to the suspense of the show, but other than that, I didn't see a purpose of him being there. I think the story could have flowed a little bit smoother if they got rid of his ultimate \"goal\", but not a major dent in the plot over all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kamui himself, I'm afraid I can't do a detailed character review without spoiling too much. Yes, you do get to see Kamui, but that is where my information stops. I actually think he is pretty interesting and an amazing plot device. Seems to be the only character that I was content with.\\n\\n\r\nFor the others, I'll summarize a bit. A little upset that Gino and Shion did not get a larger role in the series. I also did not like Shimotsuki, the new inspector we met at the end of PP1, but I think that was the point of her character. I did like Hinakawa and Saiga, although for Saiga I was a little confused on what exactly he was doing the entire time. But a little internet researching aided me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI really, really hate to say it, but I did not enjoy PP2 as much as I thought I would. I was easily bored through each episode, and I never became excited to see a new episode. It was like I was forcing myself to watch it.\\n\\n\r\n*Another thing: Kougami*\\n\r\nIf you are expecting to see Kougami in this series, don't bother. Sorry to break it to you, but honey, he doesn't come. I know, I know, I was sad too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are expecting PP2 to be just like the first, you will be disappointed. But, I do recommend you still watch it, but just for the sake of saying you watched it. Not a bad show, but wasn't up to the standard I wanted it to be. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time for reading this review! \\n\\n",

            "content": "TLDR: Inverted Parabola. Starts out all right, gets better towards the middle, crashes and burns at the end.\r\nPsycho Pass made a huge splash in 2012 as a successful Urobutcher series. Its creativity, style, and execution flowed into an enjoyable and imaginative show - albeit with some missteps. Without Urobuchi at the helm, Psycho Pass 2 tries to take his universe and tell a unique story and, honestly, fails pretty hard.\r\nIf you've seen the first season, you probably wonder where the plot for this dystopian thriller could go. After all, much of the original Psycho Pass was an introspective exploration into the world it created. Where,given all the plot developments of the first seasons, could this new series explore?\\n\\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, nowhere. Striking similarities to the first season become quickly apparent and there's an overlying feeling of deja vu throughout the entire series. The story revolves around the same conflict debated in the first series and doesn't add anything new. As the plot progresses further, it desperately tries to distinguish itself through forced and melodramatic plot twists that ultimately amount to a bizarre and nonsensical finale with a confusing, out-of-left-field take-home message.\\n\\n\r\nMost annoying is the lack of continuity from the initial series in characters. In some ways, Psycho Pass 2 doesn't feel like a sequel so much as a parody of the first series. Development seems to only really carry over for Akane; she is the only one in the cast who feels right. Ginoza, the other main protagonist from the first series, takes a backseat role. No, not like the backseat of a car; if Psycho Pass 2 was a Boeing 747, Ginoza would be sitting in the rear flight attendant's area. His developments from the previous season are ignored and he receives something like...15 lines of dialogue? \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Psycho Pass 2 introduces Shimotsuki, one of the most infuriating characters to watch on screen. Her backstory is left unexplained and viewers are left to decode the infinite mystery that is her decisionmaking logic. Tougane, on the other hand, exhibits the makings of a good character and is certainly the most entertaining aspect of Psycho Pass 2. Unfortunately, the last few episodes don't really capture the potential of his character, instead bogging him down in the far less interesting main story.\\n\\n\r\nKamui, the main antagonist, is a washed-up recycle of Makishima with essentially the same character traits and demeanor. These similarities make it incredibly difficult to appreciate him as a stand-alone character. While he may have had some distinguishing features, the resemblance to Makishima in both his methods and his goal detract from an otherwise decent antagonist. Psycho Pass 2 tries to throw in some twists to make him more interesting, but the show can't escape the shadow of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a much weaker cast than the original Psycho Pass, which wasn't even that great to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the animation and sound of Psycho Pass 2 reflect the budget. Animation more or less matches the original show - perhaps slightly better given an 11-episode length compared to 24-episodes. The soundtrack is good, but worse than the first season. Ling Tosite Sigure offers a serviceable opening; however, not nearly as catchy as their work in Psycho Pass's first OP and Tokyo Ghoul. The ending song is my easily favorite song of the show and accents the ending of each episode nicely. The removal of the \"Dominator\" insert song brings down the score a full point, however.\\n\\n\r\nI really wouldn't recommend watching this show if you've seen the first season. Even if you haven't, just watch the first season instead and leave it at that. Episodes 1-6 build up suspense and anticipation that Psycho Pass 2 fails to deliver on. Everything you'll see about the Psycho Pass universe occurred in the first season; Psycho Pass 2 doesn't offer anything dramatically different. It's simply a less interesting version of the first season that leaves you with questions like:\\n\\n\r\n\"What the fuck is wrong with Shimotsuki?\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n",

            "content": "I suspect that the writer for Psycho Pass 2 created the script after surfing through conspiracy theorist sites written by potheads, followed by using the most hackneyed checklist of what constitutes a \u2018dark, edgy thriller\u2019: Somewhat sympathetic villain. Devoted, eye-patch wearing female accomplice in a red cleavage-baring outfit. Innocent puppies being killed mercilessly. Mutilated human faces hanging on walls. People being burned alive while \u2018Nessun Dorma\u2019 plays in the background. (No, I am not joking about the last one.) \r\nPsycho Pass 2 is a terrible sequel. By \u2018terrible sequel\u2019, I do not mean a mediocre sequel that paled in comparison to the original but servedas a solid continuation of the story otherwise. I mean a sequel that ripped out all the things that made the first season interesting, shoved the pieces up its ass, and proceeded to take a dump on its predecessor\u2019s corpse.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the distinguishing factor of the Psycho Pass universe: the Sibyl System. An utilitarian system that valued the collective happiness of everyone, viewing certain strong emotions as impediments to its ideals. Although it suppressed free will and denied space for self-actualization, it was successful in creating a stable society that escalated levels of happiness. It was not evil, it simply prioritized values differently. However, the Sibyl System in Psycho Pass 2 is clearly evil. Its once cold, calculating nature has been replaced with a comically wicked persona that involves itself in all sorts of conspiracies for selfish reasons. It might as well be a maniacal, moustache-stroking dictator plucking sandwich crumbs from his beard.  \\n\\n\r\nThe writing decision to make the Sibyl System act too human ruptured the thematic axis built up by Season One. The chaos did not stop there, the show abandoned its allegory on individual-society relationships and delved straight into a conspiracy thriller plot. The result was a mess of nonsensical conspiracies that ignored the rules established in the previous season. The writer seems to think that the more complicated the villain\u2019s scheme, the better the story. The main villain, Kirito Kamui, is an expert programmer, hacking into several security systems, pulling convoluted tricks on the police, brainwashing people into becoming his cult followers, carrying out multiple organ transplants, and God knows what else. The twists and new details created too many logical gaps in the story to keep the viewer\u2019s investment. It only got more pretentious towards the end with all the theories that have no substantial contribution towards the show\u2019s themes.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the main Inspector Akane Tsunemori started off promising and confident. However, she displayed no real growth by the end of the series, even after all the tragedy she witnessed, after how Sybil System was revealed to be a corrupt dipshit. Her pacifist beliefs did not shake one bit, neither did she offer any new insight. The new characters were nothing interesting either, although Sakuya Tougane, the Enforcer with the highest Crime Coefficient ever recorded, had potential. Of course, he eventually descended into self-parody along with the show. There\u2019s also Mika Shimotsuki, the new Inspector whom everyone wanted to electrocute since episode 1. It was obvious that the show was trying to make her a poster child of the Sibyl System, but her character was utilized very poorly. Lacking initiative, useless, with cow manure for brains, it is hard to imagine how she even qualified for the job. Even after witnessing violent accidents that were partially her fault, she did not come to any realizations, her behavior painted her more like a caricature than an actual person. Yet, the show continued to focus on her childishness, which only served to annoy the audience further instead of articulating any interesting points.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the art and music departments, the animation is passable, although it took a slight dip in quality compared to the first season. I\u2019ll give extra props to the music department though, for giving us the comedic gold that was the \u2018Nessun Dorma\u2019 scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Psycho Pass 2 had me questioning if the writer paid any attention to the first season at all. In fact, the show seemed to undermine its audience\u2019s intelligence with the sheer stupidity of its plot and made-up fictional details, every episode in the second half did a good job of destroying half of my brain cells. To put it straight: Psycho Pass 2 failed to add anything meaningful to the original. It tried too hard to be \u2018deep and edgy\u2019 by throwing in shock and violence, even though it lacked thematic resonance of any sort. It\u2019s like trying to improve the taste of burnt buffalo wings by pouring a bucket of hot sauce on it: not only does it still taste terrible, you are probably going to end up with a bad case of diarrhea, idiot.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n\"The law doesn't protect the people, it's the people who protect the law.\"\r\n\"It's not society that determines the future of its people, it's the people who determine the future of their society.\"\r\nPsycho Pass 2 is best described as a political / moral discourse about the right and means of judgement, thrown into a thrilling plot and a cast of underdeveloped characters. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved season 1 of this series, but I thought that while season 2 was an interesting extension of what happened in S1, it didn't do it enough \"justice\" (oh the puns).\r\nI have come tothe conclusion that I should judge Psycho-Pass 2 collectively, and not individually as a standalone series (hence, the rating does not go below 5).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\n+ Strong main character\\n\r\n+ Good moral discourse towards the end\\n\r\n+ Sensible resolution\\n\r\n+ Great animation and art\\n\r\n+ Great background music builds suspense\\n\r\n+ Gripping and exciting plot development\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Mess of underdeveloped supporting characters\\n\r\n- Useless and stupid supporting characters\\n\r\n- Unnecessary and unimportant plot events\\n\r\n- Many, many unexplained plot holes\\n\r\n- Overpowered antagonist character\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is split into 3 main plot arcs, excluding the introductory arc, and they are the mental care facility arc, the drone base arc and the final train hostage arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe introductory arc starts off very well, cutting right to the chase in the middle of a crime investigation where we begin to see all the new characters being introduced (Shimotsuki, Togane and Hinakawa). While the criminal was apprehended very easily, we begin to see traces of how this crime is not as simple as it initially seems, from the final scene of episode 1 where the main antagonist reveals himself and manages to kidnap an inspector and kill off one of her Enforcers. (+1 for excitement)\\n\\n\r\nThings start to get really interesting from there as Akane, the main protagonist, begins to get clues about this \"ghost\" known as Kamui, who apparently bypasses all cymatic scans and can live in society without actually existing. One particularly scary / exciting part was when Akane, in the midst of searching for clues, finds the words 'WC?' scratched on the wall of her apartment building - a very shocking revelation. Later on, it is revealed that this does not mean that Kamui cannot find a bathroom, but that Kamui is asking Akane, and subsequently Sibyl, what colour they are, and further on, what colour he himself is (since he can't be scanned by Sibyl). (+1 for development)\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of depth that they actually put into the thought process behind Kamui is actually very impressive - from how he was the lone survivor of an airline crash to becoming part of an experiment to join 184 different body parts (aka personalities) together to form a human being that essentially represents a collective group of people, the only other collective group being Sibyl itself. While it would be obvious to point out that joining 184 body parts together to create a live working human is far from possible, at least the anime itself points this out by expressing Saiga's doubt so I'm not deducting any points for that plot flaw. Kamui then proceeds to represent these 184 different people, and begins to start his grand plan of \"making everybody clear\" which is actually better phrased as \"going to judge Sibyl\". I found that the amount of moral and political discourse about omnipotent beings, collective judgement and perfection / ideals within the anime  is quite substantial so kudos for that. (+1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the main idea of the story was quite simple - put a collective entity in the system so that Sibyl must judge itself, so nothing too complex there. A collective Psycho-Pass would mean that groups of people could be judged as dangerous even though each individual was clear, or that people's Psycho-Pass could change when within different groups, or like the twist at the end with Kamui - who claims that the person holding the Dominator becomes collectively part of Sibyl when pointing it at Sibyl itself. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this twist doesn't make much sense no matter how you look at it. If Kamui points at Sibyl and Kamui is part of Sibyl, and it shows a value of zero, why would Akane, who is much clearer than Kamui, make the result any greater than zero? This would most likely make Sibyl go into the negative, if anything. Nice try, but that twist doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while there is an overarching plot, the 3 main plot arcs within didn't make sense. All Kamui really wanted to do was to point a dominator at Sibyl and to force them to judge themselves. There was honestly really no need for all the subsequent killing after he got a hold of Shisui's Dominator during the first episode, and there was nothing else stopping him from walking right up to Sibyl's front door except explaining to Akane why he needs to do so. And, I believe, Akane would have immediately obliged, seeing as how she did so at the end of the anime anyway. So, everything that Kamui plotted, all the people he killed after the first episode, in my opinion, was grossly unnecessary and only serves to heighten the \"suspense\" that would end up turning on itself at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot attempts to explain that all of the other crimes were to \"test\" the functions of the Dominator - whether it could judge inspectors, other enforcers - and then to whether he could use it with the inspector's eyeball, then to just getting more Dominators for accomplices he didn't need, to carry out the train hostage taking plan that he didn't really have to carry out. The mental care facility arc was apparently to see if an inspector could be judged, but with Kamui's intelligence, this could have been done simply by pointing the gun at Shisui. The final train hostage arc was to overload Sibyl system and hence find out where Sibyl actually was - but in the end Akane brought him there so that was plain useless. So basically the plot could have been shortened to just episodes 1 and 12.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, we look at Kamui's incredible powers of persuading people through the use of drugs and holos, arguably his two main skills in this anime (aside from teleportation of course, but we'll get to that later). I'm fine with Kamui being an expert in a certain field, but in multiple fields, this becomes less and less likely. So we start with Kamui being an expert at Psycho-Pass-reduction drugs, that make people be able to kill anybody they want after taking some injection or aerosol medication. Sure, but Kamui can also program holograms of himself. Not only that, but it seems like he has 184 different holograms, all of whom are himself, and all of whom are \"aged-up\" versions of his dead friends. Okay, let's suppose he can do that, what about being able to hack into the Ministry of Defence and MWPSB's systems and to take control of ALL their drones? Okay, what about being able to find escape route for a mental care facility that was supposed to be locked down already? Can he teleport now? Oh wait, I forgot that he is also a bomb expert who can program his bombs to be overridden and controlled only by him. Next, he can also apparently produce synthetic retinal layers so that his accomplices can use Dominators under Shisui's name too, without any background in materials science. He also happens to be a drone expert and can remove the impact absorbers of drones cleanly. Amazing! Really, the amount of things that this guy can do is so over the top, it's a mystery why this man hasn't managed to locate Sibyl yet with all the time he seems to have on his hands, learning about all these things.\\n\\n\r\nNext, one of the key things I really hated about the plot this time around was about the whole Togane Misako and Togane Sakuya plotting to turn Akane black. We already know that this is not possible. While Akane is not criminally asymptomatic, from S1, we know that her Psycho-Pass NEVER gets clouded, not ever. And if anything, Sibyl should already know this. The entire plot twist about Togane being the secret antagonist and trying to cloud Akane's Psycho-Pass was incredibly unnecessary and annoying. While it did add some dimension to the plot, it didn't have any convincing motives whatsoever - all Togane said was \"This is my reason for existence\" - and neither did it progress the plot in any meaningful way. So Akane's grandmother was killed for no reason whatsoever, that's just sad and cruel and doesn't do justice to one of my favourite characters of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOther huge plot holes include Inspector Shisui, who changes very suddenly from having her eyeball taken out to becoming super loyal to Kamui, as can be seen clearly in the final two episodes where she fights almost to the brink of death for Kamui's cause. The only possible way to explain how a person who was kidnapped, then strapped to a chair with a gun pointing to herself, then seeing her own eyeball outside of her body, change so suddenly to having so much affection for her kidnapper to the point of saying \"You can use my body as well\" (during the drone base arc) or to even agreeing to kill / endanger her own former partner, Aoyanagi, is that she was brainwashed with some of Kamui's drugs - but this was not even mentioned, so it's definitely a plot hole. Not to mention that I know Kamui is an expert at drugs but it just because he himself went through 184 body part surgery doesn't mean that he is anywhere near skilled enough to perform eye surgery in the first place (oh wait, I forgot he has an infinite set of skills).\\n\\n\r\nThere were also a whole load of other unexplained plot junk like Kamui's killing of a lot of \"illegal aliens\" during a dinner banquet, Shimotsuki suddenly having the freedom to go and expose Togane's secrets to set the audience off on a red herring that everyone in the audience knows is fake, Akane's grandmother having her ear cut off instead of being killed in the first place (and then getting killed again eventually), Kamui getting help from so many people, Sibyl able to identify inanimate objects like drones based on their threat level and them killing people, but still having immense trouble figuring out whether a person who just killed another person is a \"threat\" based on cymatic scan. All of this is glossed over in the anime and simply overlooked, as if the writers hoped nobody would ask questions and just accept them as it is.\\n\\n\r\nNext, character behaviour during some plot events were unnatural. Shimotsuki's reaction to learning about the Sibyl system, plus Sibyl choosing to reveal the reality to her in the first place didn't make any sense whatsoever. Togane mentioned that Shimotsuki could be used as a \"test subject\" to see how citizens would react if faced with the reality of Sibyl, but Shimotsuki's reactions were that of a person in denial and that is by no means a valuable test subject. If I were Togane, I would have simply killed her immediately because she adds no value to the society, and even less to the plot (but more of her uselessness later - see character section).\\n\\n\r\nStill, at the very least the key premise of the plot made sense - that Sibyl needed to change to accommodate the collective identity of Kamui, as well as itself. It prides itself on \"evolving\" continually to improve but honestly it was all Akane's doing and persuasion that convinced Sibyl that anything needed changing at all. I'm horribly saddened that a collective of 100+ brains could not see this and needed Akane to give it a lecture. Then again, aristocracy is not perfect, so whatever. (+1 for believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nI do have on final note on the interesting sniper-dominator weapon that one of the protagonists from Division 3 used during the second arc to \"shoot through\" the wall and accidentally hit Aoyangi, basically killing her. This calls into question the design and specifications of the Dominator in the first place, as it is a key plot device that is never really touched on or explained. We do know that it does have a fixed number of shots, thanks to Togane's random quibbling about how there are only 3 Destroy-Decomposer shots during the drone base arc, but other than that we still have no idea, after two seasons, of what exactly it fires and where it gets it's power/ rounds from since there obviously isn't any reloading going on. They definitely need to get down to some explaining of how this thing really works, and then on to explaining how it's actually possible for such rounds / pulses of energy to be able \"shoot through\" walls and if so, what material / how thick and how reliably so? Plus, the cymatic scan is shown many times to be able to \"bypass walls\", so honestly why can't it bypass humans as well (all the countless of times the psycho-pass clear people block a Dominator by standing in front of an enforcement target) - especially when the human isn't technically completely blocking the person behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot really suffers this time around, not so much because of the main plot line but because of the general incoherence and unnecessary twists and events that felt very pointless at the end of the entire anime. I did, however, like the conclusion because at least it sensibly resolved the entire conflict in the most reasonable way possible. (+1 for overarching, resolved conflict)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art design and concept behind this anime is just so good. \\n\r\nOP Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nAnimation: 3/3\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme: 1/2 - this OP really suffered from all the horrible high pitch vocals, though the backing track was very upbeat and exciting\\n\r\nED Theme: 2/2 - good ED theme in general\\n\r\nBackground Music: 4/4 - very good background music that really built up suspense throughout\\n\r\nAdditional Themes: 0/2 - There were no additional themes, so no points here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character definitely has to be Shinya Kogami. Lol. Even though he wasn't even featured as a main character throughout S2, his cameo appearances were enough to make me love him because his lines are always impactful and game-breaking. And he is so cool! :D\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, we move on to the main protagonist, Akane, who has grown from being just an innocent, fresh police inspector to a mature, sharp, quick-witted and decisive woman who is pretty much the best boss anyone could ask for. She's understanding, calm, efficient and she gets her hands dirty when she needs to. While she doesn't show much growth throughout the anime (she's already grown a lot S1), her character development continues to pull through - from her recent smoking habit to the way she handles her new, annoying colleague Shimotsuki, to her talking with Saiga and her final face-off with Sibyl and Kamui. Akane is a character with such strong presence and courage that it's hard not to like her. She's also the one-of-a-kind natural master of her own psycho-pass. (+1 for bravery, +1 for uniqueness)\\n\\n\r\nMany people didn't like how Akane's only reaction to her grandmother's death was just one scream - but just hold that thought a while. The way Akane recovered from the initial shock and emotion, and finally went to rationalizing the whole thing - realizing that it was not possible that Kamui would target her grandmother - was not simply because of \"her nature\". The specific cutscene shows Akane remembering Kogami's words, \"This is unlike you... didn't you try to stop me (from killing Shogo Makishima) because you believe in (the law)?\" Akane was clearly distraught but she managed composed herself by recalling her past experiences in S1. Since I view S2 in light of the events in S1, I know that it's not that Akane is emotionless or lacks any human feeling in her, it's that she bravely makes the decision to suppress them to uphold the law, and to protect all of society, not just the people important to her. (+1 for character depth)\\n\\n\r\nThe next pretty damn cool character is Saiga, the one everyone is slightly afraid of because of rumours that anyone he talks to gets a clouded Psycho-Pass. But he's actually a pretty friendly and straightforward guy who's also so sharp that he basically unravels most of Kamui's intentions just by looking at him. He is also one of the best partners to Akane because she is immune to his \"clouding Psycho-Pass\" effect and becomes a caring mentor to her whenever she turns to him for advice and help on the case. (+1 for intellect) Too bad he's also just supporting cast so he doesn't get much attention.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, at this point we have to mention Kirito Kamui, the main antagonist who is basically going the huge roundabout way of doing things. We get to see a lot of his backstory before the final arc, when his surgeon talks about how he was patched up from 184 different body parts, and his subsequent life and motivations from there, so that was really good and was actually believable - the idea that he could become so invisible that he basically felt non-existent, which drove him to ask the question \"WC?\" in the first place. I loved how this thoroughly explained his motives behind the overall plot, even though it didn't really justify all that killing. It's also great to see how he actually has good intentions to change Sibyl system as a whole, and was willing to sacrifice himself for his cause. (+1 for depth, +1 for courage)\\n\\n\r\nThe other main antagonist of course, Togane, was just a mass of bad intentions and poor plot points. Sure, he had some backstory, but they basically said that he was synthetically created, had a mother complex, and likes to kill people by turning their psycho-pass black. None of this is remotely human enough to make me consider him as a character, he's more like just there for 2 key reasons, a) a deus-ex-machina to make a uselessly complex plot and b) to remind Akane of Kogami. Akane should have just let Kamui killed him when he had the chance - he totally deserved to be disintegrated for beating up a poor old granny like that.\\n\\n\r\nI was very sad that I didn't get to see Ginoza much though, because he definitely grew a lot from S1 too, but the writers didn't let him get enough screentime and demoted him to a supporting character. In fact, it's depressing that so many of the supporting characters just got sidelined and none of them were developed to any considerable degree even though I could tell that they were really interesting characters - people like Yayoi, Hinakawa, Shion and even Aoyanagi (who really didn't deserve to die in such a horrible fashion).\\n\\n\r\nThe character that I really, really hated though, definitely had to be Shimotsuki. She has got to be the number one most useless tryhard character ever. From the beginning, she gets on the nerves of everyone in Unit 1, she annoys the audience constantly by trying to get Akane removed as an inspector, her lack of understanding and naivety to every situation leads to most of the time spent \"on standby\", and her lack of any form of courage continues throughout the anime, even to the end where she continues to remain in denial. She has minimal growth despite having so many chances to change and become more mature, and she has also ZERO backstory (nobody really knows where she comes from) and she also has minimal character development - she exists just to be an obstacle and a hindrance to the overall plot and to Akane. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to justify Shimotsuki's necessity within the anime by referring to her as the \"ideal citizen\" that would accept Sibyl's true reality when the time comes for the secret to be revealed to the rest of society. While that is a good attempt of representing the useless people in society, that's not main character material! If she was just a supporting character, I would be fine with it, but nope, she has more screen time than the other cooler characters like Ginoza and Saiga. She really doesn't deserve the main character status if the reason she's there is to merely represent the unthinking, passive portion of society.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have to talk about Sibyl as a character. Sure enough, Sibyl manages to get a bit of growth, essentially killing off it's more \"insane\" minds such as Togane Misako and keeping only the select few who were less criminally chaotic in nature, which is basically the most sensible thing to do. Sibyl does have so many flaws however, that it is insane to think how it can live with itself knowing that it has this many flaws all this while. (+1 for slight growth) I really loved how Sibyl turned its back against Togane Misako at the end though, that mess of a character totally deserved some punishment.\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, most of the character really lacked growth and development, though I think Akane as a character really stood out among everyone. Too bad it was only Akane and everyone else kind of just fell short of what it truly means to be a solid character. The entire plot was basically being carried by Akane alone, and that can't ever really be a good thing, can it?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I hated the plot and I despised many of the characters, I have to say that I was excited enough to watch through the entire S2 in one sitting, so that probably means that it did well in the suspense department, especially in the initial few episodes of the anime where they kept with the lingering question on whether it was really a ghost or not. (+2 for suspense) I also felt that the action scenes were fast-paced enough to enjoy amidst all the crime-solving excitement that really kept my blood pumping. (+2 for excitement).\\n\\n\r\nThe gore in this anime is also really one of its key characteristics - to be able to show all that blood and chaos, all the face smashing and beating and to treat it as a natural outcome in the eyes of Sibyl. This is really one key feature that keeps you transfixed to the screen and constantly telling yourself \"Something is really wrong with this screwed up system.\" (+1 for thrill)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there was good pacing and not once did I feel bored. The action scenes were clear, sharp and crisp, while all the slower scenes did not feel too dragged out. I also felt that all the moral discourse with Saiga, Akane with herself and finally with Kamui, all of it actually made a lot of sense. It was especially interesting to think about the idea of Sibyl \"judging itself\" as an \"omnipotent\" being that was achieving omnipotence and absorbing anything that it didn't have power over. (+3 for pacing)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime receives a bonus 1 point for not having any filler episodes. (+1 bonus point)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really fell short of my expectations for it. My rating for the previous season was a 9, so dropping 2 points really means a major disappointment, but at least it was an enjoyable watch for me nonetheless. At this point though, I'm pretty certain this anime is not complete without Kogami Shinya as a main character.\\n\\n\r\nReviewer's Comments:\\n\r\nAfter reading through many of the Psycho-Pass 2 reviews on this site, I was shocked to see how many people have rated this anime so low just because of the hate and disappointment they felt from having their expectations of this show crushed. I honestly do not think this show deserves any less than a 5 (the bare minimum), despite the sub-par plot and character development. The show was, on the animation and screenplay side, pretty solid and I think we should at least give credit for that. I also believe that the only reason it's getting so much hate is because many people's \"Psycho-Pass\" is being clouded by their own emotions. I will stick to my score of 7 because just like Akane, if you remove your emotions from the picture and think clearly, rationally, you will no doubt pass fairer judgement.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sibyl, what is your colour?\"",

            "content": "Truth be told, after Season 1, I am highly disappointed as of Episode 5. While I understand the aspect of mystery, most of events that take place in the anime and the story itself don't make a lot of sense.\r\nNot only it goes against the logical nature of the first season of the show, it also overuses previous themes, such as the faults of the Sybil System, at the same time paying no respect to them... Because one of the faults of the system was its over-control of human life... control, that now somehow vanished, apparently for the sake of the plot.\r\nThe premise of theworld itself was police investigating incidents in the world in which machines can read a person's mind and judge it. However, none of it is left. Instead, everyone focuses on some kind of \"ghost\" who uses abilities more akin to magic or at least methods working with magic-like efficiency.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier, it was pure logic and psychology, with some action. MWPSB tried to discover the culprits behind crimes and hunt them down. To do that, they investigated crimes that occurred, looking for leads - something like this barely occurs now that the show focuses on a single mystery of a ghost, and every criminal is suddenly clean.\\n\\n\r\nChanging someone's Crime Coefficient regardless of their thoughts, tendencies and motives is illogical ability - because Crime Coefficient itself was a measurement and judgment of thoughts, tendencies and motives. It's like changing a measurement on thermometer without changing temperature.\\n\r\nIt's obvious it will be explained, but the execution of the idea is done rather badly, if instead of interest, it causes aversion to the writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe new season also seems to easily disregard some parts of the world we saw in the first season. For example, eye scanning was outdated technology in Season 1, but for some reason, it's used by Dominators to work in Season 2. Similarly, anti-hacking measures in drone factory were particularly tight, while nothing of it was reflected in latest, drone-related episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season had criminals trying to work their way around the system, they were still fragile to it once found out. This new season however disregards ordered nature of the world completely, dumbing down its safety and security, while severely overpowering criminals and making them immune to most attempts of enforcement.",

            "content": "There\u2019s no easy way to describe the Psycho Pass franchise. To put it together it simply, the story becomes a complex tale to tell in a dystopian world. Just think about it: imagine if you feel like being watched 24/7 in a Big Brother style surveillance society. How would you feel about that? Fearful? That should be a normal feeling considering every person is measured by a state of being known as \u2018Psycho Pass\u2019. It tells the limits of a person\u2019s mental state and their probability to commit a crime. This may sound all cool and dandy but in reality is a system with somany possibilities. Psycho Pass 2 serves as the direct sequel of the first season to bring those possibilities into chaotic levels.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season revolves around several changes. Technical wise, Production I.G. is no longer in charge of the project (oddly enough, they are still involved with the movie production). Instead, we get Tatsunoko Production directed by Kiyotaka Suzuki. Secondly, the series only runs approximately half the length of the first season. That\u2019s right. 11 episodes and apparently, the show is confident enough to craft a story based on the setup of the premise and what it has shown us from the first season. Make no mistake though, certain characters do make returns while new ones are added. Finally, there\u2019s an absence of Shinya Kogami. There\u2019s obvious reasons why he doesn\u2019t appear in this sequel especially for fans who have seen the first season. In regards to these changes, this sequel brings a different picture to view. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the start, the second season offers a story involving a new mysterious case. To end, it also adds a host of new characters as well as returning ones from the first season. Protagonist and inspector Akane  Tsunemori returns after learning the truth about the Sybil System. Her choice is to obey the system by following a philosophy of doing the right thing is in her mind. Joining her includes Ginoza, Yayoi, and Shion as part of the new police unit. They also get some new helping hands including six new characters who plays a variety of roles in the second season. While the show still retains their state of duty, the season is left without Kagami, a man who dealt pivotal blows against the system. At the same time, the Sybil System itself reveals startling new revelations that may change the story forever. For Akane, this season is also about her own personal battle and against another mysterious individual. This can easily be seen at the conclusion of the first episode as we meet Kirito Kamui, a mysterious antagonist who tampers with the Sybil System.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get a few other things out of the way. The absence of certain characters is something that season 2 suffers from when it comes to expansive development. Fans who have become attached to Kogami will surely feel disappointed with his lack of presence. And to make it worse, we no longer have Makishima Shougo (for obvious reasons). He was a complex character with a dark personality and a difficult antagonist to replace. It\u2019ll take time for people to get used to a guy like Kamui despite their similar dark personalities. Still, there\u2019s also a mistake about the second season with the addition with Mika when it comes to her characterization. The first episode leaves no time to depict her character as someone who is literally a complainer desperately trying to defend the Sybil System. Her ignorance and opposition against her own boss Akane is something to that can be on the line of hair pulling annoyance. At some point of the show, it would come as no surprise if most viewers label Mika to be an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the additions of such a foil character, the new season still has enough to keep fans involved and eagerly await each episode. I can say this with confidence as some episodes leaves off with thrilling cliffhangers after a built-up of events. It\u2019s also easy to interpret the show that is shrouded in mystery with secrets and foreshadowing. There are also parts during the season as we witness Kamui commence with his plans in secret with hidden motives. It\u2019s easy to tell that he is the type of man who is careful with his moves after he kidnaps and seemingly brainwashes Mizue Shisui, an inspector from Division 2. His smooth talking tells us that he is quite a manipulative character who uses words as his primary weapon to get people to join his side. Not only that but he seems to be personally interested in Akane, a contrast to Season 1\u2019s Makishima Shougo where he is disappointed at her actions. Like I mentioned before, Akane fights on personal terms with her internal struggles as his friends, family, and comrades are put in danger. Season 2 exploits many points with twists of fate with a grim sense of purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThere are definitely some problems with the direction of the episodes in this season. In particular, one episode introduces a group of new characters from another unit; a direction that I feel as inappropriate with the lack of characterization already on the current roster. But let\u2019s make this worse. This one particular episode turns into a sour blood fest after some choices are made based on the behavior of the Sybil System. And if you want to guess, Mika is as useless as ever while Akane herself does little to secure the problem. What we get in the end is nothing more than more exposition and graphic violence to add to the shock factor. There\u2019s also the situational \u2018cat and mouse\u2019 gimmick that returns in this season as the new police unit begins to hunt down Kamui. Guess who is Tom and who is Jerry. Still, the main part of the show\u2019s problem revolves with Kamui\u2019s methods to manipulate people. A part of his past connects with events of the present that deconstructs the way the Sybil System work. Unlike season 1 that is focused on the flaws of the system, it now becomes a shallow writing with terribly mishandled concept. Honestly, if that is the method that Kamui uses to manipulate people, then this season is doomed. You\u2019ll have to watch it yourself to discover the stone cold truth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter relationships are of minimal impact and nothing on par with Akane and Kagami\u2019s development from season 1. There are also strange twists thrown in revolving around with Tougane as well as Mika learns of a terrible fact. Otherwise, most of the other new characters lacks any depth with their characterization. Even Ginoza becomes less interesting despite his initial impressive introduction in this season. I say this with a potential romance angle that was doomed from the very start. Finally, don\u2019t forget about Mika. Or perhaps, I think it should be in best of interests to forget her as much as possible since she is so focused on her own ideology. (even after being exposed to the truth) It\u2019s hard for anyone to feel sorry for her to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll warn you right now. This show can be a bit of a pain to the stomach at times to watch. If you\u2019re not used to gore and blood fests, then some of the episodes will not be suitable enough. For shock value and blatant attempts to illustrate the grim society of this show\u2019s world, we get graphic violence. With total uncensored footage, there\u2019s bodies exploding with blood raining down that makes this Fall Season\u2019s Terra Formars\u2019 violence look like a joke. On top of that, the show\u2019s visuals downgrades a bit on some episodes with character expressions. You won\u2019t notice it much since it\u2019s not as explicit as the actual violence. Nonetheless, the artwork is only decent with the setting and character designs. I do give some praise to the action sequences though except some parts that are lazily coordinated. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is perhaps a stronger aspect of the sequel. While it doesn\u2019t surpass season 1 in any way, there\u2019s a good measure of coordinating the cryptic OP song to illustrate its themes. Not only that but the OST remains top notch during key moments in this season. Unfortunately, character voice mannerisms becomes a concern at times especially with people like Mika and Sho. The season\u2019s soundtrack does rebound this back though with some of the expressive tones during climatic moments, usually thriller endings that makes the audience hunger for more.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this season, I scratch my head to wonder what went wrong with the second season. It had a good momentum from the beginning with the introduction of new characters and antagonists. We also found out more of the season\u2019s motives especially involving Akane. Then somewhere down that road, the season decided to turn into bloated writing of its former self. It becomes a shameless example of how not to do a sequel. And in this case, the characters too follow down a road of deconstructing formulation. Now, this season isn\u2019t garbage though especially when it comes to some action and technical features. The initial few episodes in the beginning had a solid momentum and almost every episode leaves with a feeling of thrills; to keep the audience in their seats to look forward to more.  There are moments that makes me hunger for more but in the end, it still remains meh. \\n",

            "content": "I really liked the first season of Psycho Pass. It had everything I wanted in a cyberpunk crime Anime, from the atmosphere to the characters to the setting. So, after the announcement of Season 2, I was really excited. But, after hearing it would be only 11 episodes, I was worried, since I thought it'd be rushed and would be of less quality than the first season. Unfortunately, I was right. I'll move on to my review.Story:-\\n\r\nThis season takes place a couple of years after the events of Pyscho Pass. We are introduced to Akane's new team in the MWPSB, along with some familiar faces. After a brief introduction, we are thrust right into the action, where we at the end see the main antagonist of this season.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, as far as the story is concerned, it was disappointing. The story's really similar to the first season, but never as interesting. With the introduction of the new antagonist, Kamui Kirito, I expected something different. Story is the same old ''Person wrecks havoc in the city, MWPSB must stop him at all costs''. There are a few twists and turns throughout the series that legitimately surprise me, but those really didn't save the story from being a mess, with plot holes and nonsensical things happening just for the sake of progressing the plot. It's a shame, since it was really good in the beginning, building up the tension with each subsequent episode. The series reached its peak at Episode 6, which was really intense and even had me shaking in my boots. But, the Anime ended in a really bad way, which I didn't enjoy one bit. It left me with more questions than answers.\\n\\n\r\n                                                             Art and Sound:-\\n\r\nDefinitely the best part of Pyscho Pass 2. It's just as good as the previous season, if not better. Characters are designed brilliantly, though I still can't get used to Akane's odd eyelashes(they creep me out, man!). The detail in the city, lighting and other such intricate little things just make it better to look at. And as usual, the Dominators look badass no matter how many times I see them being used.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is also great. The Opening ''Enigmatic feeling'' though not as good as the Opening of Psycho Pass 1, is still great to hear. The ending ''Fallen'' is amazing though, best ED I've heard in a long time. It's even on my playlist now. The rest of the sounds for the Anime just get the job done and are nothing special. \\n\\n\r\n                                                             Character:-\\n\r\nOut of the main cast, Akane is the only one who got a decent amount of character development. We see her troubled, on the brink of getting her crystal clear Psycho Pass getting coloured on a few occasions. Rest of the old cast hardly has any development, Ginoza in particular. Really was sad that he barely had anything to do in the Anime, considering he was one of my favourite characters in Psycho Pass 1.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have a few new characters. The new officer, Shimotsuki, who works alongside Akane. Bluntly put, she's a flat out bitch. I didn't liker her from the beginning. She thinks highly of herself and believes she is right all the time. She even looks down on Akane's methods to handling various situations, and she doesn't even have much of a backstory. There's also the new enforcer, Togane Sakuya. I liked him a lot. He provided the season's most entertaining aspects. Sadly, he wasn't used the way I would've liked, in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main antagonist Kamui Kirito, there really isn't much to say about him. He doesn't have the charisma or panache that Makishima possessed. He's just a plain old villain trying to destroy the Sibyl System. He had his moments, some of which were actually quite good, but in the end, he hardly left an impression on me, hence was forgettable.  \\n\r\nOverall, the set of characters in this season are severely underwhelming and not memorable. \\n\\n\r\n                                                          Enjoyment and Overall:-\\n\r\nIt was an okay season. It had spectacular highs and excruciating lows. It's not close to as good as the first season of Psycho Pass. But it still warrants a watch, even if it's just for the sake of watching it in order to see the movie. I really hope the movie makes more sense and ties all the loose ends together.",

            "content": "Sequels have always been expected to fill the shoes of it's predecessors.  And it should go without saying that a great deal of sequels fall short. Either because fans of the 1st season carry high expectations or elements of the 1st season is missing in its follow up. \r\nUnfortunately Psycho-Pass 2 isn't an exception to the rule. It didn't quite live up to the success it garnered back in 2012/2013..\r\nStory: 4/10\r\n    One of the most noticeable flaw starts with unresolved tension build up from season 1. Instead of following up on the friction between the collective entity of  the SibylSystem and Akane, it places in on the back burner. Even going as far as making Sibyl passive as appose to the hands on approach the fans would have been used to. Instead we follow Akane as she investigates the new and rather bland antagonist who stirs up trouble in the system. the 11 episode runtime also further dampers the story, giving it less time to be fully fleshed out. \\n\r\n   With a new writer behind the helm, PP2 feels rather alienated from it's predecessor. The absence of Gen Urobuchi's knack for chair gripping thrill rides is ever present. The new writer isn't bad per say, but lacks the flare for the dramatic that the Butcher is known for. This shift in tone makes the story of PP2 feel more like a run of the mill tv cop drama than a dystopian/cyberpunk neo noir experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLuckily the art for PP2 doesn't go through studio changes. Making the transition with no noticeable hickups. The color pallet also remains the same, which in turn gives the city and surroundings it's familiar atmosphere. But it isn't all well, as there's a obvious dip in aesthetics and cinematics. Some frame shots felt devoid of any substance. These problems won't be something apparent to the untrained eye and shouldn't ruin your experience. \\n\\n\r\nsound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very forgettable. With none demanding any attention of the viewer, they simply play in the background for added effect. The voice actors retained their roles, so those familiar with them won't find any complaints. They also introduce 3 new parties to the cast line up but we'll talk about those later. The opening made for an enjoyable listen and keeps the pace set by the other 2 of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where things go to shit. The new characters introduced range from being bland to borderline annoying (I'm looking at you Mika!).\\n\r\nShou Hinakawa: smart shy guy\\n\r\nSakuya Tougane: deranged lunatic \\n\r\nantagonist (unnamed for spoilers): no personality to speak of. \\n\r\nand then there's Mika Shimotsuki, ohhh God MIKA... for the sake of not going off on a tangent I'll leave it at that. Akane was also a disappointment, her unchangeable plot device \"Psycho-Pass\" holds her back from getting any development and because of that she remains stagnant throughout the show's duration.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOther than seeing the continuation of Psycho-Pass, season 2 dropped the ball. It lost all the charm that made the show great to begin with and I was left more disappointed than satisfied.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom being a show I hold in high regards to one I won't bother acknowledging, Psycho-Pass 2 failed on many levels. If you were a fan of the series and have yet to watch this, I suggest you skip it and go on in ignorant bliss. A decision I wish I had follow for myself.",

            "content": "This second season of Psycho-Pass introduces a new villain in the form of Kamui who is trying to shake things up with the current society in place being ran by the Sibyl System much like Makishima did in the prior season. Akane has a mostly new team of Inspectors and Enforcers to assist her in this case as she tries to figure out Kamui's motives and origins as he manipulates others to join in his cause.\r\nUnlike the first season, Psycho Pass 2 is quite a mess in terms of writing and the amount of time it has to explore things. The first season took itstime with exploring the unique problems that plagued Japan with the Sibyl System running society, fleshing out its cast and unveiling the true nature and motives surrounding Makishima and the Sibyl System. The 22-episode count for it was enough time for you to think about and feel for the problems facing the major characters and those living within the so-called utopia that the Sibyl System provided.\\n\\n\r\nFor this second season though, the writing for the plot isn't as well thought out as a good number of the plot twists and revelations revealed regarding Kamui's origins and his plans in defying the Sibyl System are rushed through and the series relies on infodump expositions at points to fully reveal its story instead of fully showing you what happens. In addition, the majority of new characters introduced in this series either get little fleshing out or are so incompetent that you have to wonder why they were allowed to fill character space. Having this season at 11 episodes greatly limited the amount of time the series could have to explore its plot and characters. Plus unlike its first season, it didn't seem like this series had a clear focus on what it wanted to explore as subjects such as Akane's mental state and the Sibyl System running into some sort of omnipotence paradox are brought up yet either don't get properly developed or they get poorly elaborated on thanks to the show's rushed pace. It seemed like whomever was responsible for directing this season of Psycho-Pass was more focused on highlighting the spectacle of the series instead of the themes it explored from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the only genuine praise I can give this second season to Psycho-Pass is its visual presentation. It isn't much different from the first season meaning the high quality animation is retained here with its highly detailed scenic shots and character designs, fluid and intense action scenes and nicely rendered CG animation used for patrol bots, vehicles and Dominators. For as much of a mess as the story was, Psycho-Pass 2 is still one of the year's best titles in terms of visual quality.\\n\\n\r\nBut putting aside its animation, Psycho-Pass 2 is still among one of this year's biggest disappointments as a follow-up to its excellent first season. Its storytelling was a mess and the 11-episode run of it limited how much time the series could get into with fleshing out its plot and characters without having to resort to info dumping. Will have to see if the upcoming movie for this will be any better than this pitiful sequel to it.\\n",

            "content": "Psycho-Pass was undoubtedly one of the greatest, if not the best, anime of the fall and winter season of 2012. So naturally, when a sequel was announced, people got really excited. They wanted to see more of the mind-games, more of the great characters, and more of the badass detective Kougami. And did this sequel deliver? Not at all.\r\nBefore I get into the review, I\u2019d like to give a warning to those who haven\u2019t seen season one of Psycho-Pass since this review will contain a few spoilers of the first season, also, go and watch the first season, like, right now. I\u2019ll also say that,as much as I don\u2019t want to, I will inevitably draw comparisons between both seasons.\\n\r\nAlso, there\u2019s a TL;DR at the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:-  5/10\\n\\n\r\nOur story continues from about two years after where the last season ended. We see some familiar faces among our main cast, including Akane Tsunemori. We\u2019re also introduced to two new enforcers(Tougane and Hinakawa) and one new inspector who was show at the end of the first season, Mika Shimotsuki(I\u2019ll get into her character later). From there on, the show begins with a new antagonist, (whose name I cannot reveal, so I\u2019ll just call him \u2018K\u2019 for the rest of the review.). The story then becomes a detective story of the police force chasing \u2018K\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Psycho-Pass 2 is nowhere near as good as the first season. The reason for this comes from many different factors. The first, and in my opinion, the biggest contributing factor to the story\u2019s lousiness, comes from the fact that this season is only 11 episodes long, half of the first season.  That is the fundamental reason of why this story is flawed. 11 episodes is usually not enough time to create any detective story, let alone a complex one. This short length results in massive pacing problems which dampened my personal experience of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story aims to do too much in such a short span of time. In fact, it houses 4 arcs, in 11 episodes!\\n\r\nFirst there\u2019s the obligatory introduction that took 2 episodes. Then there\u2019s 3 other arcs, each of approximately 3 episodes(I won\u2019t go into detail since, you know, spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason as to why this story isn\u2019t good, is the change of writers between both seasons. While I won\u2019t blame the new writer for the bland story, I still think that keeping the same writers in both seasons would\u2019ve been the better choice. For reference the writer for the first season was Gen Urobuchi, the man responsible behind such shows like, Fate/Zero and Madoka Magika, while the new writer (for the script) was Jun Kumagai, who definitely did not have the same acclaim as Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I will say that the pacing and writing were bad, the story wasn\u2019t terrible, it had a few positives along with the negatives, for example, a both of the arcs in the middle were pretty good, even if they were rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story had good promise, and it did fine, but the execution did not reach expectations. With 11 more episodes, and a better writer, this problem could\u2019ve easily been avoided.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was something that I cannot complain about too much. The art style of the show remains relatively the same, following the saying the \u201cIf it isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe animation feels very fluent in all the scenes, and in scenes that had some blood in them this show went all out, similar to the first season. All the action and gore heavy scenes were the main highlights in the show, and even in scenes where nothing was really happening, the animation was still good. The opening and ending animations are also very well done.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I do have a few nitpicks. Sadly, the show still has the habit of making some human characters look stoned, mainly, Akane. Then there are the new character designs, which frankly, most of them look average to just bad. Even the main antagonist \u2018K\u2019 wasn\u2019t very threatening at all, far from the brilliantly designed Makashima from the first season. Even the new enforcers, didn\u2019t have that great of designs.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fault I find with the animation, is that the show rarely strays away from its comfort zone, meaning that the show doesn\u2019t take a lot of risks with its animation at all, in fact I\u2019d even go as far as to say that the animation did become a bit bland and tasteless at times.\\n\\n\r\nBut still these are mere nitpicks that aren\u2019t too noticeable, so honestly, the animation of the show is great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Psycho-Pass 2, while bearable, did not rectify the flaws that the soundtrack of the first season had. While I still like the soundtrack for both seasons, they just don\u2019t do that much for me. The soundtrack still lacks any track that I can listen to outside of the anime, excepting one or two tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, while the soundtrack is a bit tasteless; the opening and ending for this season were not.  Paired with some great animation, both the opening and ending are really good song that I rarely skipped over.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also do their jobs pretty well, both in the dub (which is airing currently) and the sub. The main problem with the sub (or dub) was the distinct lack of any outstanding voice actor, the main reason for this being the absence of Kougami and Makashima in this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the soundtrack was good, it wasn\u2019t up to par. The opening and ending are both very well done, and the voice actors are good, but sometimes feel a bit bland.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part where Psycho-Pass 2 lacked the most. The characters in the first season were all very well developed, and even the side characters had proper development. This season just threw that out the window and instead gave no development to any of the characters; aside from the one I hated the most.\\n\\n\r\nA big fault I find with the show\u2019s characters is that none of the side characters were given any respect by the writers. One of the main reasons I loved the first season is because of the side characters and their development, but this season just doesn\u2019t do that. \\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not the biggest problem, far from it. The biggest problem this show\u2019s characters have is the main characters, including the main antagonist \u2018K\u2019. The main characters comprise of \u2018K\u2019, Akane, the new enforcer Tougane, and the new inspector Mika. None of these characters are developed well, at all. \\n\\n\r\n1. Akane Tsunemori:-  Akane is the main character for both the first and second seasons of Psycho-Pass. Her character was first introduced (in the first season) as a young learning inspector. By the beginning of the second season, her character had matured, and she has learned to handle situations much more efficiently. But this leads to the problem in the second season. Her character had already developed to extreme heights. Thus, her development in the second season is practically non-existent.\\n\\n\r\n2. Sakuya Tougane:- Tougane is the new enforcer in division 1 (Akane\u2019s Division). His character acts as a \u201creplacement\u201d for the absence of Kougami. .. And that\u2019s pretty much all I can reveal about him, mainly because most of the rest of his character is a gigantic spoiler. But even though he has a large role in the story, his character doesn\u2019t change throughout the show. His character seems like more of a plot-device than an actual character.\\n\\n\r\n3. \u2018K\u2019:- \u2018K\u2019 is the main antagonist that we learn more about as the show progresses. Now, without spoiling anything, the main criticism I have against him is his goal. His goal, to me, seems extremely basic, and at times I feel that it is uninspired.\\n\\n\r\n4. Mika:- Now, for Mika. Mika is the absolute worst character in this show. By far. Her attitude to both enforcers and Akane herself is complete disrespect, and she believes that all that the Sybil decides is correct. Even to the extent that she would disobey her own superiors. But the most annoying thing about her character is that she was the only person who had potential to improve as a character, but she doesn\u2019t. Her character could\u2019ve easily matured in a way similar to how Akane\u2019s character matured in the first season, and unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, by the end of the show, none of the characters really developed well. The side characters weren\u2019t given any development, and the main characters are either developed very little, or they aren\u2019t developed at all. This lack of development could also be blamed on the short length of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did rag on the show a lot, I must admit that during my time watching it I really did have a good time. Even when the show ripped itself apart during the final arc, I did enjoy it, albeit, for the wrong reasons. The 2 major flaws that dampened my enjoyment, was the hilariously bad story, and the annoying piece of trash, that was Mika.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Brilliant setting\\n\r\n-Very good animation\\n\r\n-Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n-Enjoyable to a certain degree\\n\r\n-The 2 arcs in the middle were very good\\n\r\n-Good opening and ending\\n\r\n-Good Sub as well as Sub\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Disappointment in comparison to the first season\\n\r\n-Bland and hastily written story\\n\r\n-The lack of Kougami could disappoint some people\\n\r\n-The main villain wasn\u2019t good\\n\r\n-Character development is non-existent\\n\r\n-Terrible pacing\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Overall, the show was a huge let-down to people who liked the first season. It\u2019s small number of episodes leads to the bad pacing, as well as the lack of character development. The main villain didn\u2019t have a very interesting goal, and the side characters were completely ignored. For people who are expecting Kougami in this season don\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t even physically appear in the show. The animation of the show is great, and the soundtrack is decent. I enjoyed it while I was watching it, and I think most people will too. As long as you don\u2019t think about it, you\u2019ll at least enjoy it. Thus, this leads me to giving this show a rating of:-\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:- 6.2/10",

            "content": "As a preface, this \"review\" focuses a lot more on the differences and relations between the first and second season, and not so much on this season as its own thing. At the same time, these are my thoughts on why I think a follow-up can never be as good as the first season (it's a long read).\r\n-------------------------\r\nI want to start this off by saying that I absolutely love the original Psycho-Pass. The journey into the human psyche, the dark mood looming over the story itself, and the intense development seen in all the characters all contribute to what\u2019s come to be one of mypersonal favorites of all time. In the same vein, Makishima is one of my favorite antagonists, because he feels like such a real character, especially when it comes to anime in general. His motivations are far beyond that of \u201cjust being evil\u201d, and the sort of intelligent personality he presents is as enjoyable as ever. Then there is the society itself, or rather, Sibyl. As a concept, this is a really awesome sci-fi society, and even in execution, it works surprisingly well. This is, I think, largely because of how Sibyl interacts with Makishima. \\n\\n\r\nIf we momentarily remove Makishima (and any others like him) from the equation, what we\u2019re left with would pretty much be an episodic detective-series, focusing on tracking down individual criminals. This is not necessarily bad, but it lacks the same overarching feeling of grandeur and darkness as with a mastermind connecting each case. However, it technically isn\u2019t possible, because of the way Sibyl works. It could be interesting, and definitely gruesome, but ultimately, I feel like it\u2019d severely lack in terms of writing. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Makishima - the criminally asymptomatic. The entire system is now thrown into chaos. How do you deal with a problem like this, when you are so reliant on the system to do things for you? Should you circumvent the system to remove the threat, even if it means you may slip into darkness yourself? These are all questions asked by Psycho-Pass, and they make for very interesting story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThen comes Psycho-Pass 2, a sequel I think many of us wanted, because who doesn\u2019t want more of their favorite series?, but at the same time something we dreaded, as a sequel would pose quite a few issues in terms of writing. The biggest one, and the one I\u2019m focusing on here, is the fact that they\u2019ve written themselves into a corner, of sorts. It\u2019s not a corner in the sense that they need to do something drastic to get out, but rather that the only way forward is further into the same corner. To clarify, I\u2019m talking about the fact that the original series leaves very little to work with in terms of a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you create such a massive world in fiction, you place upon yourself a responsibility to stick to the rules that you have created. In Psycho-Pass, the highest \u201crule\u201d of all is how Sibyl works, and what it does. If you really think about it, how many (good) scenarios can you come up with, that\u2019s not too similar to that of the original series? Because Sibyl is nearly omnipotent, it creates this setting where only those unable to be judged, in one way or another, are able to act as worthwhile antagonists, which leaves little in terms of variation. What this means, is that we have to ask ourselves \u201care we okay with such a similar setup, or will it simply be too much of the same?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWith Kamui being the antagonist in Psycho-Pass 2, they\u2019ve succumbed to the fact that this is the only way, but have tried to change it up by changing the very way Kamui functions, in contrast to Makishima. Instead of being able to remain at a constantly low crime-coefficient, Kamui is outright unable to even be detected by the system itself. While this, together with the way he operates on his \u201cmissions\u201d, still provides a good story, we\u2019re once again forced to ask ourselves if continuing this series is truly a good idea. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story itself, I want to quote reddit user /u/Redcrimson who I feel really captured the feeling of this season, to an extent. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt's grimdark for its own sake, with twists that undermine its own narrative, and exists just to be violent and shocking with no greater resonance with the thematic throughlines or characters established in S1.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile my opinions on this season may not perfectly align with his, the points he makes are undeniably accurate. When watching this second season, you\u2019ll quickly notice that there are a lot more (gory) deaths spread out everywhere in the show, and as a result, we viewers will (most likely) become sort of desensitized to the deaths of characters, because we simply see it way too much. This, I think, is a huge step back from the first season, where every death got, at least from me, almost the same \u201coh shit\u201d reaction. The deformation, into the explosion, and the remaining characters taking their time to really take in what had just happened. It all felt really well done, and now that there\u2019s death around every corner, it has simply lost that feeling.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is this a bad thing because we don\u2019t care as much about characters dying in general, but it also affects our view of characters directly. Notable mention of Kamui here. Having a character as calm and collected as Kamui, suddenly killing an entire room full of people (albeit not without reason) does not make me fear him as a character. I\u2019m not on the edge of my seat in every one of his scenes, hoping he doesn\u2019t snap and kill the others with him. I think, when a character makes every kill symbolic - actually meaningful in some way - it gives this almost fearful feeling towards that character. Not because he\u2019s scary, but because it makes you fear for the others, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this season does offer a few new things, even if they don\u2019t drastically impact the general gist of the story. Examples here are Tougane and his backstory, Shimotsuki\u2019s rivalry with Akane going too far, and so on. These all add an extra level of tension to the writing, which I think is pretty needed, what with the aforementioned issues. In the same manner, I think the upcoming movie may end up good, since it supposedly doesn\u2019t involve Sibyl in the same way. Though at the same time, it\u2019s hard not to think that maybe that should\u2019ve just been the second season to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I want to say that even with all this, I don\u2019t really think this is a bad season. I definitely think it could\u2019ve been skipped, in favor of the movie, which actually changes things up, and there are a lot of things I think they\u2019ve done much worse (the overly tense writing, too dark for the sake of being dark, and some characters), and it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near as good as the first season was, but if you\u2019re a fan of Psycho-Pass as a whole, I think you\u2019ll still very much enjoy the second season.",

            "content": "*EDIT* I just finished watching so.. I'm here to clarify my final observation of this show. *May contain some spoilers*\r\nI watched Psycho Pass last year and it was damn amusing. It is sure on my list of top anime. Hearing that the second season is airing this year, I was exhilarated. But does the new season offer something of the same value, or even better than the first season? \r\nStory 6/10\r\nShort summary: Our main protagonist Akane Tsunemori has learned more about Sibyl System in the first season of what it really is, how it works, what's behind it. With her partner Shinya Kogami going missing,she worked with new acquaintances in new team formation. As an inspector in the police force, she has to work out solving crimes that causes the Area Stress to increase and threaten people's Hue, but something is off. The culprit, even though they are doing something unethical, are unable to be judged by the Dominator. What is actually happening? \\n\\n\r\nThe second season unfortunately doesn't have the luxury of the first season as the duration has been cut in half - they only got 11 episodes to play with. \\n\\n\r\nI would say this season has too much on its plate. \\n\r\nFirst: there are a lot of new characters, means they need introduction, what is their backstory, motivation, etc. so they will appeal to us. \\n\r\nSecond: the problems in the series are rather complicated, layered and linked to one another. There are inconsistencies with season 1 regarding the facts of Dominator, the scans and Sibyl System also unnecessary plot branches that doesn't make sense (read: the Toganes). If anything, they make a lot of plot holes and makes me confused. \\n\\n\r\nAs the result, I'd say... the ending is not satisfying for me. The last few episodes did answer my questions that rises as I watch the series, you could say \"all is well\". But I think they could do this season so much better. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nYou can expect the same quality of art and animation from the second season. If anything, I find it more colorful. Very rich... compared to the darker palette in first season. I'm not sure whether is it due to the big question \"What color?\" which is imposed again and again in the series. The animation is smooth, sasuga Production IG doing their best again.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOne um.. 3 words: I LOVE IT! The opening Enigmatic Feeling is pumping and catchy, and a revelation: the meaning of the lyrics (the TV size ver.) fits with the theme of the show, mostly about Akane's feeling towards Sibyl System. The ending Fallen is my jam.. It's good to have Ling tosite sigure and EGOIST doing opening and ending for this season as well. It's been a while since I watched the first season, at least they keep the same spirit with the same artists. \\n\\n\r\nSeiyuus are good as well, their voices matches the character they are playing. Still having the same ones for characters from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nAkane has grown. She is cooler, more observant and acting more like a leader now, but she still has heart and cares for the Enforcers. She experienced more emotional roller coaster here, you can see more of her expression.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of events and incidents happened in the first season, eliminating quite a number of the original team formation. Hence, there are a new characters to replace the missing positions. I like some of them (cough Hinakawa~). I'm glad that Saiga-san are still here as well, at least Akane has someone reliable to think and discuss logically. But I really despise the new inspector Shimotsuki. She poses on the different perspective from Akane. Yeah, she's annoying. But she's a realistic character - wants to bring others down but is such a coward. I do know some people who acts like her. \\n\\n\r\nTogane... another character I don't like. He is very gray (not that I don't like people in gray area, but there's this feeling that makes me don't like him when he appears) in most of the show until his true color and who he really is got revealed in the end. This revelation however, makes me despise him even further, like WTF?\\n\\n\r\nBecause Makishima in the previous season is such an intriguing antagonist, the crew for season 2 have the burden to show us a better antagonist. Unfortunately I find the main villain Kamui Kirito is not on par with Makishima, although they make him so overpowered with many specialized skills and complicated issues about his existence. After the past he had gone through, I can understand his objectives for his existence and 'color' to be recognized by Sibyl. But it doesn't justify the crimes he did in this show to test how Dominators and Sibyl System works. I just don't get how he thinks.\\n\r\nHowever the production crew decided to mess things even further, so he's not the only antagonist in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMost, if not all, new characters suffer from lack of development and exploration. Very few (except for Togane and Kamui) has been revealed about their backstory and motivation, making it quite hard to relate and feel for them. Even returning characters Ginoza and Yayoi has very little screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe design are good for some (I like Ginoza without glasses ^^) but erm Shimotsuki's face looks too closely like Akane, just sporting different hairstyle. In the earlier episodes I have difficulty differentiating them if their hairstyles are not seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nDespite holes here and there, inconsistencies (mostly about facts and Sibyl System itself) with first season and lacking in characterization, well, I admit I still enjoyed this show, with its adrenaline pump with gritting cliffhangers. It is an interesting pick on Sibyl System which is not as perfect as it seems (and assumes), and some parts makes me think along. But it's soooo bloody. A freaking level up from the previous season. I'm not a fan of gore, so it comes off as too disturbing at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 + Personal Comment\\n\r\nThe less number of episodes makes the show more straightforward and rushed - cutting down the interaction and time developing on characters, focusing solely on solving the crime and catching the culprit. It feeds us confusion after confusion up to episode 7, but especially in episode 8 explanations and revelations started to be thrown at you. Not the best way to uncover a mystery in my opinion, but rather effective due to their runtime. \\n\r\nIt's still acceptable as a series with such quality animation, but... I prefer the first season.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWell, what started as a massive disappointment was able to somewhat redeem itself towards the end, thankfully, only to completely collapse yet again. I think it's hard to debate that at least the first half of the highly anticipated Psycho Pass 2 was a complete and utter failure; I referred to it as criminal, unbelievable, sickening and disgusting. An absolute butchering. Psycho Pass 2 was on pace to be the biggest disappointment I\u2019ve ever had in my entire anime watching career, and still might be. Of course, I expected there to be some serious growing pains with the staff of this anime consideringthe mass exodus it had experienced since last time, with a massive number of previous team members leaving after the first season (including lead writer Gen Urobuchi). NOTHING, however, prepared me for THIS. The plot is clumsy and shallow, the characters are shadows of their original selves (or gone entirely), and the animation is laughably directed and significantly downgraded. This is the definition of a bad sequel. Ladies and Gentleman: Psycho Pass 2:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: After learning \u201cthe truth\u201d, Inspector Akane Tsunemori continues to try to maintain peace in her nameless utopian society, where a new threat has emerged: A man named Kamui threatens to tear down the Sibyl System once and for all and expose it for what it truly is by turning peace and order into complete chaos.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I normally start a review by discussing the plot, I\u2019m just going to get right to meat of the primary reason why Psycho Pass 2 is had such a different feel to the first which resulted in its inferiority: The characters. The original cast of Psycho Pass was loaded with memorable characters, such as Kougami, Makishima, Ginoza, Akane, and more. This was a legitimately interesting cast because all of them were treated with the time and attention necessary to properly flesh them out. Each had a personality, each had motivations, and each one added a lot the show. However, everything that the original did right, the sequel does very wrong. This anime fails not only to build upon the pieces it had in place, but it supremely fails to show us who any of the new characters are. Until very late. Psycho Pass 2 bombards us with a slew of new faces who we know nothing about, and doesn't cares to let us know who the hell those faces are until it's too late to give the time and attention necessary to make them good characters. This makes the way they think, why they think that way, what their motivations are, their identities, or anything else that we would need to know about a good character all feel half-assed. They feel completely soulless. Hell, the show doesn\u2019t even have the courtesy to give some of them any personalities at all beyond the most basic stereotypes in anime! Now I know what you\u2019re thinking: At least we still have Akane, Ginoza, and Kogami to fall back on, right? Hahaha\u2026 Wrong. \\n\\n\r\nShinya Kougami? Gone. He\u2019s not even in the sequel at all for reasons I can\u2019t even begin to fathom. However, to be honest, I wish Akane and Ginoza weren\u2019t in the show either, because then at least I wouldn\u2019t have to witness them be butchered right before my eyes. Akane Tsunemori, one my favorite female characters in anime, has been reduced to the most boring and uninteresting excuse for a thriller protagonist I\u2019ve seen in my entire life (until very late, I suppose). She has been completely disconnected from the audience. She no longer shows any emotion what so ever and has a personality comparable to a ham sandwich. I know that she was supposed to become a colder character because of her development in the first season, but she has become so distant from the viewers that we simply have no clue what is even going through her head anymore, making it impossible to relate to her. Remember the intriguing inner monologues we got from her in season one that made her really likable and sympathizable? Gone. The only inner monologues she gets this time are plot related and exist only to spew exposition or explain plot events. Not ONCE does the show touch on her inner conflict and how she can\u2019t decide what to make of the Sibbyl System! Let me repeat that using more clear phrasing: THE MOST VITAL ASPECT TO BOTH THE PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FROM THE FIRST SEASON IS GONE ENTIRELY. But hey, even worse than that is what the show does with Ginoza, or rather, what they fail to do with him. One of the most dynamic characters in the original might as well not be in this one at all; he has done nothing. Said nothing. Contributed nothing. If he didn\u2019t exist at all, nothing about the show would be even remotely different. The character chemistry between all of the characters in season one? Gone as well. Ginoza and Akane both NEVER have a SINGLE conversation that\u2019s not related to the plot or exposition; not a SINGLE one! Coming off the awesome chemistry between Akane and Kougami, as well as others, this is an unfathomable downgrade. How are we suppose to emotionally connect with anything that happens in the show is we know NOTHING about what the characters are thinking or feeling (again, until very late)? If the characters don\u2019t care, neither does the audience. That\u2019s story telling 101, and as far as we are concerned, the characters don\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nOh hoho, but I\u2019m STILL not done ripping this cast of characters new one. That\u2019s right: THREE paragraphs dedicated to characters alone. That\u2019s a new record. The one thing I haven\u2019t talked about yet is the antagonist: Kamui. Stepping in for Shougo Makishima, one of the most compelling antagonists in recent memory, he had big shoes to fill. If you\u2019re picking up on the trend that\u2019s occurring here, you can probably guess that he doesn\u2019t even come close to filling them. For more than half of the show, we don\u2019t have the slightest clue who he is, what his motivations are, or even what his end goal is. This is literally the complete opposite of what we are used to; Makishima had clearly defined motivations and goals, making the show a matter of questioning whether or not he was justified. With Kamui, he's just a mystery box until all of his ideals and goals are spunrg upon like some sort of asspull. I don't think it's debatable that the method they used in season 1 was far, far superior. Kamui comes across for quite awhile as just a bad guy wrecking havoc for reasons that we can only guess, and for a show that is supposed to be about grey morality, that's not okay. Even though his motivations and goals are eventually reveled, nothing can change the fact that he was a blatantly awful antagonist for the majority of the anime. When it comes to characters, Psycho Pass 2 stands firmly as a major fuck up.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has also seen a massive downgrade from what we are used to, as the once heart-throbbing thriller feels like nothing but a collection of random violence for the purposes of shock factor in the form of a perpetual attempt for the show to 1-up itself with each passing episode until the final stretch, all under the narrative of a carbon copy of season 1's exact same plotline. While the original Psycho Pass had a lot of time dedicated to world building and character development, the sequel says fuck all that, let\u2019s blow shit up. We see tons of blood, guts, and gore go flying across the screen, this time in quantities exponentially higher than what we ever saw in season one. The problem? \u2026Nobody cares. I find myself unable to give a damn about anything that\u2019s happening on screen, simply because the people dying are a bunch of nobodies. When someone dies in an anime, it\u2019s supposed to be a big deal! It\u2019s supposed to drive the plot forward and seriously affect the characters! Here? Massive numbers of people dying is an every episode occurrence. It\u2019s not shocking anymore, it\u2019s not entertaining anymore, it\u2019s not moving the plot forward, it\u2019s not developing the characters, so WHY IS IT HAPPENING?! Granted, the show eventually does manage to cut this crap out and actually get to the point, but it just feels like too little too late. Honestly, it's almost so jarring when the show gets to the point that it doesn't even feel natural; it comes completely out of left field. This is especially a problem because season 2 tried to shift from a character driven show to a plot driven one, and when a plot driven show has a terrible plot, it can only devolve into a trainwreck. If you can stick it out, you are rewarded with a very solid series of episodes that actually touches upon character motivations and the morality of Sibbyl, y'know, what the ENTIRE show should have focussed on in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I have left to talk about is the animation. The original Psycho Pass had some of the most incredible animation I had seen in my entire life; certainly in my top 3 all time favorite uses of animation. With that in mind, you can imagine my surprise when Psycho Pass 2\u2019s animation looked not better, not the same, but worse. Significantly worse. While it still looks GOOD, I suppose, it\u2019s nowhere near what is used to be, which was GREAT. Whoever the new art director is for this show seriously fucked up. The first thing wrong with the animation is the drastic change in color pallet; it hardly looks like the same show anymore! The original show used a mix of bright blues/whites and blacks for the environments to create a beautiful contrast and really give off the aura of a futuristic, utopian society; it worked beautifully. The second season, on the other hand, is all over the damn place. Sometimes it uses reds and oranges (for some reason), sometimes it uses the old blues, sometimes it uses something completely different. There is no consistency what so ever! The sky will be one color is one shot, and then a completely different color in the next one. There is no attention to detail what so ever! The backgrounds, once bursting at the seams with objects and completely filled out, are now completely barren. It feels rushed, lazy, and passionless. In fact, the shot composition in general is absolutely terrible. So many poor decisions have been made about the angles, lighting, and settings that I couldn\u2019t count them if I tried. Again, the animation is still good compared to other anime, but it is a shadow of its original self.\\n\\n\r\nWell, there's no question that Psycho Pass 2 did not live up to the original. While I may have called this a travesty or a worse-case scenario at some point, it does manage to significantly improve. If you were a fan of season 1, I won't particularly recommend or NOT recommend watch the sequel; it's up to you. Just make sure you go in with low expectations. This anime could have been so much more, but we got we got I suppose. Such is life.",

            "content": "I'll try to keep it short and simple.\r\nStory: 2/10.\r\nThe main antagonist Kamui's motives are never very interesting, and seeing as how that's the whole thing moving the story that is a huge problem.  Not to mention that the ending makes the whole plot irrelevant.  I can't go into more detail without spoiling it, but if Sibyl had just done some upkeep on itself and taken out the trash, Kamui would have never done any of the things he did.  Sibyl is horrifically stupid in this series, reduced from a morally ambiguous but effective system in S1 to an evil and dumb-as-shit systemin S2.  There is nothing to care about except Akane, but we'll get to that in the Character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10.\\n\r\nPassable at best.  While it never had the QUALITY art some of the later episodes of S1 had, it just felt uninspired.  The cinematography was lacking and there was no decent animation of note whatsoever, save the OP.  TatsuPro is clearly an inferior studio to I.G. in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10.\\n\r\nThe OP is really great if you can enjoy that style of music.  Great visuals and a fitting song to boot.  And there's this one scene where opera music is playing and it's ridiculous how seriously the show's taking itself.  But that's about it.  There aren't any memorable tracks from the OST.  At very best they just blend into the background.  I guess the ED is okay too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10.\\n\r\nGinoza is listed as a \"main character\" on MAL's database here.  What a joke.  He has been neutered so much and matters so little to the story at all that they might as well have killed him off in episode 1 for some shock value.  So Ginoza's bland, okay, that doesn't ruin the whole series.  But when your main antagonist is also bland and boring that is problematic.  In fact, there is not a single interesting character in this entire show except Akane.  But Akane is not developed or played with in an interesting way, she's just likable because we got to know her in S1 and they didn't screw her up too badly.  If the best thing you have to say about any one of a show's characters is \"they maintained her status quo\", then that's not great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10.\\n\r\nAt least it wasn't boring enough I wanted to turn it off.  But I'm biased because I really like futuristic settings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10.\\n\r\nIf the plot's crap and the characters are crap and the art's crap and the sound's crap there's not much left to watch for.  If you want to watch the movie when it comes out (which is being done by Production I.G. and written by Urobuchi, unlike this garbage!) then just read a summary of this online to save your time.  Not much even happened so you'll be fine.",

            "content": "Somebody needs to tell these producers that it's not okay to replace character development and a real plotline with blood and brains spewing all over the place. Psycho-Pass 2 was literally gore galore, and I can't say I was too happy about it, either. Honestly, I saw more Lethal Dominator (ab)use in one episode than I did for practically the entirety of the first season, and the exploding heads and bodies things just kind of got lame after the first 30 times it happened... \r\nSo yeah, flying bloody body parts aside, I have to say that Psycho-Pass season 2 was a really big letdown forme. Was there a single aspect of the original series that didn't go wrong in this season? As it turns out, the answer is no. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot continues along the same vein of the first season, but struggles and ultimately fails to encompass new ideas about the Sibyl System. The way things were set up in the first season, I was actually expecting Akane to do something about Sibyl in this sequel. Instead of that, all we got were a bunch of strange paradoxical theories and conspiracies that really had no bearing on the show's themes anyway. Jouji's speeches were so confusing and so incredibly irrelevant to the point that I wanted to spew blood everywhere whenever he started talking. \\n\\n\r\nActually, I take that back. The only part of the show that actually got me seriously wanting to vomit blood was the cast. Half the characters were boring as hell, and the other half were just ... there. \\n\\n\r\nLike, come on: Saiga Jouji makes his reappearance for half of the episodes but it's so obvious that he was just stuck into the story so he could make the plot move. You have Hinakawa, Kagari's completely inferior and practically useless replacement, whose only defining moment was the scene where he called Akane 'big sister'. You have Ginoza, who's a complete disconnect from his character in the first season. He lost his personality along with his glasses, and has a grand total of about 20 lines throughout the whole show. And then you have Shimotsuki Mika, the one character that everybody wanted to strangle to death within the first 10 minutes of episode 1, and really didn't do anything except crap her pants in front of Togane a couple of times and cry a lot. \\n\\n\r\nTogane was actually pretty interesting, up until they butchered his backstory and dragged him down with that mockery of a season finale. I have to admit, I already was slightly peeved at him from the beginning because he was obviously Kougami's replacement (and what was with Kougami's smoke-spectre visiting Akane all the time, anyway?) but besides having the highest recorded Crime Coefficient in history, he didn't actually end up doing anything that interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, let's talk about Akane. Out of all the characters, she was the biggest disappointment for me - her character was stale, predictable, and showed no development throughout the series. Even after seeing her grandmother's ear in a box and discovering just how screwed up Sibyl is, none of her previous beliefs were even slightly shaken. Yeah, I get that she's supposed to be grown-up and badass, but that doesn't mean that she also has to have the emotional range of a rock. I wanted to see her scream, lose her temper, do something besides act like some frigid, stereotypically perfect police officer poster child that is definitely not the Akane that I know and love from season one. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation and sound were all average. The OP was pretty cool, but all it did was get my hopes up for the season, especially after that one shot with Kougami tied to the chair. Not sure what relevance that had to the show, seeing as we never actually saw him. Hmm. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked the first season of Psycho-Pass, I would not recommend watching the second one. Besides feeling clipped due to its 11 episode length and having the most melodramatic season finale I've ever seen for such a hyped-up sequel, the characters are not up to par and the plot is confusing and over-complicated. Unless watching people burn alive to the tune of opera music is your kind of thing, I would recommend steering clear of Psycho-Pass 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: This has some minor spoilers from the first season and this season. Be careful. You've been warned.\r\n\"What colour am I?\"\r\nPsycho Pass, One of my faviroute anime's of all time. I loved the first season and as you see on my list I gave the first season a straight 10! Now the show has returned but this time its not gonna be by Production I.G., the makers of the first which sucks. Instead by TOHO animation, the good news is that a movie is coming soon and thats by Production I.G. (Yay) This meant that the script and animation was gonna be different, which wasbad but shockingly this turned out well... The story was as good and more fucked up whereas the animation....well it got dumbed down which was dissapointing. The characters and developements are good but some characters are left out. And the soundtrack is just amazing as usual.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: 8/10\\n\r\nI gotta hand it to TOHO at first this seemed like S1 with a few changes but instead later on the story progesses and gets more fucked up as we find out more. At first this just seemed like some special but as it progesses it just gets better, like trust me don\"t drop this on its first episode 9(Not saying it was bad.)\\n\\n\r\nThis story takes place a year and a half later after the first one and this time Akane is more calm and has the behaviour like Kougami, it isn't boring in any way but she feels like this MC you can seriously trust. At times we might see glimpses of her either being her old clumsy-self when she started or she gets glimpses of Kougami which help calm her down. This is very intresting and shows that Akane hasn't fully changed.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have a new villain called Kirito and is he evil and loved to hate like Mikishama. Abso-fucking-lutely, He's a more screwed up version of Mikishima, he's not in anyway better but a good replacement. Kirito is a mysterious killer who's a master in drugs and knows ways of making people's psycho passes clear by using well drugs. Remember kids, winners don't do drugs *winks*, now back to Kirito, we later find out things about him that just make the story so much more tense, he's a smartass, he knows what he's doing and that is how he is as good as Mikishima. \\n\\n\r\nSo the gang has to take down this fool before he does more crazy shiz. This is a very intresting plot, We're also introduced to 3 new characters, I'll give some brief stuff about them, first off we have Sakuya, this guy is pretty much Kougami but the evil version, she wants to turn Akane into an enforcer and finds pretty smart ways of attempts of doing this. Then you have Mika, a bitch, she calls everyone either junior, dumb or just an enforcer whn she dosen't know what everyone has been through, she easily hatable and you want her to die badly. Then you have Hinkawa, shy but smart, he's only in the story to help out with the twists which makes him pretty dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nI'm dissapointed in the art here, in the first season we had BUUUTIFUL animation with so much detail, and now we have this meh and average animation, It's not a huge dissapointment but it just sucks that this was more bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is so well done and so memroble. The OP is just orgasms to your ears while the ED is this haunting tune. Easily some of the best openings and endings of this season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment here comes from the tense action scenes with a lot of killing, the plotwists here you will not see coming, like seriously, there are a bunch which will make you just drop your jaw.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the first season of this you'll definitly enjoy this. A movie is coming soon and a 3rd season? We're not really sure. The ending here is pretty good and wraps everything up in a nice little bowtie, it really makes it worth watching the show. This is probably my 3rd faviroute show this season.\\n\\n\r\nRating: My hue has turned pitch black from how tense this was.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first season of Psycho-Pass was a real treat for the eyes and the mind, as it encouraged its watcher to ponder questions of morality as well as who really was the \"good guys\". The follow up to the hit series is no longer penned by Urobuchi, but is the sequel  still able to stand up on its own two feet? This is a mostly spoiler free review, and I will not talk much about the main antagonist due to the high spoiler content.\r\nThe series begins in a similar vein to the original just a year and a half later, it reintroduces the maincharacters and the rules of the  Sibyl System as well as the Dominator, and shows us the new characters for this season. Right away we are introduced to the integral question of Psycho-Pass 2, \"What Color?'. Anyone familiar with the Sibyl System knows that this a particularly intriguing question, as color is everything in this world. Those that lack the proper color are killed or are sent away to facilities to be rehabilitated, where they wish they were dead. This bleak overtone characterizes the Psycho-Pass series as a whole, and continues to the second season. This season also has a significant more amount of bloodshed, as in the first season it was a real treat to get to see someone active lethal eliminator mode, in the the sequel people are firing thar lazer every episode. The antagonist of this season is very similar to Makishima in his behind the scene operations as well as his \"transparency\". I wish they could have fleshed out another type of problem with the Sibyl system instead of going with a very similar plot. The secondary antagonist is actually much more interesting than the main \"bad guy\", and the reveal of what he truly is as well as his actions is kind of shocking to see. The second plot has an overarching theme of science and advancements that have gone too far, and that just because it may be possible to do something doesn't always mean it should be done, and the moral and physical consequences could be disastrous. The story was not as strong as the first and relied heavily on similar themes, but it had high notes specifically during the middle arc of the show where the action and the mystery really picked up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the series once again looks wonderful, but appears slightly more bleak this time, possibly to match the darker tone as well as the accompanying bloodshed. The art of the opening was kind of jarring to watch, and I found myself skipping the opening because its just images repeated over and over. A contrast from the first series, where i thoroughly enjoyed both openings and the endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are Psycho Pass are quite good for the most part, with some exceptions. Akane is back as the lead protagonist, and its nice to see her grow without Kogami helping her out. She still clings to her clear hue and strong sense of morality and justice in the first season, still refusing to activate that Dominator when its in Lethal mode. She shows off her skills as a detective and is pushed to the breaking point several times, but always manages to keep her cool and work towards a morally right decision.  She seems to be cracking a bit, as she has picked up a smoking habit, but otherwise its the a more mature Akane we saw at the end of the first series.\\n\r\nHowever her partner Shimotsuki, who fans of the original will recognize from an earlier arc and the final episode, does not fare as well. I'm going to be frank, she is one of the most annoying characters I've seen in a while. All she does is question Akane and whine for the whole series, and treats her enforcers like crap. She does have some great intuition about one of the villains, but in the end just manages getting herself drawn up into something she can't handle until Akane has to rescue her ungrateful ass. One of the new enforcers Togane is introduced as a competent enforcer who performs well in the field, and is trusted by Akane. It pains me to say that Ginoza's presence is greatly diminished, as his fall from grace in the first season made him an interesting character to watch, and I wanted to see more of his adjustment as an Enforcer. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the second season of Psycho Pass, but it was a very different mindset from the first, which seemed much more thought out and meticulous. I was put off by the first episode, but found that the season recovered and the middle arc was easily the best part of the show, as the ending was a little lackluster after the big reveal. Psycho Pass 2 is a solid series, but unfortunately does not hold a candle to its first series. Its a fun show to watch that will make you think and try to shock you with excessive imagery, both doesn't really try to break through the bar that was set by the first series\\n",

            "content": "TLDR; Solid show, does not live up to first season.\r\nPsycho Pass 2 has me feeling conflicted. As much as I adored the first season, and still enjoyed this one, I'm feeling quite empty about it afterwards. I'm not left with that same feeling of shock and awe like after season 1, and the biggest issue for me is obvious: characters.\r\nI loved the cast of season 1; Kogami (absent in PP2) and Akane were an excellent dynamic duo of complex characters. Instead, Akane doesn't truly have that same counterpart. The complexity of Shogo Makishima is replaced with a promising-but-falls-short Kirito Kamui, who, although seems to bean intriguing antagonist, can't find a proper place in the anime. The development of enforcers is completely lackluster as well; there is no new development in characters like Ginoza, and big bad Togane feels awfully tacked on as a surprise antagonist (as well as Misako). Enforcers like Sho Hinakawa show tremendous potential as character, but receive little to no screen time in each episode. They more serve as plot advancement devices instead of characters. Shimotsuki also feels awfully tacked on in the advancement of enforcer Togane. These reasons all tend to leave me feeling disconnected from the characters and therefore the show.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else, in all honesty, is great to perfect. The unravelling of the grand scheme is excellent, although leaves more to be desired, particularly Sibyl's end resolutions feeling very rushed. Art is beautiful and sound is magnificent. \"Enigmatic Feeling\" is perhaps coming close in my favorite OPs, and the outro is well done as well. Characters and dominators look aesthetically stunning, animation is fluid, and character artwork is unique. The characters themselves, despite my enjoyment of Akane as a protagonist, are the downfall of this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 7. PP2 features beautiful animation and intriguing story which is subsequently thrashed by severe voids in the characters. A fun, but somewhat less memorable installment, especially compared to its predecessor.",

            "content": "Psycho-Pass 2, like many other sequels, tries to top its predecessor with more blood, more torture and more revelations, only to ultimately forget why the audience enjoyed the original in the first place.\r\nTo say that Psycho-Pass 2 didn't have its high point would be false, as the series can still, at the very least, serve as an enjoyable sci-fi action series. However, because the story was constantly trying to shock the audience,  many individual episodes didn't contribute much to the story. The early episodes are almost complete copies of those in the first Psycho-Pass, but on a broader scale. Perhaps the series was tryingto re-immerse the audience in this \"utopian\" society, but as this series came out only a year and a half after the first Psycho-Pass, this seems highly redundant. It tries to make up for the lack of mystery encompassing the setting with new characters and higher stakes, but the gravity of the situation never feels earned. \\n\\n\r\nThese new characters are disappointingly hollow, with only Togane (and arguably Shimotsuki, but the less said about her the better) standing out; to make matters worse, old characters like Ginoza and Shion are side-lined. However, there is one major positive- Akane Tsunemori is now a strong, intelligent and believable heroine. Her actions, be they good or bad, normally feel quite natural, based on her past and present situation. She doesn't act pretentious or egotistic, and her likable character makes this lacklustre cast more bearable. Kamui doesn't approach Makishima in terms of presence, memorability or even intrigue. Lacking in charisma and having to rely on tasteless gore to stand-out, he isn't anything that hasn't been seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of falling short of the original, the animation quality certainly isn't up to par, despite this series being half its length. Generally opting for generic backgrounds and over utilising CGI, this series is quite a disappointment production wise, particularly from the acclaimed Production I.G., though still slightly above average. The colour palette wasn't tasteful either, with an unusual amount of orange (which, as Aldnoah Zero viewers would know, is difficult to like) contrasting the stronger crimsons and blues applied in the first series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was appropriate, with the score generally suiting the scene. The application of bombastic classical music did unfortunately ruin one scene, though that scene's writing was so shoddy that Yoko Kanno probably couldn't have saved it. The opening wasn't too pleasant, with enough jarring repeat shots to induce an epileptic fit. The singer's voice definitely isn't to my taste, and I would have much preferred if \"Nothing Carved in Stone\" returned for the opening. The ending, however, was one of my favourites from 2014, though the lack of visually interesting material prevented it from rising to the level of Zankyo no Terror's ending.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this sequel was watchable. It had a couple of interesting characters, above-average animation and a fantastic ending song. Unfortunately, it squandered its potential with the poor utilisation of its cast, shoving unearned tragedy and gore in the audience's faces, and failing to capitalise on its predecessor's success. It isn't particularly memorable, or intelligent, but those looking for some light, R-Rated entertainment should walk away satisfied.",

            "content": "*Note: Review written under the assumption that readers have watched the original Psycho-Pass. If not, proceed with a spoiler warning*\r\nIn a world where an entity judges your mental condition, there ought to be a couple of problems. Psycho-Pass 2 investigates one in particular, how can you judge a group of individuals when you are the same type of group yourself? If you brand them negatively, doesn't that just mirror yourself?\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nThe MWPSB are working on a case different from anyone they've encountered before. In fact it is a series of crimes all vandalized with the letters \"WC?\" or as we later learn not sofar into the series, \"What color?\". The mystery intensifies as the perpetrators are all connected by one thing - Kamui. They mutter his name under their breath and attribute their crimes under his name. But who is Kamui? What does \"What color\" mean? Who are they asking it to? All questions are (kind of) resolved.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, not bad, but not strong either. The psycho-pass world is very interesting, and I felt that they didn't do it justice as well as they did in the first series. Of course, usually sequels are no match for the original, but this took that difference to a whole other level. The execution of this plot was really....confusing. I personally was not able to understand everything that was going on, and had to look up summaries online after each episode. Many can consider this as only a matter of personal comprehension, but talking to other fans of the series drew many of the same conclusions. Perhaps someone who is quick to understand will probably enjoy the plot itself a lot better than I did.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nAs always, the art in Psycho-Pass 2 was near flawless. Key word \"near\". There were times (especially in the last episodes) where the animators obviously got a little lazy. But it didn't affect my watching of the show. I also noticed that the color of blood (of course there was going to be a vast amount of blood in this anime, what did you expect?) was changed in some scenes to make it seem less gory, which kind of did the trick. I'm not super sure on why some shows do this in general (to me, knowing the blood is not real is enough to make me not feel super queasy), but this minor change is understandable.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the art was probably the best part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nNot going to go super deep into this, but sound in general was fine. The background music wasn't really distinguishable but I could sit through it. The opening was definitely something of my tastes (Ling Tosite Sigure always maintaining that great vibe) and the closing was, dare I say, better than those of Psycho-Pass? Not too much to say about sound this time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nAkane showed the most potential to show character development, and true she did develop some. \\n\r\nI liked how she used Kougami in her head to work out some of the cases (yes, I am a Kougami fangirl, I can't help it), but other than that, her personality was very flat, and only in the end did she show sparks of emotion. The fact that I can't even remember some of her appearances in episodes should say enough about my feelings as of this series towards Akane (note that I did really like her in PP1)\\n\\n\r\nTogane. Oh, Togane. Togane is a new member of the group, and he is an enforcer. I really, really liked his backstory, but as a character himself, he remained pretty stoic until the end ( wow, I'm sensing a pattern here!). Although, he always did have an air of mystery around him that added to the suspense of the show, but other than that, I didn't see a purpose of him being there. I think the story could have flowed a little bit smoother if they got rid of his ultimate \"goal\", but not a major dent in the plot over all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kamui himself, I'm afraid I can't do a detailed character review without spoiling too much. Yes, you do get to see Kamui, but that is where my information stops. I actually think he is pretty interesting and an amazing plot device. Seems to be the only character that I was content with.\\n\\n\r\nFor the others, I'll summarize a bit. A little upset that Gino and Shion did not get a larger role in the series. I also did not like Shimotsuki, the new inspector we met at the end of PP1, but I think that was the point of her character. I did like Hinakawa and Saiga, although for Saiga I was a little confused on what exactly he was doing the entire time. But a little internet researching aided me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI really, really hate to say it, but I did not enjoy PP2 as much as I thought I would. I was easily bored through each episode, and I never became excited to see a new episode. It was like I was forcing myself to watch it.\\n\\n\r\n*Another thing: Kougami*\\n\r\nIf you are expecting to see Kougami in this series, don't bother. Sorry to break it to you, but honey, he doesn't come. I know, I know, I was sad too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are expecting PP2 to be just like the first, you will be disappointed. But, I do recommend you still watch it, but just for the sake of saying you watched it. Not a bad show, but wasn't up to the standard I wanted it to be. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time for reading this review! \\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSociety as we know it exists for one simple reason: law. The rules and regulations put in place are there not as containment, but as verifiable measures for how a person should behave and act on a daily basis. Breaking the rules metes out punishment. Following the law makes one a stand-up citizen. The entity that delivers the final justice is usually known as a government or a tribunal. In other words, a collective existence. Then the important question arises: who judges the judger? In Psycho-Pass 2, the sequel to the very popular Psycho-Pass, explores the answer.\r\nSTORY\r\nPsycho-Pass 2begins more or less where the original ended. After a few months, Akane Tsunemori leads a new group of Enforcers with rookie Inspector Shimotsuki. During one mission, an ominous name and question is asked, sparking a wild series of events.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Psycho-Pass accomplished essentially three things: developing the world, unveiling the secret, and investigating the idea of morality versus law. To expand further on the latter, the first season explored what it means to do the right action versus the lawful action. This puts the second season in a particular situation. The world does not need any building; we've had that and then some from the first season. There is no huge secret to shock us with; it already happened. This leaves the final portion. That is, what does Psycho-Pass 2 try to do?\\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime does is tackle the notion of a \"perfect judge.\" An entity so all-knowing and powerful that it is capable of dishing out the correct amount of justice, every time, without fail. Like the original Psycho-Pass, it's an interesting theme that has connections to reality. Looking at the United States, its a country \"of the people, for the people, and by the people.\" The U.S. government judges its citizens, but we in turn judge the government: elections, voting, and impeachment are common practices. Sybil, the \"government\" of Psycho-Pass, is different. Their conclusions are final, and there is no affecting their decisions...until this season.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to go about this, the show incorporates a \"mistake,\" an anomaly in the system that causes those in play to think about just how perfect everything seems. Its a rather interesting situation if only because it creates a paradoxical outcome in which the answer is quite clear.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are two large obstacles that impede along the way. First, is the subplot involving numerous members of the cast. Its inclusion doesn't do much of anything except deter from the prominent theme that the show was investigating. It contained a half-baked attempt at a \"twist\" that wasn't trying to mirror the first season, but was at least trying to emulate it to an extent. For now, the sub-plot served little purpose. Little because its effects on one particular character should become important with the final movie. But for now, we are left scratching our heads as to why such mindless events were taken in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of mindless, the violence throughout the anime is very distracting. Now, Psycho-Pass is known for being quite bloody, there is no denying that. But here, the violence is portrayed differently. The first season had violence as a byproduct of the goals in mind. Here in the second season, violence wasn't the byproduct and instead became the goal. Each and every encounter involves massive casualties, body parts, and gruesome acts that don't contribute to the narrative. Rather, they merely take away from the story Psycho-Pass 2 was attempting to weave.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFollowing in its predecessor's footsteps, Psycho-Pass 2 maintains the same art style. The characters are normally deathly pale, the city is dark and dangerous, and the Dominators are CG animated. It's a familiarity that is welcome to see, bringing fans of the series right back into the thick of things from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is tougher to critique, mainly because Psycho-Pass is generally dialogue heavy. The characters, therefore, are usually found sitting or standing around, talking with one another about the upcoming mission or the leads and facts found from an investigation. It does have its moments: while the violence is distracting, it is quite detailed, shootouts involve rogue robots, etc. When it can, the show does what it can to show that it's more than just a bunch of people chatting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nPsycho-Pass is known for its unfortunately weak protagonists. This time around, it's definitely more of a mixed bag. Let's focus on who I consider the most important.\\n\\n\r\nAkane started out as a shy and timid young woman looking to find her place within the system. After the events of the first season, she has become a stalwart defender of society, looking to bring about the justice that she deems adequate. She's kind to her subordinates, but extremely determined when it comes to matters of the law. Her instincts are often right, making her the perfect Inspector. The evolution she receives over the course of the first season, thanks to the antagonist and a friendly Enforcer, was interesting to see. This season, Akane actually doesn't see much development at all. She starts hardened and clear and ends with the same convictions she's maintained all along. The focus appears to be on Akane, as the rather poor sub-plot revolves around her, but she's not. Instead, it's Shimotsuki. We'll get to her a little bit later.\\n\\n\r\nA new Enforcer in the squad, Tougane embodies the \"three C's\": calm, cool, and collected. But like most men with a sinister face, scraggly hair, and jet-black clothing, there hides a more devilish side. His motivations do not become evident until later on. And what motivations they are. What drives him is simple compassion, but what he does, what he was \"designed\" to do, isn't enlightening like the other Psycho-Pass antagonists. Rather, it's just evil. And that's unfortunate, because the first season's villain is often regarded as one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Makishima questioned the law, Kamui, Psycho-Pass 2's bad guy, questions the core system itself. His existence is a stain on to Sybil; their inability to adequately judge him reveals their incompetency while simultaneously proving that there is indeed room for improvement. The majority of his actions are shrouded in mystery for a vast majority of the anime, with his final few cards being played in the last few minutes or so. Initially, he seemed like a carbon copy of Makishima, providing little insight or intrigue into the world we were presented with. But as the pieces were slowly put together, his initial question proved to be more worthwhile than at first perceived.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest character from the anime is the infamous Shimotsuki. She acts as the foil to Akane; Akane does what is right whereas Shimotsuki does what is lawful. The anime utilizes what the first season explored. In this way, instead of learning the truth as Akane does, we instead get to see someone on the outside, someone who cannot or will not bend the rules. This is where her rather abrasive and hostile attitude is created. She isn't \"bitchy\" by nature, she is simply following the rules to a fault. Her personality is dictated by society, and therefore Sybil. As such, her development over the course of the season was interesting to watch. Starting high and mighty, generating thoughts of doubt, immense collapse, and eventual delusion make her an intricate character that is perhaps only rivaled by Makishima.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is rather spooky. Relying heavily on the visuals, its constant repetition, drum beat, and vocals portray a feeling of hopelessness that coincide with the feelings of the characters within the show.\\n\\n\r\nComparatively, the ED is better than the OP. It's a rather catchy tune. It builds and builds until it can't contain itself any longer. The main vocalist mixes well with both the background singers and the very fast tempo, creating a pleasant tune to bob one's head.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has some good pieces. My favorite is the more orchestral, with the quick violin and resounding flourishes.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, everyone involved gave at least average to above average performances, with no outstanding roles to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm being honest, I actually wasn't liking the second season at first. The villain wasn't fascinating enough (comparatively) and the show didn't seem to have the same feeling of something being \"off\" that the first one exuded. This is alleviated somewhat the more the show progresses, but it doesn't execute anything as well as what was already done. If anything, their new inclusions, like a purely evil antagonist or the overdone violence, showcase how much it was trying to be like the initial season, rather than being its own self.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it can get pretty tense during certain moments. The show is by nature a psychological drama that aims to test preconceived notions of society as a whole. So seeing things devolve into a chaotic manner are the norm. The series has and never will be for the feint of heart, nor even for those who cannot interpret or try to understand different perspectives. Its an adult show that highlights what anime can do when taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nPsycho-Pass 2 did what it had to do, and that was provide a meaningful experience that could be looked at as a continuation of the series. While not as impactful or important as the first season, its atmosphere and world provide viewers with an Orwellian society rife with important questions. With one movie to wrap everything up, I'm excited to see where Akane, Shimotsuki, and the rest ultimately go.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, interesting idea at play distracted by poor sub-plot and overuse of violence\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, familiar art style, nice detail, animated nicely where needed\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Tougane is bad, Akane and Kamui are okay, Shimotsuki is great\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP and ED, nice soundtrack, okay VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, serves its purpose\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Deja vu is a weird feeling to have. It's bad enough on its own (unless its bringing up something good), but what does it feel like when a series does it? Well, according to this series, you get a horrible product.\r\n*SPOILERS FOR PSYCHO-PASS 2*\r\nIf there were ever two words to properly describe this series, they would be: \"repetitive\" and \"dumb\". It is exactly what happens when a sequel tries to play it safe but somehow manages to take the most dangerous approaches possible. It's trying to stay within the comfort zone of the franchise, yet it manages to damage the franchise in the process, inmore ways than one. Well, how? How does it ruin itself as well as tamper with its predecessor and its previous events? Why is it being labeled as repetitive and dumb? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nLet me preface what I'm about to say with this: I would be a madman if I tried to point out every single plothole this series has. It is ridiculous how an 11 episode series can have so many. Quite frankly, it's disgusting. Got that? Good. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is a total rehash of Psycho-Pass, and not in the same way as Star Wars episode 7 was to A New Hope, or Frozen was to Tangled, but much, much worse. Those films could be accused of ripping off, but while they follow similar story beats, they go off in their own directions and have actions that don't perfectly mirror their predecessors. This show? No, It rips most of its entire story structure and many of its events from season 1, and it is glaring. A stand alone complex in the early half of the series involving villains that commit seemingly unrelated crimes only being linked by their puppeteer? A villain that disposes of most of his lackeys and creates massive hysteria among the people while exploiting holes in the Sybil? The main villain doing his evil deeds while being undetectable due to something that the central conflict involving Sybil's imperfections just so happens to center around attaining info about to improve itself with Akane wanting the man with that to live for that purpose? If you've seen both seasons, you can see the obvious and glaring parallels. Hell, it even tries to recycle Akane's development from season one and implement both a Kogami character and a Masaoka character.  Goodness, have some courage.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about said story beats. Turns out, a bomb was placed in a hologram and it went off, forcing Akane and Co. to track him down and arrest him. After capture, he goes insane and talks about this mysterious master named Kamui (getting Makishima flashbacks yet?) before being dealt with for our first kill of the season by one of the more violent enforcers. After Togane (the not-Kogami) calms her down, she talks with Ginoza who both before and after this, tries to make sure Akane doesn't make any rash decisions that may cloud her Psycho Pass (even though season 1 put her through hell and she still came out fine). After a few more criminals, we get introduced to the big bad, Kirito (not that Kirito) Kamui, and I'll touch on his character later. Turns out that he actually kidnapped one of the inspectors and stole her eye do that he could use a dominator, but makes another person kill a bunch of people to ensue some of the most violent circumstances in the show (here we go again).\\n\\n\r\nThis person is dealt with after a bunch of innocent yet scarred people get shot and killed by the MWPSB in a scene that completely cheapens the impact of lethal dominators due to the fact that about 6 people are killed by them in rapid succession and another 4 die within a few minutes around that time. Later, after hacking drones for citizens to unknowingly play with and kill people with, the gang thwarts that too and Akane confronts the big bad guy but can't shoot, so he gets away (goddammit). Then we find out that Togane wants to blacken Akane\u2019s hue and we'll touch on why that's stupid later. He wraps Akane\u2019s subordinate, Mika into getting Akane\u2019s grandmother killed somehow as after a hospital housing illegal immigrants is burned in flames by Kirito\u2019s lackey (who we never see again) Togane opens up the trunk he kidnapped her in, and beats her to death with a dominator. Then it all comes spiraling down to hell, but I'll touch on that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI will only address some of the plot holes and dumb writing from this point on. For starters, in episodes 1, 2, and 4, how is our main antagonist able to switch the undetectability of his subordinates off and on without being present? In episode 4, when a boy tries to shoot one of the criminals, why does Inspector Risa stopping him in order to try to use her dominator on him when in the same episode, it has been established that that doesn`t work on him? When the boy turns out to be a hologram controlled by our main villain, was he expecting Risa to be stupid, because that's not how Batman Gambits work. You're supposed to stall and outsmart your opponent via a crazy and elaborate strategy in order for it to be a proper Batman Gambit. Just look at Lelouch from Code Geass. There is so much wrong with the way the game in episode 5 ties in with the military drones that I would go insane trying to point them all out, like how the camera is in third person view and able the switch perspectives when the camera of the drone is in a fixed and linear position, or how in episode 6, the good guys reveal the disturbing real footage to the gamers which would easily raise the area stress level to criminal levels when they could've easily just locked them out of the game via a kill screen. You get the point by now. You don't need me to name every single plot hole in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale ends up about as well as you expected. Status quo. Togane and Kirito reveal their crappy motives, Togane reveals his deeds like an idiot and is horrified that it didn't work on her, he and Titans blast each other, and before Mika can deliver the finishing blow, Togane dies (he was shot by a fatal dominator shot yet he didn't implode\u2026). However, the final villain becomes a lot more inconsistent and for no good reason. I'll get to that later in the character section. The main goal of our villain was to make the Sibyl system judge collectives that way it could judge and destroy itself. One problem. All of the brains of that system are criminally asymptomatic, meaning that they cannot raise the crime coefficient of the Sybil system to dangerous levels, so the fact that it destroys some of the brains is very stupid. Also, how did he know about the inner workings and location of the core system?  It has been established that it is top secret; so much so, that most of the inspectors and enforcers don't even know about it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the returning cast. For some reason, Akane goes through the same developments she did in season 1, but this time, she's more badass and not willing to shed as many tears. They didn't damage her character here but they didn't really add to it at all. Yayoi and Shion aren't really affected, besides showing more of the fact that they are a lesbian couple. Ginoza for some reason tries to be Akane\u2019s limiter, advising her against doing decisions her could cloud her Psycho Pass, when she's done and been through worse in season 1 but was perfectly fine. Kougami only appears in Akane\u2019s head to clear her up on things (cool to see and glad they didn't drag him into this mess). Risa is basically there to make one kill and then make a whole lot of dumb decisions before she gets wasted. That seems to be a running theme with these guys now, whether they're even fighting humans or drones, which, the fact that they're so corruptible, speaks ill of the whole organization and of how these guys work. Jouji is a bit watered down here, not making these badass and ok the mark assumptions as much as he used to and asking a lot more questions that spouting the answers to them.\\n\\n\r\nOk, now for the new guys. I'm sure we can all agree on this, Mika is the worst character in this show. She is an impudent, incompetent, asshole who picks a fight with anyone and everyone before getting used by Togani in a scene so brilliant for to him pinning her down and making her scream and beg for mercy. She reminds me way too much of Shinn Asuka from SEED Destiny, and that is not s person people want to be reminded of! As for Togane, he seems like a cool, collected, veteran at first, but then it turns out that he wants to darken Akane\u2019s hue. Why is this approved by Sibyl? Why has no one tried to stop him when he did this to 5 other inspectors prior to the series? Also, him motivation for wanting to kill Kirito (his life is a stand on mommy\u2019s legacy and he might have killed my grandma) is pretty flimsy and is spouted out way too late for us to care. \\n\\n\r\nFor the lackeys, they're all one dimensional hive-mind idiots why kill, worship Kamui, go crazy, and die, in that order. Kirito is inconsistent and quite frankly, hypocritical, which no one calls him out on. He says that he wants to help people and he even killed the \u201caliens\u201d for killing so many people with their plans, when he himself has caused so much civilian death with his plans, \u201cbut that's ok since there was no other option\u201d, as he puts it, which is dumb. He did all of this and even kill some of his own when in episode 2, he cries because the MWPSB didn't spare one of his own. That's not even counting the last episode when the multiple personalities are displayed. Did I forget to mention that the reason he had multiple personalities is because he has body parts of 184 other people inside him, and how that is stupid, because I definitely should have by now.\\n\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs some of you may know, this season was mostly done by Tatsunoko Production, which can explain why this show looks mediocre, especially by 2014 standards, and when stacked against the look of the original, which makes the downgrade even worse.  There are some beautiful looking moments, which were obviously done by Production I.G., due to how much better they are compared the the art and animation of the rest of the series. The typing animation in scenes that require it, is done terribly, some of the show's more ambitious shots and actions don't work as well as they wanted them to, and the artstyle of the characters looks off, due to this generic they look in comparison to the interesting and more realistic yet stylized designs present in season 1. Plus, the CGI here is terrible. In season 1, they managed to make it blend well with the world, but here, no dice. That's horrible considering how much more prevalent the CGI is this time around. The gore also looks inferior.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7//10\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't a lot of many memorable background OSTs this time around, but some are pretty good, like in season 1, but the slapped in opera one done in the burning scene really doesn't work as well as they wanted it too. The OP, \u201cEnigmatic Feeling\u201d by Ling Toshite Sigure, is pretty catchy and cool, and considering the band\u2019s track record, it's no surprise. The ED, \u201cFallen\u201d is probably my favorite EGOIST song to date, and that says a lot given their track record. I love this song so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is almost as good as in season 1. The voices all come back, the new ones are mostly good, but some of the one-offs don't fit the bill, but then again, it's not often that they do. Good dub though. There; a section where I complimented Psycho Pass 2. Happy?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAside from that one moment where Mika is pinned down, and one moment where Togane runs like a little bitch , there really isn't anything this season that didn't make me frustrated. A lot of that comes down to two things: the stupidity of the script, and the awfulness of Mika. They made so many scenes downright infuriating, especially any scene with Mika in it. The stupid contradictions to the first season only made things more aggravating, and there wasn't any moment in which I could really take solace in, aside from the two above. It also gets pretty dull at times too. There isn't much redeemable here at all.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10    RAW SCORE: 3.43/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat a stain in the legacy of Psycho Pass. This is an putridly stupid series that started bad and only got worse without any episode to halt the downward spiral in any way, and this is currently the only series I can say that to. It is the SEED Destiny of the franchise, in more ways than one, and her is not a positive comparison to make. I'm willing to bet that the writer for this series, Tow Ubukata, was actually watching the first season while working on this script, for some of the reasons mentioned above. It's all just a sloppy mess. Maybe if our Psycho Pass A-team (Urobutcher, Shiyotani, and Motohiro) were more present in this production rather than working on the film, this series would've actually been something of a worthy follow up, but alas, this is what we have now. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Psycho pass 2 receives a lot of negative reviews and though some may be too critical, they are based in truth.  Like the first season, it follows akane and her duties as inspector of squad 1. The problems i find that arise within the second season are uninteresting characters, an unlikely plot and what feels like to me, as a rather stalled continuation of this beloved series of mine. \r\nFirstly, Kogami is NOT in this season and though extremely disappointing to me and many others, makes sense, especially when you consider the plot of the show is not destroying the sibyl system(which would makesense for kogami to be there). Though we miss kogami, the show's problems have nothing to do with his absense, we just think it does cause we love him so much. The plot itself involves a new threat, in the guise of a mysterious man named Kamui, who poses similar threats of undermining the sibyl system much like Shogo makishima did. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, psycho pass 2 relies heavily on this type of character.  Kamui(in a unique way) is like Shogi(in the sense the sibyl system does not read him) and though the two do not share any of the same philosophy, they are the same antagonist, the only difference was that Shogo was well rounded and understandable and well liked where as Kamui, like many of the new characters, are not very well rounded and do not have the same sort of \"pizzaz\" as the characters from season 1. Other characters are added, such as Mika, a new inspector who poses an interesting personality conflict with Akane yet comes off as rather pretentious and annoying and by the 4th or 5th episode you wish she would just shut the fuck up instead of constantly posing as a hindrance to akane. Also, two enforcers are added, Sho, a introverted enforcer, who though is likable and clearly a good person, is not well rounded and has almost no back story(spare a rather forced set of dialogue by a character that has nothing to do with him) The other is a rather generic and unique Kogami(in the sense he is a badass detective like kogami but unique that he shares almost no characters traits with kogami) Unlike Kogami as well, who developed over the series, Sakuya does not develop at all. Chalk it up to 11 episodes or bad writing but that's the case. Akane herself seems rather boring and dull at times but for the most part, is the same person from season 1( so either you liked her or you didn't) Gino is still around but the interesting character from season 1 has almost no purpose as an enforcer other than to just be around and i think that we miss his importance from season 1. We are again introduced to Joji, who i feel becomes much more important and a rather important character though at the same time, the plot does not call for him at all & was probably only added for the element of having a new character(or one that can be further explored, which he is). \\n\\n\r\nThe plot, like the characters, suffers. In 11 episodes it serves to do little to deviate itself from the main plot of the first season, which was to bring the sibyl system down. However, unlike the first season, it starts off rather complicated and all over the place but does a good job of tying everything together, though it could have done a much better starting off. It also misses that cast of antagonists who added drama and tension to the show as well as progressed the plot. Instead, the other antagonist(and there is arguably only 1 more) is hardly an antagonist while the others are flat characters with no likability at all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, all that being said, if you liked the first season, you will like this one. It still has a rather interesting plot, at least one interesting enough that it's hard to predict what will happen and who will do what. The sound and art is just as good as the first one and do not let Kogami's absence throw you off too much because the second season in now way ends the possibilities of the show, and along with the movie soon to come, i predict another season or two, a season with Kogami. \\n",

            "content": "Psycho Pass 2 feels like a cheap reboot. In episode 1 we get another introduction to how dominators work, how enforcers are expendable, how some inspectors follow the rules while others think for themselves, how Sibyl can change its mind on lethal force, etc. After the first episode it's like they skip to the 2nd half of Psycho-Pass 1 where instead of hunting Makishima they go after this guy named Kamui. I\u2019ll leave it up to you to stumble through this mess of a sequel but it suffices to say that Kamui is no Makishima\u2014in no small part due to the series\u2019 lack of aShinya equivalent to act as a foil Kamui.\\n\\n\r\nBut it almost doesn\u2019t even matter because ask yourself, do we really need another Makishima? Remember, the great mystery Season 1 (evident from the first episode) wasn\u2019t the evil master plan of Makishima, it was the true \u2018nature\u2019 of the Sibyl System. Makishima was a tool for revealing these creepy revelations (which I won\u2019t spoil) to the audience and Akane. With that in mind, in Season 2 you can\u2019t just insert a new, watered-down Makishima to fuck shit up and expect that to suffice. That\u2019s like making bank robbers the main villains of a super hero movie sequel. I\u2019m way more interested in Sibyl. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to Akane. I loved her character in Season 1 because she broke away from the hero/heroine tradition of blindly following childish idealism. She demonstrated an ability to work within the system and make compromises when necessary for the greater good. Starting the sequel, I had really hoped her comfort with this moral grey zone would be explored and tested. How far would she support a corrupt system? What's her breaking point? How is she able to reconcile her duty with what she knows about Sibyl? \\n\\n\r\nSadly, Season 2 never addresses these questions and Akane largely  behaves as if she never learned the truth about Sibyl to begin with. She lacks the fire she had in Season 1 and seems almost blas\u00e9 when witnessing Sibyl-sanctioned atrocities. Even in her private thoughts, she doesn't reflect much on the lessons learned in the first season. This is not just problematic for character development but also for the plot, as Akane and many characters who directly witnessed Makishima manipulate crime coefficients (helmets) in Season 1 are baffled by this concept in Season 2. For some reason the old cast still treats Sibyl as infallible despite demonstrable proof to the contrary. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are either predictable to the point of boring or unpredictable to the point of irrational. The only unifying theme amongst the cast is that they are all universally forgettable. What started off as a bizarre and intriguing dystopian (or utopian depending on perspective) society in the first season has evolved into a silly, fucked up Disneyland. Sibyl and all of its instruments come across as inept, brittle and feeble. It seems like every episode the police or the military get hacked and lose control of a secure network or automated system. With so many vulnerabilities and blind spots, it begs the question why the chaotic events unfolding in Season 2 never happened sooner. The awe of Sibyl is just gone.\\n\r\nExpect plot holes galore. It\u2019s too convoluted to go into great detail but just prepare to be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 keeps the same gritty feel from the first season. The blood and gore content go up a notch and the death scenes are a hard 17+. \\n\r\nIn Season 1, a single murder was a really big deal. I alluded to this concept in my Code Geass review but briefly, different animes place different value on human life. For example, Ein from Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom can be depicted killing 20 nameless soldiers without any moral implications whereas human death in Full Metal Alchemist is less gratuitous and treated with more reverence.  \\n\r\nAnyway, In Season 2\u2019s ham-handed effort to satisfy its viewers\u2019 bloodlust, it clumsily altered the value of life in the Psycho Pass universe. Now we can have 10 detectives get blown away without anyone giving a shit. Atrocities, mass casualties, piles of dead civilians? No big deal. Your friend got murdered last episode? Who cares!  Out of all of the flaws in this 11 episode waste of time, this was the worst. Not only did it trivialize everything about the new plot, but it changed the conscience of the characters I grew to like in the first season. Fuck you Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is a violent, low IQ detective story rather than a psychological thriller or critique on human nature like the first season. Maybe if you go into it with reduced expectations then you\u2019ll get something out of it. Personally, I could have dropped it by episode 4 and not missed much.",

However, I came out of watching this series with a substantial amount of enjoyment. I can understand why people think this series is in-superior to its predecessor, there are some questions that it kind of forgets to answer, ones that were left at the end of the first Psycho-Pass. Also the ending is (I thought) a little rushed, I would have liked to seen maybe one more episode to draw it out. Thisseries kind of takes a different turn than what I expected going in. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, the story it went down was very intriguing to say the least. The whole time it kept me guessing until the end, their were many cliffhangers throughout and I liked most of the new characters and how they justified a lot of the characters intentions. You could believe and understand their motives.\\n\\n\r\nI would say when watching this keep an open mind try not to compare the two series to much, although (understandable) their will be times where you have to. I would recommend this, especially to people who like investigations",

            "content": "With a dystopian setting comes a down-with-the-system plot. This is true for a lot of cases. It is not that it is the end-all and be-all of all dystopian fiction. It is that if you want to move forward and present things in an uber-philosophical manner, this is the way to go. Psycho-Pass is no exception. And it incorporates this not once but twice (and with the possibility of a third time.)\r\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase. Psycho-Pass 2 is not as spectacular as it aspired to be although it tries (desperately). I can\u2019t say I was disappointed either as I didn\u2019t have high expectations forit. I was definitely brought in by the hype but the first season reminded me of how any follow-up can fall short (especially when the first season fell short itself).\\n\\n\r\nA lot of viewers say that the second season is a carbon copy of the first. Not all of that is true. Like I said, dystopian settings don\u2019t have much to go around with. When it wants to have a brooding and thoughtful tone (everything Psycho-Pass aims to be), the choices are limited. I can forgive the second season for having the same themes as the first simply because of Kamui.\\n\\n\r\nKamui may seem unoriginal at first. He and Makishima have the same goals about society. However, Kamui sets off having more drive and resolve to bring down Sibyl (or at least change it or know about its nature) although it kind of flipped over towards the end. Although not as charismatic as Makishima, he presents legit questions regarding the system. Somehow, I find him more likable than Makishima who only flaunted his educated humanist ass to put off other characters (and viewers). But both are unique in their own way and there is no reason to compare them.\\n\\n\r\nAkane in this season is not as challenged as she was in the previous. If I were to say something nice about her, it would be that her development was decent enough, giving her more self-understanding and the ability to think outside the box. But that\u2019s just it. So much potential is wasted for our beloved protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe same is true for the rest of the characters. In the end, they were nothing more than mere accessories the whole series can do without. They provided enough amusement the series can do well without. For instance, Ginoza, who received the full brunt of character development in the first season, was put in the backseat and casually thrown out the window. The characters relationships were not outlined and explored to their full extent as much as they tried to bring them out and the story never did anything to address this lack of trajectory.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its faults, the story provides enough twists to keep me watching when, to be honest, it was 80% all talk. It didn\u2019t need all the blood and gun service and car chases to mask the lack of action. This leads me to conclude that the animation never did anything to make things better. I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\\n\\n\r\nI hoped that it would be smarter than the first season as I hoped that the first season would be smart. It aspired, tried, but never did it transcend itself. I sit here, pondering over the many things that could have made the whole series better. Psycho-Pass 2 gave only so much that in return I can give it a \u201cgood enough\u201d.",

Right from the start we are informed that Sibyl is formed by extracted human brains and judges people as criminals if their emotions seem negative, who are also strangers and unelected by the public, which is a broken system in itself because bullies would feel real good after hurting innocent victims making them anideal citizen while leaving the victims victimised, and who thought of legal raping should exist? This is why Sibyl Rebels are Einstein\u2019s in comparison. Sibyl becomes even more broken as you see it not doing its job right, at an elusive 40% occasion, Sibyl can regard anyone (even non-psycho's) to have a Psycho Pass of 300 demanding them to be executed when meeting an eliminator. You call Sibyl perfect? Why the hell is it not doing its job?! This in turn makes the message of the story not a challenge, but an intellectual piece of bollocks that is down right stupid because the show is stupid! Did you know that Sibyl has a wife and a son? How does Sibyl funtari work?\\n\\n\r\nCast is stupid, cast love Sibyl, and cast thinks Sibyl is the saviour the universe.

A Sibyl Rebel Master used one of the dozen ways to be unrecognised by Sibyl: By attaching his body with thirty other bodies to confuse the Sibyl System as an unrecognised terrorist and no one acknowledges to even arrest him! Or the opening of why this guy joined the police force was because he was a semi-one dimensional psychotic douche who simply wants to cloud other people's psycho pass because one: He is the son of Sibyl, and two: It's simply explicitly normal.\\n\\n\r\nLet us remember this show for just sharing the Urobutcher name...

It\u2019s got leather seats; it\u2019s your favorite color; and it has every bit of technology you\u2019d ever want in a vehicle. That is, until you actually go to the seller to look at it and it\u2019s nothing like what you wanted. It may still be the same model, but the seats are in terrible condition and the paint is peeling. That essentially is what the second season of Psycho Pass is\u2014a sad imitation of its predecessor that leaves the watcher feeling frustrated and betrayed.\r\nI actually quite liked the first season, having rated it an8. While it does have its issues, each character is fleshed out and likeable, and the underlying plot manages to keep one on the edge of their seats all the way to the end. This time around, however, it falls short on... well, everything, and there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu I felt whilst watching it. I understand that perhaps they were trying to maintain the same feel of the first season, but it screams laziness. Clearly, the B team was tasked with handling this one.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a new inspector, Mika Shimotsuki, thrust into our faces without ever getting to see any back story whatsoever to her. She has the personality of a twig, and her sole purpose in life seems to revolve around undermining Akane every step of the way.

The animators don\u2019t even try to hide the fact that they regurgitated Kougame\u2019s personality traits and stuffed them down the throat of the main Enforcer, Tougane. He talks in similar patterns and smokes the same cigarettes, for God\u2019s sake. Ginoza seems to have become a man of few words, and having been a major character in the first season, you would think they\u2019d have done something more appropriate with him. Instead, they gave him the shortest script known to mankind which completely stifles the development we saw in the first season. L\u2014I mean, Hinakawa\u2014falls victim to this as well\u2014though he is meant to be one of the more quiet Enforcers, it doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that the studio didn\u2019t care to put much effort into a more interesting script for him. He seems like he could be a very intriguing character, but right now, he\u2019s just a cardboard cutout. \\n\\n\r\nThe ear rape that is to be called the OP, sung by the same band that did Unravel, is quite possibly the worst thing my ears have ever had to endure. Why the studio ever thought it was a good idea is beyond me. The ED, on the other hand, is actually quite good, summing up the dark theme of the show well. But that's where the positivity ends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is, sadly, a miss in the Psycho-Pass franchise, which is a shame because there was lots of untapped potential. The (albeit ridiculous) spat with the antagonist was overshadowed too much by Tougane\u2019s own villainy, and it felt like the show itself was confused as to what direction it needed to take. It\u2019s fine to have other conflicts that are different from the main one the characters are trying to resolve, but that\u2019s only if they\u2019re handled well\u2014something the second season doesn\u2019t quite know how to do. And yeah, yeah, I know everyone complains about Kougame being gone, but I\u2019m no exception. He absolutely is the strong point of this show, and without him, the second season spins off into the abyss from which there is no return.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hey, it\u2019s only 11 episodes long, so that\u2019s way less time that you have to slog through the muck of it.\\n",

            "content": "This was most certainly a difficult and frustrating season to get through, with many disappointments not by the story, but by your own standards of what you expect and want to happen. It never fully answers your questions, and all in all I believe this season didn't quite live up to its predecessor. It answered only enough to keep you interested, but still left you frustrated with a feeling of confusion and emptiness, much unlike the first season, which, although it left questions unanswered, gave a sort of satisfaction that this one did not provide. Character-wise, I'd say it was sub-par at best. Unlike thefirst season, which provided adequate development of every one of its characters, this season really only focused on a select few while the rest had to watch from the sidelines. Even the characters it did develop were not done very well. Akane Tsunemori and Kirito Kamui were the only two that really developed at all. The other two (Tougane and Shimotsuki) were really only sloppily thrown together last second. Now obviously this is not the kind of show that was meant to leave you happy and smiling, but overall I feel the story is what really pulled it together. It really kept you guessing as to what would happen next, and never giving you the satisfaction of being correct. The only thing that dragged it down is the ending, which left you feeling unresolved with no way to fix it. All in all I'd say this was a good show that did very well considering its episode count was half that of the first season, but it didn't quite make it to the same level.",

            "content": "The world of psycho pass is a cyber-punk dystopian future police society which is based on a mass surveillance \u2018big brother\u2019 like Sibyl system with its ruthless crime and mind control system. Since this spoiler free review has been written with the assumption that the reader is familiar with the world of Psycho-Pass, it will not delve too deeply on the background or the world.\r\nPsycho-Pass 2 picks up 1.5 years after the events of the first season. Akane Tsunemori, the protagonist who (much like the director of the show) was an unimpressive rookie in the first season is no longer the same scared greenhorn, buthas become a polished and talented inspector exuberating the kind of self-confidence and poise that only comes with experience and knowledge.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the main character, only a few characters return from the first season, such as Ginoza (the former inspector who became an enforcer in the first season after a spike in his psycho-pass level), Shion Karanomori (the analyst) and jouji Saiga. Unfortunately, not much depth or thought seems to have been put into the characters. Even the returning characters disappoint, as in the case of Ginoza whose character was very well developed in the first season, but is just a bland and sometimes annoying distraction in the second season. This is just one reason why P-P 2 falls short of its predecessor, which had a far more compelling character development and exposition, especially in the form of Shougo Makishima and Shinya Kougami. \\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, P-P 2 relies a lot on keeping the audience glued through shock-factor and mystery, egging the viewers by keeping them in the dark until the end. But unlike the first season which also focused on character development, the rivalry of the Makishima and Kougami (which many have compared with that of L and Kira, Tenma and Johan etc), and psuedo-intellectual/philosophical themes, the second season has little else to offer. Just like Makishima in the first season, Kamui (the \u2018antagonist\u2019 or rather \u2018anti-hero\u2019) of the second season questions and challenges the very foundation of the sibyl system and the societal order. And like the first season, the second one promotes the Hegelian dialectics and progress through synthesis of opposing ideas/forces.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the thematic nuances differ a bit; the \u2018Sibyl System\u2019, which at one point is compared to the Benthamite panopticon penitentiary (a system where one watchman can observe and control all inmates through a central tower), judges and passes orders for putting down or executing people simply based on their \u2018psycho-pass\u2019 levels (which is a combination of emotional/mental state, personality and the probability of exhibiting criminal/delinquent behaviour). Such omnipotent and omnipresent yet flawed construct with a God-complex raises some difficult questions, such as who will judge the God? Is Sibyl really that perfect that it cannot be judged on the same grounds that it judges individuals? \\n\\n\r\nPsycho-pass was a show heavily influenced by works preceding it, particularly the dystopian science fiction works of Oshii Mamorou. The ideas explored by it were by no means unique or original; similar themes have already been explored before in numerous Books, TV shows, movies and anime. Psycho-Pass 2 does not break free of the influences or the limitations set by the first series. In fact, one of the downsides of the second season is that at times it seems to be following the footsteps of its predecessor too faithfully in some respects, while overlooking some of the winning traits of the original. At times it turns into a pale copy of the original.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music are more of the same. Action sequences, however, have suffered a great dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Psycho-Pass 2 is fairly entertaining. Not great. Not bad. But something in the middle.",

I dived into season 2 expecting the worst sequel ever, because everyone, everywhere (not just here) was saying how bad it was, however I was still curious to see how Akane develops so I gave it a shot, and it ended up being not at all as crappy as everyone was making it out to be. Sure yeah, there's no Kogami, which is apparently the biggest flaw for most people, but it didn't botherme at all. Everyone disliked the new villain, but again - didn't bother me at all, I actually liked him. The story was confusing sometimes, in sense that all the antagonists and their accomplices had really unbelievable motivations (but I had that same problem with season 1, Makishima included,so I forgive it) and Sybil's actions are stupid as f**k, but in the end it kept me entertained and I honestly enjoyed it. I do mind the lack of focus on Gino, but my opinion is that this season completely focused on Akane and her development, therefore it lacked focus on other characters and aspects of story, but I'm ok with that. All in all, my advice is to give it a shot and decide for yourself how much it lack compared to the previous season.",

            "content": "Sequels can be a tricky business, especially when the original series has such a huge following and is so distinctive in style and theme. There are many different reasons for sequels existing, ranging from additional stories that demand being told to easy fan base cash-ins, and the execution of these sequels also has just as many outcomes. One of the classic examples of what makes a bad sequel is creating one without the writing of the original creator, an occurrence with a notable example being Dragon Ball GT. So, how did the latest sequel lackingits original creator's image fare as its own product?\\n\\n\r\n          Before getting into my problems with the series, I do want to say that in terms of being a thrilling and compelling detective series, Psycho-Pass 2 definitely delivers, with a huge cloud of mystery and complex clues to be deciphered. This was also aided by the fact that the returning characters from last season are just as solid as they were before, with Akane coming back even better than before and undergoing a huge amount of development in this portion of the series.\\n\\n\r\n          With that said, this series falls immensely short of its predecessor, with dozens of cop-outs and plot holes that made this a rather frustrating experience. One of the biggest problems with the series is the writing. Regardless of your personal opinions on Urobuchi's more disturbing and unsettling style of writing, the man definitely knows how to craft an incredible story. However, when someone else attempts to copy his style of writing, they tend to forget that and focus more on the disturbing portion of it. This led to an absolutely horrendous moment in episode 4 where, without spoiling anything, the MWPSB does something so outlandish and out of character that it might as well have been replaced with a neon sign reading \"insert 'Urobutcher'-style shocking moment here.\" There is an incredible depth and complexity to the way Urobuchi crafts his darker style of writing, and to try and copy that in gore alone shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the original story.\\n\\n\r\n          Another, let obvious point where the second season falters is its level of intelligence and sophistication. While I did note in my review of the first season that the quoting of famous philosophers was just barely bordering on being pretentious, I certainly didn't want them to take this aspect away from the series entirely, but that's pretty much exactly what happened. Instead, the dabbling into the elements of the human soul has been replaced by conspiracy theory pseudo-intellect that grew more pretentious and annoying by the minute. While they do introduce one new philosophical concept towards the end that was rather interesting, it's effectively drowned out by the huge cluster of random conspiracy jargon being thrown out all over the place.\\n\\n\r\n          The new characters are also one of the bigger weak points of this new season. Starting first with our new antagonist, Kamui, it becomes apparent very quickly that he is infinitely less complex and interesting than Makishima was last season, and his motivations for wanting to bring down Sibyl are not nearly as noble, though some of his more minor traits still end up being somewhat interesting. Another poorly executed character was Shimotsuki, who I can only describe in terms that would not comply with the Terms and Conditions of this website. She constantly questions Akane's method of doing things even though Akan's methods always end up producing better results. We've already set up the idea that Akane knows much more about the Sibyl System than everyone else, and yet the story constantly focuses on characters who don't know this about her, and it makes trying to sympathize with them incredibly difficult, especially with Shimotsuki, whose arrogance is only proceeded by her inability to get the job done. As for other new characters, there is one in particular, whom I can't name due to spoilers, which started off promising but ended up being rather pathetic by the end.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced as a joint project between Production I.G. and Tatsunoko Production, and this is one of the few areas that's actually improved since the first season. The cityscape is incredibly well-crafted, the CG blends nicely with the traditional 2D animation, and the character designs, Akane's specifically, are much more refined and appealing. I will say that there was a significantly higher amount of gore in this season though, but this is more due to the nature of the mediocre writing than anything else.\\n\\n\r\n          The dub is actually a rather unique case, as this, along with Laughing under the Clouds, are the flagship titles for FUNimation's new Broadcast Dub system, where episodes are dubbed a few weeks after they come out, cutting the time gap between initial air date and dub release by a gigantic margin and taking a huge step forward in an industry where dubs are starting to lose their relevance. While I wasn't able to watch the dub completely before writing this review, I was able to see seven of the eleven episodes with the broadcast dub, and I'm happy to say that's it's just as good as the dub for season one. Kate Oxley and Josh Grelle return as Akane and Ginoza, while Cherami Leigh and Clifford Chapin bring strong new voices to Shimotsuki and Kamui.\\n\\n\r\n          Yugo Kanno also returns for the soundtrack composition and brings us one of the best soundtracks from this season. Rather than stick to one general style, he brings whatever accompaniment is necessary to fit the scene, from quick-paced electronic tunes to bombastic operatic orchestrations, though I will say the latter bordered on being pretentiously ironic at certain points. As for opening and ending themes, we are met with even more familiar faces. \"Enigmatic Feeling\" by Ling Tosite Sigure plays us in with a fast-paced rock/electronic track, while \"Fallen\" by EGOIST covers the outro with another heavy electronic track laced with hard rock. Additionally, \"Fallen\" is currently available for purchase on iTunes, and I highly recommend checking it out.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, while Psycho-Pass 2 isn't necessarily bad, it falls incredibly short of its previous iteration. However, I do still believe it is necessary to watch this series, especially with the upcoming Psycho-Pass movie on the horizon for next year, written by Urobuchi this time.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nOk, that sequel is something.....something recycled that is. On to my ratings for this  episode anime sequel.\r\nStory\r\nAt first, I thought that the Sybil System is gonna have its plug pulled, but what we have instead was something whose plot was recycled, but instead of Shogo Makishima, he was replaced by Kirito Kamui, but it still have that same plot where the Sybil System is the target,  both uses accomplices to do their dirty work and both were really bad asses. Also, it still involves the members of the MWPSB Unit One, where Akane is the top of the helm, butin this sequel she is all alone without Kougami, now because the plot was something that is recycled  but modified, I'm gonna give this a 6, because, though the recycled plot is alright, the end of the anime is where one would feel disgusted that the antagonist Kamui when to all that trouble just to be recognize by the Sybil System when he could have have been the one to pull the plug.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nOk, so far the art is the usual from season , I still hate Akane's sense of fashion, where a professional like her would still wear loafers instead of low heels, I didn't get to see Mika wear some skirt and Sakuya wearing white shoes with his suit was a big crime of fashion, so it's a 5 on this category.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 7  for the ending theme Fallen by Egoist, since the song really fits the anime in general.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nOk, at first Kirito Kamui is someone where I would like to suffer a terrible death, also , he is someone that I thought who is gonna pull the plug on the Sybil System when Akane aligned with him, but in the end I do admit I was disgusted, but then again I glad that he got Sakuya. Now Togane Sakuya, at frist I thought that he'll replace Kougami but it turns out that like Kamui he is also a monster, but just like what happen to Makishima he too died- he did died right? Co'z while he was able to kill Kamui, I'm a bit surprise as to why the Dominator did do that damage that it should do where targets swell up and blow up regardless where they were hit. Now about Akane, I really do admire her development as a claim and head strong character where she herself didn't succumbed into the dark side where she  would have been an eye candy for the Dominator. Let's not for get the other added characters like Misako Togane who was the main culprit of the system,  \\n\r\nShimotsuki Mika a character that I like to hate aside from Sakuya and Kamui, in fact I was kinda hoping that she would be killed,   Ginoza Nobuchika,  Hinakawa Shion, Kunizuka Yayoi whom still provide the essential element to this sequel and who can for get the inspector gone cuckoo Mizue Shisui whom I was hoping that she would get blown up to pieces by an enforces Dominator. So with the train wreck and the character's development, I'm gonna give this category a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nFrankly the enjoyment here is how Akane would be able to deal with the pressures around her like the two monsters, where there is Kamui the known perp, Sakuya a wolf in sheep's clothing, Mika her bitchy subordinate Masako who is in charge of the system where her brain is occupying Kasei Joushu's body, where we the audience fell the main character, Akane, deeply. What adds to the enjoyment was seeing Misako Togane- her living brain of course that got blown up when the system she is serving turn against her where Kirito is the judge with the Dominator, so for that I'm giving it an 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 4 cu'z:\\n\\n\r\n- Its plot was recycled.\\n\\n\r\n-What I've expected would happen to the Sybil System didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\n-Where, I felt disappointed that the antagonist Kirito has to go to all that trouble just to be recognize.\\n\\n\r\n- Cu'z it was still entertaining, though, so watch it and judge for yourself.  \\n\\n\r\nFELIZ NAVIDAD, MUCHACHOS.",

            "content": "The first season of Psycho-Pass, hands down, is my favourite anime of all time. The plot was magnificent, the characters where unique and managed to be likeable in their own unique ways. So of course, when I heard there would be a second season, I was excited. I was all aboard the Psycho Pass 2 hype train. I drew a ton of art, I listened to the leaked opening on repeat, I even cut class to watch the first episode because I was that excited. So how did it fare compared to the first season?\r\nThe second season of Psycho-Pass had a great start. Episode 1was exciting, action packed, and left me excited for what the second season would deliver. Would I see Kougami again? How would the first season be referenced? Will we get more exploration for characters like Ginoza, Kunizuka, Shimotsuki, or Karanamori? What about the new characters, like Shisui, Togane, Hinakawa, and of course Kamui Kirito?\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, I was disappointed. While it was nice to see Shion and Yayoi's relationship carried from the first season, I was really disappointed there wasn't really much exploration of their characters. Same with Ginoza! I mean, it's not as bad for him, we did get a few scenes that showed how much he'd changed from his season one self, but it was pretty underwhelming for an anime that had initially reeled me in with it's character development. As for the new characters, Hinakawa is about as fleshed out as Karanamori or Kunizuka, which is a shame because he had the potential to become a really neat character. I can't say that Shisui didn't get a lot of screen time, but I really don't like the path the writers went with her. It didn't make sense how easily she fell for Kirito. It was nice to see a female character kick ass and get in on the action, but in the end she was just a pawn for Kirito. Which transitions nicely into how Kirito's character is played out.\\n\\n\r\nKirito is... interesting, to say the least. The idea of someone who couldn't be read by Sibyl seems to me like a carbon copy of Season 1's Makishima. I feel like the writers didn't really know if they wanted him to be a hero or a villain. I mean, in the end, we see the good motives he had but, do you really expect me to forget the part where he shot up a whole building with his men? \\n\\n\r\nTogane seemed to be a villain from the start. They tried to make him seem as suspicious as possible. But to counter that, they also made him similar to Kougami. In the end though, he was pretty much the perfect villain, with his high crime coefficient, and his killing of Akane's grandmother for... no... real... reason. That's another problem with Psycho-Pass 2. It's all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nI really was curious to see how they'd handle cramming a season of an anime like Psycho-Pass into 11 episodes. Props for the writers for making things seem ABSOLUTELY FUCKING ALL OVER THE PLACE! Really, what even was up with the story arcs? I mean.. there was the \"shooting naked people\" arc, the \"subway raid\" arc, and who could forget the \"Evil Flappy Bird\" arc!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, when Psycho-Pass 2 tried to be like the first season, that was when it was best. I really think it would be better with Urobuchi taking the front wheel. \\n\\n\r\nHere's to seeing what the movie has in store!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while i don\u00b4t get disappointed with some series that I expected to be bad .. Psycho-Pass 2 is one of them. After seeing many many people saying that compared with the first season, Psycho-Pass 2 sucked .. well i disagree. \r\nUnlike the first season, this one acquires a much faster pace without losing much of it. While in the first season we have some episodes that just are totally useless, the second season goes straight to the point and ends it quickly so it doesn\u00b4t get boring like the first season. \r\nEven though i have to admit, it was a litlebit worst. The fantastic world that Psycho-Pass managed to create isn\u00b4t so well explored as it is in the first season. \\n\r\nThe rest is pretty much the same.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10. Well .. it is the same thing. It's like if i was going to create, let's say a second season of Death Note where the same things happens but with \"different\" characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe setup is exactly the same thing as it was in the first season. Literally it looks like a copy, and i just hate it. I wanted something new.. but that doesn\u00b4t happen. \\n\\n\r\nEven tough we have tiny twists that made me surprised and at least that was nice.. but it needed to be something different. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Same thing. Nothing changed. The scenary still looks good for the most part, the characters are still well drawn and the movement still fair. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Well .. the track used are exactly the same, which is nice. For who watched the first season will want to keep the enviroment that the first season had, so they did well keeping all of them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really surprised were both the opening and the ending. The clip for opening looks deficient, it is the best word to describe it, but the song is just fucking amazing. I loved it. The ending .. also great. They both portray the feeling that Psycho-Pass gives to you so they are perfect to start/finish every single episode. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Meh. New characters were introduced. The thing is .. they suck. \\n\\n\r\nThe guy that works with Akane sucks compared to her old partner (Kougami)... the villian of this show is way worst that the first one (Makishima) and the rest of the cast just remains the same with the exception of another new character that no one cares about because he simply has 0 ZERO 0 ZERO 0 ZERO development. Why he even exist? I don\u00b4t know ... \\n\\n\r\nAbout the main Villian .. i missed the other one so much :/ I think they tried to make another character like Makishima but it just didn\u00b4t worked out. He even has the same motivations but and let's say the same way of thinking but ... he sucks. He is boring, not interesting and his design is not even nice. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I have to tell you is that Akane got so much better with this second season. I loved how with one of the new characters, Shimotsuki, they managed to magnify Akane. \\n\\n\r\nShe is no longer that younger detective that nothing knows about the world .. with the \"THING\" that happens in the first season (who saw knows what i'm talking about) she looks much more mature and professional. She is now the boss of the first squad and that is just awesome. See her on the comand bring us the memories that we had of her in the first season and it really feels good seeing her evolution. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Even though the show is kinda crappy at all points, the acelerated pace is one of the things that they made right. It's much more easier to see and enjoy than it is with the first season. However, the ending .. for the second time, it's not an ending. I mean it is a ending but a weak ending. \\n\\n\r\nDid you ever watched CSI ? Or something close to it? Criminal minds, NCIS, whatever any kind of police series .. This season looks like a big episode of one of those series. It looks like they could keep releasing seasons of Psycho-Pass because the only that they made with this season was adding a new villian and let the detectives solve the case. The secondary plot that is going on with the main plot, let's call it the Togane's arc is the only thing \"new\". The only thing that the first season didn\u00b4t had. But it's not a great thing. I mean the build up around it is crappy and the story isn\u00b4t appealing enough to make me care. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10. With all of those mistakes, I can\u00b4t give a higher rate. But in one hand the anime is fun to watch and for me that is paramount. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watched Psycho-Pass first seaon and you liked it, thrn i recommend this anime .. if you haven\u00b4t, well check my Psycho-Pass first season review and see if it makes you watch or not. \\n\\n\r\nIf you didn\u00b4t liked Psycho-Pass first season, then skip this one. Nothing changed, so if you didn\u00b4t liked the first season i'm not seeing you liking this one.. \\n\\n",

            "content": "As a pretty big fan of the original Psycho-Pass, I came into Psycho-Pass 2 wondering how they would continue the story since the former ended so well. After watching the finale, I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed in the overall dip in quality, but Psycho-Pass 2 was none the less a welcome, albeit somewhat unnecessary, edition to the franchise.\r\nThe story resumes a bit after the end of the first season, but now Akane has matured and gained a greater understanding of how things work, in particular the Sibyl system. We're also introduced to a new colorful assortment of characters, most notably the shadyyet noir-cool Sakuya Tougane, the essentially copy and paste of Makishima villain Kirito Kamui, and the ever-so-hated and quite irritating junior inspector Mika Shimotsuki. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that bugged me more than everything else, it would be just how similar this season was to the first. You might think that's a good thing, but when you have essentially the same villain with similar goals and methods, similar plot, and a similar ending, you'd feel a bit cheesed as well. Not that this was anime breaking or anything, but this coupled with a few other flaws that I\"ll explain later make at least nothing it useful. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise, Psycho-Pass 2 remains one of the best out there. A lot of people noticed some style changes from the first season that seem to work against this new season. This is mostly having to do with worse camera angels, less of a focus on detail, and a lighter color template. But honestly, these things will only bug you if you're the most nit picky of person. This season still has far better art and animation than most other animes out there. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, there is nothing really spectacular here, but there also wasn't much in the 1st season as well. The best tracks play in the most intense moments of the anime, but otherwise Psycho-Pass 2 is usually pretty quiet. What Psycho-Pass 2 does do incredible, along with the 1st season, is their sound effects. Whether that be the blasts from the Dominators or the cries of the judged, there is no dip in quality whatsoever in this aspect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Oh boy. Another problem I had with the season. As I said earlier, we're introduced to a myriad of new characters, but this came at the cost of essentially ignoring the original characters for the entirety of this season --- Besides Akane of course. The biggest, and probably biggest problem most had with the show, was the complete and utter absence of Kogami. Though this wasn't a HUGE problem with me, as there were at least some dream cameos of him throughout, it's understandable why he wouldn't be in this season; What with how the 1st season ended and all. We're also getting a movie later on which will have Kogami back where he belongs. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as the new cast of characters seemed interesting (enough), I also would have liked some further development for the original characters like Yayoi and Ginoza. I barely understand why Ginoza was even considered a Main this season since he barely got any lines. The development and backstory we got for some of the new characters like Sakuya and Mika, however, was pretty impressive for just 11 episodes. Akane remained largely the same from start to finish, but she had already matured greatly from the first season anyway. \\n\\n\r\nDelving a bit more into the story, there's just no way this season can compare to the first. Makishima was a great villain, and this new Kirito kid felt like a bad copy and paste of him. Makishima had a set goal, while at the end of Psycho-Pass 2, I'm not even sure what Kirito wanted exactly, besides questioning everyone \"What Color?\". The first season I found myself questioning many of my morals, and this season just left me wondering what goals a lot of the characters had. So although the story and presentation and Psycho-Pass 2 is a far cry from the first, Psycho-Pass 2 still manages to hold a more meaningful and captivating story than a lot of other top-name animes out there. It's by no means bad, but there is definitely a drop in quality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Psycho-Pass 2 can't hold a candle to the first season, but it definitely holds  a bright and powerful lantern to most other animes in the same genre. Ultimately, this felt like a filler arc for whatever else is to come in the Psycho-Pass series, but one of the best pseudo-filler arcs you'll ever see. If you're a Psycho-Pass fan, you have no good reason to not watch this. Will you be disappointed by it? Slightly, at least, but as long as you don't come in expecting a masterpiece above the first season, this should satisfy any and all Psycho-Pass fans.",

            "content": "I'm probably going to receive a lot of hate and criticism for this, but please spare the hate until AFTER you've read this review. Also, please forgive my bad grammar during this review as English is not my first language even though I speak it so well. I aim to do a simple review with a little complex vocabulary so it remains easy to read and understand by everyone.(contains spoilers, so be wary of reading before finishing it.)\r\nPsycho-pass 2, is the sequel to the first season of Psycho-pass 1 which is set in an advanced, systematic future where humans have things called crime coefficients andA mental I.D. called a Psycho-Pass. I won't delve much deeper into it so I'll assume everyone has seen the first season.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main point and the audience'ss failure to enjoy this season was the lack of Kogami. Kogami Shinya, who was the main character of Psycho-pass 1 had been expected to return after the end of season 1 where he *SPOILER*killed Makshima Shogo, myself included. This built up high expectations of this season which, unfortunately, didn't happen. That caused the rating of the show to overall decrease by fans and even dropping the series. Regardless of this, Psycho-pass 2 is VERY MUCH INDEED a well done sequel.\\n\\n\r\nART [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the art and animation. Since this was more of a revenue sequel rather than a immediate sequel, the studio that originally worked on Psycho-pass, production I.G., has given the main production to Tatsunoko Production which obviously means we're going to have a lesser animation art style from the greatness of season 1's. Thank goodness it didn't turn out that way much. The art style remained the same, the animation felt like it had some forced scenes at certain times and wasn't as good the first few episodes, but eventually that problem was fixed and it was almost like watching the first one.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nNot Much to say about the sound, since they reused the OST and added some tracks I think? The opening song sounded fantastic and felt a little like the first opening of the first season. The ending was amazing, as expected of EGOIST.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow, while it wasn't as amazing as the first, here's the story part of Psycho-pass 2, the one urobutcher didn't write but someone else did. You've got the PSBC Investigation division with a few new members and even a new unknow villian, sounds like it's going to turn out just like the first season right? No. The whole way this season is done goes against  the values and ideals of the first season, with the preventing of crimes from going unpunished,to the killing of people to maintain justice. While in this season, the main theme is asking us \"What color?\" as in what psycho-pass reading do you have? or what is the color of your soul? It leaves it to the viewer to come up with his/her own view of what the theme means. In all honesty that was really well done and a brilliant idea, many others could agree on. The only real issue with the story is that it didn't have as much to it as the first psycho-pass because it was purely character development that helped this time around.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow here is where the REAL goodness comes from that surpasses psycho-pass 1's quality. All the way from the physical and mental states of characters, their origins, and even their ideals are what really surprised me this time  around  in psycho-pass 2.\\n\r\nTHE PSBCDF\\n\r\nFirst of all, Akane Tsunemori. Akane is the head inspector of division 1 of the PSBCDF where she formerly was a subordinate of Ginoza, who is now an enforcer. She has taken on the role of Kogami and has made reckless decisions, excellent deductions, as well as perfectly tracking down and understanding the state not only her enemy is in, but also her colleagues. She has developed very well in this season other than in the end where she (SPOILER) decided to trust in Sibyl's actions and to arrest Kamui Kirito, whom we'll talk about in a bit. Togane Sakuya and Mika Shimotsuki, two rookies who joined the PSBCDF and are under direct supervision of akane, have their own side story in which Mika has discovered that togane Sakuya is in fact, the son of togane misako, who is a member of sibyl and the PSBCDF chief(one of them at least). Mika is probably the most hated character in Psycho-pass, being spectacle and overall a bitch towards akane and most of everyone in the PSBC, save Yayoi. We soon later find out that she actually has insecurities about her psycho-pass becoming worse and she forces herself to work with sibyl just to maintain clear. and sakuya togane, as people would say, has a mother complex and his job is to make people's minds pitch black. There isn't much else to talk about other than the inspector who was made \"clear\" by kamui, and Saiga Jouji who makes people's hues worse just from talking to him which is neato.\\n\r\nThe Kamui Faction and SIBYL\\n\r\nKirito kamui, an antagonist to the sibyl system, who has the minds of a 100+ people put into him which prevents him from being judged by the sibyl system is most possibly the best type of antagonist that came into psycho-pass since makshima shogo. While he is the antagonist, he plays a role that makes him look like the good guy and the PSBCDF the bad guys, meaning that he has a whole faction to help him achieve his objectives and judge sibyl. He never intended to escape unharmed or alive after he proved that sibyl was able to be judged, he just wanted a system that was truly capable of judging correctly which meant judging itself rather than just judging others. So he forcibly caused it to develop and have the ability to judge groups as one coefficient. That in perspective was a big improvement to an antagonist compared to makshima shougo, who just aimed to mess around and know the truth. The dialogue seemed more what actual inspectors would say and it felt more natural so it felt easier to understand and see what they were trying to do this time around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nPsycho-Pass 2 did have it's issues and little problems there and here, but it wasn't enough to break my high enjoyment of it, especially during the gory/psychological scenes during it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-All Psycho Pass 2 wasn't the greatest of sequels out there, but it isn't as bad as one would think considering the main character isn't the same badass we all know and love, and that you should watch this with the expectations of how sibyl and akane will turn out rather than how kogami would show up. Is this worth watching before the movie? hell yes, this season is mostly a set-up for the movie so for sure it is what you should watch before the movie. Thank you for reading my review and I hope you might have changed your mind and thought a little better about Psycho-pass 2, if you haven't, please comment on my profile what you thought was bad about this season and I'll be willing to discuss it with anyone :).",

            "content": "This review will assume no knowledge of season 1 of Psycho pass and thus provide no spoilers, although the first season is as good as the second and I recommend you to watch that season first. Obviously :P\r\nPsycho pass 2 was produced by Production I.G and aired during winter 2014. It belongs to the crime, thriller and dystopian genre and it is a show that delivers when it comes to suspense and entertainment. PP2 only has 11 episodes whereas the first season had 22 episodes although even despite the small number of episodes, it is action packed straight off the bat.\r\nPsycho Pass 2 is setin the future, during the year 2113. Here in a Japanese dystopia, the city in which where the story is set is governed by what is known as the Sibyl System. This system is constantly checking and measuring the stress levels, mental states, personalities as well as the chances of individuals committing crime using \u201ccymatic scans\u201d (where they scan the brain). What results from a scan is referred to as a Psycho pass and acts as a crime index. Depending on how high this index is, an individual is dealt with, often jailed or killed if they have too high a Psycho pass. The population has accepted this as the system and as a result try to live normal lives while keeping their thoughts and actions in check.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Akane Tsunemori, an inspector promoted to unit one-part of the police force in the criminal investigations sector. She works alongside enforcers, who are latent criminals with a high crime coefficient who are deemed to be allowed to work alongside inspectors and together with their dominators (weapons which will change form to kill or apprehend as necessary), they try to keep the city in check and enforce Sibyl. Akane is a kind and caring individual however she is no pushover, she can make hard choices and remain level headed, a lot of which results from here personality and the events which unfold in season 1. She will often try and not resort to killing criminals and often tries any other method if possible however she isn\u2019t afraid to kill either. She is very controlled and can keep a low index even unders stress.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, members of the police force start to be killed or kidnapped. This is coupled with terrorist style attack in the cities and even when the perpetrators are captured, Sibyl fails to detect their criminal nature. As a result we have a situation where there are criminals who are able to do as they please and as Sibyl cannot detect their nature, they can do as they please. Effectively, they are invisible to the system. This throws up various problems as Akane and her force try to pin down the man behind all these acts and every episode racks up the tension and there is a good mix of action and tension as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is really interesting about Psycho Pass in general is the concept. After all who has the right to judge whether someone is totally evil or represents a threat in the future. Can short term paranoia really lead to problems in the long run- do you really need to kill someone whose index has risen up due to an intense situation? After all, can the Sibyl system really be 100% perfect? There are a lot of questions that will crop up every episode that will keep you thinking about what is wrong and right and what is even more interesting is how there is never a black or white answer. Sometimes it really is the lesser of two evils. The show make you question your own viewpoints too, sometimes you might not like what occurs although you may feel it had to be done. Or did it? The characters themselves all play their roles rather well, the main characters do feel different and not clich\u00e9d for the most part. Side characters are well done too and have significant effects on the overall show.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering it is a detective styled show, Psycho Pass does a good job of keeping the suspense up and it can be a case of just one more episode, I promise! There are enough major twists and turns that keep you coming back and make you think \u201coh, didn\u2019t see that coming\u201d. However there are some respects in which I felt the show fell short. The most obvious is that 11 episodes is simply too short, while it is punchy and keep short and sweet, with a concept as intriguing as this one and the characters present, the short episode span does Psycho Pass 2 no favours. In fact due to the length, the way that the show is wrapped up can feel a little bit unsatisfactory. The ending feels as if it has come and gone too fast, after all the build-up, it certainly feels like a let-down. For a show like this, it really does feel like an injustice and instead of leaving you with that feeling all good anime do after a great end, it leaves you wanting more and not in a good way either. That isn\u2019t to say the end is terrible but just that it could have lived up to the hype a tad more and been made an episode longer- it was an ending that was average (but not bad I stress).\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style of the entire show was extremely well done, the darker colours especially stood out and complemented the nature of the show. Buildings, backgrounds, fight scenes, all of them had superb animation and it certainly felt futuristic. The OP and ED were both on the upper end of average, although the first 10 seconds of the ED are my favourite before all the screaming kicks in. The soundtracks were fairly complementary to the action however it was the dialogue that really made the scenes for me so there isn\u2019t really much the soundtracks added to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show however is an enjoyable watch, especially if you like a bit of cat and mouse action and more! For shows just like it I would recommend Death Note, if you haven\u2019t seen it already. There is a movie that will be released soon too for PP so keep a look out!\\n\\n\r\nTukky12\\n\r\n=)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8.5",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nA Dystopia or Not?--Absolute Justice and Self-Determination\r\nI. A Disturbing Ending: Self-Justified System and Absolute Justice\r\nThe ending of the season 2 has provided a final solution for the self-evolution of the Sibyl system, and left an especially innovative and disturbing comma, if not the period, of the story for the viewers. It is innovative because after the development of the collective Psycho-pass measurement, the Sibyl system can be brought in front of the judgment which issued by itself, and under such circumstances, there are no individuals can escape this absolute order since the judge itself, or judges themselves have to face the samelaw. Therefore, the society and the socio-political order that depicted by this show have become morally self-consistent ones. The previous contradictions within the self-justification of the Sibyl system and the order it has imposed on the whole society have been eliminated. It is this point that differentiates the show from many other dystopian works, for there are no dictator, no deliberate oppression, and no obvious sacrifice of a group of people for the interest of another group of people. The law and order developed by this fictional world, though cold-blooded, sometimes even terrifying, is able to realise a form of justice in the sense that everyone is equal in front of the law and literally no exceptions can be permitted. And for most of the people who live in that society under the control of such order, there is more or less a happy life awaiting. As one time the heroin Tsunemori imagined her old friend, who were killed in the first season\u2019s show, asking her in self-doubt that if she had lived a happy life when she was alive, though she was a little bit lazy, not clever, had limited choices in life and no further aim or ambition, the answer was a definite \u201cYes\". \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, this ending is quite disturbing. As viewers, we have to ask this question after we finishing watching this special show: is this a society that we would accept? If not, what will be the main reason to reject it, when it can be self-justified intellectually and seemingly morally? Intuitively, we would say no to it. It seems that, at first glance, it is not a desirable society compared with the one in which we are living. But we cannot instantly think of a very valid rejection when we have considered all aspects of its self-justification. Moreover, if we neglect various bloody and violent scenes that highlighted in the show (which means that the real practice of such socio-political order in an imaginable way might be much more mild than what we have witnessed), and if we just examine the Sybil system in the show\u2019s own settings (that this is a chaotic world after a series of wars and Japan with the \u201cequipment\u201d of the Sybil system is one of the few regions that could keep a peaceful order), we may have fewer reasons to reject it. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, one ambiguity points to the question that is this society a genuine dystopia or not? Evidently, it is not a utopia since initially it has not been conceived as a society better than us. But its dystopian features are also not very distinctive compared with other works in a similar strand. On the one hand, it has already been motioned that this society seems to be morally self-consistent. On the other hand, it also has a moderate and practical ultimate aim, which is to keep a peaceful and ordinary domestic social order. Many other dystopian worlds, in contrast, would have a much more ambitious purpose like improvement of the mankind or transforming the way of human life through new technologies. They try to display a way of life that apparently not better, but most of the time an alternative one compared to what we already have. From this perspective, the Sybil system, which no doubt contains high degree of technology, is just trying to provides an old-form way of life which is not very distinctive from which we are familiar with, and a practical solution within a chaotic world, although inevitably under some new conditions and limitations. So the central question still lies on what grounds we could consider the society as a dystopia and fully reject it as a practical response to a chaotic social order. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, we could easily identify a major problem of this society that makes us feel morally unacceptable. After all, its peaceful order is based on a systematic and sometimes dogmatic exclusion of a group of people in this society. It is not a fair order because the excluded are deprived of all the rights to live a normal life, though with a chance to regain the opportunities if one recovers from the \u201cmuddy\u201d psycho-pass state. If someone could be put into the isolation centres just because of his or her temporary mental state, it is unfair to those who naturally carry a high psycho-pass disposition or fall into a condition that would increase psycho-pass only by chance. Actually this unfairness of the Sybil system society might be the main reason why it feels intuitively unacceptable according to our modern moral standards. Yet, such a society can hardly be called a dystopian one. Even if we do not borrow Foucault\u2019s criticism on the modern human society that has reflected a quite similar picture of systematically excluding people with certain \u201cdefects\u201d that are considered deviant from the normal society, we could still see a multitude of similar cases that have appeared in the human history. Exclusions based on gender, ethnic groups, races, to name but a few, are all not unfamiliar in our history, and we could still witness such phenomena in our daily lives. Hence, in this aspect, the Sybil system society is not an unfair dystopian world that possesses greater evil than that of us. And it is also imaginable that through the possible improvements and designs of the Psycho-pass measurement, the standards for the law enforcement, and the recovering facilities and methods, etc., when technology develops and the Sybil system expands, the formerly explicit exclusions will become more implicit and less offensive. Such changes will naturally come into beings if this society continues to develop, since it coincides with Sybil system\u2019s own logic that its ultimate aim is to keep a peaceful order. There are no reasons for it not to implement such measures if they could reduce dissatisfactions and further harmonise the society. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, when we look back to the major invention of this science fiction, and also which would seems to be the symbolic dystopian feature, the constitution of the Sybil system, we might find it less alienated than we initially feel. One way it could justify itself is that actually it is not a form of artificial intelligence that controls the human society, but pure human intelligence with the support of the highly developed biotechnology. In this sense, although quite different from our common sense, it still can be counted as a form of self-government of human beings, not government by machines or high-level AI like in many other dystopian works. An instant response to this system, apart from a natural antipathy to such a human minds combination, would claim that it is still a system that subjected to authoritative and maybe arbitrary decisions of some people, and it cannot breed true justice if a society\u2019s fate is determined by a number of outliers. But this problem has been solved after the collective psycho-pass measurement was adopted. The outliers are also included in the whole system and are subjected to the law made by them. And based on the settings of the first season of the show, the Sybil system can continue absorb individuals with criminally asymptomatic feature or other distinctive features to improve its diversity. Based on the setting of the show\u2019s ending, the system can renew itself and replace the old members with newcomers from the society. Under such circumstances, the society and its judges are closely interlocked as a fate-sharing community. They are not isolated as an authoritative ruler and the rest who are ruled any more. To use a literally fitting but meaningfully a slight different analogy, the Sybil system can even be seen as \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people\u201d. Only the second \u201cpeople\u201d here does not indicate every member of the society, instead they are \u201celites\u201d who naturally possess certain features. So in the end it is more like the perfect form of \u201cphilosopher kings government\u201d than a popular control democracy. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily make the Psycho-pass society a dystopia. \\n\\n\\n\r\nII. Slave, or Man As His Own Master?\\n\\n\r\nWhat will, then, be the reason for us to consider this society as a dystopia and fully reject it? How should we solve this \u201cpuzzle\u201d if the above accounts are not convincing enough to characterise the society in Psycho-pass as a dystopia? In fact the show does give us a clue to reflect on this question if we try to examine its main characters. Although in the first place it was the genius rebel Makishima who is Criminally Asymptomatic in the show\u2019s first season renouncing this system and it was the main male character K\u014dgami who had to go into exile after he defied the will of the Sybil system and lynched Makishima, and even if the rebel Kamui in the end of the second season became satisfied with the solution to incorporate Sybil system itself into the psycho-pass system and accepted his death peacefully, it is the heroin, Tsunemori, who still firmly rejected the legitimacy of the system after it has evolved into a more just form. Before joining the police department, she was an innocent and outstanding graduate who lived a normal life, had close friends, and followed the instructions of the Sybil system as others did and achieved the highest score in the capability assessment test. So, what changed her views towards the whole system after two years experience as a law enforcement agent? What is the source of the influence? Has her position in the system also changed after all these stories? \\n\\n\r\nIf we want to explore the reason behind her firm rejection, we need to place ourselves in this society, and to examine it inside from Tsunemori's point of view and try to feel what she feels. Since she naturally possesses a very low degree of psycho-pass coefficient and a high capability according to the standards set by the Sibyl system, Tsunemori is a pure beneficiary of this society. Yet in the last scenes, we saw a lonely figure who turned her back towards the system and finished a cigarette by herself in her department, a habit that she acquired after K\u014dgami\u2019s leaving, and the cigarette\u2019s brand K\u014dgami\u2019s favourite. Though she is and will be determined, she is alone and dissatisfied as well. The dissatisfaction comes from her not agreeing with the Sybil system and the effect that the imposed order has caused to the society, it also comes from the fact that starting from this point, she has no companions, no friends, and does not belong to the both sides of the society. She is not a member of the majority anymore, and this detachment process started from the moment she became a police working for the Sybil system, and completed after her former close friend was killed and she witnessed the real constitution of the system. Nor she is a member working for the system as instructed anymore, and since she rejected the offer to be absorbed into the Sybil system, she is not a member within them as well. Thus it becomes that she does not belong to this whole community that interlocked by the system and the society. She is not within the One and hence she is Another One, an outlier, like those who rebelled and those who were exiled. She becomes self-determined, acting only upon her own will, and here exactly lies all the loneliness. \\n\\n\r\nIt is interesting that in an interview the writer of the first season\u2019s script were asked about Tsunemori\u2019s thought and hope, he replied that \u201cTsunemori\u2019s justice is the spirit of democracy, therefore she is not satisfied with Sybil system\u2019s obscurantism. She thinks that the procedures have their values even if they do not have concrete meanings.\u201d But is this really what in her mind and the feelings lingering in her heart? What lies behind \u201cthe spirit of democracy\u201d and how should we interpret it in the context of Tsunemori\u2019s story? As her final refusal to the Sybil system stating that \u201cit should not be the society to determine a future for the people. It should be the people to choose a future for the society.\u201d She is not satisfied because under the control of the Sybil system, she sees no room for genuine autonomous choices. However, we still need to ask what does it truly mean to have choices for the people in the society? What does it mean to Tsunemori, if she admitted that her friend once lived a happy life without thinking much about choices and autonomy? \\n\\n\r\nIn the newly released Psycho-pass movie, we are able to compare a Sybil system society with a more primitive form of social order\u2014a community of a rebel army. After his exile, K\u014dgami left Japan and went to this region to help the rebel army to resist the implement of the Sybil system. Tsunemori encountered him and tried to convince him to go back to Japan. She failed, but she also once again experienced genuineness in the interactions with K\u014dgami and witnessed a sense of brotherhood and family-hood in the community of the rebel army which she could seldom feel in the Sybil system society. They are something that can even be nurtured in a chaotic and unstable society but cannot exist in a peaceful psycho-pass society. Certain essential elements for an individual to become a human being have been shadowed by the order of absolute justice of the Sybil system society. \\n\\n\r\nConsequently, as a lonely figure that stands in the whole system, Tsunemori's dissatisfaction also derives from a natural longing as an ultimate individual. It is a longing for companionship, for friendship, for a kind of intimacy that includes trust and deep mutual understanding, for those human interactions which can penetrate one\u2019s heart and soul, for forming relationships which we can find in this show that only self-determined individuals are capable of. A life that is not ultimately self-determined cannot nurture such relationships, and sacrifice would be meaningless in this Sybil system society. Without struggles for autonomous choices when one is faced with a dilemma, and without a certain degree of sacrifice for another human being or for values larger than oneself, a deep personal relationship and genuine mutual understanding cannot be formed. Such a friendship will be missing when there is not enough room for deeply emotional tangling and a choice made fully upon one\u2019s will. It is ironic that in the show the enemies of the system and whom despised by the system often have more trust and mutual understandings with each other. Instead, the attempts to self-define and the pursuits of autonomous choices in interpersonal relationship within the system lead to scenarios like son against father or friendship abandoned. Therefore, Tsunemori's rejection to the Sybil system can also be seen as a natural response and a renouncement. A response to a society that eliminated every single self-determined individual. And a renouncement to a system that should be responsible for her loneliness. \\n\\n\r\nThen it becomes evident that the truly excluded in this society is not people with unstable mental state, but individuals with a self-autonomous mind. The dystopian feature of this fictional world finally emerges in the full scale, and it is the extinguishment of the self-determination. The Sybil system society is not one filled with tyranny, disorder, or sense of insecurity. It is a peaceful and just society, yet after all, a \u201cslavenised\u201d one. People become slaves in respect that they have to give up the ultimate self-determination in order to live a peaceful and happy life. Although it is imaginable that they still possess an amount of choices in their daily life, the area for autonomy is limited and has been delineated. Within this sphere they can be free from interference, even make self-realisation to a certain degree, but still it can be said that they live a slave-like life because once exceeding this sphere, they are no longer masters of themselves and the final realisation of ones life is determined by the whole system. People degraded to the worst form of \u201cthe last man\u201d in the sense of Kojeve\u2019s and Fukuyama\u2019s conceptions. A full self-realisation becomes impossible, since the final source of control, to determine someone to do this rather than that, lies beyond one\u2019s sphere of autonomy. \\n\\n\r\nFrom this perspective, the spirit of democracy that the producer of this show talked about, and the statement Tsunemori made when she rejected the system, are all demonstrations of self-autonomy, other than the procedures of democracy per se. And the revolution that was tried by Makishima in the first season, was not equipped with a better social envision, instead, it was just an attempt to reclaim the right of self-determination from the whole system. \\n\\n\r\nAnd more importantly, the image of a slave is actually first and foremost represented not by an individual in the society, but by the Sybil system itself. Before it incorporated itself into the whole system, this socio-political order is at most an autocratic one. After the combination of the Sybil system and the society, a full circle of absolute control has been created, and no one or any group could evade this cage of \u201cabsolute justice\u201d. From now on, even the Sybil system cannot turn the direction of the society, and becomes a slave of this whole system for it also loses the control to determine itself to do this rather than that. More like a highly efficient machine that execute an absolute will, the logic of actions has been set beforehand and the later will cannot exceed this. Moreover, collective measurement means that the sphere for personal autonomy is further decreased, and the worst scenario would be that it would rule out any room and possibility for genuine self-determination, since everything becomes collectively based and each personal action can be scrutinised by a collective. Finally, a solution that was meant to solve the problem of the Sybil system has made it into a complete form of dystopia, a dystopia that extinguish any possibilities for personal autonomy in the practice of a true absolutely just order. Wisely enough, in the last scene of the second season, the Sybil system pointed out this possible scenario to Tsunemori, and attributed it to her decision. Tsunemori, on the other hand, holds a more positive prospect of the evolution of the society. Although I doubt there will be any further authentic solutions and a way out, I look forward to the subsequent stories, if there would be any.",

            "content": "After watching the first season of psycho pass a few months back, I was extremely excited when I heard about season 2. Now it has just finished and I cant say I am disappointed but at the same time it wasn't perfect. It felt like they couldn't fit it all into 11 episodes and it was squeezed in there. When you see  the final episode you might understand, it felt like so much happened in 24 minutes, they could've fit all of that with more detail into a few episodes. Anyways, to the ratings.\r\nStory 10/10: \r\nDespite it feeling rushed I thought the plot wasbrilliant, the ideas were amazing. I would like to list a few but I wont spoil, however it is definitely worth watching just for the story all together, that's how good it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: \\n\r\nThe area and scenery of the anime was decent, sometimes I didn't really know where they were or how they got there though. But for the art itself it looks like they did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nI was a fan of the OST from the first season and cant say this OST bothers me, kinda nice. As for other sounds in the show they did a pretty good job it felt like the sounds went perfectly for stuff like the dominator.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: \\n\r\nEverything was good except kamui's character looked a bit odd, I cant really pick out what it is just something doesn't look right haha. Overall its not really that bad though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI did enjoy this but definitely not as much as the first season. I have to say though I was excited to watch a new episode every Thursday because I was wondering what would happen next, most anime's I would just wait a few days after the episode release and then watch. So this shows something I suppose :p\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: \\n\r\nAs I said before psycho pass season 1 was much better, if you haven't seen that for some reason and you are already hitting season 2, go watch that first and then come here. But overall it was a very good anime and I probably would rewatch it eventually.\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helped, pls watch this anime!!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TLDR: Still good, but missing some elements from PP1\r\nShould you watch this if you've watched the first one? It may not be necessary, but I feel like the hole for wanting more that I had in my heart has been filled. \r\nThe art and sound were very consistent with the first season. The animation quality is superb; the character's design is beautiful and the scenery (and imagery) presented is nice to look at. 9/10 for art. The OP and ED are some of the best for fall 2014. I listened to both for each episode and greatly enjoyed it. All the other music fits nicewith what is being illustrated. 9/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters continuing from last season held up, but were dragged back by the less engaging Togane and Mika. Kirito was a great villain (not as fun to watch as Makeshima), and made up for that a bit, but the new characters weren't up to par with the Ginoza and Kogami sidestories from the first season. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't too riveting and felt off, somehow. It was ok overall, but what was missing was the sidelined characters in place of an uninteresting Mika + Togane route. It felt like it didn't lead to anything and didn't surpass my expectations. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI still greatly enjoyed this, my second favorite show for thursday's in fall 2014 (Shigatsu 2 stronk). Every episode was consistent from the start. Where other series' may start worse and snowball into something fantastic, PP2 starts at about 75% intensity and stays there; this, of course, means that it doesn't pick up hard near the end.  7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give it an 72/100, or 7/10. Not great, still good, but missing those key characters from PP1. If you've watched the first season, this is a must watch. \\n",

            "content": "I'm honestly so confused on why Psycho-Pass gets so much hate... I was looking at some reviews before I went into season 2 and saw allot of people saying \"Just skip it, it'll make the anime much better\" but that's not necessarily the case. I expected season 2 to be kind of like FMA Brotherhood's movies, complete trash and honestly not worth watching even if you loved FMA as much as I did. But Psycho-Pass 2 wasn't anything like that.\r\nDon't get me wrong, i'm not saying that Psycho-Pass 2 holds up to season one. Season one was absolutely AMAZING, season 2 wasn't the same. Isuspect that season 2 was hated so much because unlike season 1, it didn't have you hooked and didn't make you think as much. It was like a lazy version of season one. Well I admit that was disappointing considering the reason I loved season one so much was because of how it made you think and generally felt allot smarter and well done, I wouldn't say it was bad because of that. Season 2 was nothing when compared to season one... However that's the problem, you're comparing it to season one. \\n\\n\r\nComparing season 1 and season 2 is really a BAD decision, see season one was this beautiful masterpiece of mystery and literature. It was an anime that not everyone was going to get the references to literature quotes. Season 2 doesn't focus on that at all, season 2's goal was to take this corrupted government and finish off it's story. They didn't focus on making this huge story with layers and layers of information to unveil. Most of this was because of two reasons. 1. Season 2 only had 11 episodes and fitting in lots of detail would leave little time to close out the show in a proper manner. 2. Season 1 consumed most of the mysteries about the government so they only thing they could reveal secrets about is the new staff and Kamui.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is nothing when compared too season 1, but comparing season one to season 2 is like comparing a professional athlete to someone on a high school team. Of course the professional athlete is going to be better than the person on a highschool team, he's had more time to practice so all around he's going to be a better player. But that doesn't mean that the highschool player is bad... I definitely think you should at least give season 2 a shot, it's not as bad as people make it out to be.",

Nothing in the first season was inherently bad, yet that is not the case here. The sound directing, voice acting, directing, pacing, etc. is all executed poorly. I would love to give it a (1), BUT, it at least tries to be good. It extends on its premise. Even if it does so completely nonsensically. It makes sense in the eyes of the anime and in the eyes of the creator. For that and that alone, this avoids a score of (1) from me. Given thatwe understand what it's trying to do, we shouldn't judge it so harshly. Regardless, don't watch this. It's complete trash and it doesn't make much sense, in any matter. It starts really bad, then it somewhat stabilizes and ends on a high note (again, assuming it made sense in the writer's eyes).",

            "content": "Psycho-Pass 2 has an ability to keep you wanting to watch the next episode. While I often see a lot of complaints about the story, I honestly didn't have an issue with it until the very end. Yeah, it mimics a lot of the same things from the first season so it might come out as stale, like the main villain having a psycho-pass that can't be read, but his true motives and the like remain hidden and there are more moving parts within these 11 episodes.\r\nThe pacing is wonderful right until the last episode when things go a little out of whack. Each plottwist and reveal is done at the perfect time. You just think you know whats going to happen next when they toss you a complete curveball, and not one from left field, but one that you kind of see in your peripheral but brush aside until it's right in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters though, are not very compelling. Akane, while as a character is awesome, is not challenged at all this season like she was in the first one and therefore nothing really happens to her. If anything she's a major hand in bringing the conclusion. Kamui has an interesting plan but he himself is somewhat boring. Don't get me wrong, he has a lot of backstory, but he takes a step back to his plan. Mika (the recruit from the end of S1) was a chance to do something with a blank slate, but instead they just use her as an annoyance. Oh, and Tougane, they telegraph hes bad news from the start, but when they reveal why and his \"ability\" it seems like a bad plot device.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and action are very good. Maybe the animation is not as good as the first season, but as a visual show it's very pleasing to watch. Even the combat sequences are well thought out. It also has a noticeably fitting soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nPsycho-Pass S2 is a well crafted ride with bland characters. Not even overall bad characters, just ones that are not fleshed out or dont get treatment. They don't even serve a purpose to give another character development, because of a widespread mindset of refusal to change, ironically, it's the Sybil system itself that changes the most in the show, and the change is somewhat underwhelming to what could have happened.\\n\\n\r\nPP2 has a lot of missed opportunities, but it does a lot in the 11 episodes it has to work with. 7/10",

The second half turned into the chase and the actual plot. What I loved about the second season is that it is far more darker that the first. There is far more death, blood, and so forth which made it extremely enjoyable. The plot itself was really good, but I feel that something that was lacking in season 2 was the characters. I absolutely despised certain characters. I actually wished death upon them. Either way, season 2 is really enjoyablebecause of the amount of mystery in it.

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 Bad story, boring characters, good art, OK sound, frustrating to watch.\r\nThe show has a pretty clear idea/premise that it feeds down your throat at every chance: \u201cA future where our lives are controlled by computers is flawed; here is an 11 episode anime about why.\u201d The creators must\u2019ve thought that the idea was cool and interesting (and it is), but they also must\u2019ve looked over the fact that any cool idea quickly becomes dreadfully boring when repeated a million times just in other words. Watching this show is like being in science class: We know that \u201cf=ma\u201d but the teacher just keeps givingus problems to practice how to use this really simple equation. \\n\r\nThe first season had the same problem of repeating itself and rehashing old ideas/concepts/ideas; it was a shame to see it repeated in the second season. Especially because after the main story of the first season was over, the only reason to watch this show was for its new characters and possibly different plot. But instead the second season is just more repetition of the \u201cwhy computers ruling humans is bad\u201d idea.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the story being incredibly boring and repetitive, the characters are also uninteresting and stale. In the first 6 episodes we were introduced to 6 new characters (new in the sense that they were introduced in this season, not carried over from season 1) that we, the viewers were supposed to care about. By episode 6, one of those characters had gotten less than 5 minutes of screen time, two had died (one of which in the same episode they were introduced), one had changed personalities with a complete 180 without any explanation, and the other was extremely annoying (so much that I had to skim through her dialogue). The only new character that I showed the slightest bit of interest was Enforcer Sakuya Tougane, who seemed to be up-to-something which I unfortunately will never know because I have to drop this god-awful show right now. To sum this paragraph up: the viewer can\u2019t give a single shit about any of these unmemorable, stale, and seemingly disposable characters, while interesting characters are the second biggest selling point of a season two following a successful season one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is exceptional as it is very well made. The colorization is very dark and pale, which creates a certain aesthetic that compliments the story. The art style is actually very good at making gore look realistic, to the point that some scenes really had my stomach turn. The only negative comment I have is that the way peoples\u2019 eyes are drawn is eerie to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is terrible. Sound effects are repeated a lot with no variation, stock sounds are used (listen whenever something metal is hit), and there isn\u2019t too much attention to detail. Sound effects are only used for big events you can\u2019t miss. Meaning you won\u2019t hear small details like a chair exhaling when someone sits down. I personally love it when a show goes above and beyond with sound design with small touches like that. The only reason why I raised the score from a 3 to a 4 is the soundtrack, which is really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nNow the misc. section where I can rant:\\n\\n\r\nWhat the fuck is up with this world? The story goes on in this futuristic dystopian statist Japan where the government keeps records on everything about its citizens including their mental health and the police can\u2019t remotely shut down their own military servers? Who the fuck was in charge of cyber security? How couldn\u2019t the fucking military detect thousands of random TCP connections to their servers? Aside from that, why don\u2019t guns exist? I was told by someone that \u201cpeople in that world are doctored to trust the dominators unconditionally, they don\u2019t know any better\u201d which I think is bullshit. If two seasons aren\u2019t enough for the police to go \u201cHuh. These dominators almost never work against the type of irregular cases that we investigate and have cost the department more than a dozen lives. Maybe we should stop using weapons that are software based and prone to failure and switch to manual firearms\u201d, I don\u2019t know what is? Three seasons? How long until these characters overcome autism and realize that pointing a software controlled gun at a criminal that obviously can bypass detection (which we know because they have clearly shown us that they can in the past 5 episodes) doesn\u2019t work?\\n\r\nAs you can tell, the story is full of pot-holes and illogical things that make it very hard to watch. The tipping point for me was episode 6 because of how retarded it was, and now I wonder how I every kept going after episode 4. \\n\r\nAnd before you call me autistic or overly-attentive, watch the show yourself and tell me it doesn\u2019t make you frustrated that they would rather remove the holo from the game in episode 6 and risk citizen psycho-passes to be clouded rather than just shutting the game down entirely (which should be super easy to do given that the government, hence the police, has direct fucking root access to the server).\\n",

Firstly the basis here is weird. It starts off pretty damn good, the middle was iffy, and the end was anti-climatic. Being only eleven episodes, I wasn't expecting much; but what I got was...alright.\r\nKamui, Kirito is the main antagonist here, and while at first he may seem quite mysterious and interesting, it quickly devolves into a lazy revenge plot that really leads nowhere. Some of the characters this time around felt rather dull, too. Akane was way too uptight andShimotsuki, her \"sidekick\" was rather dull, and sometimes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the bad comes...some good though. While this season was definitely a huge letdown it definitely has its perks. For one, the music and sound is all great - - love the OP/EDs. The art however, does feel like a slight step down from the first season. Not too much detail this time around.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all I was disappointed. I can only really recommend this to anyone who's either a die-hard fan of the first season, or really likes cyberpunk. It's a 7.4/10 from me.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This review assumes you've read my one for the first season and have seen that season, as it will contain a couple of spoilers for that season.\r\nOverview:\r\nWhen \"Psycho Pass\" first aired in 2012, it took the anime world by storm with its Blade Runner-esque setting and highly compelling action and characters. Two years later, \"Psycho Pass 2\" attempted to continue the trend, but unfortunately fan opinions are split, to say the very least. Having seen the second season myself, however, I have to say I enjoyed it quite a lot, and believe that anyone who's seen the first season should at least check outthis one, even if it isn't quite as good as the first.\\n\\n\r\nStory & World (8.5/10):\\n\r\nIf there's one area \"Psycho Pass 2\" does improve upon compared to the first season, it's the story. Set a year and a half after the original, the now veteran Inspector Akane Tsunemori discovers that a whole new threat to the Sibyl system has emerged, in the form of a mysterious man named Kirito Kamui who, much like Makishima, is undetectable by Sibyl and has been committing mysterious crimes in secret. It is apparent largely from the start that the Kamui is not simply murdering at random but is in fact performing a massive experiment with one central purpose: finding out how exactly the Sybil system works, by studying the system's signature weapon, the Dominator. Once again, it's up to Akane, along with the Enforcers and her new partner Mika Shimotsuki, to track down this mysterious figure and bring him to justice.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the story better than that of the first season is that it's not obvious exactly what direction things are going in, and there are some genuine surprises here and there. We're also finally given some genuine insight into the Sibyl system and exactly how it came to be, learning not only about the system\u2019s origin but also about the possible alternatives to it and how they were ultimately dealt with. This in turn fleshes out the setting in new and interesting ways and sets the stage for upcoming iterations of the franchise, such as the trilogy of movies which are due to be released next year.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the Sibyl system, that brings me to another compelling part of the story- the morality. While the Sibyl system has always been portrayed as seriously flawed, here this is taken to a whole new level, as it has descended into complete hypocrisy, allowing a true psychopath to roam free while executing dozens of honest people who have done nothing but discover its secret. Kamui is also portrayed as being a lot more sympathetic than Makishima, as he genuinely wants to help people rather than just cause chaos. It gets to the point that if it weren't for Akane, who is still as heroic as they come, Kamui would come off as the GOOD guy. This does a fine job at ramming in messages that were only scraped upon in the first season, namely that it's wrong to judge people by who they are rather than what they have done, and as nice as it would be to get rid of someone before they are able to commit a crime, such a thing is not only impossible, it's just plain unfair. Admittedly, some may find the whole thing a bit rushed, as it's only half the length of the previous season, but overall, I consider the story to be a major improvement.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8.5/10):\\n\r\nIf you've seen the first season, the visuals will be very familiar, and that's a very good thing. They have aged brilliantly over the years and the characters and environments still look fantastic. Unfortunately, there is one really big problem within all of this- the gore. The use of gruesome imagery like people exploding when shot with the Dominator was a common criticism of the previous season, and what do the writers do? They turn it up to even higher levels! There's even a scene where people are running out of a building and are all shot by Dominators, so we get to see one gratuitous explosion after another. There is also more than a bit of body mutilation and physical torture, both implied and plain for all to see. I actually came very close to throwing up a couple of times, as the series is just that excessively violent.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9.5/10):\\n\r\nOnce again, the sound of \"Psycho Pass\" absolutely steals the show. There aren't many noteworthy tracks that weren't in the previous season, but considering how good the music was, there didn't really need to be. The voice acting is also just as good as it was in the first season, as not only do all the returning characters keep their voices, but there are also a number of new voice actors including Colleen Clinkenbeard, Christopher Sabat and Monica Rial (three of my all-time favourites). The only thing that keeps the sound from getting 10 is that it lacks all the literature references there were in the previous season, though I found this to be forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThis is unfortunately one area that's definitely not as good as the first season. The biggest reason for this is the absence of Shinya Kogami, who, due to the end of the first season, is restricted only to a couple of cameo appearances here, which some may find disappointing. Taking his place is Mika Shimotsuki, whom some may remember as the school girl from the previous season, who lost two of her friends to a psychopath. Because of her past, Mika has a very biased opinion of latent criminals, believing that if the Sibyl system says they deserve to die, they do, no questions asked. While this does allow us to see things from a perspective other than Akane's, it also makes her, for a lack of a better word, a bitch. However, we see that she has a good relationship with Yayoi, who comforted her after losing her friends, so it's clear that she at least has the decency to accept that there's one decent person among latent criminals.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point of issue is the new villain, the aforementioned Kirito Kamui. I said before that he would come off as the hero if it weren't for Akane, but whether or not you'd root for him is a different matter. While he's certainly terrifying for the first few episodes, due to him performing experiment after experiment to find out the functions of the Dominator, as we learn more about him, he starts to feel like less of a character and more of an odd entity (I won't spoil how, of course), and ultimately feels rather underwhelming compared to Makishima, even if he is certainly more sympathetic. Ultimately, it's not the character himself that compelled me, but his goals, actions and motivations. \\n\\n\r\nNow we'll move on to the good parts. Akane was already my favourite character, but here she absolutely steals the show. In the first episode alone, she shows just how far she's come since her recruitment by calmly using her negotiation skills to talk down a criminal who was using bombs to attack the PSB, which gets his Psycho-Pass into the non-danger zone, allowing her to stun him and bring him in instead of killing him. It really is amazing to see how she's able to retain her optimism and idealism even after everything she's seen and been through. Additionally, there's a number of great new characters to replace the old ones, Ginoza is no longer the asshole he was in the previous season, and while it is very hard to like Mika at times, her character is ultimately well-rounded and sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nI have to be honest; while it is great that the writers have improved on the story considerably over the first season, it's come at the cost of it being a pretty depressing watch. It really shows that the Sibyl system isn't a law worth protecting, no matter how necessary it may be to maintain the peace. Then, there's all the psychological torture that various characters are put through- including Akane as the villains push against her natural ability to rebound from psychological stress and attempt to break her irrevocably. In other words, there are more than a few truly messed up moments and if you don't have the stomach for it, well, that's perfectly understandable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Psycho Pass 2\" is a worthy sequel to the fantastic original season. It won't win prizes for pacing and some of the new characters are a bit iffy, but as second seasons go, this is one I believe any fan of the first season should at least try, even if not everyone will be satisfied. For more on \"Psycho Pass\", be sure to await my review for the 2015 movie, which I hope to have written by the end of the year.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8.5+8.5+9.5+8+8=42.5/50=8.5/10",

Besides that, this isn't really feel a sequel to me\r\nOf course it's the different one..\r\nThe plot was indeed not the same as season 1 which is utilized when the Sibyl System has been planning to put a collective entity in the system so that Sibyl must judge itself, so nothing too complex there. A collective Psycho-Pass would mean that groups of people could be judged as dangerous even though each individual was clear, or that people'sPsycho-Pass could change when within different groups, or like the twist at the end with Kamui - who claims that the person holding the Dominator becomes collectively part of Sibyl when pointing it at Sibyl itself.\\n\\n\r\nBased of the fact of how the sequel will turn.. Nah It doesn't the same without Gen Urobuchi directly manage the story...but hey! they manage to adapted the whole story in the end by not failing it\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 Worth Watch : If you're just gonna skip the second one and already watch the movie... You're gonna get confused on what the movie is all about.. The story is important too even it's just a filler or some parts which is connected. You know?",

            "content": "First things first. I love the first season of Psycho-Pass. It left me wanting more. And when I heard that a Season 2 is coming out, I got all hyped up. Now as I write this, I just finished watching the final episode earlier and I should say... it has it's ups and downs. Why? Carry on reading...\r\nSo basically, it once again focused on Akane on being an Inspector. I was actually shocked at the end of Season 1 wherein Ginoza was demoted to being an Enforcer. But hey, he looked better without glasses! There is still Yayoi and Shion (which is pratiacally is hookingup with each other XD) which is a good sight to see. Technically it's just them that remained from the original cast of Season 1. Kougami was nowhere to be found. Yeah he appeared but only on Akane's mind, so it kind of disappoints me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we are introduced with a new set of Enforcers, Sakuya Togane and Shou Hinakawa. (Oh I adore Hinakawa so much!) Then there's the Junior Inspector Mika Shimotsuki. I'll get to them later.\\n\\n\r\nKicking off where Season 1 ended, Akane is faced once again with a new villain (?) named Kirito Kamui. Unlike Makishima Shougo, Kamui has a different goal. He wants to judge Sibyl. And by that, he played with the people of MWSPB (i dunno if I put it correctly). But as the series progresses, you wouldn't even know who the real villain is. From there, plot twists ensues.\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that if you haven't enjoyed the first season, there's no point in watching this one. For me, I do enjoyed it although it has some flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Mika's characterization. I do feel that the series pretty much \"butchered\" her character. Yes, she may appear \"bitchy\" for the most part of the series, but when you look deeper, she is just following orders from Sibyl. She technically don't know what she is doing. Therefore, she is just another victim of Sibyl's flaws. The reason why I said her character was butchered is because of the lack of her characterization. The show primarily just showed her really annoying attitude towards everybody. Yet, it wasn't revealed as to why she acts like that. It appears that she is just a natural bitch. But I strongly believe that there is more to that. The show can use some background stories for her but they didn't, so I don't exactly know what to feel about Mika's character.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, the lack of episodes. 11 episodes is not enough for this one. When I first knew that it will be just 11 episodes, I was like: \"Oh, that would appear rushed.\"... and I was right. If only this series was also 22 episodes like the first season, they can use the chance to give some more characterization to Mika and a deeper explanations to everything that is happening to the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow to mention everything I liked about it:\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Akane's maturity. OMG she just got so badass!! I love her for that!\\n\\n\r\nNext, OP and ED songs. Got me LSS'ed for a looooong time! XD\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist. Every information leaked is really interesting. The turn of events made my jaw drop. Like really. But that is not quite effective because the OP sequence pretty much revealed everything that is happening to this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe brutality. OMFG. In my opinion, this is more brutal than the first season. Like really! MORE BLOOD!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Yup, pretty awesome~\\n\\n\r\nOverall.... I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. I was actually entertained. But yeah, the flaws just don't made me feel so hyped up. By the end of this season, I was actually hyped for the Movie coming out on January. Hopefully we get more Kougami. HAHAHA!",

            "content": "The original Psycho Pass was a great anime that combined great characters, action art and everything else that makes a good anime. You wont find much of that here. \r\n     The thing that was most troubling about this anime was the characters. While I wasn't disappointed by the lack of Kogami in this series, I was very disappointed in the other characters. Previously, all the characters had great depth and you really got to know them. That sort of character interaction is not here. While of course it would be harder to explain all the charactersin an 11 episode season rather than a 24 episode one, the lack of character depth here is pathetic. Many of the characters get little to downright no explanation in this series. That was one of the strong points in the original series. It is sad not to see it here. \\n\r\n     The story wasn't half bad, but nothing special. it also felt unexplained at times, however it felt captivating at times, just nowhere near the quality of the first season. \\n\r\n     The art, like the first season is spectacular, no complaints here. It also sounded great. I have yet to find a Psycho Pass intro I didn't like.\\n\r\n     Overall this anime was fine, but a bit of a let down. I thought the first season ended perfectly, and that the anime wasn't in need of a second season. Maybe a movie would suffice to finish things up. We will be getting one in January.  It didn't seem like a cash grab, but more of an un-necessary addition. If you're into the series though, I think it may be worth the watch. Give it a try if you're bored one day. It wont live up to the first season, but it's fine nonetheless.",

            "content": "As I watch the first season of psycho pass come to an end, it lingered to mind of what will come off on the second season of this show. To be honest, I didn\u2019t set my expectations high, as it may failed to equal or exceed the actions, excitement and enjoyment I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s slightly true though.\r\nOne thing I like about psycho pass is the thrill and the hype that will make you finish it in one sitting. In season 2, though the \u2018thrill and the hype\u2019 lowered, but its plot is definitely more interesting than it was in season 1.  Here are thereasons why I think so:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tIt has more intriguing antagonist. He was like Makishima who uses other people to set up his plan. But the way he made is plan is way much cooler and cleverer, which makes the \u2018game\u2019 exciting.\\n\\n\r\n2.\t Characters showed some changes. (I only point out two because of all characters, because the changes in them are more evident.)\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tAkane \u2013 changed physically and mentally.  What I\u2019m referring to is her eyes. It makes her look sharper and smarter.  This maybe a small thing but it changed how I view her.  The way she thinks is more like Kougami now.  \\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tGinoza \u2013 being demoted to an Enforcer, he showed more human-like feelings now. Lol\\n\\n\r\n3.\tProfessor Saiga Jouji has more screening time. His strengths are thoroughly used in their investigation.\\n\r\n4.\tUnfolding of truth behind the mystery of their enemy each and every episodes will make you finish it in one go. \\n\r\n5.\tHow Akane played with the hands of sibyl is still very entertaining. \\n\r\n6.\tSurprises are there, which are crazy lol.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing only lacks psycho pass 2 is Kougami. And I realized as I watch is that he is the \u201cthrill and the hype\u201d element of psycho pass. Without him, for me, psycho pass isn\u2019t complete. After all, he was also a main character besides Akane. Aaannnd to be honest I am intrigued by Akane\u2019s actions. It seems to me that she misses Kougami. The fact that she lights Kogami\u2019s cigarette brand to smell it.  Something\u2019s fishy there.  \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason many didn\u2019t like season 2, but for me, it\u2019s still okay. Music, animation, character designs are pretty much the same as season 1. \\n\\n\r\nPS: forgive me if there were any errors on what I have written. To err is human \uf04a \\n",

People must really didn't like this second season since there was so much of a difference in the scores.\r\nAnyway, if there is one thing I can agree on, is that the first season was definitely better than this one but not by a drastic margin. If they force paced this season into 20+ episodes I would understand, but at 11 episodes, I found the story told quite well. One of the other reasons why I feel the first season was better than this was because ofthe OST. The anime background music was much more intense in the first season than it was in this second one. An anime's score has a lot to do with how much you get into it. How much you'd feel a thrill, and it affects how you perceive the action as well.\\n\\n\r\nI still really enjoyed this sequel, and at times I asked myself, \"who the hell comes up with these ideas?\" and that's a good thing because I enjoy stuff that puts me to contemplate.

True, it doesn't have much character development, but the story and the villain's goal is so interesting. They don't flesh out the villain but it's not about him, it's about his goal. The whole concept of the second season makes it worth watching. It's thrilling and makes you think.\r\nAlthough, i do concede to people's point that the \"make people's color black and make mother look prettier\" isn't really explained and the explanation that he's crazy might be pretty flimsy. Even her junior is plainannoying most of the time. By fleshing some of these character's out more, the show could've been much better overall but it's still definitely a great thriller to watch. Not too far from season 1 for a season with 11 episodes.",

If you're expecting to find all the same characters and the same things of the first season, then you'll be disappointed (and I guess you should re-watch the first one?); because this is a sequel and we find all the consequences of the actions that weremade in the first season. \\n\r\n2. In my opinion, in the first season there were more overwhelming feelings and emotions, while the second season focuses more on rational thoughts and the development of personality and feelings. \\n\\n\r\nPlot. //\\n\r\nThe story centers around Akane and her division facing a new abnormal case. They have to capture Kamui that is acting against the Sybil System. Every episode give new (confusing) clues about his motive.\\n\r\nIt is a really simple, linear story but it gets always more intense, episode after episode, and every new discover, every questions take almost a philosophical meaning and that's what made me fall in love even more in Psycho-Pass. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion. //\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n- simple, but meaningful story\\n\r\n- amazing music with Ling Tosite Sigure and Egoist\\n\r\n- twists and mystery\\n\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n- they could make it a little longer, even though it's fine like this\\n\r\n- some scenes are predictable for someone who's into thriller stuff, still good for me",

Season 2 brings some really good action and mini-plot setups that will bring quite a bit of enjoyment. The moments of tensions are great, and the philosophical debates are still there. However, season 2 as a whole is essentially an inferior copy of season 1, and with half the length it wasn't able to delve nearly as deep as the original. At the end you will probably ask yourself whether the 11 episodes made sense, which is not what a show should do.\r\n**spoilers\r\nThe maingripe I had with season 2 was the ending, which seems to be the problem that most other people have. The primary fault lies with the portion where the sybil system itself is judged, contradicting certain truths that were established during season 1 and the fact that the sybil system's judgment is so easily swayed after hearing just a handful of words... it didn't feel right. \\n\\n\r\nI also have the say that the disappearance of Kogami, and the fact that our MC spends lots of time hallucinating about him doesn't match up with the fact that we see no attempt by her to find him. This might be answered in another arc taking place between the ending of 1 and the 1.5 years that follow.",

            "content": "Comparing season 1 to this will show us a really really huge gap in terms of the quality both shows can offer. As a huge fan of the Psycho-Pass series, I try my best to not take into consideration of comparing this season with the first too much, and instead just try to enjoy the show as it is without being too biased. Without further ado, I would like to continue on in this review on my take of Psycho-Pass 2.\r\nStory:\r\nPsycho-Pass 2 takes place 1 and a half years after the first season ended, and I believe that the production crew of season 1 wantedto focus on the movie and allowed another team to handle season 2 while still overseeing their work. Psycho-Pass 2 is meant to be a bridge to link the movie and the first season, by introducing new characters that will appear in the movie and letting the viewers see more of what the Sybil System is truly like. The antagonist in this show goes by the name of Kamui Kirito and he has a rather unique story to his life. Just like Makishima Shougo from season 1, Kirito's objectives of committing crimes are to be able to get to the Sybil System. The first few episodes will be rather painful to watch because characters are dumb in them and the plot is very messy, I agree with people on these even though I love this series a lot. However, as the story goes deeper in, lots of secrets will be uncovered and revealed and they can be intriguing depending on how you portray them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in Psycho-Pass 2 can be very inconsistent, the visual composition as compared to the first season is shown to have dropped a lot in quality. Character designs can sometimes look weird and horrendous, sometimes Akane just doesn't look like Akane at all, and therefore the reason for why I say that the art can be inconsistent. But that doesn't stop us from being able to be given a treat of some rather nice action scenes from time to time. I read somewhere that another studio took over the art and animation for this season and I believe that was the reason for all the rather disappointing art, hopefully the blu-ray quality will have improved overall art for the show. You will be able to see how different the art in season 2 is by either watching the Psycho-Pass movie trailer or just simply watch back a small scene from season 1, the quality difference is really huge.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI do not really have any complaints for this section, I have always loved the soundtracks and voice acting in Psycho-Pass and this season didn't disappoint me in terms of that. Mika's voice actress does a really good job at portraying Mika's annoying attitude and Akane's voice actress is always doing her job well too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWe have been given quite a number of new characters in this season, but since this season is only 11 episodes, do not expect much character developments to occur here. I looked forward to seeing the partnership between Akane and Ginoza but nothing much happens which led me to a little disappointment, and some characters only gets a few brief lines of explanations about them and I just felt like that was the reason for the lack of character development (as compared to Yayoi getting one whole episode that tells the story of how she became a latent criminal in season 1). So yes, I highly doubt there is any powerful character development in this season as compared to how brilliantly Kougami and Makishima were developed in season 1. I do like how much Akane have grown here, she started off as a little naive girl and now she is one of the most badass characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI still enjoyed myself a lot when watching Psycho-Pass 2, the thrill that I get whenever I watch each episode as they release does make it a rather enjoyable experience for me as I've completed the show. In order to enjoy this season even though it can be quite the letdown, I suggest you to put your critics knowledge aside and just watch this show without wanting to point out every flaw in it. I do have times whereby I spotted a bunch of inconsistencies in the show but I told myself to cast them aside and when I do, I am just enjoying this show and showing my appreciation for it by really choosing to like it.\\n\\n\r\nThat is my review for Psycho-Pass 2, thank you for reading!",

I read a fantastic review and character analysis on the characters before watching also. I wanted to keep an open mind. Yes, I was seriously disappointed Shinya wasn't in Season 2! \r\nBut when you think about it, Season 2 has its high points. It's completely necessary to watch this season; yes, even before watching the movie. \r\nI loved season 2. To me, I feel like I could rewatch this season before watching Season 1. Why? I love how Akane's character grew. She was just a flower inseason 1; with Shinya's absence, she budded into a beautiful rose. Just watching her, in itself, gave me fulfilled enjoyment. \\n\r\nThe action is still there, and so it the whole idea of Sybil. You're left to ponder to yourself, even if you don't agree with the lady protagonist, why she's still working for Sybil. Her answer is definitely insightful. \\n\r\nNow characters -- It broke my heart that practically a few branch of characters were introduced. It even was a little too much for my heart! \\n\r\nThe purpose of Season 2, was to give you a fill-in for the movie, so you're not left behind. IT also, helps you see Akane's transformation. \\n\r\nShinya isn't completely left out - his presence hasn't been forgotten, that is. Akane lights a cigarette, to remind herself of him and help her think like he would. \\n\r\nI have to say, I loved the criminals of Season 2. The finale isn't something you'd want to miss either. Kyaa!\\n\\n\r\nThing is, don't let yourself go in with the hype. Make your own judgement.",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nPsycho-Pass in general has a difficult time following the \"show don't tell\" method because it covers so much material each episode. This can lead to some alarming plot holes if not executed properly. Unlike the first season, Psycho-Pass 2 doesn't link together plot points very well. Even by the last episode, all of the evidence pieces feel like they were just taped together rather than being a part of a large puzzle. Some short cuts don't follow logic and were simply taken to get a point across. Overall, however, I still think the new plot, while somewhat unnecessary, was quite interesting. There were alot of clever and exciting ideas, but they just didn't always lead to something that entirely made sense. Perhaps 11 episodes just wasn't enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art definitely lives up to expectations. Some of the gripes from the first season, such as weird angles of Tsunemori's face, have been fixed completely in this iteration. Like the ups of season 1, the animation is fluid and the cityscape is absolutely stunning. This is the expected quality for a 2014 animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nOverall, the show's music is nothing to complain about. While none of the background music stood out to me, all of the pieces worked well in depicting the show's atmosphere. The opening and ending both start out great and get me hyped, but always seem to fall off in the middle. I liked the first season's opening and ending much better. This may just be me, however, and I'm sure many viewers will love the new tracks. As for voices, most characters seem to have fitting and well done voices. Although, I did notice that Tsunemori's voice changed pitch a couple times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nReturning characters come in with a solid foundation but receive little development throughout season 2. The new characters started off with interesting personalities, but seem under worked.\\n\\n\r\nAkane Tsunemori: The main character of the series. While I think she is generally a likable character, I was disappointed by how little she was affected by her surroundings. By the second season she has become a veteran inspector. Her psycho-pass is extremely hard to cloud, but aside from being optimistic and moralistic in nature, there is no given explanation as to why she is \"asymptotic.\" She suffers from many personal traumas in Psycho-Pass 2, but her character never changes much. She most likely could have held the same opinions in the finale right from episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nMika Shimotsuki: The new inspector of Division 1. She comes off a bit as the stereotypical naive and ignorant girl who refuses to admit her own msitakes. While she has been on the job for two years, she somewhat resents Tsunemori's senior authority because unlike Tsunemori, Shimotsuki believes the enforcers should be used as nothing more than tools in solving crimes. She strictly plays by the rules which unsurprisingly leads to some problems. Her only real point of variation is her attraction and admiration for enforcer Yayoi Kunizuka for comforting her after the Oso Academy case. \\n\\n\r\nNobuchika Ginoza: Ginoza from season 1 was awesome because he was such a conflicted character. Early on he gave advice to Tsunemori, and later found out that he was a complete hypocrite, falling victim to his stress/rage and being demoted to an enforcer. It's really disappointing that he is a complete supporting character in Psycho-Pass 2. He has one lackluster emotional scene, and after that pretty much serves as Tsunemori's advisor for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nSakuya Togane: A new enforcer introduced in episode 1. Sadly, he comes off as a shady character immediately because of his portrayal in the opening. Seriously, don't give away the plot in the opening. It's not cool. But yeah, he appears to be very level-headed and agreeable, much like a replacement Kogami at the beginning. What frustrates me is that his change into his real self is so jagged, and the other characters show practically no interest in that. Not even Tsunemori. \\n\\n\r\nSho Hakinawa: A new enforcer, and another stereotype. He's that typical depressed guy with a specific skill set and chooses to crouch in his chair. \\n\\n\r\nKamui: The main antagonist of season 2. His major skill is making people do what he wants, but in a different manner that Makishima's. Also, unlike Makishima, he isn't out to destroy Sibyl, but is curious about Sibyl itself. \\n\r\n My complaint is that we never really understand how he achieves his amazing skills. Also, we later find out that his personal motivation doesn't really add up with his goals.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAlthough there are many issues that are hard to overlook with Psycho-Pass 2, it's hard to deny that it was a pretty fun ride. Every time I watch the show I get the immediate sensation of wanting to drop everything and become a detective. The violence is intense, but luckily isn't anything that will keep me up at night. Ultimately, while flubbing some plot components, Psycho-Pass 2 does teach us more about the Division 1 crew and the Sibyl System, and makes me eager for more Psycho-Pass in the future. \\n",

            "content": "The first season of Psycho-Pass really did leave a huge impact on me but somehow while the second season is still good in my opinion, I can't help but feels this second season is just like a filler just to affirm Akane's character development in the first season. And because of that, I think this second season could not stand on its own without the first season in front of them making this second season is too dependent. While it's a bit disappointing, the second season is actually still fun and interesting to follow.\r\nAs stated in my first season review, I praised Psycho-Pass because ofits character development while still maintaining the major character trait untouched. While I was wishing for Akane's further character development, what did I get is only an affirmation of Akane's character development in the first season. This is stated by how the whole case seems like a test for Akane's character even Akane herself stated that in a monologue early in first few episodes. There's not much difference of how Akane viewed the Sybil from the beginning to the end of the season and for me that's a bit disappointing as Akane's view of Sybil was a leftover from the first season. Still, I love how the writer kept Akane in character and maintaining her major character traits those are kindness and her sense of justice even she is a bit rough after what happened in the first season and that is the part I love about this second season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not much explored, I love how they throw the hints of Akane who is still attached with Kogami. For me this is very important for Akane's character as Kogami was the one who built Akane's character in the first season. They can't just throw that away and because they keep him in Akane's mind, I think it is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line of this second season is pretty good in my opinion with a major theme of judgement. While being interesting enough, I can't help but feels the story line it's a little bit like a copy of the first season with the main villain's feeling is almost close with what Makishima's feeling in the first season and questioning the Sybil's judgement. It is still interesting but deeply in my heart, I really do want a new innovation in the story department to make myself stop comparing the second season with the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations and soundtracks are still very impressive in my opinion maintaining its reputation from the first season. The opening performed by Ling Toiste Sigure and the ending performed by EGOIST of this season are so much rocking and made the hype level up to the roof proofing that both of them are really fit for rocking the Psycho-Pass universe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while it is still interesting, the second season is too much dependent to what happened in the first season and overshadowed by them at the same. It made me could not stop comparing the first and the second season. I don't know if that's good or not but I think it is better to have a dependent second season so they could catch anyone who start the series a bit late.",

I really waiting for it.\r\nwhat i regret is there's no more Kougami Shinya in main character, the fact that KougamiShinya is the real badass affect all the story. if tsunemori is the heart of psycho pass than Kougami is the soul of psycho pass. The heart without soul is just an empty body there's no passion no emotion in it,  You can't make the badass vanish like that ! \\n\r\n When i think, it make sense why the Kougami is vanish from the 1st season, but I expect that he will back in 2nd season and kick the fucking sibyl system ass. I hope in the 3rd season psycho pass the badass will come back.\\n\r\nActually I miss Kougami so bad :))",

But I wanted to see how it was for myself, so after finishing season 1, I moved with trepidation over to season 2.\r\nI'll get this out there, this season isn't terrible. It's more or less awful for how it is structured and what it represents. This season is more or less season 1 except cut down to a much shorter length. The characters mirror characters from the last season and generally fill their roles notas well. The largest issue with a shortened season is the fact that there is less time for everything to develop, so it just feels rushed and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are boring and I don't like them. especially the villain and the character who takes up the position Akane had in the previous season. Sibyl is constantly stupid in this season and nothing of value is gained from watching this. This season also feels like it's spilling a bit too much unnecessary blood. In season 1, everyone who is shown dying feels realistic and necessary. In this season, it feels like people are dying simply for the shock factor, and not for the purpose of the story at large.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've heard about the movie, it largely ignores season 2, so there is likely no reason you'd have to watch this show. Stick with the first season, and don't waste your time on this repetitive goo.\\n\\n",

            "content": "How do you live up to the first season of Psycho-Pass? A villain like Makishima, and two great lead characters in Tsunemori and Kogami, it's hard to top. And But I don't think that Psycho-Pass 2 is trying to top season 1, or even reinvent itself. Instead, it's a continuation, like if season 1 had been 11 episodes longer. And it succeeds incredibly in this sense, not feeling like a new show. I'll start off with the characters. The new cast of characters, and the old, are rather hit or miss, which was an issue with the first season. You have Tsunemori, a fantastic characterand the show protagonist again, and an enigmatic villain this season, yet no new character peaked my interest other than the villain, and that's because you know nothing about him until the final half of the show. The writers did a great job not giving this seasons villain the exact same motive as Makishima, and instead spicing it up, as well as adding a side villain. The new inspector seems to function as a foil to Tsunemori, acting irrationally at times, and seeming to think she is in competition with Tsunemori. She however does experience some satisfying character development by the end of the show. The other new characters like the red-haired enforcer just don't have enough development, and Ginoza and Yayoi are pretty much ignored in any development as well. Luckily, the story is what is gripping about this season. Like the first, this story is a deconstruction of itself. Urobuchi created the world of Psycho-Pass just to break all the rules, like \"What happens if you can't read a criminals Psycho-Pass?\". This season, while including some of the old deconstruction elements, is building up to something new and rule-breaking, and it is enthralling. Every week since it aired, I waited to find out what it will be. The new \"twist\" kind of let me down, though that stems from trying to compare Season 1's twist to this one's, and it felt rushed. The ending was also a pretty major let down, and doesn't really explain anything. The animation is good, nothing standout, apart from the brutality of the show. It's really taken a violent turn, and the animation luckily fits it well. The final half of the finale takes a noticeable dip in animation quality. The soundtrack is fantastic as well, with the OP and ED being some of the best this season. The actual OST is also very fitting, with a sci-fi feel to it to match the cyber-punk nature of the show. All-in-all, the best way I could think of this show was as a supplement to the movie, and to explain a bit of what has gone on between Makishima and the movie. The season as a whole felt rushed, mainly because they only focused on one case the whole time. The story was still alright however, and the soundtrack continued to be great, while the characters took a back seat to the story. Overall, 5/10.",

            "content": "My first ever review, but anytime this series comes to my sight, i feel like i have to share my opinion bout it. The 1st season was my first \"omfg\" anime series ever, with Makishima Shogo being my first and till, last \"manlove\" anime character. (Kogami was the \"aaah he is so coool kawaii\" guy that was put in for the  girls to dream about.) With his death, and without his presence the story lost its half, or even more than its half; and they give us one more season, i was happy at first too, trying to clone Makishima in the person of,Kamui?, and trying to force on us the same \"magic\" that Makishima had without him doing anything, but the other characters praising/ glorifying him to the point that it just became awkward. This is the main idea(the problem if the series) i would like to share with my review, i don't know if its understandable; Makishima himself built up his charisma slowly, step by step with every episode, they even had a talk with prof Saiga about the phenomena. He was a well built character supported with philosophy, art and literature just enough and not to much; personally he made me read more books than any of my school teachers(sadly). On the other hand Kamui did nothing the whole story, and the studio (tried) forced surrounding characters to build him up, with the only interesting, philosophical idea of the \"omnipotent\", which could have been settled in one episode. So in my opinion, as i look at the series, the second season is one empty bundle, to satisfy our superficial needs.",

Here the situation has been changed with more focus put into a discussion on society. If you didn't like the all the psychological babble before, I have good news. There's even more. \r\nThe art style has its ups and downs. The background color schemes are mostly gray or boring colors and feel slightly depressing to look at. Admittedly, its traditional to have a crime drama set in dark alleyways and poor lighted places so it maybe an aesthetic choice. Meanwhile the holodisplays and special effects are really good. Blood splatters and facial expressions are handled well too.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any problems with the sounds. The dominators sound good. The various technology chimes and blips manage to avoid being annoying. The voice acting was good from the subbed perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show great. The MC was fully developed in the original show. Now she's set loose on the world. There's no need to analyze her behavior. Just sit back and watch one of the strongest female leads ever take charge. The other returning cast members are treated the same way and have almost no development time. Instead we are introduced to a couple of new characters that receive developmental attention. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is going to be hit or miss. If you liked the first one, then this will be fine. I don't think of it as a step down, but it doesn't recapture the initial wonder of the original. New elements aren't added into the world and much of the story formula remains the same. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a solid sequel. It adds a few layers onto the story without changing direction. Not so much launching to new heights as a step in the right direction.",

I miss him so very much. However, there are some moments where we get to see Akane think of him, and that was so damn beautiful.\r\nAlso, I wanted to see more of Gino. His character development in the previous season resulted in him becoming the coolest mofo next to Ko. Like... more of that, please.\r\nI definitely preferred the Enforcers, story, and music from the first season, but oneof the things I preferred from this season was Akane. Hot damn, she was so badass. Easily one of my favorite female characters in anime. Again, she had astounding character development last season, and her new self definitely got the screen time it deserved without denying us of any more development (because, there is still character development to be had). \\n\\n\r\nI think because this season was shorter, the story couldn't be fleshed out as much as the first season's, but I'm okay with that. It's often difficult for shows, books, movies, etc. to revamp themselves after a major storyline ends (like the storyline in the first season of Psycho-Pass). So, if this season were longer, it would feel unimportant and drawn out because it wasn't connected enough to the previous season/storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think I'm done talking about this season for now. I still really enjoyed it. It didn't feel as \"big picture\" to me as the first season (because that was the primary storyline), but it was still a nice experience to sit down and watch.

            "content": "Psycho-Pass, the first season of the anime and the part that had basis in the manga was an absolute revelation into the world of Cyberpunk-esque, Dystopian Utopia and Totalitarian Authority that is so complex a difficulty to talk about and deal with even in forms of art.\r\nUnfortunately, Season 2 felt like a shadow of the former season. Perhaps I had too much expectations of the show with the levels set as high 'Kogami and Makishima'. I have heard the argument of take everything for itself and without comparing it to something else but it does not apply here.  Not only because it is asequel but the cast, story and consequences are far too connected and that is how the show wants to.\\n\\n\r\nTogane was obviously painted as a pseudo-Kogami but that works out for the better as his origins are revealed. He is the saving grace of the season along with the opening and ending themes of the show.\\n\r\nThe antagonist, Kamui Kirito is almost tad too pretentious in all 'its' hybridized existence and the exasperation that I felt in giving a care about his journey, his truth and his easy-going ways. The way he dances around the society, tearing it apart just doesn't have gravity to the extent it should.\\n\r\nAnd Misako Oka-san is basically a wish fulfillment for all those who just wanted to see someone wipe away smug omniscient face of a haggard looking 'B' woman. She replaces Sibyl in form and is replaced by out by Kamui, who in turn sacrificing himself in a typical cop-out death that always follow a character with no future beyond a certain point.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps, the real disappointment is not seeing Tsunemori see no character development at; perhaps because that was because it was already set away in the season 1 storyline. But on the overall I was pleased with seeing the Enforcement squad with its unique members, Inspector Shimotsuki being not too unpleasant napkin of a character and the Professor being classic anime portrayal of a mystery man notwithstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, you'll nothing if you don't watch this. You may find some value in terms of the world lore if you do. I cannot tell how you will feel after watching it through but if you are fan and want to tick things off, It may as well be a pleasant experience.",

            "content": "Sequels often fail to capture the same light that their antecedents do; unless they are planned in advance, they are produced to satisfy fans and make more money, rather than filling out the particular world\u2019s narrative. A particularly notable example would be The Heroes of Olympus by Rick Riordan. His first series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, was nothing short of addicting Greek mythology primer as seen through a teen\u2019s eyes. But his second series, while introducing the Roman counterparts and another camp for half-bloods, does not have the same feel. The writing is sub-par, the lingering awe for higher beings died, the main charactersare overpowered, and on and on.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, if a sequel follows the same basic storyline as the first, it is immediately criticized. I believe that lack of originality is not necessarily a cause for complaint, especially if the ripoff is good in and of itself (e.g. The Inheritance Cycle). Every new narrative is funded directly by inspiration from earlier works. This is not a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to a sequel, Psycho-Pass 2, whose antagonist is fairly similar to that of season one (S1) -- a criminally asymptomatic individual who escapes the scans of the Sibyl System. Yes, season two (S2) isn\u2019t as good as the first in practically every respect. But it\u2019s still an acute examination of the morally ambiguous consequences of a system powered by human brains that monitors every citizen\u2019s potential to commit a crime. Although not as horrifying as S1, S2 still shocked me with some of the acts of evil and depravity, and the antagonist presented a needed response to Akane\u2019s doubts of the Sibyl System. Akane remains clear no matter what happens, lucky her, while another character darkens the coefficient of others, and another clears the coefficient of others. Perhaps S2 was unnecessary, but I still enjoyed it. After all, with this premise, any serious threat to the Sibyl System would have to be a unique individual immune to it, which means an antagonist similar to Makishima. So get a grip, critics, let\u2019s overlook the lack of complete and utter originality. Everything created is but a derivation of something that came before.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you liked S1 you should like S2 as well. Production I.G returns with a lucid yet gentle overlay of colors; the characters\u2019 faces are perhaps too pale but that\u2019s stylistic. The soundtrack is the same charged, driven orchestrals. And the moral dilemma called the Sibyl System is as strong as ever. The only thing I missed, really, was Kogami.",

Much like the first season, we get a new \"type\" of person that isn't recognized by the system and it is hardly predictible how the ending will turn out. However, the mysteries involving the new anti-hero were less interesting than the ones we got to see in the first season. \r\nArt (8) & Sound (9) : \r\nThe art isn't different from the first season and is still nice. Same for the soundtracks, openingand ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5) : \\n\\n\r\nI have to say, I was dissapointed. The characters where dull, especially compared to the first season, where the villain had a lot of charisma (in my opinion) and had so much presence in the anime. In season two, he is quasi inexistant. I know he is supposed to be a \"ghost\", but his personality was just not there. Same with Kogami, and I'm not saying this because he didn't get to appear as a person in season two. The producer tried to make Tsunemori a second Kogami to fill that \"gap\" of the missing super detective, but with no success because it didn't make her more interesting. The other characters where dull, even the new ones who had each a distinct personality. None of them really standed out. The villain could've so much better but yeah, he wasn't...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement (5) :\\n\\n\r\nI did like the anime but what annoyed me where the characters. They just couldn't grasp my attention and in the end I just watched because I wanted to know how everything would end. Many other people found it very enjoyable but if you are not keen on psychological stuff or thinking together with the inspectors and all, I woulnd't immediatly recommend it. But, it is a nice change of anime from time to time ^^",

I honestly thought they could've done it more better. I mean, it was good. But I felt something was missing.\r\nMay be due to its amazing first season, its second season was not able to take up its hype to viewer's demand as it is usually the case for most of the anime. Story, Characters, Art... Nothing much has changed, but comparing it with first season's, perhaps the word 'Good' is suited to describe the second season and 'great' for its first season.\r\nIf there wassomething that has definitely has gotten better, that will be the sound-work. Ling Toshite Shigure (if you don't remember who they are, they sang 'Unravel' for Tokyo Ghoul) and Egoists joined to sing OP and ED for second season, and their songs perfectly emerged to the anime and made it into a wonderful wonderful BGMed anime.\\n\\n\r\n(Enigmatic Feeling, Who what Who what By Ling Toshite Shigure)\\n\r\n(Fallen, All Alone with You, Namonashi Kaibutsu By Egoist)\\n\\n\r\nAll I got left is the movie, but I am actually quite worried about if they will be able to tell this fantastic story like they did in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSame as the season before, recommended for Mystery, SF, Story Lovers.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for Season Two I guess...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSayonara!",

            "content": "A Review of Psycho-Pass 2:\r\nWell, any show with the number 2 in the title is bound to not stray too far from the pre-existing ideas that are associated. Obviously there are exceptions to this way of thinking, but Psycho-Pass 2 is not one of them.\r\nSet very soon after the conclusion of the first season, we see familiar faces doing what they've always done; upholding the law to the best of their ability. So, this show is VERY much like its predecessor, and it's a very good season on it's own, but I personally don't think it's as good as the one that came before. Onereason for this is the new characters. In the first season, we had 22 episodes to grow close to all the faces we saw interacting every episode. Now, half of those faces have been replaced and we only have 11 episodes to form any sort of bond with these new characters at all. They're not badly developed (save for one of the new Enforcers who gets hardly any screen time at all) and they're enjoyable, but they're not the same as the people we enjoyed watching in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound are pretty much equivalent, though I do want to give special mention to one song that appeared in episode 9 during a very emotional scene. That was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe story...is confusing. I can see it as either being better or worse than the first season's main arc. This season, the story begins right from the get-go and is consistent throughout. it also feels like the perfect length for such a story. The first season took some time to get into and at times felt like it dragged on, so that's where I feel the second season is better. However, the second season isn't original. it simply builds on top of what the first season already laid out and threw in some small tidbits that were left out of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, it's a pretty good sequel overall.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+The theme song grew on me after a while. Not fantastic, but not awful\\n\r\n+Old characters appearing and acting like they always have\\n\r\n+The strong theme of morality\\n\r\n+Animation and sound are solid\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Opening theme took a while to grow on me\\n\r\n-New characters are meh\\n\r\n-Story simply builds off of previous season making it seem like a semi-rehash\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the original Psycho-Pass and I definitely enjoyed the follow up to it. If the first season was just your cup of tea, you have no reason not to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why Psycho-Pass 2 gets a 9/10",

            "content": "This is technically a season 2 for Psycho Pass but it feels more like a sequel series instead. The story is pretty good with a whole new villain and a slightly different cast of secondary characters. The story sometimes appears even more fucked up than the last season while maintaining a similar level of blood and gore. Since the secret of the Sibyl system has already been revealed to the viewer the big mystery of the show is the goal of the main villain. This season is noticeably shorter because of it, which is a good thing because this plot would not have done aswell as it did if forced to stretch over 20 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, with cool technical designs and none of the character designs look terrible. They all manage to look unique while still managing to look normal for their society. The animation is smooth as the last season and never noticeably falters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in Psycho Pass 2 is just as good, if not better, than the music used in season 1. The voice actors for the new characters all manage to put on quality performances in the English dub. Sound effects are believable and well done.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't able to accept new characters easily you probably won't like this season because several major cast members from the last season don't show up. Instead several new characters are brought in that do a good job in their roles.\\n\r\nTsunemori Akane - Once again the protagonist, this season tests her resolve to maintain the rule of Sibyl. She doesn't do a lot of character growth in this season but shows off a little of the growth she made at the end of the last. She maintains her character flaws as well though.\\n\r\nKamui Kirito - The new 'villain' for this season, he is definitely a means justify the ends type of guy. He comes off as a lot nicer than the villain of the last season(and several side characters as well). Some viewers may be able to empathize with him though.\\n\r\nTougane Sakuya - He starts off as an apparent replacement for Kougami but also grows into his own character. Whether or not you like him is up to you but I thought he was too much of a momma's boy.\\n\r\nShimotsuki Mika - I think this character was designed for the viewer to hate. I was constantly hoping for character growth but disappointed. She was shown joining the force at the end of the last season but doesn't really grow in the year and a half between then and now. Something that I didn't notice even after rewatching is that she was involved in girls school case in the first season. She works as a character though, even if she isn't particularly likable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this season. I remember watching it every week on its initial release and it constantly kept me craving more. When marathoned its just as enjoyable though. I think it could even be watched without having seen the first season, though you might miss certain parts of the story. If you aren't big on 'changing of the guard' style cast transformation though this season might just piss you off. I do recommend though if you liked season 1.",

She showed so much integrity and intelligence in the cases her division is handling--unlike in the previous season whereshe's more like a greenie.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime started really good but then just when it was about to end--there's a lacking element to it that felt like it wasn't ended nicely and felt like it was cut early. I honestly felt it didn't put justice to the expectations and hype I had with the previous season and the beginnings of this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was still a great experience--I can say I would probably mood over how am gonna find an anime like this in the days ahead.",

Had to look it up to find out the series had actually ended. I was really expecting another 11+ episodes to this series, only in small part due to the length of the first season. After watching the last episode, I had no idea it WAS the last episode. It seemed more like the ending ofa major arc, sure, but not the finale of an entire season. It lacked closure and left a lot of wanting.\\n",

Season One followed the exact same formula as season two and even had a similar level of gore and shock factor, it was practically the same story - minus one character. \r\nI think the reason most people hate this season is because Kogami is gone. There, I said it. Everyone kind of got on their knees for him for some reason, but he didn't make OR break the show, he was merely a character there whobroke the rules a little. Was a season two necessary? Not really, but was it equally as good as season one? Yeah, since it's the same story just with another villain. The art style and animation was consistent just like season one, the team was as enjoyable to watch as season one (except for one SERIOUSLY annoying character), and Sibyl was just as corrupt as season one.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I can see that would give people reason to hate on season two is actually Sibyl. The system had someone in the group who went against what Sibyl as a collective believed in but was SELECTED to run the case? Uh, ok. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is just as good as season one if you stop inserting yourself up Kogamis backside, it's enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nOverall - 8",

            "content": "Story (7/10)\r\nI'm not even going to bother summarizing the story, because you have the synopsis right there when you click on the anime. But, I will tell you that I did enjoy the story, for the most part. I find it difficult to say that because it took me quite a while to get back into the story after episode 5 or 6. I think it's been roughly a year since I started Psycho-Pass 2. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy it overall, I did. I just found that the middle part of the plot got a bit rocky.\r\nArt (7/10)\r\nI'm no experton art style, nor do I claim to be, but I like the art style in this anime. The shading and colors add to the dark, almost surreal atmosphere. I really enjoy the contrast between the officers and the civilians. I might be imagining it, but I did notice a difference between the two and the former used darker, more menacing colors. I could be off the mark, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from Psycho-Pass, I thoroughly enjoyed the music they chose for the openings. I'm partial to the first season's opening, but that's just me. I even watched the last half or so of this show in the dubbed version. Disclaimer: I like both sub and dub, but it really depends on the anime and how I'm feeling. Sometimes I don't want to read subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but personally I felt Akane was the only character (ironically, from how I felt about her in the first season) that I liked or felt any connection to at the end of it all. I feel like she developed well, and is a strong character compared to how she used to be. Otherwise, the others didn't leave much of an impression on me. I'm still not sure if that's good or bad. If the minor characters are too good, they take away from the main character, but that's the balance the writers have to find, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI have a hard time giving the enjoyment more than a 7, because although I really liked the philosophy when I got back into Psycho-Pass 2, I didn't understand the ending that well, but maybe I missed something. If anyone wants to explain it to me in the comments I'd be glad to listen. For the sake of a spoiler-free review I'm trying not put a lot of plot in (or any, as I feel I'm doing right now) since my question is about the last episode. But anyway, I did enjoy the majority of Psycho-Pass 2, although I did think the ending to the first season was a whole lot more satisfying. I guess the problem I have with the ending is I don't feel fulfilled after finishing it, there's not crazy cliffhanger or sense of closure for me, it's more of an indifference.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this is a good anime. I enjoyed the bits of philosophy that were peppered into it. Personally, I really like anime and stories that make me think and question things. This was well done and I would definitely recommend it if you want a bit of a sci-fi psychological thriller.",

            "content": "(Blanket warning for minor spoilers.)\r\nWhat a shame - that's really all I can say at this point. \r\nThe second installment of Psycho-Pass - the riveting 2012 series which had all the makings of an intelligent psychological thriller - is terrible. There's no two ways about that. Considering that Urobuchi is merely supervising the sequel and not writing it, like he did for the original, the cracks show. \r\nBeing a sequel, Psycho-Pass 2 is susceptible to being compared to the original for obvious reasons and as such, it fails to deliver.\r\n- SOUND (9/10): I enjoyed the OST used for the series and both the OP andED are pretty fantastic. The OST in particular is excellent, especially with the orchestral pieces used to enhance dramatic tension. It was fantastic in the first season and this has been carried over to the second, which works for me.\\n\\n\r\n- ART (8/10): Akira Amano's character design definitely has a couple of flaws - anybody who's read Katekyo Hitman Reborn can confer the same face thing, but it's a stylistic issue and a personal gripe for the most part. What I liked here is the minor design changes to reflect the passing of time. Shame that only Gino and Akane received these and not the rest of the cast. I liked the backdrops too and it's fairly the same as to what I'd come to expect from from the first season, including the gory shots of blood and guts.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem for me was perhaps the usage of CGI and how it momentarily distracted me, but it was otherwise pretty good.\\n\\n\r\n- STORY (4/10): And here's where Psycho-Pass 2 begins falling apart. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season ends with the Sibyl System still in place and the initial problem still present. The second season deals with exactly the same problem as the first, but with about 200% less charisma and grace. Kamui's motives and his method of getting things done make absolutely no sense, Tougane starts off with obvious parallels to Kougami but falls flat at the end, and the less that is said about Mika's bumbling, the better. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the second biggest oversight - after the cast of characters - is how often the previously established rules of the Psycho-Pass world are ignored and dismissed and, worse, how incompetent the MWBPS appear to be this time around. Sure, it's explained away as the collective Sibyl System's problematic judgement, but so is everything else. Psycho-Pass 2 is successful in establishing the fact that the Sibyl System is not perfect, but that in itself doesn't make it interesting or compelling.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the frequent use of gore. Too many people blown to bits this time around, to the point that it feels like it's being used as a shock factor. Psycho-Pass doesn't shy away from difficult to watch scenes - let's consider the first episode of the first season, for one - but there's no purpose to them here. Virtually half of the secondary cast is killed off messily and there's no real emotional impact to their deaths, neither on the other characters, nor on the audience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, finally, probably something less people comment on but - fanservice. Male-centric fanservice to be specific, with Shion, Kunizuka and the 2nd Division's Aoyanagi being stripped down to their underwear. I have no problem with it since it's not very distracting, but I wish that they'd levelled the playing field with some female-centric ones. I mean, we got shirtless Kougami in the first season; I could've done with more of that. :P\\n\\n\r\n- CHARACTERS (3/10): The meat of any good psychological thriller is it's story, brought to life with compelling and well-developed characters. What a shame that we get neither the story nor the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is perhaps the most interesting out of all of the rest of the cast, which is not saying much. Her growth and position as a respected Inspector is a good watch, a far cry from who she was at the beginning of the first series. I liked the little detail with the cigarettes, a good way to exhibit her attachment to Kougami. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that while Akane is a good character, the entire weight of the story is placed on her and the poor girl can't deliver while being exactly as pacifistic as she was the first time around. Akane needs a foil and for that we get three - Mika, Tougane and Kamui reprising the roles of Ginoza, Kougami and Makishima from the first season, and all of them fail at them utterly.\\n\\n\r\nKamui and Tougane's motives are lacklustre and they are explained via info dumps - something that automatically lessens their impact. Their development is non-existent and the chemistry between Tougane and Akane had potential, but it failed to deliver as such. Kamui's motives and actions have such laughable contradictions, and that's made even more annoying with Kamui being capable of doing nearly everything. Both Tougane and Kamui's methods of affecting a person's Psycho-Pass are explained, sure, but it's a hard swallow.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget the side cast, which is mostly pushed aside. Shion and Kunizuka serve their minor roles to capacity, but the disappointment is the newer Enforcers, none of whom are given any room to grow. Explaining this away as the limitations of a shorter season is really no excuse - the show shouldn't introduce so many characters if it's not prepared to treat them right. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is Ginoza's treatment - he'd played an important secondary role in the first season, but he might as well not exist in the second. He's not used as well here and even though he gets his moments to shine, it's nowhere near enough development.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, the biggest beef I have with Psycho-Pass 2 - Shimotsuki Mika.\\n\\n\r\nIt's never explicitly stated at any point, but Mika played a role in the first season. She's nowhere near the same character though, and watching her bumble through the entire case is an exercise in frustration. \\n\\n\r\nFor the record - I didn't like Akane initially. She's easily one of my top three characters in the Psycho-Pass 'verse now, given how we've watched her grow as a person. I was expecting the same from Mika but, sadly, that does not happen. \\n\\n\r\nThe problems with Mika are numerous, but the one most obvious is her tendency to be snotty and high-handed, without actually having the talent to back it up. She talks back to her superior officer, undermines her decisions despite them showing results, ignores her Enforcer's advice and she can't handle situations effectively when actually placed at the helm (episode 4. Just... episode 4). All of this would be understandable if she were a fresh recruit but, nope, she's been working under Akane for a year and a half. \\n\\n\r\nMika is more concerned with her Psycho-Pass than she is about doing anything useful. Her only shining moment comes when she cracks the Tougane secret, but even that proves to be a bust. She becomes an accomplice, indirectly causes the death of a citizen, but she chooses to never take any responsibility. She serves herself for the most part and isn't developed at all - no talk about her past, her family, her circumstances.  I couldn't empathize with her, because Mika blindly accepts everything about the Sibyl System, despite how fucked up it all is. Her conflict is non-existent and it only serves to prove that she's downright useless and incapable of utilizing her own agency. \\n\\n\r\nYes, her story-line is basically how an average Sibyl-System-grown citizen would handle being in the same situation as Akane. However, that alone doesn't make it interesting and/or exciting to watch. Mika is frustrating from the start to the end and one can't even ignore her, because she's a part of the main cast. \\n\\n\r\nAt least Makishima isn't completely ignored and is mentioned multiple times. The Kougami cameo was a nice touch, but I particularly enjoyed Akane-Jouji interactions and, well, Jouji in general. Perhaps one of the better things about Psycho-Pass 2 is that we get to watch Jouji work his magic.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4/10): Where the first season starts off slow then picks up momentum and ends on a high, the second does the same... except it all crashes and burns around the finale. Again, Kamui and Tougane were not compelling enough antagonists, the plot has holes, the characters are not developed well enough and then there's Mika. I imagine that the staff's intention was to make us feel sorry for her, but I couldn't do that with how much she frustrated me with her actions. I honestly wish there was a better character arc for her; it would've certainly elevated my enjoyment of the series a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nSuch a shame, because I really did want to like the second season. :(\\n\\n\r\nTo any enthusiasts of the original - just pretend that Season 1 is all that exists. The second certainly doesn't do well to live up to the first's legacy.",

            "content": "Psycho Pass season 2 packs quite a punch with tons of gore and extreme action sequences but it does lose a lot of its potent storytelling and character without Gen Urobuchi at the helm.  \r\nThe second season of Psycho Pass gets quite a mixed reaction amongst fans of the original and for good reason.  However, I still enjoyed my experience because of the amazing and twisted action sequences throughout the show.  I am a huge fan of horror anime and really gritty animation styles and I will say Psycho Pass season two delivered on this front.  After season one I neverimagined anything could compete with the brutality and twisted atmosphere of the original.  However, up against all odds, season 2 manages to be even more over the top with regards to action and suffering.  First off, the dominators are basically set to \u201cblow it the fluff up\u201d mode throughout the entire show as civilians, inspectors, and enforcers are all treated like bugs throughout the series.  Many of these fight sequences are well diversified as we encounter all out warfare involving bots, hostages, civilians, torture sequences, and villains alike.  These sequences were well paced throughout the show and worked well to hold your attention throughout the series as Psycho Pass has established itself as a show that never holds back on the gore.  The choreography and animation also provides a ton of suspense throughout the show and added a level of intensity to the series as you can feel every character movement during the action sequences.  The sci fi elements were also strong in season 2 as the shots of the city along with the technology the characters use throughout the show also held my attention.  All of these themes and aspects combined into a very fast paced and intense horror action experience.\\n\\n\r\nPsycho Pass may be tons of fun for horror fans but season 2 does have a few drawbacks most notably with regards to the characters and writing.  Gen Urobuchi is a master story teller who wrote many interesting and meaningful conversations between characters during season 1 which added a lot of meaning and development to complement the horror themes of the first season.  This elevated the first season as these conversations where extremely philosophical and intriguing.  However, these meaningful conversations along with character development is absent in season 2.  This can be attributed to the 12 episode format which leaves less time to develop characters with the amount of action sequences that are already present in the show.  The characters from season 1 that appear are still in character.  For example, Tsunami is still very smart and quick to solving problems.  However, other newer characters leave a lot to be desired.  The villain Kamui is basically a lesser version of Shogo.  Shimotsuki is a one note character whose only trait is being na\u00efve, and Tougane\u2019s intentions were too obvious to warrant suspense or interest during the show.  Overall, when it comes to characters, season 2 is a mixed bag with more misses than hits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also struggles to be at the level of season 1 as it\u2019s simply a copy paste rehash of season 1 with less suspense or creativity.  There is not much to say about it because you have already seen it and the new writers don\u2019t even try to hide it as from the beginning we are immediately introduced to Kamui and the troubles he causes the Sibyl system.  From there it is a condensed 11 episode version of season 1 with nothing to add to the series.  This rehashed story line only serves as a baseline for the Sci Fi action sequences throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nPsycho Pass season 2 is a still a fun time because of the insane exploitative sequences of Sci Fi action complemented by some outstanding animation even if it is lacking in depth and character.  If you like horror action you should watch season 2 of Psycho Pass but if you are looking for something more from an anime you may be underwhelmed.  \\n",

This is supposed to be a continuation from the previous season & that I honestly think it isn't that bad as other people make it out to be but it isn't really good either.\r\nStory was actually simple to understand what was going on in Season 2 yet that's the problem where Season 2 suffers. The Writing is more easily to understand what was happening throughout Season 2 in other words this Type of Direction is completely Average. It isn't that Complex nor that Fleshed out as the previous season. An AverageJoe like me was capable enough to understand Season 2 so easily that I find it somewhat insulting because Season 1 had time Fleshing the Story out & being Complex for a viewer like me to slowly understand what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nMika, a side character, was handled so poorly out of the other characters. She came off as an Annoying Know-it-all and disrespected Akane. She is the only character that I despised throughout Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Antagonist he was handled fine but he wasn't that interesting nor that investing in my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nI actually think Season 2 was Average at Best, there are some things I like while other things I didn't like. People say \"Don't watch it, it's not worth it\" for me I would say give it a chance just to have your own opinion but watch at least 3 to 5 episodes to see if it's worth watching.",

            "content": "This continuation just has too much of a convoluted and messy story to really stand at the same ground as the first season. \r\nStarting right where we left of, the story is centered around Akane, and returning as well as new members of Division 1, trying to apply justice in the distopian Japan where Sybil reigns as it avaluates a persons capability of becoming a latent criminal. This time around, we have our antagonist, Kamui, who wants to prove that the sistem is not perfect, and confronts the Public Safety Bureau, with his various schemes, all while we progressively learn various plot points about Sybil,and the vthe diverse cast. The problem is the repetition of the main arch plot, all this has been done... the diference is that there's a much more focused approach, and with a reduced number of episodes it doesn't allow for much world or character building. 5/10 Story\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fenomenal, it's really gripping to watch all the effects, since there are so many contrasts of colors, and the dark tone, relating to the type of story and world we are settled in. Overall this and the sound are the best aspect of this second season. 8/10 Art\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another problem, especially Kamui, first he is introduced as a poor man's Makishima, but as the story unfolds, he develops a lot more, and his backstory and goals help in that matter, but they are not as solid as Makishima's. Akane is the only real character who has a development and personality, maturing since the first season and dealing with the various problems she encounters. But the missing part is that there isn't really any strong connection between her and the antagonist, any real tension between morals like Makishima and Kogami and even her in S1. And the rest of Division 1 is really a miss, since they are not as developed, only Tougane and while promissing, his integration in the story isn't that good. 5/10 Characters\\n\\n\r\nIt started well enough, and you can say it is extremely well paced, it was gripping, but the problems emerging were to many that, while good to stand on it's own, doesn't really compare to the brilliant first season, not progressing in any way in its conclusion, serving as a good action oriented sci fi, with a confusing plot embedded.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have to begin this review by saying that albeit I'm giving it a full score, it is by no means perfect. It has many flaws. That said, there is an explanation for such contradiction and it is my own, personal method of evaluation. To me, if the pros in a work of fiction are big enough they negate the cons. And PP2 has spectacular highs. In fact, I consider the first season closer to perfection than this second, but this second season has much, much higher highs than the first season. It's just unfortunate that the lows are also lower.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is good enough,very tense and at many points clever. It also never ceased to surprise me with its twists and turns. And the cliffhangers at the end of the episodes, ah the cliffhangers! It relies and feeds back much more into the mythology of Psycho-Pass than the first season, being much more sci-fi and much more investigative. But then there are the flaws. It's very bad at explaining some points in some parts, making it harder than it should to understand in an apparent way of trying to make some points more clever than they really are. Also, some characters are sidelined, like Ginoza, for example, that was an important character in the first season and now is just an extra in the background most of the time. But there is a positive side in the characters department too. Akane is AWESOME in this second season, finally worthy of being the main character, she's smart and brave and cunning. She's badass. And there is another female character that people will hate, and she is a good addition. Also the nemy is pretty much Makishima Shougo but only much improved. Makishima was good on paper but lacking in execution, and Kamui is a bigger threat and brings forth more interesting developments about Sybil.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND\\n\r\nI'm putting them together because there is nothing much to say than that they're incredible. I'm not very good at judging animation, I think. I can't really see fails other people see, so take my judgement with a grain of salt. But the sound desing is good too, enhancing a perfectly paced, perfectly tense mood.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT\\n\r\nIt's much better than the first season (but don't jump to it, it depends on the first season). And Psycho-Pass 2 also, in its final episode, gives a hint to future developments, but it's too open if a third season doesn't come to be. So I would recommend it. To everyone, I think its subject matter probably interests anyone. Some set pieces astound and the revelations, albeit I admit a bit silly at times, always manage to make sense. It's just good.",

Also that ending theme song.\r\nDisliked - The opening themes video was bland, obvious spoilers in it.

            "content": "I'll be generous and give this a 7 out of 10.\r\nI have mixed feelings about this season. I really wanted to like it. As a heavy Psycho Pass fan, I really wanted to enjoy a return to this show. I ended up being disappointed with many aspects of this show.\r\nMany of the show's problems can be attributed to its main villain, Kamui.\r\nI'm not going to go to any spoilers, but the best way to describe him would be that he's a ghost. From what the previous show's villain, Makishima Shougo, left, Kamui has quite the big shoes to fill. Unfortunately, he fails for the mostpart to be as interesting as Makishima.\\n\\n\r\n1) Makishima always had this air about him that despite being a genius, he was beatable. This allowed for an interesting cat and mouse chase between him and the inspectors. Kamui doesn't have any of that. He comes off as invincible and too good even by the own shows standards. He has too many people following him, too many resources, and winds up pulling too many gambits to the point that it can leave the viewer very confused.\\n\\n\r\n2) The problem with Kamui is that he's clearly a villain that's forced by the writers to become more dangerous than he has any right to be all for the sake of being a bigger threat than the series' previous antagonist. He winds up pulling feats that just seem too much or too far fetched in a world that is governed by CCTV cameras everywhere. \\n\\n\r\n3) While he performed great feats, Makishima was human, while Kamui is a ghost. Which I'm guessing is what the writers were going for. However, they failed to portray this properly and execute their idea in a way that the audience can accept. Despite his interesting concept, his background story sounds ridiculous and he winds up being too much.\\n\\n\r\n4) Kamui feels like a copy and paste version of Makishima. Despite the differing concepts of the two antagonist, they are very much alike. Instead of going for another villain with a new personality contrasting his predecessor, we are ultimately left with a guy who tries too hard to beat the other and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I will say that Kamui does pull off feats that genuinely left me impressed. His portrayal and execution in the long run did not leave me with a good lasting impression on him.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the movie, and so far I could skip this entire season without getting too lost there. Although there are some pivotal moments in this show, they are not enough to warrant watching a full season of boring explanation after boring explanation just to catch up. Nothing overall has been changed. If you're that interested, watch it. Otherwise, stay clear.",

            "content": "I haven\u2019t watched a lot of current anime so I figured with the finale of Psycho-Pass 2 having come out this week it\u2019s as good a time as any to play a bit of catch-up and check out the series that have been getting praise this past year. Psycho-Pass is a good start as the first season is one of my favorite anime ever and this second season has been rather divisive among fans and critics, meaning it\u2019s time for me to formulate an opinion.\r\nThe first season of Psycho-Pass was written by Gen Urobuchi and was a mix between cyberpunk and a dystopian future, somethingthat worked really well and produced a unique world and story (my two favorite types of science fiction). The show had issues with being too pretentious and other, smaller parts that took away from the overall story, but for the most part it was an excellent, enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is getting a lot of unjust flak for a lot of things I feel the show did right. This season has issues but, truth be told, I marathoned the entire show this evening and couldn\u2019t have had a more enjoyable time.\\n\\n\r\nIn this season a bad guy with the ability to bypass the Sybil system by not having a crime co-efficient nor a hue (the color corresponding to the state of a person\u2019s psyche) is leading Akane and the freshly recruited inspector Shimotsuki across Tokyo in a bid to stop his madness. Along the way the man begins collecting Dominators, the weapons that the agents use to stop or kill criminals after gauging their psycho-pass, and experiments with how to use them.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the plot was tense, multi-layered, and worked out really well. It pushed the anime toward an existential crisis type ending that these sort of anime tend to have while also allowing enough action and intrigue to keep someone not as involved in the philosophy from falling asleep.\\n\\n\r\nOne issue comes from the fact that Gen Urobuchi isn\u2019t the writer. While the story is good, the writing can be pretty bad at times and I was especially cringing at the first episode. Thankfully, that first episode is not an indication of what to expect further along and the writing got mildly better, though never as good as Gen.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem of this series is that we\u2019re introduced to a load of new characters who don\u2019t get a lot of time to develop, probably the biggest problem for most people. And this is an understandable gripe as the first season had a decently developed team of characters. But that season was twice the length of this one and I think the focus on a very well-paced story works to the advantage here.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t get into the characters who\u2019ve joined Akane\u2019s team as none of them are worth discussing. The main characterization here is the fact Akane is now senior to a newbie who does things a way that doesn\u2019t exactly work in the society she belongs to. The duo are at odds throughout the entire show and later on, as Shimotsuki learns about what the Sibyl system is and starts into a sort of mental breakdown, we see the only true character development the series manages.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is at times superb, at others it relies heavily on awkward looking CG. The music ranges from the bad opening to pretty good tracks during the show, to a decent ending.\\n\\n\r\nAs Psycho-Pass 2 is only about three and a half hours in length (subtracting the opening and closings) there\u2019s not a lot I can say about it, especially without spoiling things. It\u2019s missing some key elements that made the original so enticing but is still an intelligent and interesting romp through a unique world. It\u2019s gruesome, it\u2019s violent, it\u2019s thoughtful, and it comes together to a mildly satisfactory conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Psycho-Pass 2 is a worthy follow up. It\u2019s not as good as its predecessor, nor is it all that particularly bad. It\u2019s a short, intelligent crime drama that, while not as memorable as the first season, is still pretty solid nonetheless",

End of story.\r\nI'd upload a decent analytical review, explaining why it is so horrible, but neither do I have the time, nor do I feel like putting in more effort than the actual writers did.\r\nAwful recycled, messy, if not plainly nonsensical plot with some of the greatest asspulls since Mirai Nikki plus pointless lines of dialogues and characters whose creation ended with their design.\r\nWe're talking about writers here that literally tried to give a definitive answer to the omnipotence paradox. And in one or two sentences at that.\r\nJust stay away if you want to keep theoverall positive experience of season one because pretty much everything that made it good left the building for this season.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be my review for a steaming pile of... wait I mean Psycho-Pass 2. Its easy to get those two things confused. Pyscho-Pass 2 takes everything that was good about the first series and removes it, doubles the amount of annoying characters and installs more illogical arguments and situations and serves it up in a much more manageable size of 11 episodes. Lets begin the review and hopefully validate this terrible score.\r\nFirst the story takes place a short time after the events of the first series. Akane is now head inspector, a few enforcers are gone for various reasons and a newdetective joins the group. The story begins much the same way as the first season, an event occurs but it seems to be the work of some master criminal pulling the strings from the background. Akane and gang then go on an investigation to figure out who it could possibly be. Of course during the investigation they forget some of the events of the first season and ask silly questions like is it possible to fool the sybil system? We also have new information given to us or rather crammed in to the show in order to try and patch up some of the story holes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story picks up towards the middle again, as though it needs the extra speed to kill itself with the last few episodes. Plots within plots and failed logic abound as everyone's favorite detective comes to the rescue of justice. Does justice prevail? Well that's up to you to find out. There were a few interesting conversations towards the end but really the simple fact that its over is its saving grace. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the characters a little. Akane is only slightly annoying in this season though I'm sure this is again do to the choice to mask her poor character behind a more annoying character (Mika Shimotsuki) who is seemingly trying to win backstabbing cunt of the year award. The enforcers have little significance this time around and the only one worth a mention is the new enforcer (Sakuya Tougane) who plays a seemingly intricate part in the muddled story. The other characters only got a short scene here or there to show that they still are alive and to make it seem perfectly normal that every character is a master criminal, world level hacker, super charismatic leader, tireless bad ass and a telepath. Again there are a few interesting interactions and my hopes got raised towards the end of the show as some interesting developments arise for Mika, but sadly they were quickly let down.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound again were very well done. Cant have any complaints here. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show was not existent. I wanted to finish it so I didn't have to restart it in the future. The show takes itself to seriously to behave in the manner that it did. This time it doesn't even matter about whether or not you agree with the terms of \"justice\". This season was bad because it felt like it was written for children to say \"Wow this is deep\" as they pretend to their friends that they understood it and try to gain some level of cool or maturity from their lies. Luckily I had no emotional attachment to the show so I was able to just steamroll through the episodes in only minor frustration and unfortunate boredom.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Did you watch the first season? Do you have plans to watch the first season? If yes then watch this and be disappointed. If no, then stay the hell away.",

            "content": "*tl;dr at the bottom of the page\r\nAfter finishing a solid season one of Psycho Pass, I found out that there was a second season and I couldn't ignore it. I wanted to review the two seasons of Psycho Pass together, but after watching the second season it became clear that the quality of the anime significantly worsened. That is why I will review the two seasons of Psycho Pass separately, and now on to the review. \r\nThe second season of Psycho Pass occurs eighteen months after the first season. We meet new character additions to division 1 of the MWPSB and a new antagonist seekingto confront the Sibyl System. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Psycho Pass 2, especially the second half of the anime, is quite disappointing. The first half of the anime gives a sense of suspense and anticipation of what will happen next that really made me sit on the edge of my seat. It really hooked me in and I couldn't stop watching. The second half, however, made me scratch my head multiple times in confusion. The build up for the main antagonist Kamui was really well done, but the build up fails to deliver at the end as the anime hits a giant brick wall. The plot holes are inconsistent with the characters and the story and simply make little to no sense at times. Oh the plot twists, don't even get me started on those. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing from its first season, the animation is great. It is the best part of Psycho Pass 2 and the saving grace of it. I could have easily given this anime a 4 or 5 instead of a 6 if it was not for its animation. The anime uses darker colors especially well to reflect its dark atmosphere and the dark atmosphere effectively set the tone for it. The music is the kind you would expect in a psychological and sci-fi anime, but nothing extremely special. The ending song is my personal favorite for this anime and I enjoy the osts quite a bit as well. \\n\\n\r\nAnd here we get to the characters, oh boy do I have a lot to say. I can write a whole essay alone just by ranting on about my least favorite character, the new inspector in division 1, Shimotsuki, aka the \"relentless bitch\". So relentless bitch is an extremely despicable character who believes that she is always right and refuses to listen or hear from others. She looks down on enforcers and even her fellow investigator Akane as well. Not only that, she is also extremely weak and indecisive to the point of making you want to flip tables and never gets anything done. Did she even fire a single shot this whole season? And then we have the new enforcers as well. Hinakawa and Tougane. Hinakawa is an expect on holograms and is shy, not a whole lot to say about him. Tougane is a strong enforcer that resembles Kougami from season one. Tougane had the most potential out of all the new characters, but the anime fails to effectively develop him as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the new antagonist Kamui. While some people say that he is basically the same as Makishima from season one, I give him a little more credit. The anime does show how far Kamui is willing to go to achieve his goals, and he does some things that Makishima would probably never do. However, his goal is extremely similar to that of Makishima and he basically drives season two into another \"freedom vs order\" argument. \\n\\n\r\nFinally we have the original characters from season one. I was quite frustrated with how they treated Ginoza and Kougami. Ginoza becomes a complete side character despite the huge influence and development he had in season one. Kougami doesn't even make a physical appearance in season two, just what the fuck. They spent so much time on Ginoza and Kougami in season one just to completely throw them off to the side in season two that I question how they came to that decision in the first place. Akane actually does get good development as it shows her new role as the senior investigator of division 1 and the effects of her decision to accept the sibyl system for the time being. She is the one breath of fresh air among all the other characters in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy the second season of Psycho Pass as much as I did the first season. It is not good sequel to the solid first season and only drags this series down as a whole. And god, I still can't get relentless bitch Shimotsuki off my mind. \\n\\n\r\n\"Enough you Idiot! Shorten it to 20 words or less!\" -Saitama (One Punch Man)\\n\r\n(tl;dr) PP2 started off great and had some potential with its plot and characters, but fails to deliver at the end.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nDespite only being half the length of the first series I still think the second series actually put up a good effort to make a sequel to this brilliant franchise.\r\nThe story continues with Akane Tsunemori who has learnt about the secrets of Sibyl and has vowed not to reveal their secrets so she carries on to uphold justice until a new threat changes everything.\r\nNow I have to applaud the story once again especially considering this was only 11 episodes and despite the length it was still very entertaining, it had some interesting plot twists like the last season although some things were predictable.\r\nItwas very interesting seeing Akane being pushed even further than before as she has become the leader of Unit 1 and is desperately trying to keep her convictions intact from this new threat that is trying to threaten the authority of the Sibyl system considering she knows it's secrets.\\n\r\nOnce again there is more loss in this series that puts Akane even more on edge and makes her very desperate not to get clouded from the actions affecting her and that even the people she is working with can't be trusted as they too pose a threat to her investigation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters mostly consist of characters from season 1 excluding Kougami and some others who died, but the characters that replaced them weren't exactly up to snuff.\\n\r\nAkane continues to be the badass she was at the end of series 1 and this series really tested her abilities as a leader and person and the fact she made it through all that happened really shows how much of a resolved person she is.\\n\r\nThe people that survived series 1 didn't really get as much screentime compared to the first series and their characters aren't really expanded upon however Ginoza has now become an enforcer which makes him see his teammates from a new perspective since he is now one of them, but his character isn't really expanded upon any further.\\n\r\nThe new characters were certainly mixed in my opinion, Sakuya Tougane who is a new member is a very seclusive person and has the highest coefficient on record although he does believe in Akane's belief, but his reveal as a villain didn't surprise me at all since he looked suspicious anyway.\\n\r\nMika Shimotsuki was actually a student in the first series and has now become an inspector, but she is annoying as hell she doesn't even trust Akane's judgement or actions and the fact she kept on whining about it didn't help whatsoever for her character.\\n\r\nKirito Kamui is the new villain of this season and despite not being as good as Shougo he was still pretty interesting because the fact he couldn't be detected b Dominators was interesting enough and finding out why he couldn't be detected sounded pretty grim and shows why he wanted to reveal the secrets of the Sibyl system.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle remained as well done to the first series and didn't really have nothing really new to add other than making peoples deaths even more gruesome than the last series like when there was a massacre a bank or when Kirito transplanted someones eye so he could use it himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe action was a bit more variance to the first series like how drones were hacked in and used to kill the workers and enforcement officers by cleverly being disguised as a video game making people not realise that they were killing people on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological aspect was again done very well too as it shows the difficult situations Akane had to go through without her mind being clouded which made her look like a heart less human being, but you realise she is hurting on the inside and that she must focus on the job first and let loose later.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel like this series shouldn't really get the slack it got because despite not being as good in some areas compared to the first series it certainly kept other areas at a good enough level to make this worth watching.",

Aired on Fall 2014 along w/ other awesome anime series didn't let Psycho-Pass 2 down. It stands along w/ Akame ga Kill!, Donten ni Warau, Akatsuki no Yona, Amagi Brilliant Park, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, Gugure! Kokkuri-san, and Kiseijuu. What so damn tough opponents those are!\r\n    The story centers around the heroine, Akane Tsunemori and her division to capture the rebel against Sybil System, named Kamui. It's complicatedand every episode makes you curious about what will going on next and what's behind the motive of this Kamui to questioned the system which rules society. By this summary, I hope it won't bring spoiler at all wwww~\\n\r\nEventho' the storyline sounds simple but the conflict both intrapersonal and interpersonal of each characters runs deeper than you imagine. If I could say it's so philosophical and meaningful. Even w/ such a hard topic to bring with, the delivery of every questions to solve the case go on so smooth yet mysterious. That's how I like this series the most.\\n\\n\r\n    Another boost point is also the music. Ling tosite Sigure with \"Enigmatic Feeling\" as opening and EGOIST with \"Fallen\", are the blast. The rhythm, tempo, as well as gloomy lyrics bring an unspeakable excitement which feels so fit w/ the series.\\n\\n\r\n    As my words deliver the information about the improvement of each characters above, I shouldn't say much about it~maybe it will ruin the viewers feel who haven't watched it to enjoy the series. According to what my acquaintance said, there are few new characters added in this second season, compared to the first season, the new characters here really goes boom the story and conflicts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor such the great plot and other aspects of it, I give 9 for the series \u266a\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nGreat plot and somewhat mysterious stuffs\\n\r\nDamn catchy theme songs\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThe improvement of the case seems to overreact by make it so dramatic",
