The main character is easy for me to relate to what made this show really something for me to look forward to when I first read about it online.\r\nAll episodes are well connected with each other and made me wanting to just watch it in one go as soon as I had the chance watching it. This proves the concept of the story and how well I could follow it. There were no gaps or plot holes for me to recognize. The art was fitting andthe comedy elements were well placed breather moments making the whole show not too dense and after a bit of drama acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nThe big question is why or when should you watch it? Have you ever had moments in life when you thought: \"Damn, what if I didn't do this or what if I would had done that.\" Ever felt regret about something in the past? This show will unwind those questions in a really good way for you to relate to. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this good and well written story and the animation fits perfectly.

            "content": "Watching ReLIFE was quite an experience. Although it wasn't \"special\" it had its moments.\r\nStory 7.0/10\r\nStory, wasn't anything special. The duration of the series follows Kaizaki Arata, a 27-year-old neet or shut in. He gets offered a pill from some odd fellow, Ryou Yoake, because you know, when you meet a stranger on the streets you accept pills from them. Anyway, as you may already know he's able to start his life over, from high-school again. Now it's not one of those, starting over again from a different world, more so, main character Kaizaki is goes back in time, kinda sort of. He's still the sameage mentally, it's only his appearance that has changed. Nothing special is worth mentioning or pointing out in this story. The whole neet trying to redo his life gimmick seems overused and uninteresting at first however, the plot for each episode would have some interesting developments that were actually worth watching. The biggest issue I had was that sometimes intrusive sub-plots began taking over what was really important in the beginning which was the MC getting the opportunity to redo his life. It wasn't all that bad though, although the story-telling isn't consistent, the characters introduced later in the story, Arata's friends, their backstories and situations add for a very amusing, dramatic and emotional experience. From a comedic standpoint, the show is very light on jokes. Often times there were scenes that appeared to be made for laughs however, a majority of it felt forced and just didn't work out. I\\n\\n\r\nPacing in the story is really slow, if you want to have a good experience watching for the interesting narrative, along with other features this series has to offer, then I highly recommend that viewers watch it at their own pace. Furthermore, please make sure that you don't take users, myself included (obviously.) opinions and reviews and let them ruin or change your perspective of how you perceived the show.  Towards the ending of the series, around episode 10 I noticed that there was a good amount of dramatic build up. There was a lot of potential opportunities for an amazing dramatic conclusion, however... NOPE! this potential was thrown out. I thought it would have made for great entertainment if the last few episodes focused more on drama however, this simply was not the case. Instead the last few episodes seemed like they should've been aired around episodes 7 or 9 or at the very least should've been released as an OVA or OAD.  If any improvements to the story could've been made I would have liked to seen it focus less on branching out. Often times the story was all over the place. One episode the plot follows this character, doing this that and the other, next episode focuses on another character doing this that or the other. For me it came off as unbalanced, the story hardly focuses on the \"Why?\" and just keeps going forward. All and all, I wasn't impressed with everything that the story had to offer. Perhaps if there was a season 2 in the works then it would more than likely help me come to terms with the conclusion. Although predictable romances were made clear in the story, I still want to see the final outcome without reading the manga. The story earned a nice 7/10 from me mates.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nArt, animation and other related things were pretty bad. Character designs along with the animation quality for settings looked outdated. I thought I was watching something from 2007 or 2008. This would not have been such a bad thing if only the show wasn't released in 2016... you know, the year we are currently in. In addition to that, the reaction faces and backgrounds used for the characters looked like they belonged in the late 2000's period too. Over the top reaction faces with settings that matched them. Speaking of backgrounds, the settings for a majority of the locations, school, parks, festivals, all looked like hand painted cels from before you and I were born. Traditional cel animation... I hope to see the Blu-Ray release improve the quality of the settings and character designs. If this was rushed then I would totally understand. overall it's just unacceptable. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI hope you like pianos...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty bad. It was like they were on a budget or something. I didn't really care for the opening and ending songs. In addition to that the background songs were not, in any way, special. Now ordinarily, I love pianos, if you've ever read any of my past reviews then you already know I'm a sucker for pianos, being a pianist and keyboardist and all.I'll be honest though, there is hardly any songs playing at all for the majority of the time. I kid you not, there are like 3 or 5 songs played in the background, all of them don't seem to match with whatever situations going on in the series. Often times it was as if the background music was added to prevent a scene for feeling bland or boring. It was too late for that though.... The voice actors were alright, I suppose. There isn't too much to say about them other than they did a pretty good job delivering their character's lines. What caught my attention in the sound department was how quiet the series is.  Background characters don't say anything. No talking from background characters at the fireworks festival, school, it felt a little too strange to me.  I mean, it's ordinary in lots of shows, however because the show was going for more of an authentic type setting, focusing on realistic settings, I think that background noise is necessary, especially since the show is very quiet in terms of sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters felt so one-sided. Each had one distinct trait about themselves that made the individual stand out, barely. Developing romantic relationships between the males and females were predictable and very, very, cliche. I mean, to the point where it wasn't cute, or sweet,  nor emotional. You can easily tell whose going to end up with who based upon their actions with one another. The character development in the show is somewhat minuscule. Chizuru is like the only character in the show that has any major character development and growth. I found this to be somewhat disappointing because I thought that if anything Arata would have been shown to have the most beneficial developments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nEntertaining isn't a word I would use for the \"enjoyment\" part of ReLIFE. If anything, any sense of enjoyment was rather weak due the inconsistent and often times \"strange\" way story telling... or presentation. Not to mention that somewhat inconclusive ending.  While watching ReLIFE it felt more like I was just in it for the ride. Nothing for me to think about other than how predictable the events will turn out and what characters will form a romantic relationship. Overall I wasn't too impressed with everything that ReLIFE had to offer in the Story, sound, art, and characters department. It felt rushed in those departments. Perhaps the producers were worried about time constraints and not finishing things in time, either way the final product just didn't live up to my expectations. The series just barley earned the 6/10 I gave it.",

            "content": "!FIRST REVIEW!\r\nTo start off, ReLife is an anime that you can learn from. There was always some sort of tactic to get you interested, whether it was character development, conflict, or the entertainment. All-in-all, it was a very good anime.\r\nThe characters were so loveable and memorable, I even remember their names, plus got emotionally attached to each one of them. Their experiences really pull at your heart strings and make you love them even more. Even the tsundere character was loveable in this one.\r\nThere is conflict around every corner, but you understand where the problem is coming from and want to know how it getssolved. Most conflicts such as the ones in the story are not portrayed as commonly in other animes airing as of late. With this, I am going to have to say that it takes you back and gives you the feeling of nostalgia, especially with the music- mostly piano and jazz-, art - simple with cell-shading and cute editing used from older animes-, and of course the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nWith this anime, I kept on laughing or on the edge of my seat. Every episode either had me in tears of joy or sadness. This anime is a slife of life done RIGHT. The simple highschooler, middle schooler, or even those with full-time jobs will love this anime, relating to the characters often. The anime is very light, however touch on inner conflicts that many people face, including jealousy between friends and the \"real world\".\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this was a fairly well-made anime. The creators were not afraid to take risks and produced a wonderful anime- and based off a japanese webtoon from comico at that! There were some minor issues, such as the sudden change in music. The modern animes made today have orchestral music or even the computer-made songs in the original soundtrack, but this anime continuously plays rather simple piano pieces to help portray mood. Another this was when in one episode, SOMEONE TYPES ON THE KEYBOARD WHERE THE WORDS ARE AND ON THE NUMBER PAD (usually on the right of the keyboard). (And yes I just had to notice that.)\\n\\n\r\nI REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that I was not expecting much when I jumped in to this - A slice of life anime based on a webtoon AND a completed tag when it first airs did not sound promising- HOWEVER, it exceeded my expectations and I ended up finishing the anime in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nPLEASE, GIVE IT A CHANCE.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I want to note that when I first wrote the majority of this review as first impressions, I still had 3 more episodes to watch. The original review didn't include my thoughts on the ending. This review you're about to read is my final opinion on ReLIFE and it was spell checked. I'm only going to add my thoughts about the ending at the end and I decided not to edit the rest. Enjoy.\r\nShould you watch? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: No. This may sound confusing to some but it's how I feel about this series. I feel like if I getinto too many details describing the show then I'll sound like I'm telling you not to watch. Even though I'm not an expert at doing reviews, I'll try my best to express my thoughts while they're fresh.\\n\\n\r\nSo as many of you already know, this story follows a 27-year-old jobless man that gets the offer to go back to high school. With a pill, he turns from a grown adult to a 17-year-old. One of the problems is that he still has the mentality of a 27-year-old and he can't tell anyone about the pill and his real age. He gets assigned to a high school nearby and ends up falling for a very shy and awkward girl named Hishiro and making many friends. The second problem is that this girl he has fallen for and his friends are 17-year-olds and the difference of age causes a problem on how he needs to act and how far can he go around them. What comes next is a 'not very original' romance/friendship story between our cast.\\n\\n\r\nI came to this series with ridiculously low expectations (like really low). To my surprise, in the first episodes (episodes 1-6 to be specific) I was having a blast. I was laughing my ass off and I really enjoyed the character's interactions with each other. I thought that this series could be something unique and it could hold on its own against the other spectacular series that approach us this summer season. Then...I got to the 7th episode. It all fell downhill from here on.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with episodes 7-10 is that they felt like nothing was progressing. Sure we got some character development for side characters, but to me it just felt like I was watching OVAs or specials. It wasn't until Episode 11 that somewhat picked the story up a little and I felt like shit was progressing. I was really enjoying the first episodes but suddenly I wasn't laughing as much and I wasn't having the same enjoyment as before.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the second half fell flat, it wasn't horrible nor unwatchable. I think that since I was having so much fun with episodes 1-6 that when it dialed down a bit, it felt a bit underwhelming. It was good seeing that development and it was a decent watch all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing extraordinary, but it's interesting. The characters are a bit clich\u00e9, but still lovable. The romance is nothing to fangirl about, but it's cute. It's not the best thing I've watched, but I did have fun. I think I underestimated this anime and even though it had a couple of flaws, it was very enjoyable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nTHOUGHTS ON THE FINAL 3 EPISODES: So if you've read this far, you'd know how disappointed I was about the second half. Now that I have finished the show, I think these 3 episodes made up for the mess it got itself into. After 4 episodes of feeling like I was watching non-canon filler, the story really picked itself up, it felt funny again and we got a pretty good ending. Without spoiling anything, all the romantic doubts I had about who was going to end together were resolved (at least in my opinion). The only thing I'm a bit disappointed about is that I feel like I'll need to pick up the manga to get a 100% satisfying ending. Don't get me wrong, it was somewhat satisfying, but my romance craving heart needs a full confirmation on things. Needless to say, I really enjoyed this anime and will be thinking about it for a while.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 7.5\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (I originally gave it a 7.5 but after watching the last 3 episodes, it's a solid 8.)\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, I say to go give it a shot. It's only 13 episodes and I think it's worth at least one viewing. I really hope you found this review helpful.",

            "content": "The prospect of being able to live part of your life over again and do things differently isn\u2019t a new setup in any media, let alone anime. One of the more memorable attempts at tackling this premise was a 1986 novel called \u201cReplay\u201d, but it was hardly the first. 18 Again! (1988) and particularly 17 Again (2009) and Seventeen Again (2000) are another similar bunch of films tackling the same scenario. ReLIFE is late to the party, and it makes very little attempt at subverting this familiar premise. But that\u2019s okay; originality isn\u2019t everything. Having an unoriginal narrative that\u2019s well-executed is far more valuable thanhaving an original and shoddily-executed narrative. All things considered, ReLIFE seemed to be primed for the former category, but ultimately, it wasn\u2019t to be. There simply isn\u2019t one quality I can recall that this show excels in. Not in pacing, not in characterisation, not in drama, not in art, not in animation, not in sound, not in comedy and not in tone. And for the record, having a poorly-executed and unoriginal narrative is the least valuable of the bunch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPREMISE\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE's premise is likely familiar to anyone who has read their fair share of web novels; it's the \"starting life again in another world from zero\" premise that has been steadily wedging its way into recent anime adaptations. That said, ReLIFE feels far more reminiscent of Welcome to the NHK!, wherein the series delves into and ultimately seeks to 'solve' hikikomori issues and thought processes with stunning authenticity. However, this similarity only really extends as far as ReLIFE's initial premise. For better or for worse, ReLIFE only ever touches on NEET lifestyles once or twice throughout its 13-episode run, opting instead for an irritating amount of tiresome adolescent melodrama. Now, melodrama in itself isn't an inherently bad thing; if utilised competently, it can explore a particular theme in far greater depth and provoke far greater emotional impact than if it were to attempt to emulate the nuances and confines of reality. Melodrama is an incredibly helpful tool for dealing with hefty themes even if it ultimately cheapens a character's conflict when viewed from a critical outlook. It is unfortunate, then, that ReLIFE's themes are the weakest and most ill-defined element of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBAD DRAMA\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE began quite promisingly by setting up several intriguing plot and character threads to later be drawn on and building chemistry between characters with genuinely funny \u30fc if largely hollow and repetitive \u30fc humour. It gradually introduced several interesting and entertaining characters, though they never really stray far enough from their established stereotypes. ReLIFE set up its initial premise exceptionally well, held up mostly on the merit of its characters. However, the ultimate tragedy strikes when the show puts on too much weight for the characters to carry. ReLIFE starts to buckle when it first gives its audience a taste of drama though somehow manages to stay afloat just on the merit of its characters, but it falls flat on its face when it ends up shoving too much bad drama into the show.\\n\\n\r\nBad drama is drama that viewers can't relate to, care about and/or drags on for far too long. ReLIFE's particular brand of drama sidelines the leads in favour of having everything revolve around not-quite-main-characters that are given too much screen time. It doesn't help that ReLIFE drags out this melodramatic subplot for an entire quarter of its run time, slowly chipping away at my patience and quickly pushing the focus characters from 'sympathetic' territory into 'irritating-and-just-get-on-with-it' territory. As time wore on, I grew to actively dislike, if not outright hate, most of the characters in ReLIFE as more and more melodrama was piled on in a weak attempt at keeping me on the edge of my seat. Admittedly, I was on the edge of my seat \u30fc I came very close to walking straight out of the room and never looking back several times throughout these four agonisingly slow-paced episodes.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE spends too much time on what amounts to meaningless drama that has no lasting or significant impact on the characters involved after it is resolved. The problems in question are the kind I was confronted with at the age of 14. In spite of the questionable weight of these issues, I was expecting to find Kariu's drama interesting and relatable, but I instead found it drawn out and shallow. ReLIFE wastes four episodes on angsty melodrama that has absolutely nothing to do with the protagonists, and it doesn't even have the decency to tackle it in any real depth. Worse than being shallow, it quickly becomes boring/grating and lacks any weight because it's incredibly obvious how Kariu's problems are going to be neatly tied up in the end. The problems she faces throughout the series are quite typical of high school drama shows; I've seen it done plenty of times before, and I've seen it done a whole lot better. Do you want good high school melodrama? Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou excels at it. Do you want shallow and inoffensive high school melodrama? Take ReLIFE or Yume Kara, Samenai. And in ReLIFE's case, the supporting characters it shoved into this subplot (see sportsgirl #87408) don't have nearly enough depth or personality for me to latch onto, or they are boring renditions of existing archetypes I've seen a million times over. ReLIFE has boring drama and boring characters, and that doesn't make for a good combo.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is at odds with itself \u30fc while its premise is designed for exploring its characters in a dramatic and meaningful way, most of its characters are seemingly designed primarily for light-hearted comedy and light character drama. It certainly doesn't help that all of the drama it does tackle is predictable and boring, and when the show empties itself completely of comedy, it becomes a slog. ReLIFE suddenly decides that it wants to revolve around teen melodrama that bears little resemblance to its original themes for a quarter of its length. Not only does ReLIFE almost entirely lose its focus half-way through, but the narrative also becomes dry, boring and predictable. After a certain amount of tiresome melodrama, it becomes impossible to see these characters in a sympathetic light anymore. The more this subplot was dragged out, the more irritating the characters became. In the end, it amounts to nothing more than bad filler in a show that had no room for filler. Aside from the sparse developments for the protagonist and one other character, everything else is ultimately rendered moot after the subplot reaches its conclusion -- Kariu doesn't change as a result of this conflict; not really. It feels as if only the surface problems were painted over and bandaged together while the deeper problems continue to seethe underneath. Kariu gets shallow treatment throughout the volleyball arc, but this isn't automatically a bad thing. If these deeper issues were brought up later on in the series, it might serve as appropriate setup. Unfortunately, ReLIFE ends before any of that can happen, so it remains pointless at the moment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFOCUSING ON THE WRONG CHARACTERS\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat most bothers me about ReLIFE is all of the wasted potential \u30fc not only in that it doesn't explore any NEET-related problems or the fact that it wasted four episodes piling more melodrama on top of even more melodrama for characters that were never developed enough for me to care about in the first place, but also how ReLIFE doesn't follow any of its more interesting threads. Yoake is an interesting and, as it turns out, flawed character that isn't perfect at his job. ReLIFE spends an episode focusing on him and his past (another one of its subplots), but in spite of this focus, Yoake still remains largely mysterious to both Kaizaki and viewers; we don't really know what makes him tick. I wouldn't have minded if Yoake got four episodes to himself and his character was actually explored in a decent amount of depth; he has the potential to become an interesting AND multi-faceted character. Unfortunately, not only does ReLIFE spend this time on a much more irritating and less interesting character, it also reduces Yoake to gags most of the time, which means we rarely ever get to see the real him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it isn't only Yoake, either \u30fc An, another character who should be prominent in ReLIFE doesn't get nearly as much screen time as she deserves. In fact, she gets even less time than Yoake. Much like Yoake, she is mysterious and a lot of her qualities feel vague and ill-defined; her personality, her interests, her perspective and also how she feels about the romantic tension she oftentimes finds herself entrapped in. Fortunately, An has a lot more surface personality than Yoake and has a bigger role than gags most of the time, but because she has even less focus than Yoake, it all balances out in the end. We never get a sense of what makes either Yoake or An tick, and most of the focus that could have been directed at clearing up this vagueness is instead used for perpetuating its tiresome melodrama for far too long.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that another good character, Chizuru, gets enough screen time for us to actually understand and care about her, but I often found myself thinking: \"can we get back to something more interesting \u30fc you know, like Chizuru?\" She gets a decent amount of focus, which is something ReLIFE actually does quite well, but I feel that if the series focused more on her and less on generic insecure sportsgirl #59830 and Kariu's melodrama, it would have been a whole lot less irritating and even entertaining if done well. She disappears for episodes at a time, aside from getting maybe a line or two that don't help to progress the plot in the slightest. Chizuru was a big part of what made the comedy and light-hearted feel of ReLIFE work so well, but she essentially vanished in episodes 7-9; ReLIFE dumbly sidelined one of its best qualities to bring into focus one of its worst subplots.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I almost forgot about Kaizaki \u30fc you know, the protagonist? Hey, cut me some slack here, the show seems to forget about him a lot of the time, too! The show rarely decides to focus on the protagonist and his problems, but when it does, it's actually interesting. Kaizaki has so much screen time, yet we see so little of his character. Almost every time he engages with other characters \u30fc and particularly the high school ones \u30fc it's usually quite shallow because Kaizaki needs to stand as a symbol and self-insert for the older audience. None of the more interesting parts of his personality are shown; it's mostly just a way for Kaizaki to crack a joke or reference that the older audience can appreciate. If he showcases too much of his personality, that gets in the way of his status as an easy-to-slip-into pair of trousers. This means that he ends up stuck in a rather odd position as the protagonist \u30fc he's boring, bland and ultimately just feels like an observer. Oh, but he's also an amalgamation of all the 'I'm getting near that age' tropes. Yeahhh, ReLIFE isn't great with handling its characters, but the worst of it is when the show starts dealing with Kaizaki's backstory.\\n\\n\r\nBased off his introduction, one might make the mistake of thinking that Kaizaki is an interesting and flawed character, but this notion is mostly put to rest when Kaizaki's backstory is unveiled. Kaizaki is portrayed as a 'good' person \u30fc the show even uses the term 'hero' to describe him \u30fc with nary a flaw in his personality. It's society that is painted as evil, villainous, wrong, morally reprehensible and just all around dickish while ReLIFE makes every effort to portray Kaizaki as a decent person with no significant flaws. This is ReLIFE's crowning moment of wasted potential. Kaizaki's backstory turns out to be quite interesting, actually, but Kaizaki is still as boring as ever. This has to do with the fact that most of his dark backstory doesn't actually have a lot to do with Kaizaki himself; in it, he mostly plays the supporting role to someone else's main character. The problem with Kaizaki's backstory is that it isn't his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, Kaizaki has rather shallow characterisation despite being the protagonist; about his only real character flaw is, as briefly summarised by another character in the show, \"a lack of confidence.\" He has difficulty coming to grips with his past, but there's not a lot else that viewers can find to latch onto Kaizaki as a character. Most of the time, he's simply used as a symbol for the 'approaching middle ages' demographic and plays the role of the counsellor in this high school drama. Unfortunately, Kaizaki turns out to be a phenomenally boring character that never strays far enough from his established archetype to grasp a firm sense of identity. But it almost seems as if he was never meant to develop like that; to Kaizaki, ReLIFE is 'feel good therapy.' By involving himself in and solving these kids problems (i.e. playing the counsellor role), he is expected to gain back some of the confidence that he has lost, because he is so afraid/self-conscious of how his actions will impact on his environment. Unfortunately, that still doesn't make Kaizaki an interesting \u30fc let alone three-dimensional \u30fc character; instead, it just makes him perfectly suited to overseeing most of the melodrama in this series. At best, it only serves as a justification as to why he sticks so close to his established archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is some potential to take Kaizaki's character in an interesting direction and give him some depth in the future, but ReLIFE ends before any of this can happen. ReLIFE sets up a great many plot and character elements throughout its run but never draws on the more interesting ones, save for an exception or two with its final two episodes. However, there is some good news: while ReLIFE falls flat as a standalone season, if a sequel airs and actually goes about drawing on the massive amount of setup that ReLIFE has been building up with these 13 episodes, ReLIFE has the potential to become a far more engaging series along with gaining more depth. With enough caution, a second season of ReLIFE could even be enjoyable if it focused a lot more on endearing characters like Chizuru, rather than irritating characters like Kariu. However, this potential certainly doesn't change how poorly-paced, terribly executed and just flat out boring the majority of this season was; it only softens the blow.\\n\\n\r\nBut ReLIFE isn't all bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE spends its final three episodes attempting to make up for its terrible drama by reverting back to the way it was initially, though it still makes a few feeble attempts at meaningful drama. And, surprisingly enough, ReLIFE does actually manage to redeem itself somewhat by its final episode, but it ends up failing on an entirely different level: by the end of its thirteen-episode run, ReLIFE hardly accomplishes anything. ReLIFE is a lot of setup without a lot of execution. Worst of all, ReLIFE doesn't even have a proper conclusion \u30fc it merely cuts off, prompting viewers to pick up the manga if they want more. ReLIFE doesn't end up being much more than a bad advertisement for its parent manga series. When a show still doesn't have a firm sense of identity by the end of its run, why would viewers want to delve further into the series? ReLIFE fails not only as a TV series, but also as an extended advertisement.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it must be said that the show does have a solid final two episodes that gradually repaired my shattered image of the characters. ReLIFE does follow a predictable flow with its romantic subplot, but it wasn't done poorly. That said, there is one thing that this last arc does quite well: (mostly) believable, well-paced and light drama. ReLIFE is at its best when it's taking itself seriously, but not to a ridiculous extent. The comedic tone is still present here, and it blends well with the drama. Better yet, the characters weren't irritating and it never really felt like the show was dragging on in spite of its undeniably slow pace. I even felt like I could get behind these characters and care about them, their troubles and even their trivialities, had I been given more of this. This last arc is everything ReLIFE should have been throughout its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, ReLIFE's subplot left a fat and ugly scar that wasn't so easily healed, and it ultimately hampered my enjoyment of ReLIFE when it was at its best. It's also regrettable that ReLIFE never truly ends, either. Just when ReLIFE was starting to get into the groove, it was over. On the bright side, that final arc did at least provide some solid setup for a sequel, though that means that this season suffered greatly for it. Had ReLIFE been more focused on what it wanted to achieve throughout its run and stuck more closely to its original premise, it might have ended up as a decent series. Unfortunately, ReLIFE is diluted with too much adolescent melodrama and never quite ends up tackling any issues surrounding NEETs. ReLIFE wastes any potential its initial premise has and resigns itself to being a generic high school drama series with Kaizaki playing the 'lecturer' role, telling these kids how they should go about solving their problems. The final two episodes amount to Kaizaki feeling down in the dumps about the fact that he will one day have to part ways with these kids that he has grown so attached to. It's admittedly executed quite well, but it ends before accomplishing too much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUNIMPRESSIVE PRODUCTION VALUES\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, ReLIFE doesn't even have decent animation. At a moderate distance, characters lose facial distances. Colour is bland to the point where it could even be called dry. The animation is lacking too; In an attempt to disguise this, there is an excessive usage of what amounts to still frames with characters yapping their faces off. Character designs are mostly generic and boring, but An is the sole character to have an interesting design. However, the animation does shine in a few choice moments \u30fc episode 4, in particular, has some interesting, creative and even visually appealing animation that does well to visually evoke a certain character's negative emotions. On the whole, though, the artwork and animation are reminiscent of an uninspired low-budget 2011 anime.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE doesn't fare any better in the sound department, either. Something particularly peculiar was the lack of background noise throughout the entire show; it was a rarity to hear crowds clamouring about, and background students make very little noise. This was something I kept noticing every now and again, and while I want to say it was immersion-breaking, the rampant melodrama already did a fine job breaking my immersion. On the non-diegetic side, ReLIFE doesn't sport much variety in its soundtrack. It's chock-full of piano and not much else. In addition to lacking much-needed variety, the tracks that are present are utilised at awkward times, further cheapening character drama. Hearing the same piece played over and over again whenever the show wants to portray drama is not only grating on the ears, but also degrades any emotional impact a scene could have had if it were silent or paired with a better track. ReLIFE's soundtrack is wholly unimpressive and, at its worst, detrimental to the tone this series is trying so hard to pull off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUDING/TL;DR\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE ultimately ends up as a bad show with a few redeeming points, rather than a good show with a few flaws. It isn't bad to the point that it's unwatchable, but it even falls below the average high school drama because it throws in too many unnecessary elements that are never properly expanded on throughout its run. ReLIFE simply doesn't know what it wants to be, and before it can fumble around too much and possibly find some semblance of an identity, it cuts off without accomplishing anything truly meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is a shallow, semi-funny, melodramatic, endearing, irritating, slow-paced, sentimental, mildly engaging, largely predictable, sometimes boring and sparsely perceptive half-a-show that I don't entirely regret watching. At times, its narrative is a mess. However, at its best, it is funny and endearing in the way it approaches its subject matter. Unfortunately, these good moments are far and few between, and greatly overshadowed by the irritation likely to be incurred by ReLIFE's unhealthy fixation on bad melodrama. If the premise piqued your interest, I reluctantly recommend giving it a go, and if you are charmed by its first episode, I reluctantly recommend sticking with it for as long as you can. If you feel as if you are forcing yourself through an episode, take a break and come back to it with a clear mind. However, if nothing changes by the next episode, drop it like a hot potato; it's only going to get worse. And if the first episode doesn't impress you, I heartily recommend not bothering with the rest.",

            "content": "ReLife review\r\nImagine a food that does not make you an impression, any food that does not interest you and that does not seem like that worth eating, nevertheless trying it though out of pure curiosity. Imagine that food giving you the taste of something that is not necessarily great or special, but something that you never expected, something that is fine for what it is. That was how ReLife worked for me, and it was surprising, because it is one of these series that you must savor and then judge. What I got was nothing short of a really satisfying watch, especially in terms ofenjoyment and connection with the common, flawed, human beings that it manages to present. I expected this season to be sub-par compared to the last one, and this series, that did not interest me to the least, managed to show me some kind of light, which might make me strive to changing my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nReLife revolves around your 27-year-old half-NEET man named Kaizaki Arata, who had quit his job in a company only after 3 months after entering, being fed up with his work environment and how cold-hearted and unaware of their surroundings his co-workers were. Following his resignation, he fell into a slump, not being able to fit into society as one of its active members, only working in part-time jobs, and receiving money from his parents to only slightly cover his life expenses. Having a difficult time, hiding the fact that he did not have a stable work environment from his friends, and receiving a phone call from his family saying that they will not send any money from then on, Arata was lucky enough to encounter a mysterious person named Yoake Ryou in the street in front of his house in a calm yet messed-up, for him, night, the latter declaring that he works for an experiment, ReLife, which gives the subjects a chance to re-live a part of their highschool lives leaving their mentality untouched and just looking like highschool students, change themselves, develop, and not regret the choices they make in the process. Arata, at first, does not know what to do, but after a while decides to undergo the experiment, taking the pill in order for him to look younger, like a highschool pupil does, and starts going to highschool in a daily manner, changing not only himself, but his close people as well.\\n\\n\r\nA draw-back in the story department is that the plot development itself is based on a plot convenience, that being the pill and the experiment in general. I usually am not a fan of plot conveniences, as they are used as detritments to the value of the whole plot. What was successful, however, was the execution of the series. Despite featuring characters that you can see every day, they are handled in a slow-paced, caring way that can drag sometimes, that contains malodrama in heavy situations, but however serves as sheer connection between the audience and the characters. ReLife being a slow, arc-based show for most of its running, it takes advantage of its slow pacing as well as the rather big cast of characters and manages to develop it thoroughly. That might as well turn some people off, as focus on the main character is lowered consequently, but ReLife manages to somehow equal quality and quantity, develop even the most side of characters, something that I never expected from coming from such a series, and make them relatable. \\n\\n\r\nOn another hand, ReLife is a show that is based on drama, but also contains some amount of comedy, mostly coming from the interactions between the characters, it being sparse yet working out quite fine. There is also an amount of chibi faces included, which is by no means good, as it ruins the mood, but most of the times the transitions between drama and the comedy work out fine, if not well enough. As a matter of fact, the characters themselves helped quite much in the plot development, and both the drama and comedy being hits, as despite them being quite common and their reasoning quite cheesy (school setting, teens, you know), they are different from each other, and as a whole cast it works out quite well. Coming into terms with and realizing their goals and, most importantly, their own-self with well-handled execution, the conclusion is obvious. The ending was not conclusive in a literal manner, but was in a sentimental one, because I felt that all things that needed to be dealt with did. As a whole, although the story was being something that never made me go \"wow\", it worked out fine for what it was, and that is what is important.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, as described earlier, ReLife works out well enough for me to consider it something that is way better than just average. What is likable in it are not the personalities of their characters, not nearly as much as how they execute them and develop them. Their interactions involving comedy being funny, but these including drama being a bit dragged and melodramatic, is not something that is of huge importance. What is important in ReLife is how each character is handled and fleshed-out individually, something that other series do not manage to do, putting the minor complaints into shame really. Explanations will be given below, as I am gonna view each character as a different individual and then draw conclusions on them as a whole, successful cast. \\n\\n\r\nKaizaki Arata is a very sociable, caring and understanding person, that is until his confidence is stepped on, after several happenings including his senior in work and his other co-workers, quitting his job and trying a different approach in life, including trying to find a new job through applications and, after failing on that, just working part-time in convenience stores. As an obvious consequence, he realizes that he has not grown up enough, that his social skills were rendered useless and that life is not going to treat him any kinder that he thought it would. After him being given the chance to relive one high school year through the experiments, he develops as a person, comes into terms with himself, does not get further involved into other people's situations, and winds up becoming a person that still has his doubts, but is way more mature than he already was. Kaizaki having such a personality is subject to self-insert, creating a character that is so relatable that you will find yourself caring about him all the way through. Except of that, he also is quite the funny dude, and the comparisons between adult life and highschool life he makes in his mind, such as the fact that the former are mostly ridden by logic and the latter by emotion is nothing short of realistic. \\n\\n\r\nHishiro Chizuru is that kind of girl, who never was particularly close with people, that being due to her transferring schools very frequently in her early years. In the process of growing up till the story takes place, she gradually lost her interest in other people, started not caring about her surroundings, that being partially because of her inability to be close to other people. She always showed doubts about her understanding of things and her hurting people, although she is a great student, and started wanting to change that and obtain social skills and friends, especially after meeting up with Arata. She slowly yet decisively starts showing interest on other people and becomes an all around better person, along with leaving her already good aspects unscathed. After several happenings, it is clear to the viewers and almost all the main characters, excluding one until a certain episode, that she is trying hard to improve. \\n\\n\r\nKariu Rena's personality is not to my liking, because she is that example of the stubborn girl who is jealous of people because she can not reach them despite trying hard. She sometimes reminds me of a cookie cutter character and is definitely one that is not plausible. She admittedly is a good character though, because she shows many kinds of development as well. She does not get rid of her inferiority complex, but somehow tones it down and starts understanding her close friends, them being Chizuru and Honoka, more. She is full of ill-fated desires, and a very jealous person, but after some events, including her fight with Honoka and her discussion with Chizuru, she starts being more relatable. That can also be supported with the fact that they spend quite some time on her character and that they did not want her to be left as just a character that had a complex.\\n\\n\r\nTamarai Honoka is the exact opposite of Rena, a person that screams unreachable when it comes to sports and one that is afraid of getting close to people because she does not want to be denied by them. Both Honoka and Chizuru serve as plot devices to Rena's development, but they themselves are developed, and that is another positive thing for the series. They used a big arc for just these 3 characters, which indicates that airing time was used effectively and decisively, making them fleshed out in a proportional manner. As mentioned earlier, their engagements might feel a bit cheesy and melodramatic, but that is not of much importance, as the journey and the conclusion, as a whole, are satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nYoake Ryou and Onoya An are people who work for the ReLife experiment project, and a whole episode is spent on their flashback, including their relationship with Subject 001, and their interest into Subject 002, that being Arata himself. Worries and implications about their work are depicted in a solid manner. There are other side characters as well, but getting into them is not worth it, because their involvement into the series do not mean many things. Overall, if you take these characters, which are nothing short of common and cliche, and combine them, you create a cast that is good enough for a coming-of-age anime series that ReLife is, that of course supported with respective execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of ReLife remind me of my expectations pre starting watching it. Nothing special and something that does not interest me. The character designs were generic and reminded me of quite many slice of life series that I had watched, including Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, the animation was inconsistent sometimes yet worked out, and the backgrounds were quite good. I really have not much to say about the art and animation sections, just that the chibi faces were as annoying as ever. The soundtrack was repetitive, only consisting of few piano songs, and most of the times did not fit the concept of the story. The opening theme was quite good on the other hand, and had lyrics that reminded me of what the characters were going through. The ending songs were many, not as much memorable as someone would think they would be, but a nice change to the \"one ending per one cour\" archetype. Overall, I think that both the animation and the sound departments could have been better, and that they would grab another point of two had they been a bit more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about ReLife would undeniably be the enjoyment part. I enjoyed the struggles, the development of each and every character, the interactions, the relationships, the starting and ending episodes, and despite some episodes being weaker than others, I considerably enjoyed the middle episodes as well. It being a surprising watch, ReLife managed to drag me into the story, and make me involved in the difference between the adult and the adolescence world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nReLife really was a big surprise for me, and I am gonna remember it for quite a long while. It was cliche, it was generic, but it was fine for what it was. It never tried to be more, and it never tried to be less than what it is. And that is what matters. It is a series that does not take itself overly seriously or overly lightly, and managed to create a plausible enough conclusion. It is a coming-of-age tale for people that just want to relax, enjoy, relate with, and have fun with. Ignoring the shortcomings would be something that would make the series even more likable, and for such an experience like ReLife, it would be worth it.",

            "content": "Tl;dr \u2013 ReLIFE is escapism at its most shallow. It presents a 27 year old, whose life isn't going anywhere fast, an opportunity to repeat his last year of high school & doesn't even think to ask why he might say yes. \r\nIt seems one can turn on the TV on any given day, in any given country, & have a reasonable chance of hearing how bad young people have it in today's economy. Mass unemployment, poor quality jobs for those that have them, no access to housing & the list goes on. Many questions have been asked of why, across the world, young peopleseem to be cut off from the traditional pillars of society in a way previous generations haven't been, & what can be done about it.\\n\\n\r\nArata Kaizaki is the Japanese man of these times. At 27, he finds himself living alone in a bachelor pad funded by his parents, relying on part time work since he quit his salaryman job under (initially) unclear circumstances. After having his allowance cut by his parents, & a night of drinking while pretending to still have a \u201cnormal\u201d job with his old school friends, Arata is approached in the street by Ryou, a blonde Morpheus, who presents Arata with an opportunity: Take the blue pill & spend a year as a 17 year old high school student as part of the ReLIFE Programme.\\n\\n\r\nOnce back at school, however, any potential for ReLife to be an interesting exploration of why Arata would want to resort to reliving the last year of high school, not to mention other themes that could be explored in this scenario, is quickly squandered. For the majority of its thirteen episodes, ReLife is just another forgettable high school ensemble anime. Indeed, as early as the second episode it seems to have forgotten that there might be a reason why Arata would have joined the programme to explore, & instead settles into the usual, predictable routine of misunderstandings, arguments, innocent romance & lots of girls crying.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of episode one, you'll have a pretty good idea of everything that is likely to happen in the following twelve (& probably some ideas that are better). Chizuru, the black haired, socially awkward genius of the class, quickly becomes Arata's \u201cI'm 27! I can't have these feelings for a seventeen year old\u201d slow burning love interest who he is soon teaching how to behave normally. On its own, Arata meeting a socially awkward girl who he helps function in society & in so doing finds out something about himself could have been an interesting core to build a story around; that is if it wasn't introduced almost as soon as Arata shrunk into his teenage body & then just as quickly became second fiddle to the other little dramas going on with the other characters.  I bet you can't guess how they resolve that age gap, either. \\n\\n\r\nOoya & Rena, the other \u201cpair\u201d in the group, fill predictable roles. Rena is an insecure girl who resents that her friends are better than her at things she likes, despite that also being why she's friends with one of them in the first place (don't ask, the writer clearly didn't). Her role is mostly to provide drama & conflict within the group, because bitches be crazy. Ooya, meanwhile is the \u201cI can't believe you're so smart yet so dumb about love!\u201d guy who's blissfully ignorant about anything to do with girls, in particular Rena's feelings for him.\\n\\n\r\nRyou, Onoya & Honoka round out the group, three characters who can be summed up as being there when needed, although they're also often there when not. A subplot involving Onoya & Ryou is introduced for little apparent reason except to fill a couple of episodes, allow for a cock tease moment between Onoya & Arata (you can make your high school anime protagonist an adult, but he'll always be a teenage virgin) & ensure they can form a third pair at the end without being \"weird.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe drama in ReLife, & there is plenty of teenage angst to sit through, mostly seems to come from Rena's intense self-pity causing her to fall out with her friends. Chizuru is smarter than her & that pisses her off. Honoka is better at sports than her & that also pisses her off, although only after resolving her issues with Chizuru. Of course, they just want to be her friend, but simply talking these things through would rob ReLife of half its episodes. Plenty of talking goes on behind closed doors, however, as almost everything seems to be instigated or resolved by a conversation someone wasn't meant to hear. \\n\\n\r\nNow, Rena allowing her resentments & insecurities boil over into lashing out at others could have been a fine story element, if it was given proper time to be established, developed & resolved. But we only have thirteen episodes & a lot of other things to get through so you'll just have to hope it reminds you of a better show that you can use to fill in the gaps. It also seems odd that a series that started out apparently being about why Arata would want to be 17 Again exerts so much time on a 17 already girl having tantrums with her girl chums. \\n\\n\r\nAll this teenage drama also gives Arata, the nominal protagonist of ReLife, something to actually do, given the show has no interest in exploring his motivations for being there. Despite being an adult having done him no favours in his own life, it seems that experience somehow gives him insight into things that his teenage companions lack, Ryou even going so far as to imply in an off hand comment that that's what he's there for. I'm sure we're all guilty of giving life advice to others that we'd never follow through with ourselves, but building an entire elaborate corporate business model around it seems a bit much. I can think of better uses for that miracle pill of Ryou's. \\n\\n\r\nOne could go on at length about the many flaws, contradictions & things that just don't make sense about the ReLife programme. There isn't much point, though, as to give it any real thought is to do more than the writers did. At the end of the day, it exists only to make the synopsis sound distinct enough from all the other high school anime out there to pique the interest of potential viewers. As for commenting on the characters or society it depicts, or exploring themes of youthful alienation or societies inability to accommodate people like Arata, ReLife isn't interested. Why does the ReLife programme exist? Why not. Why would they want to offer NEETs an opportunity to relive the last year of high school? Why not. Why would someone want to do that? Why not. I miss the days when \"a wizard did it\" was enough.\\n\\n\r\nArata, beyond apparently not being interested in why he'd want to be 17 Again, also really doesn't seem like an adult in a teenagers body, despite what his classmates say. In particular, there is a running gag throughout the series that Arata consistently fails tests with abysmally low scores. That's a pretty standard gag in high school anime, but remember Arata has already graduated high school & university to get to this point. Curriculum\u2019s change & all that but, like most of ReLife, it seems indicative of how little thought has been put into exploring the opportunities & complications presented by Arata's unique situation.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the show does elaborate on how Arata came to quit his job, the event that began his downward spiral, although it does so in a typically simplistic way \u2013 the workers & boss at his old job were a shower of bastards who did something terrible* & went on like it was nothing. Good on Arata for taking a stand against the system & tendering his resignation despite knowing the damage it will do to his future prospects, an act that somehow seems to stand as a symbol for future young employees at evil incorporated. \\n\\n\r\n*To discuss it in more detail would be a spoiler, but it's also notable that ReLife, intentionally or not, does that uniquely Japanese thing of apportioning blame to everyone, including Arata, for said terrible thing. Remember kids, if someone you know is being bullied, doing something is as bad as doing nothing. Grow up!*\\n\\n\r\nExcept that he wasn't shut out from society as is at first implied. Sure, quitting his job is a blemish on his CV when applying to other faceless bastard corporations. But even in Japan it's not like soulless office drone is the only option available to him. Indeed on two occasions he has reason to ask for his adult body back so he can see people who helped him get on in his adult life. Good thing Ryou had a blow me pill tucked away in the same orifice he keeps the shrink me ones. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the more we find out about Arata's past suggests not simply that he's an unhappy victim of an unaccommodating society, but someone who lacks the imagination to function as anything but the lifeless salaryman many people his age would give an arm to avoid becoming. It's ironic to think that an author who presumably wrote ReLife to avoid such a life created a character who apparently can't function any other way. Then again, it's not like there is an academy award winning example of a story where a Japanese guy finds himself unable to keep his job in the big city & ends up working in a socially taboo job which he slowly comes to accept & embrace as others learn to shed their prejudices towards him & the work he does to draw inspiration from.\\n\\n\r\nOn the production side of things, there isn't a lot to say about ReLife. The character designs are all pretty standard & unremarkable, with one minor annoyance that they all have mourning armbands on their cardigans for no reason. If you like close up shots of girls crying, smiling & embracing, though, this anime has you covered better than a KyoAni production. Everything else to do with art & animation is functional & not really worthy of comment. The OST, however, is particularly irritating. I assume Masayasu Tsuboguchi is a disciple of Randy Newman, as he mostly sticks to a piano playing along with whatever is happening on screen: \u201cWalking down the street. Looking at my feet. Feeling life is sweet. Just stood in some ****. Dee Ba Doo Ba Dee\u201d\\n\\n\r\nReLife is escapism at its most simplistic & lazy. It presents a scenario ripe for thematic exploration but instead contents itself with going through the motions with minimum thought. It's purpose isn't to ask why a 27 year old would see to go back to high school. Instead it asks you, the viewer, if you're a twenty something whose life has gone nowhere & offers an easy way to avoid dealing with it if you answered yes. If you want to watch a series about a NEET who feels cut off society but learns ultimately that escaping into fantasy is no solution with the help of a strange seventeen year old girl he forms a questionable relationship with, watch Welcome to the NHK. If you're a twenty something NEET who watches lots of cartoons about teenagers being friends & wish you could be in one, ReLife is the shallow, pandering experience you've been looking for.\\n",

            "content": "ReLIFE is a series that borrows elements from other series of the same genre and gives it a twist of its own. The concept proves to be an interesting one, even if the premise makes it seem like it will turn out to be a typical school anime. In some parts, it is what you\u2019ve seen before. But the way the series manages its themes and its characters makes this series much more than it initially started out to be. A story about a man who gets to relive his high-school life can be a great one if done right. But ReLIFE ends up beingjust more than a series about a protagonist who goes through awkward situations in a school. It focuses on how this character changes throughout the series and what he learns from his experience. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise of the series is definitely something that is quite unique. The story revolves around a 27-year-old jobless protagonist named Kaizaki Arata, who one day meets a man who gives him the offer to join a program named ReLIFE. This program will supply Kaizaki with a pill that can make him look 10 years younger and he\u2019ll be put in a high-school as a test subject, to study his improvements and actions. But the series less focuses on the concept on being young again, and more on the concept of learning new things and adapting to a new environment. ReLIFE just isn\u2019t a story about Kaizaki, but also the story about the people around. It\u2019s not just how his school is changing his life, but how he\u2019s changing other people\u2019s lives. And the series focuses on some really important themes, which elevates the quality of the series. The series plays out like a typical slice-of-life school anime, as the series goes through many different situations and story arcs. And the series rearranged the content of the manga to make the series more enjoyable. Many twists and backstories that appear way later in the series, appears in this series, so anime-only watchers can see these reveals. And the ending may not end the overall main story, but it feels like a satisfying conclusion in the series, knowing how much the characters have changed. \\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nReLIFE concept and premise may be interesting and all, but the ReLIFE\u2019s biggest strength is its characters and how they are handled. The series is more character-driven than story-driven, as the series primarily focuses on the development in character relationships. And the way the series presents its characters and their improvements is what makes the series so special. And the series manages to focus on some really important themes, both for teenagers and adults. No, it\u2019s main theme is not just \u201clive your life to the fullest\u201d (as the synopsis may suggest), but it\u2019s also about bullying is the social world, how to be able to cope with situations you want to run away from, how to withstand yourself from making wrong decisions, how sometimes the wrong decision might be the best for everyone, how being superior can get you hate, and so on. The series isn\u2019t a page-by-page adaptation of the manga, as many things were rearranged to suit the structure of the anime. Many content skipped from the first episode appears in the second. The reason for doing is primarily because they wanted to end the first episode off with the first day done. And many important moments that happen later in the manga, gets adapted earlier on in the series. This is because they wanted to adapt the big reveal and the major backstories. The pacing of the series is somewhat fast, but not rushed. It manages to not waste time and always entertain. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, ReLIFE\u2019s biggest strength is its characters. It only takes an episode or two for them to be likable, and each character stands out one way or another. And the fact that every character gets an adequate amount of focus makes sure that the entire cast as whole is strong, instead of one character standing out more than the other. The protagonist of the series, Kaizaki Arata, ends up being likable from the start as he can be relatable to adults and teens, primarily because we see him as both. The way he changes a character throughout the series is fascinating. The ReLIFE program managed to makes Kaizaki learn a lot of things that can help him later in the future. He learns his values and realizes how society works, while helping others around him by sharing his knowledge and experiences as an adult. But Kaizaki\u2019s not the only character that gets a lot of development, but also the rest of the main cast too. Hishiro Chizuru also changes throughout the series, as she learns how to be more socially active and how to understand other people. And she\u2019s later give a major backstory that changes the way the audience sees her. And her relationship with Kaizaki is really well handled. Yoake Ryou, a character that very few people expected to be a character with depth, proved to excel and be an excellent character. His backstory on how much he had to go through to make his first subject successful, shows that his smile is just there to cover up his regrets. And characters like Onoya An, Kariu Rena, and Ooga Kazuomi also prove to be just as good of a character as the rest of the cast. Onoya\u2019s interactions with the rest of the characters is always fun, and Kariu and Ooga\u2019s relationship is really intriguing, especially towards the end of the series.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art is generally good in ReLIFE, especially considering the fact that TMS has a lot to do this season. The detailing isn\u2019t the best, but it works. The backgrounds are fairly good looking as it\u2019s pretty well detailed. The architectures look nice and well detailed and the natural environments look good too. The lighting is a little subpar is sunlight won\u2019t feel like as if it a ray, but rather on flat color with multiple shading would be used instead, which doesn\u2019t work too well. But the shading, particularly on characters, looks fine. The character designs are quite good, even if it\u2019s not anything unique. You\u2019ve probably seen Kaizaki\u2019s face in some other anime before, but it still works well here too. Far away character models can start to lose its details though. The art style is intentionally drawn in a simplistic manner at times for comedic relief and it works well. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nProbably the weakest thing about ReLIFE is its animation quality. The production values are okay at best, and this might be because TMS has to many projects to work on this season. The fluidity in character movements is lacking and it can be comparable to Sakamoto desu ga from last season. There\u2019s a particular moment when Yoake was running, and that didn\u2019t look too good. Character movements look alright, but the frame rate feels too low at times, which makes it lack a proper flow. But it still works though, just not as much as you want it to be. And there are times when the animation quality improves, particularly during comedic, over-the-top reactions, when the art is simplified. \\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nReLIFE may have a large main cast, but it doesn\u2019t have a large supporting cast, so the number of seiyuu needed for this anime is quite low. That being said, there a whole lot of well-known seiyuu behind the voices of some of these characters, and they do a splendid job in adding more depth to the series. Ono Kensho does a great job as Kaizaki, as he does both serious and comedic parts right. His \u201ceeehh!\u201d (which you\u2019ll hear a lot), works well and he does a good job in doing over-the-top reactions. At the same time, he manages to get the serious parts done too, particularly when Kaizaki\u2019s backstory is introduced. Kayano Ai does a great job as Hishiro. It feels weird to listening to her after watching the KonoSuba OVA (since she\u2019s Darkness), but she manages to make Hishiro as emotionless as possible, while adding a sense of curiosity in her voice. She does have experience in these type of roles (like Shiina from Sakurasou). Kimura Ryouhei was the perfect Yoake. He manages to get his optimistic spirit perfectly and it\u2019s hard to see anyone else do his role better than he did. Other seiyuu such as Tomatsu Haruka as Kariu, Uchida Yuuma as Ooga, and Ueda Reina as Onoya, all do a great job in what they have to do. And there are other well-known seiyuu doing supporting roles, such as Namikawa Daisuke, Sugiyama Noriaki and Sawashiro Miyuki, who all do a good job too.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nReLIFE\u2019s music is also quite good too. The number of ED ReLIFE has is astonishing, especially for its length. This is because every episode has its own ED. That being said, though none of the ED ends up being extraordinary, all of them at least manage to be good. There\u2019s not a single ED in the series that felt lacking in any ways. The OP, \u201cButton\u201d, is a very good ED that manages to capture the heart and tone of the actual series. Its vocals are nice and the music is great too. The background music in the series is great though. Though there isn\u2019t much a variety, the ones you will hear will work well with the context. There\u2019s a lot of piano music, that\u2019s for sure. The piano music they mostly play is placed so well almost all the time. The music would play when someone is talking, then stop when things are silent. The music will follow the sounds of the characters speaking, which is really great. A good example of this is near the beginning of the series, when Kaizaki and Yoake meet for the first time.\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nReLIFE might have been much more than I wanted. If it was simply a series about a main character who gets to relive his high-school life and go through awkward situations, I would have been satisfied enough, But the series becomes much more than that by developing its characters other than the protagonist, and the series. And the fact that the series focuses on really important themes was a big surprise too for an anime labeled simply as a school slice-of-life, as it can easily be called a psychological drama at times too. I had so much fun seeing the characters change throughout the series and create relationships with other characters, whether it be friendship or romance. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, ReLIFE is the anime to watch this season. There was a good amount of hype surrounding it before it aired\u2026 or pre-streamed, and the series manages to deliver overall. It\u2019s got a great cast of characters that develop throughout the series so much, and the well-developed relationships are made. The comedy is consistently funny and inventive. And even its serious moments are done with such care. The series focuses on some very important themes throughout the series and some very good life lessons are learned. The production values are weak, but the series makes up for it with almost everything else. And not much is skipped, but rather rearranged, so it would work better in its anime format. Overall, ReLIFE has something for everyone, whether it be lighthearted or serious. \\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic cast of characters that get sufficient focus and development\\n\r\n+ Character relationships are handled well\\n\r\n+ Premise is interesting and evolves into something much more than reliving a school life\\n\r\n+ Important themes are introduced and well-focused on \\n\r\n+ Fast and consistent pacing with the rearrangement of content makes the flow of the series better\\n\r\n- Production values are weak and animations lack fluidity \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

The story is quite enjoyable and I am sure the viewer will be awed by how many times this anime can make one laugh in unexpected ways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think art was like how various other anime in the market have but the incredible thing was how the animators made the use of art to make the funny scenes thousand times more funnier.  :D  Right facial expressions and background were used at the right time which helped adjust and enjoy the story to the fullest. For a slice of life anime I think it was very well done.\\n\r\nI still remember various scenes where the art made the plot so funny that I ended up grinning very much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Though there were no new tracks but the use of right tracks at the right time helped the series achieve its enjoyment quota. The music blends in with the animation and helps in getting the viewer their enjoyment quota.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What I mainly found awesome about this anime is that it has new characters with new emotions that I havent seen for quite some time. I have to say that the characters are quite refreshing and unpredictable and humorous.

            "content": "ReLIFE is one of those animes where you look at the synopsis and decide that it may or may not be your cup of tea. In this regard, it is truly a hidden gem because under the relatively simple premise of a story is great writing and excellent execution.\r\nThe story is a slow burn; I've remarked myself that the pilot episode itself was only average. But as you make your way through the series, everything starts to just make sense why this story is being told, and you come to truly care about these characters which are so phenomenally written.\r\nIt's easy to mess up characterdevelopment but difficult to master getting it just right, and ReLIFE is a prime example of the latter. It's filled with a memorable cast with each character standing out with their own consistently-crafted personalities, fully including their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nFew anime get the endings they deserve but fortunately for us, ReLIFE is one of those.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE has made me feel ways I have not felt from consuming any other type of media. It's genre-defining storytelling at its finest and is easily one of the reasons why I have come to love anime. At the very minimum you will feel a shred of care towards these 2-dimensional characters, so what are you waiting for? Give it a shot and you won't regret it, as cliche as that sounds.",

I don't have a plan to see this anime even one day before release. But after release, i watched all eps just in one day. I surprised that i watched very good anime without anticipate it comes.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nYour life is ruined, job is suck, you afraid that the time that you must life on your own is come but you not ready for it, How if you can back in highschool once again? This is ReLife. The concept isgood, also have some unexcepted plot twist. This show have much life leasson, and inspriring story. But the pacing is slow, not much story progress. Relationship story is quite mainstream.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI can say this have average animation quality, but the expression and comedic scene is very great. Make me laugh more because of that. And also character design is cute i think.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOP song is great, i like very much. Voice acting is wonderful, especially for An Onoya, her voice is really cute XD. But BGM is quite poor. It almost like not have BGM at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThis show have much character developement, Rena character developement i think have more deep than our MC altough she is just Supporting character. Love relationships is predictable and reasonable. But just me or not, im more interested with supoorting couple than main couple relationship. Seriously, they have very funny, and enjoyable relationship, very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best part of this show, i overenjoyed watch this, make me feel back in highschool and also got much inspiring quotes and life leasson. Make me happy, make me laugh, i can see this show as a bright light of my life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThis is not prefect show, but i very recomended this for everyone. Not just for adult but also teenager. Yeah, teenager, You still can life once again (first time) in highschool. You should watch this, dont regret in the end and hoping you can go back once again in highschool life, because it cant!",

            "content": "RELIFE,\r\nI went into this anime with low expectations due to my perceptions of the slice of life genre being slow paced and outright boring (Looking at you Angel Beats!) That is why to my surprise I can conclusively say that I came out of this 13-episode rollercoaster satisfied and emotionally attached to the characters and their journeys.\r\nFirst and foremost, I must say releasing this in a Netflix style binge fiesta was a stroke of marketing genius. It has likely contributed to the surging popularity of the show here on MAL and definitely best watched over a short period of time.\r\nAs with every review, Itry to limit it to 500 words. Short but sweet as per say.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Sound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNothing really stood out here from a soundtrack perspective. The opening was forgetful and the OST maybe marginally added different layers of tension to scenes that required it. Thought it was pretty cool that the ending track changed for each episode; this was definitely a nice touch.\\n\r\nA highlight for me was how each voice actor perfectly fit with the character they were portraying and paved way for the chemistry to develop between these characters.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Art/Animation (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot much to really say here that has not been said by previous reviewees, the animation does not really stand out, nor is it required to as it\u2019s a slice of life genre depiction that is not expected to product ufotable produced fate franchise production values. Everything seems animated to a satisfactory level and the output was consistent throughout. One highlight for me was the choreography of the final episode\u2019s big reveal, it was perfectly directed and will leave you gobsmacked and applauding how well it was brought out on screen.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Characters/Story (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt take\u2019s something special to create story that has characters that are universally loved by the audience. ReLIFE puts its characters at the forefront with the utmost confidence that they will succeed in engaging us through their dialogue and specific individual characteristics. Whether it\u2019s Hishiro, Kaizaki or Kariu, they all have multiple layers of development throughout the 13-episode journey that enable us to care in suspense for where it might lead. At the time of writing this, I still cannot think of a character that I genuinely disliked on this show, I was paying attention throughout, which is an achievement in itself as I have the attention span of a goldfish.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise there has been critique from the MAL community for the pacing of this show, but in all honesty what can be expected for a slice of life genre and in general, it takes time to develop characters and clear a path for a story to be told. More so I was surprised by the cliff-hanger and have no idea where this story will lead to in the future. There are still many questions that need answering in (hopefully) season 2.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Overall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did the job of keeping me on board for the 13-episode journey and has led me to begin reading the manga, which thankfully the anime has for the majority of the time been faithful to the adaption of the source material.\\n\\n\r\nWord Count (471/500)",

            "content": "ReLIFE is a Summer 2016 anime that Crunchyroll gave the Netflix treatment the moment the first episode aired on broadcast TV due to it being released on some foreign app prior to it TV broadcast. It's also not very good. But I suppose if you're going to make available the entirety of an anime from the very start of this miserable season, it should be the one that's incredibly safe and inoffensive, shouldn't it? Because whilst ReLIFE succeeds at nothing, it manages to inoffensively incorporate everything that fans find pleasant about this medium. Are the people who like this show the same ones who saythat Sound Euphonium is unambitious and entirely devoid of meaning? That would be fucking hypocritical of them if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is centered on a twenty-seven year old man named Arata Kaizaki who is working part-time to make ends meet after an incident with his first company caused him to quit after only three months. One night after drinking some sorrows away, he is offered the chance to take part in an experiment by a mysterious man who will guarantee him a job if he goes through with it, so Arata accepts and soon finds himself in high school again with a body that's ten years younger and an inability to pass even the simplest of high school exams because somehow it's supposed to be funny that a grad student can't solve math problems. He soon befriends a bunch of classmates from the mysteriously quiet Chizuru Hishiro to the academically-gifted but incredibly unfit Kazuomi Oga, and the show is basically these characters going through various awkward issues whilst Arata is also there. Yeah, don't expect the dude and his issues to take center stage all that much in this series. I think Vaan from Final Fantasy XII had more plot importance than him.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough ReLIFE starts intriguing with the possibilities of what it'd be like to live high school again, if you took that premise away, it's nothing but a boilerplate high school anime with lame jokes and toothless drama. Arata is barely involved with a lot of his classmates' issues, and when he is, it's usually to give a generic speech that the show tries to tie into his real age, but fails because anyone around the age of sixteen would know the advice he dishes out. And I'm not kidding when I say the jokes are lame. It's nothing but crappy reaction faces that try to make light of situations that shouldn't be taken lightly to begin with, especially when dealing with issues as heavy as suicide. There's even a moment early on in the series when drama occurs because Chizuru looks like the Devil whenever she tries to smile. I don't know who the fuck thought good drama can occur when the catalyst is something that can't be taken seriously, but he is more wrong than a Rwanda massacre denier.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever the show does focus on the actual ReLIFE experiment, it can be a little intriguing. But most of what we know about it is told through the eyes of supervisors like Ryo, and he mostly angsts about the first person he put through the experiment and how he failed with him. Thing is, it's kind of hard to sympathize with Ryo when they don't make clear how he failed besides saying the person never changed throughout their high school life, and it's especially hard when you don't tell me anything about Ryo's personal life, so I'm not sure why I'm supposed to care about his failure. It also doesn't help that when they finally reveal who the first subject actually is, they never do anything with it other than make you go \"I guess that makes sense\". Plus, it doesn't seem like the first subject's failure to pass the experiment is all that bad, although that might be because of all the crappy jokes they make at the person's ineptitude.\\n\\n\r\nBut that and the suicide issue I mentioned earlier are honestly the best drama the show can offer. Because oh my god, the issues the characters have to face in this show are unimaginatively lame. Anyone who's read my reviews of Shirobako and Kiznaiver will know that I don't like drama where the characters learn things that anyone over the age of sixteen would already know. The last two years of teenage life I'll give a pass because some people are late bloomers, but despite the fact that these characters are in their final year of high school, they're learning things that I'd expect a seven-year old to struggle with. I mean jealousy at someone's superior sports and academics despite the fact that you're good at both as well? An inability to make friends because you act like a robot? Is that really the best drama you could come up with for these characters to face? High school crushes that are mutual on both ends? In a world where those Persona games exist, that doesn't fucking fly!\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I watching characters go through struggles if they don't learn anything profound by the end? You don't have to be original. You just have to make them go through conflicts that hit hard and don't hold back when it comes to the important stuff. And you have to make sure that the stuff is actually important, because those are the kind of experiences that people over the age of sixteen deserve to go through. People discovering empathy or learning that the job market is rough is like discovering that \"blue\" is a color or an apple is a fruit. Would you really want to watch someone go through a lot of trouble because he didn't know that \"blue\" belongs in the same category as \"red\"? Even Barney isn't that insulting to its audiences' intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, whilst ReLife isn't without its charms, its lack of teeth mars it too much for it be more than a mediocre show, and when it does gain teeth, it finds a way to break them with a baseball bat made out of unfunny. The characters are all tolerable for the most part, but they're never developed beyond being a simple stereotype. The \"adult turning into a kid\" premise is incredibly underused and lacks tension since it's revealed that Arata can turn into an adult again just by swallowing another pill. And the animation is incredibly plain, although given that TMS is handling four shows this season, perhaps asking for more is a bit much. It even has the gall to just end with a \"life goes on\" ending, and given how over 100 chapters were covered in something that's currently in the 130s, chapter-wise, I don't expect to see a sequel anytime soon. Also, these chapters must be shorter than Atom Ant if this adaptation really covered that much, because I refuse to believe any manga can be this padded. And I've read Kimi no Iru Machi, man.",

The implementation of giving a life event another shot really jumped the story, making you feel emotions for all the different characters and wanting them to have a happy ending. When you finish the season you'll be attached to the characters, wanting another season as soon as possible. Overall, the story had progressed nicely, at agood pace and is very enjoyable for those looking for a laid back series for the summer 2016 anime season.",

            "content": "This anime's somewhat relatable for me. I'm a 23 year old man, who is currently unemployed and also out of education. Though my circumstances/reasons for being in my current situation are entirely different (and valid), I can still relate to the main character a hell of a lot, as well as that desire to just... go back 10 years, make some changes, make more of an impact with what I know now, and have a fresh start.\r\nI really did know nothing going into this. ReLIFE's on the front-page of both MAL and Crunchyroll a lot recently. I saw the genres on MAL as school andslice of life, and so I thought \"WHY THE HELL NOT?!\" (school/sol anime is my weakness), and decided to watch an episode.\\n\\n\r\nLess than 24 hours later, I had finished the show, and was browsing Tumblr for #relatable posts. Damn.  God damn. This shit's good. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise, and the way your introduced into the school environment, is certainly unique, and you've got a diverse mix of characters/personalities. You've got some romance, some drama, some day-to-day life problems, as well as teenagers just being teenagers. The best part though (if you ignore the kind of sci-fi magic pill thing) is that it's pretty realistic! The reasons for the drama, and the build-up to potential romance, the way characters introduce themselves... it all feels pretty natural to me, which I really appreciate in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's also some deeper story-lines and elements that come into play a few episodes in. A couple of serious topics come to light, and are dealt with in (again) a realistic and mature way.  After a few episodes, I just thought ReLIFE was going to be some light, fun fluff, with a generic and positive message, but no. These additional elements made quite an impact, and they were incorporated into everything in a mature manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes flow together really well, and can be appreciated both individually, and as a whole. I really enjoyed the music, too. There's a good mix of stuff played during the end-credits, plus a jazz-ish vibe throughout the show, thanks to a piano, and yeah.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE will leave you wanting more, which in my opinion is a sigh of an A+ anime. Highly recommended!",

The main character is easy for me to relate to what made this show really something for me to look forward to when I first read about it online.\r\nAll episodes are well connected with each other and made me wanting to just watch it in one go as soon as I had the chance watching it. This proves the concept of the story and how well I could follow it. There were no gaps or plot holes for me to recognize. The art was fitting andthe comedy elements were well placed breather moments making the whole show not too dense and after a bit of drama acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nThe big question is why or when should you watch it? Have you ever had moments in life when you thought: \"Damn, what if I didn't do this or what if I would had done that.\" Ever felt regret about something in the past?

            "content": "Watching ReLIFE was quite an experience. Although it wasn't \"special\" it had its moments.\r\nStory 7.0/10\r\nStory, wasn't anything special. The duration of the series follows Kaizaki Arata, a 27-year-old neet or shut in. He gets offered a pill from some odd fellow, Ryou Yoake, because you know, when you meet a stranger on the streets you accept pills from them. Anyway, as you may already know he's able to start his life over, from high-school again. Now it's not one of those, starting over again from a different world, more so, main character Kaizaki is goes back in time, kinda sort of. He's still the sameage mentally, it's only his appearance that has changed. Nothing special is worth mentioning or pointing out in this story. The whole neet trying to redo his life gimmick seems overused and uninteresting at first however, the plot for each episode would have some interesting developments that were actually worth watching. The biggest issue I had was that sometimes intrusive sub-plots began taking over what was really important in the beginning which was the MC getting the opportunity to redo his life. It wasn't all that bad though, although the story-telling isn't consistent, the characters introduced later in the story, Arata's friends, their backstories and situations add for a very amusing, dramatic and emotional experience. From a comedic standpoint, the show is very light on jokes. Often times there were scenes that appeared to be made for laughs however, a majority of it felt forced and just didn't work out. I\\n\\n\r\nPacing in the story is really slow, if you want to have a good experience watching for the interesting narrative, along with other features this series has to offer, then I highly recommend that viewers watch it at their own pace. Furthermore, please make sure that you don't take users, myself included (obviously.) opinions and reviews and let them ruin or change your perspective of how you perceived the show.  Towards the ending of the series, around episode 10 I noticed that there was a good amount of dramatic build up. There was a lot of potential opportunities for an amazing dramatic conclusion, however... NOPE! this potential was thrown out. I thought it would have made for great entertainment if the last few episodes focused more on drama however, this simply was not the case. Instead the last few episodes seemed like they should've been aired around episodes 7 or 9 or at the very least should've been released as an OVA or OAD.  If any improvements to the story could've been made I would have liked to seen it focus less on branching out. Often times the story was all over the place. One episode the plot follows this character, doing this that and the other, next episode focuses on another character doing this that or the other. For me it came off as unbalanced, the story hardly focuses on the \"Why?\" and just keeps going forward. All and all, I wasn't impressed with everything that the story had to offer. Perhaps if there was a season 2 in the works then it would more than likely help me come to terms with the conclusion. Although predictable romances were made clear in the story, I still want to see the final outcome without reading the manga. The story earned a nice 7/10 from me mates.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nArt, animation and other related things were pretty bad. Character designs along with the animation quality for settings looked outdated. I thought I was watching something from 2007 or 2008. This would not have been such a bad thing if only the show wasn't released in 2016... you know, the year we are currently in. In addition to that, the reaction faces and backgrounds used for the characters looked like they belonged in the late 2000's period too. Over the top reaction faces with settings that matched them. Speaking of backgrounds, the settings for a majority of the locations, school, parks, festivals, all looked like hand painted cels from before you and I were born. Traditional cel animation... I hope to see the Blu-Ray release improve the quality of the settings and character designs. If this was rushed then I would totally understand. overall it's just unacceptable. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI hope you like pianos...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty bad. It was like they were on a budget or something. I didn't really care for the opening and ending songs. In addition to that the background songs were not, in any way, special. Now ordinarily, I love pianos, if you've ever read any of my past reviews then you already know I'm a sucker for pianos, being a pianist and keyboardist and all.I'll be honest though, there is hardly any songs playing at all for the majority of the time. I kid you not, there are like 3 or 5 songs played in the background, all of them don't seem to match with whatever situations going on in the series. Often times it was as if the background music was added to prevent a scene for feeling bland or boring. It was too late for that though.... The voice actors were alright, I suppose. There isn't too much to say about them other than they did a pretty good job delivering their character's lines. What caught my attention in the sound department was how quiet the series is.  Background characters don't say anything. No talking from background characters at the fireworks festival, school, it felt a little too strange to me.  I mean, it's ordinary in lots of shows, however because the show was going for more of an authentic type setting, focusing on realistic settings, I think that background noise is necessary, especially since the show is very quiet in terms of sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters felt so one-sided. Each had one distinct trait about themselves that made the individual stand out, barely. Developing romantic relationships between the males and females were predictable and very, very, cliche. I mean, to the point where it wasn't cute, or sweet,  nor emotional. You can easily tell whose going to end up with who based upon their actions with one another. The character development in the show is somewhat minuscule. Chizuru is like the only character in the show that has any major character development and growth. I found this to be somewhat disappointing because I thought that if anything Arata would have been shown to have the most beneficial developments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nEntertaining isn't a word I would use for the \"enjoyment\" part of ReLIFE. If anything, any sense of enjoyment was rather weak due the inconsistent and often times \"strange\" way story telling... or presentation. Not to mention that somewhat inconclusive ending.  While watching ReLIFE it felt more like I was just in it for the ride. Nothing for me to think about other than how predictable the events will turn out and what characters will form a romantic relationship. Overall I wasn't too impressed with everything that ReLIFE had to offer in the Story, sound, art, and characters department. It felt rushed in those departments. Perhaps the producers were worried about time constraints and not finishing things in time, either way the final product just didn't live up to my expectations. The series just barley earned the 6/10 I gave it.",

            "content": "!FIRST REVIEW!\r\nTo start off, ReLife is an anime that you can learn from. There was always some sort of tactic to get you interested, whether it was character development, conflict, or the entertainment. All-in-all, it was a very good anime.\r\nThe characters were so loveable and memorable, I even remember their names, plus got emotionally attached to each one of them. Their experiences really pull at your heart strings and make you love them even more. Even the tsundere character was loveable in this one.\r\nThere is conflict around every corner, but you understand where the problem is coming from and want to know how it getssolved. Most conflicts such as the ones in the story are not portrayed as commonly in other animes airing as of late. With this, I am going to have to say that it takes you back and gives you the feeling of nostalgia, especially with the music- mostly piano and jazz-, art - simple with cell-shading and cute editing used from older animes-, and of course the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nWith this anime, I kept on laughing or on the edge of my seat. Every episode either had me in tears of joy or sadness. This anime is a slife of life done RIGHT. The simple highschooler, middle schooler, or even those with full-time jobs will love this anime, relating to the characters often. The anime is very light, however touch on inner conflicts that many people face, including jealousy between friends and the \"real world\".\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this was a fairly well-made anime. The creators were not afraid to take risks and produced a wonderful anime- and based off a japanese webtoon from comico at that! There were some minor issues, such as the sudden change in music. The modern animes made today have orchestral music or even the computer-made songs in the original soundtrack, but this anime continuously plays rather simple piano pieces to help portray mood. Another this was when in one episode, SOMEONE TYPES ON THE KEYBOARD WHERE THE WORDS ARE AND ON THE NUMBER PAD (usually on the right of the keyboard). (And yes I just had to notice that.)\\n\\n\r\nI REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that I was not expecting much when I jumped in to this - A slice of life anime based on a webtoon AND a completed tag when it first airs did not sound promising- HOWEVER, it exceeded my expectations and I ended up finishing the anime in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nPLEASE, GIVE IT A CHANCE.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I want to note that when I first wrote the majority of this review as first impressions, I still had 3 more episodes to watch. The original review didn't include my thoughts on the ending. This review you're about to read is my final opinion on ReLIFE and it was spell checked. I'm only going to add my thoughts about the ending at the end and I decided not to edit the rest. Enjoy.\r\nShould you watch? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: No. This may sound confusing to some but it's how I feel about this series. I feel like if I getinto too many details describing the show then I'll sound like I'm telling you not to watch. Even though I'm not an expert at doing reviews, I'll try my best to express my thoughts while they're fresh.\\n\\n\r\nSo as many of you already know, this story follows a 27-year-old jobless man that gets the offer to go back to high school. With a pill, he turns from a grown adult to a 17-year-old. One of the problems is that he still has the mentality of a 27-year-old and he can't tell anyone about the pill and his real age. He gets assigned to a high school nearby and ends up falling for a very shy and awkward girl named Hishiro and making many friends. The second problem is that this girl he has fallen for and his friends are 17-year-olds and the difference of age causes a problem on how he needs to act and how far can he go around them. What comes next is a 'not very original' romance/friendship story between our cast.\\n\\n\r\nI came to this series with ridiculously low expectations (like really low). To my surprise, in the first episodes (episodes 1-6 to be specific) I was having a blast. I was laughing my ass off and I really enjoyed the character's interactions with each other. I thought that this series could be something unique and it could hold on its own against the other spectacular series that approach us this summer season. Then...I got to the 7th episode. It all fell downhill from here on.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with episodes 7-10 is that they felt like nothing was progressing. Sure we got some character development for side characters, but to me it just felt like I was watching OVAs or specials. It wasn't until Episode 11 that somewhat picked the story up a little and I felt like shit was progressing. I was really enjoying the first episodes but suddenly I wasn't laughing as much and I wasn't having the same enjoyment as before.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the second half fell flat, it wasn't horrible nor unwatchable. I think that since I was having so much fun with episodes 1-6 that when it dialed down a bit, it felt a bit underwhelming. It was good seeing that development and it was a decent watch all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing extraordinary, but it's interesting. The characters are a bit clich\u00e9, but still lovable. The romance is nothing to fangirl about, but it's cute. It's not the best thing I've watched, but I did have fun. I think I underestimated this anime and even though it had a couple of flaws, it was very enjoyable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nTHOUGHTS ON THE FINAL 3 EPISODES: So if you've read this far, you'd know how disappointed I was about the second half. Now that I have finished the show, I think these 3 episodes made up for the mess it got itself into. After 4 episodes of feeling like I was watching non-canon filler, the story really picked itself up, it felt funny again and we got a pretty good ending. Without spoiling anything, all the romantic doubts I had about who was going to end together were resolved (at least in my opinion). The only thing I'm a bit disappointed about is that I feel like I'll need to pick up the manga to get a 100% satisfying ending. Don't get me wrong, it was somewhat satisfying, but my romance craving heart needs a full confirmation on things. Needless to say, I really enjoyed this anime and will be thinking about it for a while.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 7.5\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (I originally gave it a 7.5 but after watching the last 3 episodes, it's a solid 8.)\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, I say to go give it a shot. It's only 13 episodes and I think it's worth at least one viewing. I really hope you found this review helpful.",

            "content": "The prospect of being able to live part of your life over again and do things differently isn\u2019t a new setup in any media, let alone anime. One of the more memorable attempts at tackling this premise was a 1986 novel called \u201cReplay\u201d, but it was hardly the first. 18 Again! (1988) and particularly 17 Again (2009) and Seventeen Again (2000) are another similar bunch of films tackling the same scenario. ReLIFE is late to the party, and it makes very little attempt at subverting this familiar premise. But that\u2019s okay; originality isn\u2019t everything. Having an unoriginal narrative that\u2019s well-executed is far more valuable thanhaving an original and shoddily-executed narrative. All things considered, ReLIFE seemed to be primed for the former category, but ultimately, it wasn\u2019t to be. There simply isn\u2019t one quality I can recall that this show excels in. Not in pacing, not in characterisation, not in drama, not in art, not in animation, not in sound, not in comedy and not in tone. And for the record, having a poorly-executed and unoriginal narrative is the least valuable of the bunch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPREMISE\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE's premise is likely familiar to anyone who has read their fair share of web novels; it's the \"starting life again in another world from zero\" premise that has been steadily wedging its way into recent anime adaptations. That said, ReLIFE feels far more reminiscent of Welcome to the NHK!, wherein the series delves into and ultimately seeks to 'solve' hikikomori issues and thought processes with stunning authenticity. However, this similarity only really extends as far as ReLIFE's initial premise. For better or for worse, ReLIFE only ever touches on NEET lifestyles once or twice throughout its 13-episode run, opting instead for an irritating amount of tiresome adolescent melodrama. Now, melodrama in itself isn't an inherently bad thing; if utilised competently, it can explore a particular theme in far greater depth and provoke far greater emotional impact than if it were to attempt to emulate the nuances and confines of reality. Melodrama is an incredibly helpful tool for dealing with hefty themes even if it ultimately cheapens a character's conflict when viewed from a critical outlook. It is unfortunate, then, that ReLIFE's themes are the weakest and most ill-defined element of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBAD DRAMA\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE began quite promisingly by setting up several intriguing plot and character threads to later be drawn on and building chemistry between characters with genuinely funny \u30fc if largely hollow and repetitive \u30fc humour. It gradually introduced several interesting and entertaining characters, though they never really stray far enough from their established stereotypes. ReLIFE set up its initial premise exceptionally well, held up mostly on the merit of its characters. However, the ultimate tragedy strikes when the show puts on too much weight for the characters to carry. ReLIFE starts to buckle when it first gives its audience a taste of drama though somehow manages to stay afloat just on the merit of its characters, but it falls flat on its face when it ends up shoving too much bad drama into the show.\\n\\n\r\nBad drama is drama that viewers can't relate to, care about and/or drags on for far too long. ReLIFE's particular brand of drama sidelines the leads in favour of having everything revolve around not-quite-main-characters that are given too much screen time. It doesn't help that ReLIFE drags out this melodramatic subplot for an entire quarter of its run time, slowly chipping away at my patience and quickly pushing the focus characters from 'sympathetic' territory into 'irritating-and-just-get-on-with-it' territory. As time wore on, I grew to actively dislike, if not outright hate, most of the characters in ReLIFE as more and more melodrama was piled on in a weak attempt at keeping me on the edge of my seat. Admittedly, I was on the edge of my seat \u30fc I came very close to walking straight out of the room and never looking back several times throughout these four agonisingly slow-paced episodes.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE spends too much time on what amounts to meaningless drama that has no lasting or significant impact on the characters involved after it is resolved. The problems in question are the kind I was confronted with at the age of 14. In spite of the questionable weight of these issues, I was expecting to find Kariu's drama interesting and relatable, but I instead found it drawn out and shallow. ReLIFE wastes four episodes on angsty melodrama that has absolutely nothing to do with the protagonists, and it doesn't even have the decency to tackle it in any real depth. Worse than being shallow, it quickly becomes boring/grating and lacks any weight because it's incredibly obvious how Kariu's problems are going to be neatly tied up in the end. The problems she faces throughout the series are quite typical of high school drama shows; I've seen it done plenty of times before, and I've seen it done a whole lot better. Do you want good high school melodrama? Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou excels at it. Do you want shallow and inoffensive high school melodrama? Take ReLIFE or Yume Kara, Samenai. And in ReLIFE's case, the supporting characters it shoved into this subplot (see sportsgirl #87408) don't have nearly enough depth or personality for me to latch onto, or they are boring renditions of existing archetypes I've seen a million times over. ReLIFE has boring drama and boring characters, and that doesn't make for a good combo.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is at odds with itself \u30fc while its premise is designed for exploring its characters in a dramatic and meaningful way, most of its characters are seemingly designed primarily for light-hearted comedy and light character drama. It certainly doesn't help that all of the drama it does tackle is predictable and boring, and when the show empties itself completely of comedy, it becomes a slog. ReLIFE suddenly decides that it wants to revolve around teen melodrama that bears little resemblance to its original themes for a quarter of its length. Not only does ReLIFE almost entirely lose its focus half-way through, but the narrative also becomes dry, boring and predictable. After a certain amount of tiresome melodrama, it becomes impossible to see these characters in a sympathetic light anymore. The more this subplot was dragged out, the more irritating the characters became. In the end, it amounts to nothing more than bad filler in a show that had no room for filler. Aside from the sparse developments for the protagonist and one other character, everything else is ultimately rendered moot after the subplot reaches its conclusion -- Kariu doesn't change as a result of this conflict; not really. It feels as if only the surface problems were painted over and bandaged together while the deeper problems continue to seethe underneath. Kariu gets shallow treatment throughout the volleyball arc, but this isn't automatically a bad thing. If these deeper issues were brought up later on in the series, it might serve as appropriate setup. Unfortunately, ReLIFE ends before any of that can happen, so it remains pointless at the moment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFOCUSING ON THE WRONG CHARACTERS\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat most bothers me about ReLIFE is all of the wasted potential \u30fc not only in that it doesn't explore any NEET-related problems or the fact that it wasted four episodes piling more melodrama on top of even more melodrama for characters that were never developed enough for me to care about in the first place, but also how ReLIFE doesn't follow any of its more interesting threads. Yoake is an interesting and, as it turns out, flawed character that isn't perfect at his job. ReLIFE spends an episode focusing on him and his past (another one of its subplots), but in spite of this focus, Yoake still remains largely mysterious to both Kaizaki and viewers; we don't really know what makes him tick. I wouldn't have minded if Yoake got four episodes to himself and his character was actually explored in a decent amount of depth; he has the potential to become an interesting AND multi-faceted character. Unfortunately, not only does ReLIFE spend this time on a much more irritating and less interesting character, it also reduces Yoake to gags most of the time, which means we rarely ever get to see the real him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it isn't only Yoake, either \u30fc An, another character who should be prominent in ReLIFE doesn't get nearly as much screen time as she deserves. In fact, she gets even less time than Yoake. Much like Yoake, she is mysterious and a lot of her qualities feel vague and ill-defined; her personality, her interests, her perspective and also how she feels about the romantic tension she oftentimes finds herself entrapped in. Fortunately, An has a lot more surface personality than Yoake and has a bigger role than gags most of the time, but because she has even less focus than Yoake, it all balances out in the end. We never get a sense of what makes either Yoake or An tick, and most of the focus that could have been directed at clearing up this vagueness is instead used for perpetuating its tiresome melodrama for far too long.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that another good character, Chizuru, gets enough screen time for us to actually understand and care about her, but I often found myself thinking: \"can we get back to something more interesting \u30fc you know, like Chizuru?\" She gets a decent amount of focus, which is something ReLIFE actually does quite well, but I feel that if the series focused more on her and less on generic insecure sportsgirl #59830 and Kariu's melodrama, it would have been a whole lot less irritating and even entertaining if done well. She disappears for episodes at a time, aside from getting maybe a line or two that don't help to progress the plot in the slightest. Chizuru was a big part of what made the comedy and light-hearted feel of ReLIFE work so well, but she essentially vanished in episodes 7-9; ReLIFE dumbly sidelined one of its best qualities to bring into focus one of its worst subplots.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I almost forgot about Kaizaki \u30fc you know, the protagonist? Hey, cut me some slack here, the show seems to forget about him a lot of the time, too! The show rarely decides to focus on the protagonist and his problems, but when it does, it's actually interesting. Kaizaki has so much screen time, yet we see so little of his character. Almost every time he engages with other characters \u30fc and particularly the high school ones \u30fc it's usually quite shallow because Kaizaki needs to stand as a symbol and self-insert for the older audience. None of the more interesting parts of his personality are shown; it's mostly just a way for Kaizaki to crack a joke or reference that the older audience can appreciate. If he showcases too much of his personality, that gets in the way of his status as an easy-to-slip-into pair of trousers. This means that he ends up stuck in a rather odd position as the protagonist \u30fc he's boring, bland and ultimately just feels like an observer. Oh, but he's also an amalgamation of all the 'I'm getting near that age' tropes. Yeahhh, ReLIFE isn't great with handling its characters, but the worst of it is when the show starts dealing with Kaizaki's backstory.\\n\\n\r\nBased off his introduction, one might make the mistake of thinking that Kaizaki is an interesting and flawed character, but this notion is mostly put to rest when Kaizaki's backstory is unveiled. Kaizaki is portrayed as a 'good' person \u30fc the show even uses the term 'hero' to describe him \u30fc with nary a flaw in his personality. It's society that is painted as evil, villainous, wrong, morally reprehensible and just all around dickish while ReLIFE makes every effort to portray Kaizaki as a decent person with no significant flaws. This is ReLIFE's crowning moment of wasted potential. Kaizaki's backstory turns out to be quite interesting, actually, but Kaizaki is still as boring as ever. This has to do with the fact that most of his dark backstory doesn't actually have a lot to do with Kaizaki himself; in it, he mostly plays the supporting role to someone else's main character. The problem with Kaizaki's backstory is that it isn't his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, Kaizaki has rather shallow characterisation despite being the protagonist; about his only real character flaw is, as briefly summarised by another character in the show, \"a lack of confidence.\" He has difficulty coming to grips with his past, but there's not a lot else that viewers can find to latch onto Kaizaki as a character. Most of the time, he's simply used as a symbol for the 'approaching middle ages' demographic and plays the role of the counsellor in this high school drama. Unfortunately, Kaizaki turns out to be a phenomenally boring character that never strays far enough from his established archetype to grasp a firm sense of identity. But it almost seems as if he was never meant to develop like that; to Kaizaki, ReLIFE is 'feel good therapy.' By involving himself in and solving these kids problems (i.e. playing the counsellor role), he is expected to gain back some of the confidence that he has lost, because he is so afraid/self-conscious of how his actions will impact on his environment. Unfortunately, that still doesn't make Kaizaki an interesting \u30fc let alone three-dimensional \u30fc character; instead, it just makes him perfectly suited to overseeing most of the melodrama in this series. At best, it only serves as a justification as to why he sticks so close to his established archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is some potential to take Kaizaki's character in an interesting direction and give him some depth in the future, but ReLIFE ends before any of this can happen. ReLIFE sets up a great many plot and character elements throughout its run but never draws on the more interesting ones, save for an exception or two with its final two episodes. However, there is some good news: while ReLIFE falls flat as a standalone season, if a sequel airs and actually goes about drawing on the massive amount of setup that ReLIFE has been building up with these 13 episodes, ReLIFE has the potential to become a far more engaging series along with gaining more depth. With enough caution, a second season of ReLIFE could even be enjoyable if it focused a lot more on endearing characters like Chizuru, rather than irritating characters like Kariu. However, this potential certainly doesn't change how poorly-paced, terribly executed and just flat out boring the majority of this season was; it only softens the blow.\\n\\n\r\nBut ReLIFE isn't all bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE spends its final three episodes attempting to make up for its terrible drama by reverting back to the way it was initially, though it still makes a few feeble attempts at meaningful drama. And, surprisingly enough, ReLIFE does actually manage to redeem itself somewhat by its final episode, but it ends up failing on an entirely different level: by the end of its thirteen-episode run, ReLIFE hardly accomplishes anything. ReLIFE is a lot of setup without a lot of execution. Worst of all, ReLIFE doesn't even have a proper conclusion \u30fc it merely cuts off, prompting viewers to pick up the manga if they want more. ReLIFE doesn't end up being much more than a bad advertisement for its parent manga series. When a show still doesn't have a firm sense of identity by the end of its run, why would viewers want to delve further into the series? ReLIFE fails not only as a TV series, but also as an extended advertisement.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it must be said that the show does have a solid final two episodes that gradually repaired my shattered image of the characters. ReLIFE does follow a predictable flow with its romantic subplot, but it wasn't done poorly. That said, there is one thing that this last arc does quite well: (mostly) believable, well-paced and light drama. ReLIFE is at its best when it's taking itself seriously, but not to a ridiculous extent. The comedic tone is still present here, and it blends well with the drama. Better yet, the characters weren't irritating and it never really felt like the show was dragging on in spite of its undeniably slow pace. I even felt like I could get behind these characters and care about them, their troubles and even their trivialities, had I been given more of this. This last arc is everything ReLIFE should have been throughout its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, ReLIFE's subplot left a fat and ugly scar that wasn't so easily healed, and it ultimately hampered my enjoyment of ReLIFE when it was at its best. It's also regrettable that ReLIFE never truly ends, either. Just when ReLIFE was starting to get into the groove, it was over. On the bright side, that final arc did at least provide some solid setup for a sequel, though that means that this season suffered greatly for it. Had ReLIFE been more focused on what it wanted to achieve throughout its run and stuck more closely to its original premise, it might have ended up as a decent series. Unfortunately, ReLIFE is diluted with too much adolescent melodrama and never quite ends up tackling any issues surrounding NEETs. ReLIFE wastes any potential its initial premise has and resigns itself to being a generic high school drama series with Kaizaki playing the 'lecturer' role, telling these kids how they should go about solving their problems. The final two episodes amount to Kaizaki feeling down in the dumps about the fact that he will one day have to part ways with these kids that he has grown so attached to. It's admittedly executed quite well, but it ends before accomplishing too much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUNIMPRESSIVE PRODUCTION VALUES\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, ReLIFE doesn't even have decent animation. At a moderate distance, characters lose facial distances. Colour is bland to the point where it could even be called dry. The animation is lacking too; In an attempt to disguise this, there is an excessive usage of what amounts to still frames with characters yapping their faces off. Character designs are mostly generic and boring, but An is the sole character to have an interesting design. However, the animation does shine in a few choice moments \u30fc episode 4, in particular, has some interesting, creative and even visually appealing animation that does well to visually evoke a certain character's negative emotions. On the whole, though, the artwork and animation are reminiscent of an uninspired low-budget 2011 anime.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE doesn't fare any better in the sound department, either. Something particularly peculiar was the lack of background noise throughout the entire show; it was a rarity to hear crowds clamouring about, and background students make very little noise. This was something I kept noticing every now and again, and while I want to say it was immersion-breaking, the rampant melodrama already did a fine job breaking my immersion. On the non-diegetic side, ReLIFE doesn't sport much variety in its soundtrack. It's chock-full of piano and not much else. In addition to lacking much-needed variety, the tracks that are present are utilised at awkward times, further cheapening character drama. Hearing the same piece played over and over again whenever the show wants to portray drama is not only grating on the ears, but also degrades any emotional impact a scene could have had if it were silent or paired with a better track. ReLIFE's soundtrack is wholly unimpressive and, at its worst, detrimental to the tone this series is trying so hard to pull off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUDING/TL;DR\\n\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE ultimately ends up as a bad show with a few redeeming points, rather than a good show with a few flaws. It isn't bad to the point that it's unwatchable, but it even falls below the average high school drama because it throws in too many unnecessary elements that are never properly expanded on throughout its run. ReLIFE simply doesn't know what it wants to be, and before it can fumble around too much and possibly find some semblance of an identity, it cuts off without accomplishing anything truly meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is a shallow, semi-funny, melodramatic, endearing, irritating, slow-paced, sentimental, mildly engaging, largely predictable, sometimes boring and sparsely perceptive half-a-show that I don't entirely regret watching. At times, its narrative is a mess. However, at its best, it is funny and endearing in the way it approaches its subject matter. Unfortunately, these good moments are far and few between, and greatly overshadowed by the irritation likely to be incurred by ReLIFE's unhealthy fixation on bad melodrama. If the premise piqued your interest, I reluctantly recommend giving it a go, and if you are charmed by its first episode, I reluctantly recommend sticking with it for as long as you can. If you feel as if you are forcing yourself through an episode, take a break and come back to it with a clear mind. However, if nothing changes by the next episode, drop it like a hot potato; it's only going to get worse. And if the first episode doesn't impress you, I heartily recommend not bothering with the rest.",

            "content": "ReLife review\r\nImagine a food that does not make you an impression, any food that does not interest you and that does not seem like that worth eating, nevertheless trying it though out of pure curiosity. Imagine that food giving you the taste of something that is not necessarily great or special, but something that you never expected, something that is fine for what it is. That was how ReLife worked for me, and it was surprising, because it is one of these series that you must savor and then judge. What I got was nothing short of a really satisfying watch, especially in terms ofenjoyment and connection with the common, flawed, human beings that it manages to present. I expected this season to be sub-par compared to the last one, and this series, that did not interest me to the least, managed to show me some kind of light, which might make me strive to changing my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nReLife revolves around your 27-year-old half-NEET man named Kaizaki Arata, who had quit his job in a company only after 3 months after entering, being fed up with his work environment and how cold-hearted and unaware of their surroundings his co-workers were. Following his resignation, he fell into a slump, not being able to fit into society as one of its active members, only working in part-time jobs, and receiving money from his parents to only slightly cover his life expenses. Having a difficult time, hiding the fact that he did not have a stable work environment from his friends, and receiving a phone call from his family saying that they will not send any money from then on, Arata was lucky enough to encounter a mysterious person named Yoake Ryou in the street in front of his house in a calm yet messed-up, for him, night, the latter declaring that he works for an experiment, ReLife, which gives the subjects a chance to re-live a part of their highschool lives leaving their mentality untouched and just looking like highschool students, change themselves, develop, and not regret the choices they make in the process. Arata, at first, does not know what to do, but after a while decides to undergo the experiment, taking the pill in order for him to look younger, like a highschool pupil does, and starts going to highschool in a daily manner, changing not only himself, but his close people as well.\\n\\n\r\nA draw-back in the story department is that the plot development itself is based on a plot convenience, that being the pill and the experiment in general. I usually am not a fan of plot conveniences, as they are used as detritments to the value of the whole plot. What was successful, however, was the execution of the series. Despite featuring characters that you can see every day, they are handled in a slow-paced, caring way that can drag sometimes, that contains malodrama in heavy situations, but however serves as sheer connection between the audience and the characters. ReLife being a slow, arc-based show for most of its running, it takes advantage of its slow pacing as well as the rather big cast of characters and manages to develop it thoroughly. That might as well turn some people off, as focus on the main character is lowered consequently, but ReLife manages to somehow equal quality and quantity, develop even the most side of characters, something that I never expected from coming from such a series, and make them relatable. \\n\\n\r\nOn another hand, ReLife is a show that is based on drama, but also contains some amount of comedy, mostly coming from the interactions between the characters, it being sparse yet working out quite fine. There is also an amount of chibi faces included, which is by no means good, as it ruins the mood, but most of the times the transitions between drama and the comedy work out fine, if not well enough. As a matter of fact, the characters themselves helped quite much in the plot development, and both the drama and comedy being hits, as despite them being quite common and their reasoning quite cheesy (school setting, teens, you know), they are different from each other, and as a whole cast it works out quite well. Coming into terms with and realizing their goals and, most importantly, their own-self with well-handled execution, the conclusion is obvious. The ending was not conclusive in a literal manner, but was in a sentimental one, because I felt that all things that needed to be dealt with did. As a whole, although the story was being something that never made me go \"wow\", it worked out fine for what it was, and that is what is important.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, as described earlier, ReLife works out well enough for me to consider it something that is way better than just average. What is likable in it are not the personalities of their characters, not nearly as much as how they execute them and develop them. Their interactions involving comedy being funny, but these including drama being a bit dragged and melodramatic, is not something that is of huge importance. What is important in ReLife is how each character is handled and fleshed-out individually, something that other series do not manage to do, putting the minor complaints into shame really. Explanations will be given below, as I am gonna view each character as a different individual and then draw conclusions on them as a whole, successful cast. \\n\\n\r\nKaizaki Arata is a very sociable, caring and understanding person, that is until his confidence is stepped on, after several happenings including his senior in work and his other co-workers, quitting his job and trying a different approach in life, including trying to find a new job through applications and, after failing on that, just working part-time in convenience stores. As an obvious consequence, he realizes that he has not grown up enough, that his social skills were rendered useless and that life is not going to treat him any kinder that he thought it would. After him being given the chance to relive one high school year through the experiments, he develops as a person, comes into terms with himself, does not get further involved into other people's situations, and winds up becoming a person that still has his doubts, but is way more mature than he already was. Kaizaki having such a personality is subject to self-insert, creating a character that is so relatable that you will find yourself caring about him all the way through. Except of that, he also is quite the funny dude, and the comparisons between adult life and highschool life he makes in his mind, such as the fact that the former are mostly ridden by logic and the latter by emotion is nothing short of realistic. \\n\\n\r\nHishiro Chizuru is that kind of girl, who never was particularly close with people, that being due to her transferring schools very frequently in her early years. In the process of growing up till the story takes place, she gradually lost her interest in other people, started not caring about her surroundings, that being partially because of her inability to be close to other people. She always showed doubts about her understanding of things and her hurting people, although she is a great student, and started wanting to change that and obtain social skills and friends, especially after meeting up with Arata. She slowly yet decisively starts showing interest on other people and becomes an all around better person, along with leaving her already good aspects unscathed. After several happenings, it is clear to the viewers and almost all the main characters, excluding one until a certain episode, that she is trying hard to improve. \\n\\n\r\nKariu Rena's personality is not to my liking, because she is that example of the stubborn girl who is jealous of people because she can not reach them despite trying hard. She sometimes reminds me of a cookie cutter character and is definitely one that is not plausible. She admittedly is a good character though, because she shows many kinds of development as well. She does not get rid of her inferiority complex, but somehow tones it down and starts understanding her close friends, them being Chizuru and Honoka, more. She is full of ill-fated desires, and a very jealous person, but after some events, including her fight with Honoka and her discussion with Chizuru, she starts being more relatable. That can also be supported with the fact that they spend quite some time on her character and that they did not want her to be left as just a character that had a complex.\\n\\n\r\nTamarai Honoka is the exact opposite of Rena, a person that screams unreachable when it comes to sports and one that is afraid of getting close to people because she does not want to be denied by them. Both Honoka and Chizuru serve as plot devices to Rena's development, but they themselves are developed, and that is another positive thing for the series. They used a big arc for just these 3 characters, which indicates that airing time was used effectively and decisively, making them fleshed out in a proportional manner. As mentioned earlier, their engagements might feel a bit cheesy and melodramatic, but that is not of much importance, as the journey and the conclusion, as a whole, are satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nYoake Ryou and Onoya An are people who work for the ReLife experiment project, and a whole episode is spent on their flashback, including their relationship with Subject 001, and their interest into Subject 002, that being Arata himself. Worries and implications about their work are depicted in a solid manner. There are other side characters as well, but getting into them is not worth it, because their involvement into the series do not mean many things. Overall, if you take these characters, which are nothing short of common and cliche, and combine them, you create a cast that is good enough for a coming-of-age anime series that ReLife is, that of course supported with respective execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of ReLife remind me of my expectations pre starting watching it. Nothing special and something that does not interest me. The character designs were generic and reminded me of quite many slice of life series that I had watched, including Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, the animation was inconsistent sometimes yet worked out, and the backgrounds were quite good. I really have not much to say about the art and animation sections, just that the chibi faces were as annoying as ever. The soundtrack was repetitive, only consisting of few piano songs, and most of the times did not fit the concept of the story. The opening theme was quite good on the other hand, and had lyrics that reminded me of what the characters were going through. The ending songs were many, not as much memorable as someone would think they would be, but a nice change to the \"one ending per one cour\" archetype. Overall, I think that both the animation and the sound departments could have been better, and that they would grab another point of two had they been a bit more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about ReLife would undeniably be the enjoyment part. I enjoyed the struggles, the development of each and every character, the interactions, the relationships, the starting and ending episodes, and despite some episodes being weaker than others, I considerably enjoyed the middle episodes as well. It being a surprising watch, ReLife managed to drag me into the story, and make me involved in the difference between the adult and the adolescence world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nReLife really was a big surprise for me, and I am gonna remember it for quite a long while. It was cliche, it was generic, but it was fine for what it was. It never tried to be more, and it never tried to be less than what it is. And that is what matters. It is a series that does not take itself overly seriously or overly lightly, and managed to create a plausible enough conclusion. It is a coming-of-age tale for people that just want to relax, enjoy, relate with, and have fun with. Ignoring the shortcomings would be something that would make the series even more likable, and for such an experience like ReLife, it would be worth it.",

            "content": "Tl;dr \u2013 ReLIFE is escapism at its most shallow. It presents a 27 year old, whose life isn't going anywhere fast, an opportunity to repeat his last year of high school & doesn't even think to ask why he might say yes. \r\nIt seems one can turn on the TV on any given day, in any given country, & have a reasonable chance of hearing how bad young people have it in today's economy. Mass unemployment, poor quality jobs for those that have them, no access to housing & the list goes on. Many questions have been asked of why, across the world, young peopleseem to be cut off from the traditional pillars of society in a way previous generations haven't been, & what can be done about it.\\n\\n\r\nArata Kaizaki is the Japanese man of these times. At 27, he finds himself living alone in a bachelor pad funded by his parents, relying on part time work since he quit his salaryman job under (initially) unclear circumstances. After having his allowance cut by his parents, & a night of drinking while pretending to still have a \u201cnormal\u201d job with his old school friends, Arata is approached in the street by Ryou, a blonde Morpheus, who presents Arata with an opportunity: Take the blue pill & spend a year as a 17 year old high school student as part of the ReLIFE Programme.\\n\\n\r\nOnce back at school, however, any potential for ReLife to be an interesting exploration of why Arata would want to resort to reliving the last year of high school, not to mention other themes that could be explored in this scenario, is quickly squandered. For the majority of its thirteen episodes, ReLife is just another forgettable high school ensemble anime. Indeed, as early as the second episode it seems to have forgotten that there might be a reason why Arata would have joined the programme to explore, & instead settles into the usual, predictable routine of misunderstandings, arguments, innocent romance & lots of girls crying.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of episode one, you'll have a pretty good idea of everything that is likely to happen in the following twelve (& probably some ideas that are better). Chizuru, the black haired, socially awkward genius of the class, quickly becomes Arata's \u201cI'm 27! I can't have these feelings for a seventeen year old\u201d slow burning love interest who he is soon teaching how to behave normally. On its own, Arata meeting a socially awkward girl who he helps function in society & in so doing finds out something about himself could have been an interesting core to build a story around; that is if it wasn't introduced almost as soon as Arata shrunk into his teenage body & then just as quickly became second fiddle to the other little dramas going on with the other characters.  I bet you can't guess how they resolve that age gap, either. \\n\\n\r\nOoya & Rena, the other \u201cpair\u201d in the group, fill predictable roles. Rena is an insecure girl who resents that her friends are better than her at things she likes, despite that also being why she's friends with one of them in the first place (don't ask, the writer clearly didn't). Her role is mostly to provide drama & conflict within the group, because bitches be crazy. Ooya, meanwhile is the \u201cI can't believe you're so smart yet so dumb about love!\u201d guy who's blissfully ignorant about anything to do with girls, in particular Rena's feelings for him.\\n\\n\r\nRyou, Onoya & Honoka round out the group, three characters who can be summed up as being there when needed, although they're also often there when not. A subplot involving Onoya & Ryou is introduced for little apparent reason except to fill a couple of episodes, allow for a cock tease moment between Onoya & Arata (you can make your high school anime protagonist an adult, but he'll always be a teenage virgin) & ensure they can form a third pair at the end without being \"weird.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe drama in ReLife, & there is plenty of teenage angst to sit through, mostly seems to come from Rena's intense self-pity causing her to fall out with her friends. Chizuru is smarter than her & that pisses her off. Honoka is better at sports than her & that also pisses her off, although only after resolving her issues with Chizuru. Of course, they just want to be her friend, but simply talking these things through would rob ReLife of half its episodes. Plenty of talking goes on behind closed doors, however, as almost everything seems to be instigated or resolved by a conversation someone wasn't meant to hear. \\n\\n\r\nNow, Rena allowing her resentments & insecurities boil over into lashing out at others could have been a fine story element, if it was given proper time to be established, developed & resolved. But we only have thirteen episodes & a lot of other things to get through so you'll just have to hope it reminds you of a better show that you can use to fill in the gaps. It also seems odd that a series that started out apparently being about why Arata would want to be 17 Again exerts so much time on a 17 already girl having tantrums with her girl chums. \\n\\n\r\nAll this teenage drama also gives Arata, the nominal protagonist of ReLife, something to actually do, given the show has no interest in exploring his motivations for being there. Despite being an adult having done him no favours in his own life, it seems that experience somehow gives him insight into things that his teenage companions lack, Ryou even going so far as to imply in an off hand comment that that's what he's there for. I'm sure we're all guilty of giving life advice to others that we'd never follow through with ourselves, but building an entire elaborate corporate business model around it seems a bit much. I can think of better uses for that miracle pill of Ryou's. \\n\\n\r\nOne could go on at length about the many flaws, contradictions & things that just don't make sense about the ReLife programme. There isn't much point, though, as to give it any real thought is to do more than the writers did. At the end of the day, it exists only to make the synopsis sound distinct enough from all the other high school anime out there to pique the interest of potential viewers. As for commenting on the characters or society it depicts, or exploring themes of youthful alienation or societies inability to accommodate people like Arata, ReLife isn't interested. Why does the ReLife programme exist? Why not. Why would they want to offer NEETs an opportunity to relive the last year of high school? Why not. Why would someone want to do that? Why not. I miss the days when \"a wizard did it\" was enough.\\n\\n\r\nArata, beyond apparently not being interested in why he'd want to be 17 Again, also really doesn't seem like an adult in a teenagers body, despite what his classmates say. In particular, there is a running gag throughout the series that Arata consistently fails tests with abysmally low scores. That's a pretty standard gag in high school anime, but remember Arata has already graduated high school & university to get to this point. Curriculum\u2019s change & all that but, like most of ReLife, it seems indicative of how little thought has been put into exploring the opportunities & complications presented by Arata's unique situation.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the show does elaborate on how Arata came to quit his job, the event that began his downward spiral, although it does so in a typically simplistic way \u2013 the workers & boss at his old job were a shower of bastards who did something terrible* & went on like it was nothing. Good on Arata for taking a stand against the system & tendering his resignation despite knowing the damage it will do to his future prospects, an act that somehow seems to stand as a symbol for future young employees at evil incorporated. \\n\\n\r\n*To discuss it in more detail would be a spoiler, but it's also notable that ReLife, intentionally or not, does that uniquely Japanese thing of apportioning blame to everyone, including Arata, for said terrible thing. Remember kids, if someone you know is being bullied, doing something is as bad as doing nothing. Grow up!*\\n\\n\r\nExcept that he wasn't shut out from society as is at first implied. Sure, quitting his job is a blemish on his CV when applying to other faceless bastard corporations. But even in Japan it's not like soulless office drone is the only option available to him. Indeed on two occasions he has reason to ask for his adult body back so he can see people who helped him get on in his adult life. Good thing Ryou had a blow me pill tucked away in the same orifice he keeps the shrink me ones. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the more we find out about Arata's past suggests not simply that he's an unhappy victim of an unaccommodating society, but someone who lacks the imagination to function as anything but the lifeless salaryman many people his age would give an arm to avoid becoming. It's ironic to think that an author who presumably wrote ReLife to avoid such a life created a character who apparently can't function any other way. Then again, it's not like there is an academy award winning example of a story where a Japanese guy finds himself unable to keep his job in the big city & ends up working in a socially taboo job which he slowly comes to accept & embrace as others learn to shed their prejudices towards him & the work he does to draw inspiration from.\\n\\n\r\nOn the production side of things, there isn't a lot to say about ReLife. The character designs are all pretty standard & unremarkable, with one minor annoyance that they all have mourning armbands on their cardigans for no reason. If you like close up shots of girls crying, smiling & embracing, though, this anime has you covered better than a KyoAni production. Everything else to do with art & animation is functional & not really worthy of comment. The OST, however, is particularly irritating. I assume Masayasu Tsuboguchi is a disciple of Randy Newman, as he mostly sticks to a piano playing along with whatever is happening on screen: \u201cWalking down the street. Looking at my feet. Feeling life is sweet. Just stood in some ****. Dee Ba Doo Ba Dee\u201d\\n\\n\r\nReLife is escapism at its most simplistic & lazy. It presents a scenario ripe for thematic exploration but instead contents itself with going through the motions with minimum thought. It's purpose isn't to ask why a 27 year old would see to go back to high school. Instead it asks you, the viewer, if you're a twenty something whose life has gone nowhere & offers an easy way to avoid dealing with it if you answered yes. If you want to watch a series about a NEET who feels cut off society but learns ultimately that escaping into fantasy is no solution with the help of a strange seventeen year old girl he forms a questionable relationship with, watch Welcome to the NHK. If you're a twenty something NEET who watches lots of cartoons about teenagers being friends & wish you could be in one, ReLife is the shallow, pandering experience you've been looking for.\\n",

            "content": "ReLIFE is a series that borrows elements from other series of the same genre and gives it a twist of its own. The concept proves to be an interesting one, even if the premise makes it seem like it will turn out to be a typical school anime. In some parts, it is what you\u2019ve seen before. But the way the series manages its themes and its characters makes this series much more than it initially started out to be. A story about a man who gets to relive his high-school life can be a great one if done right. But ReLIFE ends up beingjust more than a series about a protagonist who goes through awkward situations in a school. It focuses on how this character changes throughout the series and what he learns from his experience. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise of the series is definitely something that is quite unique. The story revolves around a 27-year-old jobless protagonist named Kaizaki Arata, who one day meets a man who gives him the offer to join a program named ReLIFE. This program will supply Kaizaki with a pill that can make him look 10 years younger and he\u2019ll be put in a high-school as a test subject, to study his improvements and actions. But the series less focuses on the concept on being young again, and more on the concept of learning new things and adapting to a new environment. ReLIFE just isn\u2019t a story about Kaizaki, but also the story about the people around. It\u2019s not just how his school is changing his life, but how he\u2019s changing other people\u2019s lives. And the series focuses on some really important themes, which elevates the quality of the series. The series plays out like a typical slice-of-life school anime, as the series goes through many different situations and story arcs. And the series rearranged the content of the manga to make the series more enjoyable. Many twists and backstories that appear way later in the series, appears in this series, so anime-only watchers can see these reveals. And the ending may not end the overall main story, but it feels like a satisfying conclusion in the series, knowing how much the characters have changed. \\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nReLIFE concept and premise may be interesting and all, but the ReLIFE\u2019s biggest strength is its characters and how they are handled. The series is more character-driven than story-driven, as the series primarily focuses on the development in character relationships. And the way the series presents its characters and their improvements is what makes the series so special. And the series manages to focus on some really important themes, both for teenagers and adults. No, it\u2019s main theme is not just \u201clive your life to the fullest\u201d (as the synopsis may suggest), but it\u2019s also about bullying is the social world, how to be able to cope with situations you want to run away from, how to withstand yourself from making wrong decisions, how sometimes the wrong decision might be the best for everyone, how being superior can get you hate, and so on. The series isn\u2019t a page-by-page adaptation of the manga, as many things were rearranged to suit the structure of the anime. Many content skipped from the first episode appears in the second. The reason for doing is primarily because they wanted to end the first episode off with the first day done. And many important moments that happen later in the manga, gets adapted earlier on in the series. This is because they wanted to adapt the big reveal and the major backstories. The pacing of the series is somewhat fast, but not rushed. It manages to not waste time and always entertain. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, ReLIFE\u2019s biggest strength is its characters. It only takes an episode or two for them to be likable, and each character stands out one way or another. And the fact that every character gets an adequate amount of focus makes sure that the entire cast as whole is strong, instead of one character standing out more than the other. The protagonist of the series, Kaizaki Arata, ends up being likable from the start as he can be relatable to adults and teens, primarily because we see him as both. The way he changes a character throughout the series is fascinating. The ReLIFE program managed to makes Kaizaki learn a lot of things that can help him later in the future. He learns his values and realizes how society works, while helping others around him by sharing his knowledge and experiences as an adult. But Kaizaki\u2019s not the only character that gets a lot of development, but also the rest of the main cast too. Hishiro Chizuru also changes throughout the series, as she learns how to be more socially active and how to understand other people. And she\u2019s later give a major backstory that changes the way the audience sees her. And her relationship with Kaizaki is really well handled. Yoake Ryou, a character that very few people expected to be a character with depth, proved to excel and be an excellent character. His backstory on how much he had to go through to make his first subject successful, shows that his smile is just there to cover up his regrets. And characters like Onoya An, Kariu Rena, and Ooga Kazuomi also prove to be just as good of a character as the rest of the cast. Onoya\u2019s interactions with the rest of the characters is always fun, and Kariu and Ooga\u2019s relationship is really intriguing, especially towards the end of the series.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art is generally good in ReLIFE, especially considering the fact that TMS has a lot to do this season. The detailing isn\u2019t the best, but it works. The backgrounds are fairly good looking as it\u2019s pretty well detailed. The architectures look nice and well detailed and the natural environments look good too. The lighting is a little subpar is sunlight won\u2019t feel like as if it a ray, but rather on flat color with multiple shading would be used instead, which doesn\u2019t work too well. But the shading, particularly on characters, looks fine. The character designs are quite good, even if it\u2019s not anything unique. You\u2019ve probably seen Kaizaki\u2019s face in some other anime before, but it still works well here too. Far away character models can start to lose its details though. The art style is intentionally drawn in a simplistic manner at times for comedic relief and it works well. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nProbably the weakest thing about ReLIFE is its animation quality. The production values are okay at best, and this might be because TMS has to many projects to work on this season. The fluidity in character movements is lacking and it can be comparable to Sakamoto desu ga from last season. There\u2019s a particular moment when Yoake was running, and that didn\u2019t look too good. Character movements look alright, but the frame rate feels too low at times, which makes it lack a proper flow. But it still works though, just not as much as you want it to be. And there are times when the animation quality improves, particularly during comedic, over-the-top reactions, when the art is simplified. \\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nReLIFE may have a large main cast, but it doesn\u2019t have a large supporting cast, so the number of seiyuu needed for this anime is quite low. That being said, there a whole lot of well-known seiyuu behind the voices of some of these characters, and they do a splendid job in adding more depth to the series. Ono Kensho does a great job as Kaizaki, as he does both serious and comedic parts right. His \u201ceeehh!\u201d (which you\u2019ll hear a lot), works well and he does a good job in doing over-the-top reactions. At the same time, he manages to get the serious parts done too, particularly when Kaizaki\u2019s backstory is introduced. Kayano Ai does a great job as Hishiro. It feels weird to listening to her after watching the KonoSuba OVA (since she\u2019s Darkness), but she manages to make Hishiro as emotionless as possible, while adding a sense of curiosity in her voice. She does have experience in these type of roles (like Shiina from Sakurasou). Kimura Ryouhei was the perfect Yoake. He manages to get his optimistic spirit perfectly and it\u2019s hard to see anyone else do his role better than he did. Other seiyuu such as Tomatsu Haruka as Kariu, Uchida Yuuma as Ooga, and Ueda Reina as Onoya, all do a great job in what they have to do. And there are other well-known seiyuu doing supporting roles, such as Namikawa Daisuke, Sugiyama Noriaki and Sawashiro Miyuki, who all do a good job too.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nReLIFE\u2019s music is also quite good too. The number of ED ReLIFE has is astonishing, especially for its length. This is because every episode has its own ED. That being said, though none of the ED ends up being extraordinary, all of them at least manage to be good. There\u2019s not a single ED in the series that felt lacking in any ways. The OP, \u201cButton\u201d, is a very good ED that manages to capture the heart and tone of the actual series. Its vocals are nice and the music is great too. The background music in the series is great though. Though there isn\u2019t much a variety, the ones you will hear will work well with the context. There\u2019s a lot of piano music, that\u2019s for sure. The piano music they mostly play is placed so well almost all the time. The music would play when someone is talking, then stop when things are silent. The music will follow the sounds of the characters speaking, which is really great. A good example of this is near the beginning of the series, when Kaizaki and Yoake meet for the first time.\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nReLIFE might have been much more than I wanted. If it was simply a series about a main character who gets to relive his high-school life and go through awkward situations, I would have been satisfied enough, But the series becomes much more than that by developing its characters other than the protagonist, and the series. And the fact that the series focuses on really important themes was a big surprise too for an anime labeled simply as a school slice-of-life, as it can easily be called a psychological drama at times too. I had so much fun seeing the characters change throughout the series and create relationships with other characters, whether it be friendship or romance. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, ReLIFE is the anime to watch this season. There was a good amount of hype surrounding it before it aired\u2026 or pre-streamed, and the series manages to deliver overall. It\u2019s got a great cast of characters that develop throughout the series so much, and the well-developed relationships are made. The comedy is consistently funny and inventive. And even its serious moments are done with such care. The series focuses on some very important themes throughout the series and some very good life lessons are learned. The production values are weak, but the series makes up for it with almost everything else. And not much is skipped, but rather rearranged, so it would work better in its anime format. Overall, ReLIFE has something for everyone, whether it be lighthearted or serious. \\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic cast of characters that get sufficient focus and development\\n\r\n+ Character relationships are handled well\\n\r\n+ Premise is interesting and evolves into something much more than reliving a school life\\n\r\n+ Important themes are introduced and well-focused on \\n\r\n+ Fast and consistent pacing with the rearrangement of content makes the flow of the series better\\n\r\n- Production values are weak and animations lack fluidity \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

This year is going to be one of my best years because of animes like ReLife.\r\nStory: The story is your typical highschool setup but this anime is quite refreshing as ithas various plots which doesnt allow the viewer to guess what will happen next.\\n\r\nI found this anime very humorous and refreshing each episode was the continuation of the previous episode. The story is quite enjoyable and I am sure the viewer will be awed by how many times this anime can make one laugh in unexpected ways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think art was like how various other anime in the market have but the incredible thing was how the animators made the use of art to make the funny scenes thousand times more funnier.  :D  Right facial expressions and background were used at the right time which helped adjust and enjoy the story to the fullest. For a slice of life anime I think it was very well done.\\n\r\nI still remember various scenes where the art made the plot so funny that I ended up grinning very much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Though there were no new tracks but the use of right tracks at the right time helped the series achieve its enjoyment quota. The music blends in with the animation and helps in getting the viewer their enjoyment quota.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What I mainly found awesome about this anime is that it has new characters with new emotions that I havent seen for quite some time. I have to say that the characters are quite refreshing and unpredictable and humorous. I thinks the characters played a very important role in bringing out the originality in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think this is one of the series that I enjoyed the most this year. I stayed glued to my seat filled with laughter till the very end and I hope others will too feel the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I recommend this anyone who wants something new, refreshing and  humorous. I can definitely say that those who watch this anime sincerely are in for a very enjoyable ride. I think I will watch this 2-3 times more just fill my enjoyment quota!!\\n\\n",

ReLife is first anime that made me feel that way in a while. I have not thoroughly enjoyed an anime this much since 2014. While its plot revolved something more down-to-earth and reality (well the only exception being the ReLife pill), the anime always manage to make me smile and laugh. It is a wonderful slice-of-life that is not only very funny but relatable. \r\nUnfortunately, I cannot capture how much I enjoyed this anime in a review, even though I justfinished watching it. And I will never bring myself to reveal any plot or spoil the show for you. I STRONGLY URGE to start watching this masterpiece of Summer 2016. The best part: all 13 episodes came out on the same day. NO WAITING FOR WEEKS!!!\\n\\n\r\nPerks of the Anime:\\n\r\n-No needless lewd fanservice\\n\r\n-Beautiful animation, characters,and setting (i'm a huge sucker for works of art)\\n\r\n-Great voice acting in subtitle\\n\r\n-Very real slice of life with some serious subjects but always makes you laugh and grin in every episode\\n\r\n-Very relatable characters and situations\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-why only 13 episode T_T. I need more. the anime ends at manga chapter 109 btw.\\n\\n\r\nWhy are you still reading? God damn it. Stop wasting time and binge watch all 13 episodes like me! I promise you will not be wasting your time and will cherish this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nWhere i watched it: AnimeHaven.\\n",

            "content": "ReLIFE is one of those animes where you look at the synopsis and decide that it may or may not be your cup of tea. In this regard, it is truly a hidden gem because under the relatively simple premise of a story is great writing and excellent execution.\r\nThe story is a slow burn; I've remarked myself that the pilot episode itself was only average. But as you make your way through the series, everything starts to just make sense why this story is being told, and you come to truly care about these characters which are so phenomenally written.\r\nIt's easy to mess up characterdevelopment but difficult to master getting it just right, and ReLIFE is a prime example of the latter. It's filled with a memorable cast with each character standing out with their own consistently-crafted personalities, fully including their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nFew anime get the endings they deserve but fortunately for us, ReLIFE is one of those.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE has made me feel ways I have not felt from consuming any other type of media. It's genre-defining storytelling at its finest and is easily one of the reasons why I have come to love anime. At the very minimum you will feel a shred of care towards these 2-dimensional characters, so what are you waiting for? Give it a shot and you won't regret it, as cliche as that sounds.",

I don't have a plan to see this anime even one day before release. But after release, i watched all eps just in one day. I surprised that i watched very good anime without anticipate it comes.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nYour life is ruined, job is suck, you afraid that the time that you must life on your own is come but you not ready for it, How if you can back in highschool once again? This is ReLife. The concept isgood, also have some unexcepted plot twist. This show have much life leasson, and inspriring story. But the pacing is slow, not much story progress. Relationship story is quite mainstream.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI can say this have average animation quality, but the expression and comedic scene is very great. Make me laugh more because of that. And also character design is cute i think.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOP song is great, i like very much. Voice acting is wonderful, especially for An Onoya, her voice is really cute XD. But BGM is quite poor. It almost like not have BGM at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThis show have much character developement, Rena character developement i think have more deep than our MC altough she is just Supporting character. Love relationships is predictable and reasonable. But just me or not, im more interested with supoorting couple than main couple relationship. Seriously, they have very funny, and enjoyable relationship, very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best part of this show, i overenjoyed watch this, make me feel back in highschool and also got much inspiring quotes and life leasson. Make me happy, make me laugh, i can see this show as a bright light of my life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThis is not prefect show, but i very recomended this for everyone.

            "content": "RELIFE,\r\nI went into this anime with low expectations due to my perceptions of the slice of life genre being slow paced and outright boring (Looking at you Angel Beats!) That is why to my surprise I can conclusively say that I came out of this 13-episode rollercoaster satisfied and emotionally attached to the characters and their journeys.\r\nFirst and foremost, I must say releasing this in a Netflix style binge fiesta was a stroke of marketing genius. It has likely contributed to the surging popularity of the show here on MAL and definitely best watched over a short period of time.\r\nAs with every review, Itry to limit it to 500 words. Short but sweet as per say.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Sound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNothing really stood out here from a soundtrack perspective. The opening was forgetful and the OST maybe marginally added different layers of tension to scenes that required it. Thought it was pretty cool that the ending track changed for each episode; this was definitely a nice touch.\\n\r\nA highlight for me was how each voice actor perfectly fit with the character they were portraying and paved way for the chemistry to develop between these characters.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Art/Animation (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot much to really say here that has not been said by previous reviewees, the animation does not really stand out, nor is it required to as it\u2019s a slice of life genre depiction that is not expected to product ufotable produced fate franchise production values. Everything seems animated to a satisfactory level and the output was consistent throughout. One highlight for me was the choreography of the final episode\u2019s big reveal, it was perfectly directed and will leave you gobsmacked and applauding how well it was brought out on screen.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Characters/Story (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt take\u2019s something special to create story that has characters that are universally loved by the audience. ReLIFE puts its characters at the forefront with the utmost confidence that they will succeed in engaging us through their dialogue and specific individual characteristics. Whether it\u2019s Hishiro, Kaizaki or Kariu, they all have multiple layers of development throughout the 13-episode journey that enable us to care in suspense for where it might lead. At the time of writing this, I still cannot think of a character that I genuinely disliked on this show, I was paying attention throughout, which is an achievement in itself as I have the attention span of a goldfish.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise there has been critique from the MAL community for the pacing of this show, but in all honesty what can be expected for a slice of life genre and in general, it takes time to develop characters and clear a path for a story to be told. More so I was surprised by the cliff-hanger and have no idea where this story will lead to in the future. There are still many questions that need answering in (hopefully) season 2.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2713) Overall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did the job of keeping me on board for the 13-episode journey and has led me to begin reading the manga, which thankfully the anime has for the majority of the time been faithful to the adaption of the source material.\\n\\n\r\nWord Count (471/500)",

            "content": "ReLIFE is a Summer 2016 anime that Crunchyroll gave the Netflix treatment the moment the first episode aired on broadcast TV due to it being released on some foreign app prior to it TV broadcast. It's also not very good. But I suppose if you're going to make available the entirety of an anime from the very start of this miserable season, it should be the one that's incredibly safe and inoffensive, shouldn't it? Because whilst ReLIFE succeeds at nothing, it manages to inoffensively incorporate everything that fans find pleasant about this medium. Are the people who like this show the same ones who saythat Sound Euphonium is unambitious and entirely devoid of meaning? That would be fucking hypocritical of them if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is centered on a twenty-seven year old man named Arata Kaizaki who is working part-time to make ends meet after an incident with his first company caused him to quit after only three months. One night after drinking some sorrows away, he is offered the chance to take part in an experiment by a mysterious man who will guarantee him a job if he goes through with it, so Arata accepts and soon finds himself in high school again with a body that's ten years younger and an inability to pass even the simplest of high school exams because somehow it's supposed to be funny that a grad student can't solve math problems. He soon befriends a bunch of classmates from the mysteriously quiet Chizuru Hishiro to the academically-gifted but incredibly unfit Kazuomi Oga, and the show is basically these characters going through various awkward issues whilst Arata is also there. Yeah, don't expect the dude and his issues to take center stage all that much in this series. I think Vaan from Final Fantasy XII had more plot importance than him.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough ReLIFE starts intriguing with the possibilities of what it'd be like to live high school again, if you took that premise away, it's nothing but a boilerplate high school anime with lame jokes and toothless drama. Arata is barely involved with a lot of his classmates' issues, and when he is, it's usually to give a generic speech that the show tries to tie into his real age, but fails because anyone around the age of sixteen would know the advice he dishes out. And I'm not kidding when I say the jokes are lame. It's nothing but crappy reaction faces that try to make light of situations that shouldn't be taken lightly to begin with, especially when dealing with issues as heavy as suicide. There's even a moment early on in the series when drama occurs because Chizuru looks like the Devil whenever she tries to smile. I don't know who the fuck thought good drama can occur when the catalyst is something that can't be taken seriously, but he is more wrong than a Rwanda massacre denier.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever the show does focus on the actual ReLIFE experiment, it can be a little intriguing. But most of what we know about it is told through the eyes of supervisors like Ryo, and he mostly angsts about the first person he put through the experiment and how he failed with him. Thing is, it's kind of hard to sympathize with Ryo when they don't make clear how he failed besides saying the person never changed throughout their high school life, and it's especially hard when you don't tell me anything about Ryo's personal life, so I'm not sure why I'm supposed to care about his failure. It also doesn't help that when they finally reveal who the first subject actually is, they never do anything with it other than make you go \"I guess that makes sense\". Plus, it doesn't seem like the first subject's failure to pass the experiment is all that bad, although that might be because of all the crappy jokes they make at the person's ineptitude.\\n\\n\r\nBut that and the suicide issue I mentioned earlier are honestly the best drama the show can offer. Because oh my god, the issues the characters have to face in this show are unimaginatively lame. Anyone who's read my reviews of Shirobako and Kiznaiver will know that I don't like drama where the characters learn things that anyone over the age of sixteen would already know. The last two years of teenage life I'll give a pass because some people are late bloomers, but despite the fact that these characters are in their final year of high school, they're learning things that I'd expect a seven-year old to struggle with. I mean jealousy at someone's superior sports and academics despite the fact that you're good at both as well? An inability to make friends because you act like a robot? Is that really the best drama you could come up with for these characters to face? High school crushes that are mutual on both ends? In a world where those Persona games exist, that doesn't fucking fly!\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I watching characters go through struggles if they don't learn anything profound by the end? You don't have to be original. You just have to make them go through conflicts that hit hard and don't hold back when it comes to the important stuff. And you have to make sure that the stuff is actually important, because those are the kind of experiences that people over the age of sixteen deserve to go through. People discovering empathy or learning that the job market is rough is like discovering that \"blue\" is a color or an apple is a fruit. Would you really want to watch someone go through a lot of trouble because he didn't know that \"blue\" belongs in the same category as \"red\"? Even Barney isn't that insulting to its audiences' intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, whilst ReLife isn't without its charms, its lack of teeth mars it too much for it be more than a mediocre show, and when it does gain teeth, it finds a way to break them with a baseball bat made out of unfunny. The characters are all tolerable for the most part, but they're never developed beyond being a simple stereotype. The \"adult turning into a kid\" premise is incredibly underused and lacks tension since it's revealed that Arata can turn into an adult again just by swallowing another pill. And the animation is incredibly plain, although given that TMS is handling four shows this season, perhaps asking for more is a bit much. It even has the gall to just end with a \"life goes on\" ending, and given how over 100 chapters were covered in something that's currently in the 130s, chapter-wise, I don't expect to see a sequel anytime soon. Also, these chapters must be shorter than Atom Ant if this adaptation really covered that much, because I refuse to believe any manga can be this padded. And I've read Kimi no Iru Machi, man.",

The anime had taken place in a high school setting and displayed events with wonderful art, as well as creating characters you would enjoy and want to see more of. The implementation of giving a life event another shot really jumped the story, making you feel emotions for all the different characters and wanting them to have a happy ending. When you finish the season you'll be attached to the characters, wanting another season as soon as possible. Overall, the story had progressed nicely, at agood pace and is very enjoyable for those looking for a laid back series for the summer 2016 anime season.",

            "content": "This anime's somewhat relatable for me. I'm a 23 year old man, who is currently unemployed and also out of education. Though my circumstances/reasons for being in my current situation are entirely different (and valid), I can still relate to the main character a hell of a lot, as well as that desire to just... go back 10 years, make some changes, make more of an impact with what I know now, and have a fresh start.\r\nI really did know nothing going into this. ReLIFE's on the front-page of both MAL and Crunchyroll a lot recently. I saw the genres on MAL as school andslice of life, and so I thought \"WHY THE HELL NOT?!\" (school/sol anime is my weakness), and decided to watch an episode.\\n\\n\r\nLess than 24 hours later, I had finished the show, and was browsing Tumblr for #relatable posts. Damn.  God damn. This shit's good. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise, and the way your introduced into the school environment, is certainly unique, and you've got a diverse mix of characters/personalities. You've got some romance, some drama, some day-to-day life problems, as well as teenagers just being teenagers. The best part though (if you ignore the kind of sci-fi magic pill thing) is that it's pretty realistic! The reasons for the drama, and the build-up to potential romance, the way characters introduce themselves... it all feels pretty natural to me, which I really appreciate in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's also some deeper story-lines and elements that come into play a few episodes in. A couple of serious topics come to light, and are dealt with in (again) a realistic and mature way.  After a few episodes, I just thought ReLIFE was going to be some light, fun fluff, with a generic and positive message, but no. These additional elements made quite an impact, and they were incorporated into everything in a mature manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes flow together really well, and can be appreciated both individually, and as a whole. I really enjoyed the music, too. There's a good mix of stuff played during the end-credits, plus a jazz-ish vibe throughout the show, thanks to a piano, and yeah.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE will leave you wanting more, which in my opinion is a sigh of an A+ anime. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Being able to redo a life full of mistakes would be a dream for anybody. A lot of people have regrets about their early life down the line and spend many nights wishing they could take something back or undo some mistake; however, they must come to terms with such things, as in life there is no such thing as a redo. But what if there was? \r\nReLife is the story of an unemployed man who is offered a chance to return to being a high school student for an experiment on fixing people's lives by allowing them another chance at things. They pay hisliving expenses for a year while in school and even promise a job offer when it is all done. Kaizaki Arata, the main character, drunkenly accepts the offer and takes a pill that reverts his appearance to that of a teenager and he starts as a third year (In Japan high school only lasts three years instead of four). Everything is up to him at this point.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning:\\n\\n\r\nSo this show starts out fairly well with interesting ideas and some comical and entertaining points that show the main troubles of a grown 27 year-old man returning to his teenage years. I found myself chuckling at some points and was genuinely interested to see where his struggles would lead him. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, some of my interest was lost after he quickly made friends with those sitting around him. His struggles became a bit less relatable at that point, because he quickly and smoothly adapts to his surroundings and starts fitting in rather perfectly. This bothered me a bit, considering he is joining this class in their third year. By this year, friend groups are already established and everybody has people they talk to and hang out with. ReLife shows very little of this and instead Kaizaki starts a new friend group almost immediately even after being openly embarrassed in front of the class and getting terrible grades in his tests. The connections he made with the other characters were fairly forced in my mind as it seemed that the author wanted to quickly get into other people's problems instead of taking his/her time to write out a more tangible relationship with these characters and let the character connections occur naturally. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, Kaizaki's first day was terrible for him and full of struggles, but the second day on everything goes great for him and he makes a tight knit group of friends and all my sympathy and reliability with this character go out the window. But I still held some interest so I kept watching.\\n\\n\r\nMain contents: \\n\\n\r\nSo from this point on, a major problem arises with this show that causes it to go from good to alright to average to mediocre. Kaizaki has one big problem that he struggles with; a trauma that caused him to fall into his pathetic unemployed self that lead to the main events of ReLife. The mental trauma that he suffers from this specific event shows through here and there, but other than that Kaizaki seems to have almost zero problems or struggles he has to face (or at least struggles he himself has to face). The majority of this show consists of the problems of other people while Kaizaki just kind of watches and then thinks, \"I should do something to fix this\" and then everything ends with tears and hugs and everyone's friends with each other. All of the personal struggles build other characters and leave Kaizaki in the dust as he becomes an outlying variable in the lives of other people who get more screen time than he does. The center of the story ends up being everyone else while Kaizaki just observes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story kind of reconciles with this by allowing Kaizaki to observe the problems of others and he bounces his own experience off of theirs and uses that to solve these problems. But, unfortunately the only part of his backstory that is actually important is that one event that caused him trauma and everything else is irrelevant. *I mean, its not like he has 27 years of experience he could reflect upon and use to apply to the problems he faces now and give meaning to the idea of ReLife*; that was sarcasm. Kaizaki seems flat as a character because he doesn't come through as a 27 year-old man with plenty of experience to share with these younger characters who are struggling through their youth. The event that defines his trauma is supposed to give the impression that the real world is cruel and sometimes you have to sit down and take it instead of standing up for yourself. It was supposed to show that not all problems can be solved. As fitting as that is for a show such as this, it doesn't come through with the amount of impact or authority that it should without properly displaying Kaizaki's full 27 years of experience. We don't need to know every day of his life to understand his story and his character or the message that is trying to be conveyed through his experience, but multiple events that show that he did have a childhood and he did go to school and he did experience the things that the high school characters now are going through. There simply isn't enough for me to feel something for Kaizaki or find the events in this show relatable. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime ended with everything going well and everybody's problems are practically fixed and a thing of the past (save for Kaizaki and one other character). The ending didn't surprise me, was predictable, and was almost frictionless as there was almost zero conflict, save for a plot twist at the very end that sparked enough interest in me to watch a second season, but this didn't warrant forgiveness for the lack of conflict. All the conflicts until that point were interesting and had good ideas and even made me interested and maybe I felt something for these characters (except Kaizaki). But each conflict ended in an episode or two and had a very anti-climactic and boring ending and felt repetitive and basically almost all of it revolved around one side character who got more development than the main character or the main heroine. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that this show doesn't know where to focus its efforts and rushed the beginning with minimal back story and very few ideas on what to do with these characters. The show had promise and despite the lazy ending there was a plot twist at the very end which was interesting enough to make me watch a second season. However, I don't see a second season for this show coming anytime soon. \\n\\n\r\nI give ReLife a 5/10 for having interesting ideas but going about them in the wrong way and forcing itself into the main conflict without background or natural development. If you want to check out this anime and decide for yourself if it's what you like than I won't deter you, because I think it is worth a watch at least once, but it isn't nearly worth a rewatch.",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to turn back the clock and redo life differently? Relife takes this concept and applies it to Arata Kaizaki, the second subject for the illusive Relife organization to conduct their social experiments on. It doesn't foray into the science fiction elements, instead it teaches adult life lessons through the thunderstorm that we call our adolescence. These messages are often conveyed through humorous, melodramatic and heartwarming scenarios.\r\nArata is the glue that holds everything together. He begins as a honest but unmotivated part time convenience store clerk. From the outset we can see that he is unsatisfied, having to lied to his friendsand family about his current successes. It's his growth as he comes to terms with past issues and relearns how to build healthy connections with those around him that makes him great. His inner narration constantly reminds us that he is a cynical adult, while his actions show his heart is in the right place. \\n\\n\r\nThere is little focus on the science aspects, you take a pill and it makes you look ten years younger without any serious repercussions, and then you are to be monitored at a school for one year with the opportunity to have a fulltime job after completion. It does occasionally have elements that show the possible dilemmas of the experiment, like the comedy driven situation were Arata was being tested to remain non intimate with the temptation of a schoolgirls crush or a saddening glimpse into the first subject which resulted in failure.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the second episode the story progresses in a typical anime high school comedy, romance drama fashion. He quickly makes friends with the aloof and lonely Chizuru, the hot headed Rena and the overachieving but romantically dense Ooga to name a few. The characters are really what drive the plot and the way they interact with one another with their constant misunderstandings and glib is reminiscent to the feel of Gekkan Shojuo. In the final third a typical melodramatic volleyball dispute that dragged on for too long but the way from which Arata relates to it and grows from it was both memorable and emotional. It was also nice to see how far Chizuru had come.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is colorful and simple. Character designs were clean but felt a bit outdated, giving an initial impression of budget constrains. There were a few small details that were suiting, like how Chizuru's design had one twin tail behind her neck and one in front giving her an awkward but cute appearance, which matched her comically awkward forced smile. \\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds never really stood out. The direction retained this low production feeling by having clunky Windows Movie Maker like transitioning effects. Animation fared better but also too having no noteworthy moments. The OST utilized plenty of piano which melded into the background nicely.  There was also multiple ending themes that matched the tone of each episode which was a nice touch.   \\n\\n\r\nIs Relife is a playful tale of redemption? Is it a unique take on the typical romance comedy? Its both, as the ideas mirror of one an other. It might not be the prettiest, or most well directed and at times situations can feel down right cliche. However, there were moments that had me laughing, empathizing and cheering on the characters as they grew, failed and fumbled.",

            "content": "I was suggested to pick up this anime, because it relates to me a lot. Currently 26, struggling with life, and pretty much a NEET, as society would call it. I sat through it, and now have mixed feelings about this anime. \r\nThe story revolves around Kaizaki Arata, a 27 year old who doesn't have a steady job, lies to his friends about working, faces depression from the fact that he isn't able to provide for himself. What makes things worse is the fact that his parents decide to stop sending him money to live off of. Things look bleak for our protagonist, with noway out. I can definitely relate, and it's not an easy position to be in.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Yoake Ryo, a mysterious man who offers him an offer that seems too good to pass up. In exchange for participating in an experiment where he will physically regress to his high school self, and thereby go back to high school and experience high school life all over again, he will be covered for living expenses and possibly get a job offer at the end of the experiment. It seems too good to be true, right? That's where you're wrong. The eponymous experiment, ReLIFE, is a program to rehabilitate NEETs and those who have turned away from society. What follows is the life of Kaizaki who is now in the body of a high schooler, with the mind of an adult, reliving life with his new classmates, facing the trials and tribulations that follow. \\n\\n\r\nIf you stop to think about it, this is a brilliant idea. For me personally, high school is where a majority of my personality was molded, from what I liked, to how I behaved. By having a chance to experience that again, you can see where you went wrong, and what you can do to fix it. So, the logic of the story is quite sound, at least for me. The story really excels at highlighting the differences an adult would face in highschool, from smoking (something I also do), to mingling with high school students, and the age gap that is always on your mind, because an adult is always conscious of that. It aims to show people that just because we made a mistake, doesn't mean we have to constantly suffer because of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is what I'd call \"absurdly average\". It's not bad at all, but it's not good, and there's nothing wrong with that. For an anime of this genre, dealing with adults as the main topic (something a lot of anime shy away from), it has very mellow color palette which is just soothing and relaxing to watch. The characters aren't exceptionally beautiful, nor are they bad looking, and that's where I got my \"absurdly average\" nomiker. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is where I have a huge complaint. The voice actors do their job well, as usual, with the standout being the VA for Onoya An's character, but the gripe is with the musical score. At moments of tension or suspense, you get these jarring piano scores, where, with the excuse of music, it sounds like a 5 year old just slammed his hands onto the piano. If it were one off moments, I'd forgive it, but it's constant, and ever infuriating. TMS Entertainment really screwed up bad with the musical score here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in ReLIFE is subtle for some, pretty obvious for others. Kaizaki in particular has very subtle development, which you might actually miss if you aren't careful enough. But it's definitely there. Kaizaki shines at what he does best, helping others, even though he's the one who needs help. But the brilliant part of ReLIFE is this. By helping others, being self-sacrificial, he grows as a person, and progresses through the anime. It's heartening to see that he isn't the usual protagonist, with the \"Friends are the most important\" or self sacrificial to the point of detonation. It's really where he shines through, being average, but likable all the same. \\n\\n\r\nFor someone like me who could actually relate to this anime, at the end, it left me with a lesson that I personally feel I should carry with me for a long time. \"Your mistakes and failures do not define who you are as a person\". Mistakes and failures are important, because they help a person grow, but it's important not to dwell on them all the time, just because they seem so jarring. That's what maximized my enjoyment of this anime. It taught me that I was so much more than what I thought I was. It helped inspire some confidence in myself, when I had none. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I eagerly wait for a season 2 for this anime, since it is a very open ending. I'd like to see how Kaizaki progresses through the remainder of his ReLIFE term, and what else he learns, because I could very well apply it to myself. If you're feeling lost at life, confused about what to do, please do pick up the anime and give it a chance. More often than not, you'd like what it has to teach you.",

Although the anime overall is light hearted with some really funny comedic moments, the beauty of the story is in how it also introduces and deals with weightier topics, such as peer pressure, bullying and being left out.\r\nYet the story is above all one of second chances, change, hope with romance and lovethrown in. It deals with the darker topics and moves the characters on with a cast as well fleshed out as could be in a single cour series. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say this one definitely warrants a watch if you enjoy simple, relaxing and fun stories, yet with a few more mature and adult themes (without the ecchi, thankfully).\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, watch this particularly if you enjoyed - Ore Monogatari, Lovely Complex and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.",

            "content": "This anime is life inspiring and will make you laugh. \r\nI can relate to this anime as I just turned 28 and Im studying at the University at the moment. Funnily enough my apparence is also young and people mistake me for being 20 or younger(no problem since Im a girl). I started the economy study after about 6 years of jumping from one petty job(with a million failed interviews in between) to the next and realizing that I want a job that not any teenager can do easily (and probably better than me) so I aimed for the most versatile education I could thinkof and failed most of the subjects for the first year. But like the main character Im not giving up, I will have my bachelors degree in a couple of years. \\n\\n\r\nThe only peeve I have with this anime is that they treat 27 as if its the new 50! But then again this character has been sat on his butt for ten years drinking and smoking for every oppertunity he gets to do so. Throw in the stress/anxiety, sleeplessness and lonelyness of being NEET and this character seems a bit more realistic. Still, hes in his 20's, hes still young, so I think the anime is a little bit silly. The positiveness of the Relife program is that he gets to be a bit more bold and figure stuff out. This is a lesson for a lot of people since the things we are afraid of saying or doing overwhelms us and we forget that mistakes gets forgotten in the big picture.",

            "content": "\" The effects you have on others is the most valuable currency there is. \" - Jim Carrey\r\nThis quote perfectly sums up the reason of our existence, no matter how small and insignificant you are, whenever you're around, every words and every action that you did will serve as a push, if not for yourself and brings an impact to others, a memory or in an unexpected form of encouragement for someone. But what does this has to do with this anime?\r\nReLIFE preys on this concept through a NEET adult mindset inside a high school student exterior, engaging on a scary idea with this andmakes the possibility that everything will be gone afterwards if you wanted to be a part of this 'experiment', you're the only one left with memories while the friends and lover in your memories would not even remember you. The fun and the pain, all is bear by yourself at the end and it's up to you to decide whether it's worth it.\\n\\n\r\n'You guys just won't let me give up! Why?!' - Kariu ( ReLIFE )\\n\\n\r\nBoring philosophical part aside, I found that this line has the most accurate depiction of a genuine friendship. The friends that won't always be there for fun moments but will never let you give up. ReLIFE has an ordinary storyline but extraordinary way of presenting the relationship, especially with friends, adding the deep characters development and projecting their insights so that you could resonate with them. You have Ryou that doesn't stand out much with helping the male protagonist but is always a step in front, doing his best as a supporter and aiding him in unexpected ways. Hishiro, the silent, smart and awkwardly cute girl that attempts to express herself more to make more friends but learnt more on understanding the feelings of others and herself in the process. And so, with the quirky characters, the whole romance and comedy thing plays out. But this time, feels joined the room. DEEP FEELS.\\n\\n\r\nThe story emphasized on two of the most close and distant elements that we have all experienced before - memory and regret. With the high school slice of life genre, it portrays the importance of living and enjoying the moment to its fullest, laugh or cry as hard as you can because before you know it, you're just one of the passive grown-up in the workforce, struggling to the peer pressure and reminiscing the old days where you can actually meet those ridiculous yet true friends and hang out with no stress. It will show that nothing hurts more than regret, or the faded memories that you once treasured.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, ReLIFE is a slice of life and a romcom with a twist that leads to exceptional feels. It's both entertaining and comforting, to know that even if the memory is gone, the impact that you left and those words that you said could meant a great deal to someone in their life.\\n\\n\r\nSo, would you like to experience this ReLIFE? \\n\\n",

            "content": "A ReLIFE Review\r\nTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t expecting ReLIFE to be very good. From the very first episode it was clear that this show wasn\u2019t a powerhouse in terms of visual design/animation. It was almost as if my screen screamed \u201clow budget\u201d the moment I laid eyes on it. This didn\u2019t necessarily have to be a problem, as all it takes is a little creativity and/or skill to work around the confinements of time and money. For one reason or another however, ReLIFE lacked the ingenuity to create any sort of visual spectacle throughout the season\u2019s entirety. The show went with a very basic, butvery consistent style. While it was at no point an eyesore, it was also at no point something worthy of awe. Backgrounds were no more than sufficient and background crowds ended up being less appealing due to lack of details/movement.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design however, was done quite well. Still not extraordinary, but ReLIFE does manage to create characters with distinct physical properties and overall pleasant appearances. Which I guess is to be expected with any self-respecting show, but whatever. They look good, and they\u2019re memorable. One thing I will call the show out on though is an over-reliance of comical chibi faces. I don\u2019t really consider ReLIFE to be a comedy, it\u2019s certainly not styled or focused like one. Sure, there are obvious jokes and genuine laughs to be had in every episode, but mainly the show seems lean more towards slice of life and drama rather than a constant aim for humor above all else. If ReLIFE were to just cut down a bit on chibi and focus on creating more moments of subtle humor, I feel the show would be better off for it. But perhaps that\u2019s just personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music of the show, the beginning of the season consisted of the same piano rift played at different paces, in different scenes, to try and match the mood being set. A lot of times this just came off as distracting, and often I\u2019d question whether individual scenes would be better off without any background rhythm whatsoever. Eventually the show evolved from its basic piano rift and by the end it had some actual variety in its soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nWhile musically and visually ReLIFE wasn\u2019t much over adequate, it still had a chance to prove itself worthy through its storytelling. ReLIFE starts off as a fairly basic deadline narrative where our 28-year-old protagonist, Kaizaki, is given a chance to take a year off from his depressing NEET life. He\u2019s approached by business man (and soon to be supporter) Ryou with a proposal to take part in an experiment. The corporation (ReLIFE) that he works for has developed a miracle drug that they want to test on Kaizaki, a drug that will turn his body back to its teenage form and give him the chance to re-experience high school. He only has a year however, and everyone he meets and befriends with have their memories wiped clean of existence as he returns to his adult life.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially it feels like ReLIFE traps itself from the beginning, offering what seems like only two outcomes: The show is going to end on a bittersweet note where he gets to remember his friends and everything he\u2019s learned from them, and his friends still remain affected by him but will sadly forget about him as a person OR the show will just break its own rule that it set for itself, copping out for a happy but perhaps ill gained conclusion. In storytelling, if you create your own rule then you better stick to it, because it is in no way clever to go against that rule just to service your shitty, unearned resolution. Luckily, ReLIFE doesn\u2019t do this and actually offers up a plausible and exciting third option, one which I won\u2019t disclose any further because of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the first season, ReLIFE does prove itself to be a plot with a plan, which honestly is quite a relief. The end of the first season isn\u2019t the end of the series however, and that leaves me questioning how there could possibly be a full second season that doesn\u2019t feel prolonged. The first season did feel a bit stretched thin and some characters do seem like they should be squeezed dry of any more dramatic conflict by now. Kariu in particular is used as the center of almost every issue and the season as a whole. There are two problems specifically that are essentially the same lesson being learned twice, which leaves me skeptical as to why she would repeat the same mistakes rather than taking her bad experiences and using them to avoid once again in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Kariu, I\u2019d say the characters themselves are pretty solid. It\u2019s interesting to see the levels of perspective tied to them, with Oga, Honoka, and Kariu being the core and average high schoolers. Then there\u2019s Chizuru and Kaizaki, who are sort of outsiders compared to the \u201cnormal\u201d students, followed by An and Ryou who in turn are even further outside the center and watch the others from a distance with Kaizaki as their intended focus as well as his effect on others.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE the corporation still remains mysterious by the end of this season and the true purpose behind their experiment is still yet to be revealed. That, plus the romantic entanglements and conclusion to Kaizaki\u2019s ReLIFE experience are probably enough to keep me enticed for future installments. The plot shows that it has an idea of where it\u2019s heading and the characters are likeable. It\u2019s a shame that the show couldn\u2019t come up with more skillful or creative animation, because it seems to be the only big thing that\u2019s holding it back.",

            "content": "It has been awhile since I've written a review but as soon as I finished this anime I knew I definitely needed to write a review expressing my feels.\r\nAbsolutely 10/10 this anime!! :3\r\nA must watch and, as of now, probably one of my favorites out of the summer list of anime.\r\nAs I was watching the anime I figured to give it a 9/10 but as I became closer to finishing the anime up I gave it a 10/10.\r\nNow there are many reasons as to why I love this anime:\r\n1) The color. The art of this anime is actually what caught my attention. The pastel bluemixed with the gray of their school uniforms and even their hair color. I absolutely love pastel colors so just looking at the poster for this anime drew me in immediately before I even knew what it was about.\\n\\n\r\n2) As you all know from reading the synopsis it revolves around a high school. Now I've never been to public school since I was home schooled growing up but I have been to an all girl's school before. So when there was some girl drama going on in the anime I could relate to it. It was just small things like that, that made me enjoy the anime even more as well as bring up some memories.\\n\\n\r\n3) Feels. Yes. Legit feels. It's anime's like this that pull on my heart strings and not just with romance and all that lovey-dovey doki-dokiness. But with feelings and emotions of relating to other people is what hit me. Especially at that age in high school. It shows the hardships of what comes with going to school as well as giving a glimpse of what happens after high school and boy do I know the feeling. So this is what tug at my feels and it gave a //you never know what life can give vibe. I know it's deep but it's the truth. It's life.\\n\\n\r\n4) The flow. Most anime rush the plot and just shove everything in but this anime didn't. It had a nice flow to it bringing up one story after the next. Like everything was related to each event and it all tied together perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n5) Humor. The amount of perfect humor this anime has is spot on. It's absolutely perfect. How you think it's taking a serious note and then moves on to a humorous point is down right my kinda thing.\\n\\n\r\n6) It's just such a good anime that I feel a lot of young adults can relate too and I find that is a very unique plot that was made in a GOOD manner not like. Rushed and thrown together as most anime do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow as much as I did love the anime there are //some// things that bugged me:\\n\\n\r\n1) I bloody hate fillers more than everything but this anime didn't really have any except for one and since I'm sensitive to fillers it really bugged the hell outta me. And honestly the fact that this entire anime was streamed in one go it kinda worried me that if people were watching this one week at a time they would eventually forget about it. And with anime being streamed at least once a week; with that one filler. People can usually loose interest. So I know I strayed from the point but the point actually is. Fillers are bloody annoying but I would love for everyone to watch this anime so it was more like...my concern for the anime's overall success LOL.\\n\\n\r\n2) OK WHERE IS SEASON TWO HONESTLY. I won't put in any spoilers but when you finish this you will demand for a season two, I don't want to explain why since I'm writing this in the negative section of this review but this anime needs a season two. I know that this anime covered about 100 chapters of the manga and there's only like. 130 chapters. So IF there will be a season two it won't be any time soon which bugs the hell out of me because I NEED ANSWERS. <-----seriously not a spoiler. Just watch it and understand. It's the same feel when most anime don't have a season two (I'm staring at those specific anime's you hear me.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut overall this anime was far by one of my favorite's and I really hope they make a season two and I will definitely read the manga just cause I love it that much.\\n\\n\r\nSo I hope you enjoyed this review and if you got to the very bottom of this:\\n\\n\r\nThank You For Reading!!! <3 ^_^\\n\\n",

            "content": "// This ReView only contains spoilers if you haven\u2019t ReLived the experiences shown in the anime yourself//\r\nReLife is an awesome mix of light-hearted comedy and existential drama, which ponders about serious adult problems by presenting us with a typical anime high-school setting. Surprisingly, it works.\r\nStory:\r\nWe are given a premise of an adult guy participating in an experiment called \u2018ReLife\u2019, which allows you to alter your appearance to look younger and spend a year in high school. Again. Under a watchful eye of the supervisor. The story after this is pretty simple and all of the revelations are obvious to the attentive viewer. ReLife draws itsinspiration from many sources. It shares alienation of a single person from the community with  \u2018Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru\u2019, finding your way emotionally and rationally with \u2018Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo\u2019, protagonist interaction with an unfamiliar setting with \u2018Boku dake ga Inai Machi \u2019, morally right versus socially acceptable dilemma with  \u2018NHK ni Youkoso\u2019. So, what are the unique aspects of the show? Is it just another copy of popular titles made to impress the audience? It can be said that ReLife is really good when it follows its original path, and gets worse when it strays off to the point of becoming easily compared. Luckily, that doesn\u2019t happen too often. \\n\r\nUnlike all of the former titles, ReLife is not about how our actions influence the world, but how our emotions influence our actions. It touches the aspects of friendship, love, social distance, acceptance in community, competitiveness and value of a person in his own eyes. It wonders where we draw the line between helping someone and intruding in their lives. Just like the former titles, however, ReLife is more mature than it lets you to believe at first sight. This is where the other aspect kicks in to balance this out.\\n\r\nComedy in ReLife is largely built on comparing the present and the past, contrasting differences (kids these days) with similarities (I guess X is still like this). It\u2019s a neat choice of giving the show a solid viewpoint and is also really good for giving minor details to the protagonist, considering that while he is not that much older than the rest of the cast, a lot has indeed changed in the last decade. It also deals with other minor things we pick up when growing up, such as formal language and vocabulary or just general ability to socialise in a group.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter section is where the title could drop its prefix and just be called \u2018Life\u2019, because this is what drives the show. It is not about main character moving towards his goal, but more about him realizing his own self through other people, who are much more in-the-moment. ReLife is about, well, life, and life is about having problems, because this is what we, as humans, spot best. Protagonist has problems, his fellow students have problems, even his supervisor faces several challenges. Some want recognition. Some want friends. Some want to correct their mistakes. Some just want to have fun. The assortment of obstacles, big and small, is so varied you could almost certainly relate to some of them. \\n\r\nAll characters are pretty unique and likeable, but instead of describing their personalities, I\u2019d like to point out how carefully authors tone down general tropes to convey their message. Shy people are not hilariously shy, assertive and eccentric characters are hardly tsunderes, etc. Sometimes we see comic situations, but they are never portrayed for the sake of comic relief. They shape the characters; they create interactions between them and fill the blanks in your and main character\u2019s understanding of their problems. Main character himself is not antisocial or too extreme in his behaviour \u2013 just a regular person with another chance in life. And because he doesn\u2019t really fit into this bunch of students, we can observe the situation from his point of view \u2013 as an outsider, detached from the rest of the cast.\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t become relevant until about halfway into the show, when curator says, \u2018Do you like ReLife? Does it let you to take a thorough look at yourself?\u2019 Not sure if this was intended, but this phrase is as applicable to the protagonist as it is to the viewer. ReLife challenges us as much as it is challenging the protagonist. Every single time we think about past situation and how we could\u2019ve done something differently, we are missing out on the present. This happens because we can usually only look at every situation once we are out of it, when we are not bothered by immediate feelings and goals. ReLife focuses on this aspect heavily by telling the viewer, \u2018Hey, if think you could relive some moments of your life and change them to better your present, why not focus on your present instead?\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in ReLife is really, really good, especially on the characters design side. It is simple but very fitting for the story, much like in the source material. A fair amount of detail is given to the background, and characters out of focus are also somewhat detailed (unlike A-1 Pictures straw men). \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI feel like ReLife deserves some extra credits at this department because the voice acting is on a superior level. Most of strong points of the anime are based upon interacting with feelings (or lack of them); hence it becomes extremely important to voice it properly. Another strong point is a special ending song for each episode, which definitely adds to the experience. OP is much more memorable than all of them, however.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nReLife deals with feelings of regret we have about our past, but more importantly, it tries to inspire us to face the present. There will always be regrets, because no life is perfect as is. But are we reducing the value our past problems hold? Do the negative aspects only break us and bring negative emotions, or do they shape us, build our character and prepare us for the life ahead? \\n\r\nDespite tackling complex issues, ReLife\u2019s messages are pretty simple. You can\u2019t run away from your life forever. Sometimes, you have to fail to succeed. And even if we have the second chance, there is no guarantee that we will use it and not miss out on it again. \\n\r\nIt is not about waiting for the right moment in your life to start acting. It\u2019s about starting doing something right now, not because it will be easy, or painless, or even that the result will pay off, but because in the end the journey will be worth it.\\n\\n\r\nScore: Story (8*40%) + Characters (9*30%) + Animation (9*15%) + Sound (8*15%) + Enjoyment (+1) = 9.45\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Achievement: Passion Cliff Is Too Steep \\n",

            "content": "This review should be spoiler free.\r\nIn this current time where the hype train is literally is full steam ahead, zombies roam around, steel robots are sliced like butter and explode with pizzazz, and people are gaming the metagame in dark, cerebral atmospheres...\r\nIt was a relief to finally watch something relaxing, happy, and deep like ReLIFE.\r\nI will admit that there are some biases that helped me enjoy the show:\r\n1. I can relate to the main character; I was in very eeriely similar circumstances not too long ago.\r\n2. I have a reasonable set of human emotions (i.e. I don't find sadness/happiness weird or foreign, crying as aman is ok, because... men are human too)\\n\\n\r\nBut with that said, even if the above biases does not fit for you, I would still recommend ReLIFE. \\n\r\nDealing with complexity of human emotions is not an easy task; but ReLIFE handles some of the complexity well. Does it handle the complexity better than ALL other shows? No. Is it a revolution of a 'school-period' slice-of-life show? Not really. So some of the elitists might pose the question: then why is it worth my time?\\n\\n\r\nMy answer is: Unlike some dramas that create drama for drama, ReLIFE handles the concept of perspective really well. ReLIFE shows that when well developed characters have different, but reasonable & real perspectives, those perspectives can clash and force even the best of us make bad/sub-optimal decisions; What then naturally results from these decisions and perspectives is organic, solid drama. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of simply posing realistic scenarios as food-for-thought, the show then goes a step further by educating some of us (in a non-preachy way) what are good tactics to handling some of these situations should they arise in our lives, by showing the good (and bad) decisions made by the characters. In my opinion, it is these aspects of ReLIFE that make it a strong contender for one of the top spring anime of 2016.\\n\\n\r\nHowever.. even if, post-watching, you feel like you've known the scenarios it presents all along, are a elite/veteran k-drama watcher, and/or feel the ending is a tad predictable, then I hope the journey of the show and its relaxing, light-hearted commentary on life will give you a smile and a laugh.\\n\\n",

ReLIFE isn't about going back to fix your mistakes as much as it is about striving to impact those around you in a positive way and rediscovering inner confidence that may have been muddied by the harsh life of adulthood\r\n-VERY likeable yet relatable protagonist. Don't be fooled by his NEET label he's put on in the beginning. He's not creepy or treats the world as eroge. He's just a normal dude\r\n-makes strong efforts to drive the plot in interesting ways. Doesn't always succeed but the work is clearly shown. I thought all the aspectsof this premise that they could explore within 13 episodes, they DID. kudos\\n\r\n-pace does not drag and it's clear the creators are aware of annoying tropes about romance anime and manages to circumvent most of them \\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\n-music was less than mediocre and often times feels misused\\n\r\n-..\\n\r\n..\\n\\n\r\nhonestly, haven't felt this excited to write a review about anime in a while. really impressed.",

            "content": "Well, I first heard of this show while I was searching for shows to watch. Around that time this show was announced, with the manga going on and the anime coming out 2 months later after I heard of this series.\r\nThe thing that attracted me to ReLIFE was the title itself!\r\nI don't know why but a show with such a title seemed waaaayyyy too appealing. I watch anime cause I'm too lazy to read manga. Black and White and more over reading fandubs on PC irritated my eyes. So I decided to wait for the anime. This show has 13 episodes and I knew thestory until ep 8. Soooo unfortunately my enjoyment was kinda limited though I must admit- ReLIFE is better animated than on manga. Of course that's my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get to my review\\n\r\nReLIFE at the Date of Release had not more than 110 chapters to adapt. So this show ends after adapting around 100 chapters.\\n\r\nTBH if you have read the manga and follow it like a freaking sidekick then this show is not for you. I was able to enjoy this show because I dropped the manga 1 and a half months before this anime's release.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE follows this energetic protagonist- Arata Kaizaki or if you prefer the Japanese way of saying it- Kaizaki Arata. Arata is out of college and got a job when he resigned 3 months later cause things weren't working out for him in that company. Why? I won't spoil it. Check it out for yourself. It'll definitely make you mad. Seriously! It's too unjust.\\n\r\nSo his after-3-months-resignation, many companies were hesitant to hire him. He got a part time job at a convenience store and struggles to make ends meet.\\n\r\nEnter Ryo Yoake or rather- Yoake Ryo, an employee from the ReLIFE organisation. He meets Arata around midnight and gave him the ReLIFE pill and outlined the whole ReLIFE process to Arata. Arata originally sceptical ends up swallowing the pill cause he was high on booze. The pill worked! No surprise there!!\\n\r\nThis story would highlight his 1 year high school story which acts as a restart button to completely change his life!!\\n\\n\r\nThis show as I mentioned isn't fully adapted. So if you want the full story, go to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are really relatable. These characters you'd find in almost any school. well, in any anime high school. But their personalities are too eccentric and enjoyable!!!\\n\r\nThe MC is a new breed of MC! not this crying bitch but someone who's helpful and head strong.\\n\r\nAll the secondary characters are also really well made!!! None of them hold the story back. Each character plays an important role in the story, which makes me wonder- are they actually secondary characters??\\n\r\nEach character is given sufficient screen time to get to know them better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, I never pay attention to who produced the music. But the background tracks actually match the on-screen tension. The Opening song has a really good buildup and really catchy. Starts with a slow keyboard and then guitar and finally some good ol' \"BA-DUM-TSS!!\"\\n\r\nThe Opening son's name is Button while the artist is some \"Penguin\". Sorry for not remembering the band's name but you could always youtube it! Basically, AWESOME SOUNDTRACK!!!! I can't say for the endings though cause I never watch them.\\n\\n\r\nArt is well made, Don't expect something flashy! It's your standard Slice of Life anime. The art style is really fun tho!! Especially Hishiro's smile XD !!!!!\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is a really enjoyable anime that teaches a great lesson. Instead of the traditional messages like-\\n\r\n                                         \"FRIENDSHIP!!!\"\\n\r\n                    or\\n\r\n                                         \"NEVER GIVE UP ON DREAMS!!\"\\n\r\n                    or               \\n\r\n                              well, I hope you get it\\n\\n\r\nThis show instead provides a different message- you have one life that is waaayyy too short! Give equal importance to studies but never get stressed out! Enjoy your school life! These years will never come back to you. You'll anyway have your fair share of stress when you reach adulthood...\\n\\n\r\nLike Arata said \"Enjoy this final year! Go have fun! Fall in love! Create more and more friends!!!'\\n\\n\r\nI give this show a 9/10.\\n\r\nWatch this show!!! It's highly recommended",

I've personally never seen something like that with my +160 watched animes) but\r\nthe plot itself isn't THAT great (it is however fairly entertaining). The fact that the main character is more mature than your typical high school protagonist found in high school / romance scenarios gives in my opiniona better feel to the anime. We're not block with the stereotypical character who is either dumb, shy or perverted.\\n\r\nThe anime is split in 3 acts (well not really acts). In each one the main character will try to help those around him thanks to his experience (act 1: help character 1 and 3, act 2: help character 2 and 3, act 3: help character 3 and 4, + the \"main\" story between the main character and character 1).\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack, graphics, animation:\\n\r\nAll 3 were ok but not outstanding (I liked the opening, which is rare for me).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNot the best characters (far from it actually). You can read them easily (the facts that it was gonna end like it did for the 2 main protagonists of ep12 was obvious + I personally understood the \"secret\" behind subject n.01 before the reveal).\\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere:\\n\r\nThe anime has both a happy / comic atmosphere and a more sad one (the life of the main character). They're going well with each other which result in an anime with an unordinary and appreciable vibe.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment:\\n\r\nReLIFE is very entertaining.\\n\r\nSure, it is not as funny as Baccano or as heartwarming as Spice and Wolf. And even if the main character is more mature, the maturity level of the story is FAAAAR from Evangelion.\\n\r\nDespite all of that, when rating something the overall enjoyment is more important than the plot or the characters and ReLIFE is a funny, and very entertaining anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(once again sorry if I made any mistakes, english isn't my primary language)",

            "content": "My oh my, I've just witnessed such a wonderful Anime that has been so well written and animated that I can't even begin to put it into words. ReLife is an Anime that came out on July 1st as a complete package of 13 episodes as opposed to it coming out on a weekly basis and that strategy worked out to its advantage. The story introduces us to Arata, a 27 year old who quit his recent job after just three months which leaves his future prospects in shambles as no one employs him because they think he's gutless. Though the reasons for his Resignationfrom his previous job , which are dark and traumatic, are later explored, it really puts the poor man in a tough spot. He loses confidence in his own skills and doesn't feel like socializing with anyone around him.\\n\\n\r\nThen one day, after getting a wake up call from his family who refuse to pay for his living expenses henceforth, he is approached by a stranger named Ryo who offers him another chance at life. He tells him that he will get one years worth of living expenses and a job at the end of it all is he agrees to be the Guinea pig for an experiment. The experiment for which Arata is supposed to be a test subject will turn him into a teenager and he must attend highschool once again so as to reinvigorate his emotions and push him back into reality. The whole thing is basically supposed to make him  change his ways as a NEET. Arata, after careful consideration of the prospects of a future job, decides to accept and so begins his ReLife.\\n\\n\r\nIn his school Arata comes across characters of all kinds and types. Whilst their character archetypes are pretty generic (the tsundere, the happy go lucky dude, the quiet reserved girl) the situations in which all of them are placed are pretty emotionally investing and I found myself hooked from the get go. The Intro to the Anime felt rushed but I was settled in soon after and from there I couldn't stop myself from watching as this story unfolded. This Anime opening theme, like most other openings that I've watched, resonated with me over time and I fell in love with it as the series progressed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found most enjoyable about the show was how realistic it was, apart from the whole experiment that turns you back into teen of course. During certain parts I felt like it was paralleling my life as it continued to spout truths about our everyday existence that I had pondered many times over and relived through countless years of surviving in this harsh reality. It even felt like the cast was talking directly to me at points which I found astounding. The character intermingling was wonderful and felt completely natural throughout. Rena's tsundere character was the main focus for most of the shows  run and a lot of the story revolved around how she felt and how Arata dealt with it. It was interesting to watch as I thought about what I myself would do in a situation like the many Arata faces and in addition it invoked emotions in me from across the spectrum of heartfelt feelings as I teared up more than once.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST to this Anime is beautiful as well, mostly composed of Jazz pieces and piano solos that brought life to many scenes in the Anime. The tensions between the characters would build up to their very peak and the OST would help bring them to that point and then, at the very climax, it'd bring them all to a resolution with a wonderful melody. Definitely one of my favourite OST from the recent Anime that I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery behind the ReLife experiment was greatly implemented throughout the shows run and the identity of test subject number 1 was kept secret until the most appropriate moment which filled me with utter bliss once I realized who it was and also that I was right about the speculation of their identity. There's a small hint in the opening theme about that which I figured out because Im a focused Nancy, but you'll have to divulge that information on your own if you're interested enough.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that was welcoming was how well developed almost every character from the main cast was. Each character had their own curve of progression and each characters personality was given due development. Some characters were obviously given more development than others but it didn't feel like any character ever overshadowed another. It usually becomes an issue for me when characters go unused in an Anime but that wasn't the case here at all. Each character came out different at the end of the story than they were at the beginning and I was thankful for that.\\n\\n\r\nHishiro and Onaya turned out to be two of my favourite girls from this years Anime releases and Hishiro was especially cute in many of her scenes. Her characters development was the most astounding in my opinion and I enjoyed every second of it! Onaya and Ryo along with Rena, Honoka and Oga made up a great supporting cast and their moments together was just very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI binged the entire show in 2 days and Im thankful to my friend Sebastian who recommended this Anime to me. It resonated with me on a very deep level and no series has been able to do that to me for a while so Im grateful that such a show exists. The end to the season left us on a bit of a cliffhanger I suppose and it sets up the premise for the second season nicely, if there's goanna be one. Here's to hoping they adapt it :D \\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this Anime from this summers line up (although I haven't seen the others yet.) Its got great romance, it does its job well for being an awesome spice of life with great comedic moments and drama and finally, it hits home like only romance Anime can. The feelings portrayed through the characters and the dialogue spoken between them is some of the best that I've seen in recent times if memory serves me fright and I was entertained throughout!\\n\\n\r\nYou wont be disappointed , I promise you!\\n",

            "content": "ReLife is an adaptation of the web-comic ReLife. After reading the manga for quite sometime now, it was rather difficult to keep my composure when the first official PV was released. I'd be lying if I said I was satisfied with the TMS Entertainment as the studio for this adaption. I have not seen any other anime by this studio and none of them really looked appealing to me. But damn was I wrong. TMS did an amazing job with this web-comic adaptation. Finally, lets get started with this review.\r\nIt all starts with a 27-year old who can not land a stable job right afterleaving one only after 3 months. Ever since then, Kaizaki, Arata would bomb every single interview gets into. Even after graduating from grad school, it seems Kaizaki will not budge. Ever since then he's been relying on his parents support to get him through these rough times. This sounds a little too relatable coming from someone who is also relying on their parents support for college. Anyone with a similar background would be able to sympathize with Kaizaki and understand how difficult the real world is out there. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was one of the many things that caught me off guard with this adaption. At first glance, I was not too satisfied with it to be honest. Comparing the web-comic art, this was kind of a downgrade in my opinion. But after binging the anime in one day (yeah sounds pathetic) I can see it suits the warm atmosphere in some scenes. It makes it rather appropriate to see with the right mood in. Although you can not always have what you want, but after the last episode, I was pleased with how pretty the animation turned out to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ReLife was extremely enjoyable for me. If you enjoy the Romance, Slice of Life, Comedy and Drama genre then you have come to the right neighborhood. This anime balances all those genres appropriately, not too much of any. I don't know if it is just me, but I feel like the year 2016 is lacking the \"Romance Slice of life\" anime so far. Since this anime was the only one of the kind that I enjoyed as well as an adaptation I looked forward to, ReLife has made its way my top 3 list. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "\"Someday we'll part. Maybe be forgotten. But we're living in the moment. So... make lots of friends, fall madly in love, and enjoy every moment to the fullest.\" - Arata Kaizaki.\r\nAt first glance  Relife feels a bit like every other school life anime but the standard high school humor is replaced by jokes about generation gap or Arata miserably. The main cast is also introduced and at first seems like perfect instances of traditional tropes. And that's when the brilliance of Relife arises.\r\nRelife simultaneously tells the story of a man who is desperately trying to put his life back on track and alsothe story of the younger people around him who are just entering adulthood. The show expresses how experience can easily help us to deal with the issues of our youth. Arata, being both caring and more experienced helps his classmates with their troubles. Simultaneously the hopes and dreams of his younger classmates rehabilitates his view of the world.\\n\\n\r\nAside from our main protagonist the show has a well rounded and likable cast. The ever failing Rena, kind hearted Kazuomi, sultry An, cool headed Ryo and the wonderfully shy and earnest Chizuru all start of as genuinely likable people and gradually peel off their many layers. While Relife does not have a very unique art direction, it consistently gives focus on it's characters facial expressions which helps the audience get into the headspace of the characters they are watching on screen.\\n\\n\r\nRelife aims to create a nostalgic atmosphere. Cemented by it's soundtrack. While it isn't the greatest it is sufficient to create the mood it's aiming for.\\n\\n\r\nIn a time where most shows tend to show off shallow relationships Relife aims to remind how great having strong relationships is exemplifying how the bonds we have can make us grow.... or how they can harm us. Relife refuses to gloss over dark subject matter related to becoming an adult but gives and optimistic way to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately in a character focused show, the viewer's enjoyment comes from how they can relate to the characters and the trials and tribulations they go through. At least for me I was able to relate to all the characters and even if you can't I hope that you can enjoy this show which truly managed to make me feel positive emotions when I was at my worst.",

            "content": "As an individual in his early twenty's ReLIFE serves as a good reminder of the little things I missed about being a teenager. When I was a teenager I took what I had for granted and I also have lots of regrets. When I was a teenager I honestly did not enjoy school and I was pretty much like the character Hishiro who would have trouble making friends and changing habits. The only thing I enjoyed was getting home so I can shut off. So after watching ReLIFE I went over my regrets about being that one guy who spent his days studying andbeing friendless but I learned a valuable lesson of enjoying what I have now and living life to the fullest by taking any opportunity given to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo you might think did ReLIFE upset me? No it just appealed to me as a viewer who is past his school days which has inspired me to do more as an adult. If you are some student in High school you might learn to cherish your youth more by watching this show. ReLIFE is one of those shows that is an example of anime not being for just young people as it more appeals to people past their teenage years. I was at first giving ReLIFE a seven or eight at first but gave it a nine after really liking the ending to the show which was game changer. \\n\\n\r\nSo ReLIFE is the story of our main character Arata who is struggling to find a job at the age of twenty eight because he quit his first job after three months. Society deems him as a half-neet so no one will hire him for work leaving him to eventually live with his parents in the country an idea he isn\u2019t too fond of unless he can get proper work somewhere.  After drinking a lot he meets Yoake who works at ReLIFE laboratory whose goal is to come up with a way to get someone un-neeted and ask Arata to participate in an experiment. The experiment in question involves using a drug to make Arata look like a high schooler and relive a senior year in high school which due to being drunk Arata agrees and wakes up realising Yoake was not joking. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story Arata gets involved with the problems of his classmates. As the story progresses Arata betters the life of the students while the same could be said about him. The story can sometimes feel a bit slow and a lot of the time it\u2019s a bit of laughs. The main thing to note is that series ends on high note that makes me wish for a season two in the near future.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series include a variety of trope characters which include the quiet girl (Hishiro), a tsundere (Rena), a dense dude (Oga), a transfer student (An), and the childhood friend trio Honoka, Akira and Asaji. The characters are in their last year of school and things come between them which can ruin their memories of high school and their friendships. Our MC Arata who will be forgotten by all of them after the experiment task himself on making sure their last year is a good one. \\n\\n\r\nArata does this by trying to act like the adult (because he is one) and uses his wisdom and experience to come up with a solution. While reflecting on his past experiences Arata comes at a cross roads with himself and has to overcome his problems if he is to solve those of others. Yoake is also similar to Arata as Yoake is trying to overcome his past problems by trying to make sure Arata's experiment is a success. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting of the student characters is Hishiro, Rena and Honoka who are central in the social problems between the students. Hishiro has never made a friend and is a loner who's troubles unravel slowly as the series progress as they learn how to make friends. Rena is a very stubborn character who can't say what is on their mind because they are afraid of what others think. Honoka is a character that only enjoys school for a single reason and without that reason she cannot enjoy life as a student.     \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is average but slightly colourful at times. The colours in question are usually bright blue green and orange which makes the series not appear entirely dull in the art department. Stuff like character movements can sometimes appear stiff but this is not an action anime so that is ok. There is not really much to say about character designs other than they are pretty standard for a slice of life anime set in school. Sometimes the animation does change however to make humorous moments seem more humorous. \\n\\n\r\nThere is not much background music to ReLIFE, the opening is decent however the ending theme does change every episode to some 90s or early 2000s track. I kind of like how this is done to reflect the age of Arata as he would be someone to listen to such music.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy ReLIFE and what messages it was trying to deliver. If you like the school drama series or a fan of series about growing up then ReLIFE may be for you.  \\n",

Though not your typical school animeit still retains the charms of everyday school life  making the end result a great anime that will make most school graduates reminiscing on there own school days",

            "content": "9 months. That is how long it took me to actually get back into anime. I couldn't tell you why, but it took me forever to actually find an anime that would peak my interest to an extent in which I would appreciate the genre like I did before. Come mid-January, I saw one of my favorite YouTube anime reviewers (BlackCriticGuy) do a review on this very series here. I wondered to myself whether it could be that show that pushed to get back into the wonderful world of anime.\r\nI'll tell you what. It was.\r\nI had an absolute blast watching this show, and seeing allof the characters in the series interact with each other on such an emotional and captivating level. I had so much fun with this series, that watching scenes from the series again and again is practically a hobby of mine. I'm heavily planning on reading the manga and whatnot, as well as delving even more into the story. It's March, and I still can't get over this series. I love it.\\n\\n\r\nHuge props to TMS Entertainment, who did the phenomenal animation to this series. The character designs, while a bit basic and simple, were very interesting in their own way. I personally enjoyed seeing a mix between the chibi style of animation (which was occasionally used for comedic effect) and the regular animation, which would add more light-hearted moments to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series was absolutely lovely. Though the plot is heavily character-centric, the story itself does have a very unique tone to it that I cannot deny was incredible. The arcs, which generally delved into each of the characters in the main friends group, were each fascinating and captivating. I personally enjoyed learning about Kaizaki's past the most out of each of the characters, for his past was quite dark and heart-wrenching. Those scenes really touched me, as well as hurt me too. They were quite emotional for the characters and the viewers alike. I also enjoyed the arc concerning Rena Kariu and her role on the volleyball team. However, that arc was a bit long, which did annoy me a bit.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering I'm talking so much about the characters, I guess I'll just start talking about them entirely. They were by far the best part of the series. I genuinely loved almost every character in the series (emphasis on almost), but I did have a few favorites. My personal favorite character in the entire series was easily Kaizaki Arata. I understand he's a generic main character who cares about each and every one of his friends and foes alike- I get that. But learning about him and what this poor man had to deal with before the ReLife experiment took over his life was absolutely awful to see. I really empathized with his character the most throughout anyone in the entire series. I also was a big fan of his love interest in the series, Hishiro Chizuru. I learned that a lot of people don't like her character, and though I do respect other people's opinions, I personally had so much fun learning about her as a person and how she ended up how she did. It was also really funny and cute to see her open up to people more. (Plus, the scenes in which she attempted to smile at people were really funny.) Finally, I would like to speak about Ryo Yoake, the man that gave Kaizaki the opportunity to work at ReLife in the first place. He was quite interesting, learning about why he chose Kaizaki to be his second experimental subject, and his relationship with another character (I would say, but that could possibly give away spoilers, just know that I find them to be cute together.)\\n\\n\r\nThough I had a blast with this series as a whole, a few problems did bother me throughout the series, which included a few characters, as well as a specific arc that I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\nDo you remember earlier when I stated that I liked ALMOST every character in the series? Well, I personally didn't like the friends of Honoka, Rena's teammate. I don't even remember their names, which should simplify just how forgettable they were in the series. I don't hate them, it's just that we know absolutely nothing about them.\\n\\n\r\nI also did not appreciate how long Rena's volleyball arc was. I didn't hate it, but it was an issue that did need addressing.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I had a blast with this series, and if you have not seen this series yet, do yourself a favor. Check it out. I got back into something that I had avoided for 9 months because of this series, so if you are a hardcore fan that has not checked this series out yet, watch it. You will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm so glad that this was the first series that I had watched in forever. The little amount of nitpicks that I found with the series were so minuscule and superfluous that they barely do anything to ruin it. In fact, they weren't even that bad looking back on it now. They were quite okay, it's just that they could've been done much better. So yeah. I loved it. I really wish to see another anime like this in the coming months, so if you have, please reply to me and let me know what it is. I need to know.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering that's all I have to say, I'm just going to end it here.\\n\\n\r\nLater!",

            "content": "Story:  Mostly a crap fest; good premise, absolutely no follow-through; neither in supporting the premise with some believability, nor with actually doing anything interesting with it.\r\nThis started out promising -- I can well imagine a down on his luck NEET taking the chance to go back to high school if that means he might end up with a decent job, and I could also see how one might use that premise to have him learn something to change his life's direction, so the job won't end up being the be-all and end-all of the experience.\r\nBut alas, that does not happen.  Instead the showquickly devolves into a typical, and not very inspired high school anime, with stock characters, and standard melodrama.  I think I fell victim to a bait-and-switch tactic.\\n\\n\r\nKaizaki actually has a reason for his NEETdom, and where this anime might not fail for a Japanese viewer, this is where it fails the most for me.  Japan still has an unbelievable crappy attitude towards bullying; while it now seems to recognize that it doesn't necessarily build character, and in this show the guilty parties are portrayed as solidly (and boringly) nasty, it still does not acknowledge it as something unrelentingly negative, and something for which neither the bullied nor anyone who speaks up for them bears any responsibility whatsoever.  Cultural relativism?  Get out of my face.  I hate bullying, and the Japanese propensity for it and its lousy excuses piss me off.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Nothing to write home about, mostly undistinguished characters.  The animation is actively bad in some parts.  The fireworks are pretty though, but when are they ever not.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Worst background music I've heard in a long time.  OP and EDs (the latter different for every episode) rather good; I got the impression they were trying to evoke a \"back in time\" feeling with them -- Porno Graffitti, Puffy, TM Revolution, L'Arc-en-Ciel -- if only the background music had been up to to the same standard.  Decent voice acting; my favourite being Yoake Ryou voiced by Kimura Ryouhei; Hatano Wataru is totally wasted on a throw-away character, and Namikawa Daisuke not fairing much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Kaizaki is supposed to be the hero of his story, but there isn't enough there there.  We find out why he quit his job, and that stands him in good stead, but beyond that?  Nada.  The most intriguing characters remain mysterious -- we never find out why Chizuru is in the position she is in, exactly what Yoake did wrong with Subject 001, how come Onoya works for ReLIFE.  The high school characters are stock and not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  It's mostly inoffensive, light-hearted escapism, but I enjoyed it less than I might otherwise have if it had lived up to its premise. It touches on some darkness, but quickly withdraws, as if it had touched a hot stove and learned its lesson.  It would have been vastly better if it had embraced that darkness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Thoroughly mediocre.\\n",

            "content": "Relife gives us a hikkikomori as the lead and has him take a pill which makes him live one year as a 17 year old. The starting episodes of the anime (episodes 1-6) are a real blast and there are a lot of literal laugh out loud moments as the main character Arata tries to fit into he new surroundings. The reason the first few episodes are such a blast is because there is no story progression in those episodes. The story in this anime is atrocious and the message given out is even worse.\r\nLets start from the beginning. If you had the chance torelive a year as a 17 year old, what would you do? Well if Relife is anything to go by, the best way to be \"born again\" and \"heal\" is by becoming a mangina \"Yes man\" and take all the crappy problems of your peers upon ourselves. Coz you know, nothing makes you a better person like sorting through teen angst and drama. Instead of really introspecting his life and growing as a person, Arata decides to help his classmates deal with banal, crappy everyday problems. He being a 27 year old in reality should mean he should be able to deal with problems no? Nope. He sucks. Now lets go to the romantic foil for Arata, Chizuru Hishiro. Good lord, can you have a more bland and boring character than this? She is essentially Sadako V2 (from Kimi no Todoke) with all the good qualities stripped out. Anything which made Sadako tragic and made you sympathize with her is removed and replaced with a banal \"I don't know how the world works, but I work real hard\" It boggles my mind how someone be he 17 years old, 27 years old, or even 60 years old can fall in love with someone who has zero and I mean zero character. The rest of the characters are what you would expect in similar anime. You have a handsome friendly guy, a tsundere, a dumb airheaded girl with big tits who is in a threesome with two of her classmates (I am not making this up I swear) All are average but the tsundere was cute. \\n\\n\r\nFinally lets get to the message of the anime. So here it is. If you see someone getting bullied/discriminated against, do not under any circumstances intervene. Coz you know, the people suffering will have a \"plan\" in their head and you standing up for them is akin to you ruining their \"grand master plan\" So don't do it. Watch them suffer in silence and let the bullies win. I swear I am not making this shit up. \\n\\n\r\nThe first six episodes are fun because the characters and world is still being introduced to us. Once we get to the \"story\" part, the anime goes downhill and never recovers. My recommendation is to avoid. \\n",

            "content": "OK, I'm gonna try make this as short and simple as can be without spoiling anything.\r\nStory (6) - Middle-aged man can't find job, man gets offered job, job involves going back to school again after taking a pill that makes him 'look' young, and I guess you could say the story evolves from there. The story was decent enough and if your really into romance and watching relationships evolve then I think you'll really enjoy this.\r\nArt (4) - Yea... this is kinda the downside of the series. The art wasn't unbearable, but when you compare it to other series of its age it feels abit outdated and slack.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) - Voice acting was decent, no real complaints tbh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6) - Alright, what really determines for me if I'm going to watch a 'typical' romance series is if I like the main character and most importantly if I like his/her love interest. This series ticked those two boxes and I could really feel myself rooting for these 2 character throughout the whole series. Other than them, I felt that the other 'side' characters were... ok I guess. Nothing really wrong with them but I felt they could really bore you when the series tried delve into them more than they should have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7) - I found this series a real treat to watch. I basically watched all of on the first two days of its release (because it released all of its episodes on one day for some reason). I think you'll really like this if your into typical slice of life/comedy/romance genres and I think you'll especially enjoy it if your a more mature viewer. This is because the MC is an adult himself and the certain struggles he faces may be more identifiable on an adults level.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6) - Overall this was a decent anime series, it was nothing too bad and I don't think it'll become one of your favourites either. This was just a typical school/romance anime that I think fans of the genre will enjoy.",

            "content": "About a year ago I started getting into reading manga, and one of the first ones I picked up was ReLIFE. I liked it so much that binge-read the whole thing one weekend, and since then I have been impatiently waiting for a new chapter of it every week. Even though I have read many more manga since then, many of them better than ReLIFE, I was still very happy, when I heard that it was getting an anime adaptation, while also afraid they were going to ruin it. Well then read on and see how it worked out.\r\nLet me introduce to you Arata, 27years old, no girlfriend, no serious job, no prospects for the future,\u2026To sum it all up he is a neet. One day going home from a bar, where he was with his friends pretending to be successful, he is approached by Ryou Yoake, from the ReLIFE Institute, who offers Arata the possibility of making him young and sending him to high-school again, where he would gain the experience, that would turn him into a functional adult. He agrees and the next day he wakes up as a 17 year old. And so begins his new life as a high-school student.\\n\\n\r\nOk, first of all the the whole premise of ReLIFE while interesting, is not exactly anything special. The problem with this kind of setup is that there are so many different routes it could take and places it could go wrong, however fortunately for us it avoids all the perils it could encounter. It manages to create a captivating story, based one incredibly likeable characters (more on them in the next paragraph), based around more or less cliche school situations. \\n\r\nAs the anime is based around a still ongoing web manga, the main questions for the manga readers were, how faithful of an adaptation was it going to be, and how is it going to end. Well, in my honest opinion this is the best manga adaptation I have seen. There have been no important parts skipped, neither have then been any changes made to the story and this is even more surprising, given the fact that it covers more then a 100 chapters in its 13 episodes, which is impressive by itself. Regarding the ending, it is done exceptionally well, choosing a great moment in the story, that makes the story seem complete, while still urging people on to read the manga, or wait for another season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the high points of the anime has to be its characters. Arata, our main character, could be thought as just another generic hero, as he is generally an all-round good guy, however the as the story progresses, he slowly evolves into one of the best developed characters of the genre. His backstory is also quite interesting and it really does explain why he got in the position he is in now. Only one good character is still not enough to make an anime, and fortunately the others are just as good, if not better. The highlight has to be Hishiro-san, an extremely hardworking and smart student, but with a total lack of any social skills. That in turn results in some extremely fun moments, which are still a step above similar events in your typical school comedy anime. Later on we actually get some great insight in her backstory as well, which might as well be one of the highlights of the anime. Then we have the two ReLIFE operatives, who are definitely a lot of fun, always teasing Arata, giving him a hard time, but at the same time helping him become a better person. As if all these characters were not enough, we also have Oogga and Kairu, the first classmates that Arata befriends, both integral to the story. There is also a whole bunch of side characters, but they do not really stand out. To sum it up the characters are great, well developed and a whole lot of fun. \\n\\n\r\nGiven that the manga or to be more precise webtoon is done in full colour, it leaves little to interpretation. Thankfully the art is taken directly from the source material, so the colour pop, the characters are distinctive, so it is easy to know who is who and the backgrounds are nicely drawn. If you have already been reading the manga, seeing the exact same scenes, but now animated, it just takes the story another level. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is probably the weakest point of the anime. It is never better then adequate, while it sometimes even manages to totally miss on some parts, as the sound does not work well with whats going on the screen. The opening and endings on the other hand are great. That is even more surprising, given the fact that every episode has a different ending, and I can\u2019t remember one that would be bad.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I prefer reading manga to watching anime, but given the enjoyment I got from watch this anime, I have actually questioning that, and started thinking that the problem might be just in an unfaithful adaptation. Not to say the manga is worse, just a bit different, and more in depth, however, I have to say that in my opinion watching the anime, and then just reading the manga from where the anime ended should be a valid option here. Given all that has been said this anime deserves a score of 9 out of 10, and so I can easily recommend this to everyone.",

            "content": "!!! I am going to tell you right away, if you are looking for a show with a satisfying* ending, then this show is not for you. {*- our opinions on satisfying may differ so watch it anyway, it's great} !!!\r\nI started watching reLIFE because one of my friends recommended it to me when I was looking for a great Slice of Life/Romance show. After reading the description I was a bit skeptical, it sounded like Matrix in a way and I was never a big fan of Sci-Fi. Well, I was worried for nothing, it's mostly School anime. So let's go over some aspectsof it:\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10): Comedy and Romance parts were very well done, nevertheless as I said earlier I was never a big fan of Sci-Fi, but that little amount of it that was in the show was keeping me watching it. But the show has never expanded on it, and when it ended I personally was dissatisfied, but the questions the show raises are quite interesting and I will definitely discuss them with my friends. I will highlight just one so you can think on the answer what would you do:\\n\\n\r\n\"Do you sit out of the others business or get involved with it?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (8/10): Honestly don't have much to say, but I would love to highlight music since piano backgrounds really add to the mood and the art was very pleasing to my eyes. Also every outro has a different song so check that out too\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): This is where the show excels. It has presented me with the MOST SUPPORTIVE LEAD EVER! I really didn't see that much of a change in Arata because all the change has seemed to happen before the events, BUT he has changed every other character around him. So even if you initially assume that this is a show about him, then I have to inform you that it is not. I loved this part though , when I came to this realization I have felt like reaching nirvana. I hope you love it too. And yes, almost all background characters are your usual archetypes, I think you have to just get used to that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (x/10): I have enjoyed the show and writing this review, but I honestly feel like this part of the review is useless since I am not in the position to tell you that. But if I had t, then \\n\\n\r\nx=10\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Nice show, has you involved every minute and most importantly gives you something to think about. Let's hope there will be a season 2 or at least an OVA.\\n\\n\r\n(14:31)__12.30.2016 \\n\r\nHave fun,\\n\r\nYour buddy Alex<3",

            "content": "My review for ReLife without spoilers.\r\nBefore i start i want to let everyone know that i'll write this review with honesty.\r\n\u2022 Story/Plot rate (10): \r\nThe story was magnificent and unique! The episodes were following a perfect order and they were very clear and not confusing at all. I truly enjoyed the story and it was perfectly fitting with the gender of ReLife, i am satisfied with what i watched even though it was a bit predictable. What i enjoyed mostly about the plot it's  that it had sources from human's daily life, what do i mean by that? Everything that happens during a highschool year can be seen in the anime. Drama, love, hate, jealousy any much more and this made the anime even better for me. As about the plot holes they weren't many to worry about. Anime is still enjoyable and satisfying to watch^^\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art (10):\\n\r\nI must admit that the studio made great job to create amazing backgrounds for the anime. Unique and memorable art such as the character reactions, the places etc. The director with his art could easily give you the emotions of the characters without making you wonder what do they actually feel, it was pretty clear. The characters were perfectly fitting to their designs and to their personalities as well and they were all different.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound(9):\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an outstanding job for me to fit perfectly to the characters. It was such a pleasure! The background music were fitting with the scenes but sometimes they were using it too much which i found unnecessary but not bothering.  The opening was decently fine, as about the ending the director was showing the credits using amazing drawings which i really enjoyed to watch. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character rate (10): \\n\r\nThe characters were just excellent. They weren't extremely smart or stupid but they were unique of a kind. I believe, this is the strongest and the best part of ReLife. The characters were incredibly realistic and that truly amazed me. They make me feel that i was a part of them.. like.. i was back to high school. However the main character was easily spotted and had a lot of difference than the other characters but the anime is perfectly directed so you'll believe that any other character is a main one as well. I can't really tell that they were some characters which i didn't like. I believe that the director didn't had any intentions for us, the audience, to dislike any of those characters. And yes i will remember them in the future. I can't really believe that this anime can teach you things about real life. I am just amazed. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment rate (10):\\n\r\nSince the anime made me believe that i was a part of it and gave me a lot of nostalgia my enjoyment rate will be 10. Since i already recommend it to a friend who is not an anime fan and he watched the anime and he enjoyed it a lot i'll feel free to recommend this one to more people, it deserves it. Surely i'll rewatch ReLife at sometime of my life but until then i'll keep what i saw in my heart and in my mind :) \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall (10)\\n\r\nTo sum up, the anime was extraordinary. That's the reason i'll give it a 10 out of 10. I'll recommend this anime to people who are more than 25 years old to experience the nostalgia of high school. Thank you ReLife for the 13 episodes i can't wait for season 2! \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!",

            "content": "With two decades of tomfoolery under my belt, I will tell you that the older you get, the more decisions you'll have to make, with increasing consequences for whatever your decision may be. Many times, you just want to hit rewind and have a redo for multiple situations. And even knowing that will never happen, you will still find yourself dreaming about taking a different path and end up playing out the scenario in your head. (I'm sure everyone has done this, regardless of age, but it just becomes more agitating when you screw up on something major). ReLIFE is basically this exact concept andsoo much more. \\n\\n\r\nThink of any slice of life or romcom anime. It is a fact that the mc in a majority of these anime are absolute idiots. They are either dumb and dense, or super intelligent and dense. The plus side to having an mc like this is purely for plot depth. Seriously, try writing a small scene with the mc talking to a girl and being able to pick up on all the subtle body language and sentence phrasing. Then have the mc plan his next dialogue based on everything he's gathered from the girl. It's extremely hard because it involves thinking from so many angles. Whereas, if the mc lets everything fly over his head, there's intrigue that can be played on and a lot of comedy that can be explored. \\n\\n\r\nKaizaki Arata is the lead character in ReLIFE; he is a jobless 27 year old that gets a chance to redo his third year in high school (Japanese equivalent of senior year if I'm not mistaken). There's a reason why it's 10 years ago, but explaining is somewhat spoiler territory. Instead let me say how good Kaizaki is socially. First and foremost, he's an absolute nightmare academically, but he's got ten extra years of social skills on his classmates. Therefore, he picks up on the mood of a place and the nature of other characters way quicker than anyone else. With that ability, he aims to better the lives of his classmates via helping solve some of the problems that the characters are going through. His charm comes from the fact that he is able to see things that an average high school guy completely overlooks. What's more is that Kaizaki falls for the one girl that is the complete opposite of who he is. \\n\\n\r\nAnother quality trait of ReLIFE is how down to earth the plot is. If you ignore the sci-fi of an anti-aging pill, the entire plot can actually happen in real life. Too many anime play on the \"my parents died and I'm trying to cope with it\" just to have a tear jerk moment at the end. Honestly, it's pitiful and embarrassing to watch. I may be the only one in this boat, but it's such a letdown when an otherwise good anime throws nonsense like that into the plot. By the way, the only anime that plays the \"I have a sad life\" to a sufficiently hilarious and moving extent is Angel Beats only because all the characters are dead starting in episode one (no, that wasn't a spoiler). In ReLIFE, all the characters are very likable and have a unique trait that sets them apart. Granted they are all the stereotypical high school attitudes, it's still refreshing to see it cast in a new light. When Kaizaki attempts to help his classmates, he isn't helping them cope with loss; instead, it's the more realistic feelings of jealousy, hate, love, and anger. Such simple emotions are dealt with such precision that it isn't dry or boring. It leaves a sense of satisfaction after watching him solve a problem. Along with the realistic plot, the comedy of ReLIFE is not flamboyant but rather subtle and witty, being placed at calculated times. In fact, a lot of the more memorable jokes tend to play on the dramatic irony of the audience knowing the true age of Kaizaki. I won't ruin the jokes, but suffice to say that it won't have you bursting in laughter, but it will leave you with a wide grin and a few chuckles. Normally, this isn't what you want with comedy, but there are SO MANY tiny details that cause you to smile that it has the same effect as boisterous laughter. This may also just be me; I may have a slight immunity to burst out into laughter from watching a lot of stand up comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of ReLIFE is nothing special.... which is exactly why it's sooo good. Throughout the entire show, there is a mood of maturity. This in itself is contradictory to the fact that the show takes place in a high school. With this sense of maturity, the straightforward artistic style creates an added depth of a little more sophistication. If you've watched Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, you'll get what I mean because the art is very similar. \\n\\n\r\nThe music of ReLIFE is probably the only gripe I have with the show. I won't say that I'm an expert in music, but I will say that I trust my ear for music more than others. This show has a very clear vision of the type of impression it wants to leave in the viewer, and I fully understand the reason for why the background score is the way it is. I just don't think, it was executed well. There is a heavy piano overlay for suspenseful scenes, which is totally understandable, but that same arpeggiation is used in comic relief as well as for the general plot. I may be overthinking it, but if and when you end up watching it, you'll get what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, ReLIFE is an excellent anime that I highly recommend. The dumb and sensible character that is Kaizaki Arata is not only relatable but very lovable. Please leave comments below on what you thought of the show if you've already watched it. I'd love to hear your views. \\n\\n\r\nBTW:  If you're interested in a show with an mc that is super intelligent and sensible, I recommend Oregairu. It's also a high school romcom, but way deep and well thought out!",

            "content": "ReLife is a comedy-drama focused on a NEET young man named Arata Kanzaki who participates in a one-year experimental project where he is regressed into the form of a teenager via taking a mysterious medication and re-experiences life as a high school student, as a means for him to repair whatever personal defects prevent him from being a productive member of society. While under the project, Arata puts up with the behavior of his supervisor Ryo Yoake, tends to some of the personal problems affecting his classmates, and reflects on the personal problems of his past that led him into becoming a NEET.\r\nReLife strikes upa solid balance of light comedy and drama in exploring everyday life as a high school student and the personal problems that affect Arata and several of the high school students he comes to befriend during his participation in the ReLife project. The students that Arata encounters go through the typical pressures that teenagers face growing up such as struggling to make friends, jealousy between rivals, and first love. The series is also not afraid to tackle some darker territory when Arata's backstory is focused on that elaborates on how he became a NEET and it offers a rather painfully believable look at life within a former employer he worked with that he is still recovering from. While the comedy for the series can be a hit or miss relying on the typical goofing off from teenagers and bemused expressions made by characters in response to specific situations, the strong focus on the developments of the characters and their personal problems more than make up for the shortcoming. It also offers up a surprising twist on exploring who the first volunteer for the ReLife experiment is within the high school, yet makes sense when considering the particular character's personal problems. The series ends inconclusively with Arata still in the middle of participation in the ReLife experiment, but the series is supposed to be getting a sequel OVA series starting early next year that is supposed to be tying up loose ends with the show's storyline.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to presentation, ReLife is less than extraordinary. The show's visuals have solid character designs sporting a decent amount of detail, though animation shortcuts are a frequent occurrence throughout its run and especially become apparent during its later episodes. Its soundtrack relies heavily on piano pieces to convey its light and heavy dramatic scenes. The effectiveness of this is hit-or-miss as I found it effective during the show's more mundane moments yet not so much during its more heavier dramatic moments, especially in the case of Arata's backstory).\\n\\n\r\nWhile having some hiccups with its presentation, ReLife is still one of the better 2016 anime titles I got to see thanks to its effective mix of comedy and drama in exploring the typical developments of growth faced by teenagers and Arata having the opportunity to relive them through his current experiences in the ReLife program. It's a definite recommendation if you enjoy anime that are a bit more mundane with their storytelling, in light of this show's setup leading to it for our male lead.",

This show is genuinely funny which is hard to come by  in the current years when talking about romance/drama animes.\\n\\n\r\n ReLIFE's last episode was very well colored and the music was on point during the climax scenes making for a well rounded last episode.\\n\\n\r\n Character wise, there are only a few that stood out from the pack for me making for a very slim cast of memorable characters. Character development also felt very slow, which would be good if the anime was 24 episodes, but it's only 13 episodes long. With that said, the character development fails to build up fast enough to keep up with the generally short show, so it feels rushed by the end.\\n\\n\r\n There are tidbits of drama sprinkled in that are written in a way that makes them forgettable, so when the actual drama that was hinted at shows up, you get blindsided almost, making for a story that leaves something to be desired. When an anime is tagged as a romance, you would expect there to be more to do with that tag and not completely forget about it until the last 2-3 episodes. Sure there was the typical \"she likes him but he doesn't know\" trope at the VERY beginning, but then the romance just drops off until the end of the show, which makes that aspect not very impactful. Very generic setting. (Highschool). \\n\\n\r\nThe writing of ReLIFE is supposed to be suited towards maturing audiences, but constantly reminds you that \"this guy is 27 not 17\" over and over again. If this is a Seinen, then I'm sure the watchers wont forget it that quick.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style/animation are average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall just an average show. With the few likable characters it had to offer and the comedy that made me laugh for a very good portion of the show, it has very apparent pacing, character, and writing problems that make it a show to watch only when you have nothing else.",

            "content": "* Man if you got regrets in your life, this will be a hell of a trip for you!!*\r\nMan this one is touching a pretty interesting topic. Regrets and also some pretty simple yet valuable life lessons.Thus is the story and point of ReLife. There is actually a small plot and 1 expected twist. What is admirable is that while the twist is expected the anime does a great Job confusing you and  overshadowing with other events while directing your attention elsewhere.Also ofc there is some comedy attempts and it isn't a plain SoL-Rom and the school setting isn't cringe or cancerous. Actually apretty REASONABLE and REALISTIC environment!! Also the romance was there. Maybe not as you wanted but you can't say its non existent. Obviously, it had its comedic moments which were rather refreshing,calming,natural and hilarious.\\n\r\nSounds are pretty good. The op perfectly depicts the situation while presenting the upcoming events and characters . There are many different ED for each episode because each ED sway its own emotion.That gets bonus points for its dedication and sheer amount of work put on the show!\\n\r\nArt is really good, with its details and fitted its mood. When it was headed a comical way the art was around the same and back to serious when it needed. It was relaxing and calming. Nothing really unique but exactly what one man needed.Meaning it fitted and there was zero annoyance from it. I would say that it made you feel more open.\\n\r\nThe characters were equally good with the art. Wasn't something unique but there was also nothing felt wrong. Their reactions and interactions were normal. Nothing unique or felt like an impulse.Not to forget how easily you could understand what motivated each character and their action since it was so nicely presented.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------Personal opinion an weaknesses------------------------------\\n\r\nKinda overuse of the age irony and while some times its hilarious after some time its just common. Tho it ain't a comedy so im not gonna condemn its attempt to insert some.\\n\r\nThe feeling of somethings missing. Time skipping. What happened to some events!\\n\r\nWell its pretty simple and unless you are really nitpicky there isn't much to trouble one man. The only worth mentioning problem would be its season 2 Baiting or manga baiting. Unfulfilled ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a pretty relaxing and calming anime with its quoting about life through our MC's experience.Tho it baited for a 2nd season and if there isn't one that's bad since its story is still going!4 hours relaxing spent. Would recommend to someone who liked com-roms.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Its a story about one's self, regrets and how to change.\\n\r\n-Romance motivate's you watch more. NOt so boring. School setting not full of cringe !\\n",

            "content": "Every episode im on the edge of my seat grinning all the way through the episodes wondering can this anime get any better, and the answer to that is yes it can. First the writing in this anime is top notch especially since this is a Rom com, but i think in my opinion, and you can quote me on this later, but this is the best school romance comedy i have EVER seen before all the way. The relationships in here were some of the best, and i have seen over 50 different romance anime's. This is one of those anime's that keep youwanting more, so a season 2 would make me feel like its Christmas. So finally i give this anime a 8 out of 10 because they had a perfect chance to have the 2 MCs kiss, but didn't probably because there might be a second season, but that would be in like a year or 2 if they even do one more at all so that is the first reason. The last reason is that during the season the red haired girl was getting mad, and ignoring people for no reason, and that distracted me from watching, or paying attention to the rest of the anime, or to put it in a bad way the red haired was being a total BITCH until the end. So this anime is definitely one of my favorites for ever now.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR I fully reccomend this series to whoever is out of high school and sometimes misses those times of his life.\r\nAs a pretty casual anime fan, ever since I left high school and later found myself in the \"real world\", I more often than not end up finding many series immature, clich\u00e9d or dumb. For this reason, I generally give up on those series. After having seeing too many high school romcoms, weather I was searching for a guilty pleasure or simply following reccommandations, it feels like they always revolve around the same plot points, they follow pretty standard timelines and, more irritating than anything,they always treat the audience as japanese high school student. \\n\\n\r\nThis last point is probably nothing wrong itself, considering that theyr are aiming at such an audience, but as a west-born-non-high-school-student (or even western high school students), I already reached a certain level of maturity that would make me wanna skip certain plot points and focus on others.\\n\\n\r\nReLife, in this sense, is a great experience. The series is 100% self aware, it has a more mature vision of high school romcom, and in my opinion, it's trying to communicate a message and it should be seen as a different kind of series than usual.\\n\\n\r\nFrom now on the review may contain spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nTo me this series, is more of a \"memory therapy\" that allows the viewer to travel back in time with the main character and enjoy the happy time of high school once again. I have seen people arguing that the story is clich\u00e9d and predictable, the characters are tropes copypastas and that the anime in general is not that interesting. I believe there is a reason for it to be this way and I'll bring it up later. First I'll comment about few things:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was cool, I don't know too much, but there wasn't any moment so bad it stood out, so a 7 is fair imo. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the sound of the series, I'm not an expert in voice acting, so no comment on that, but the music was great. It reminded me a lot of Durarara!, from the OP to the soundtrack in general (like that jazzy piano that sometimes does not fit the situation at all), it was good. The series sounds more mature than it looks, which is amazing when they want to convey certain messages in scenes. Like I can rememeber few \"romantic\" scenes, in which the music playing was totally out of mood, which reinforces the idea that a high schooler might get excited, but you know what's happening and it's no big deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were cool in my opinion, nothing too relevant, the main character was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyement was really what drove the series forward. The comedy is on point,  I hardly laugh at anime comedy, but this series had be cracking a couple of times.\\n\r\nIt seeems that thsi series really appeals to the older high school romcom viewer: often I was expecting certain scenes to move in a certain way, only to take a more logical path. The characters are all written in such a way tha their personality will end up solving all the conflicts. The story is directed in such a way that there are no real stakes to the actions. It's all fabricated to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the point of watching such a series then?\\n\r\nReLife, to me, was like going on vacation to some fancy sea side locality: The beaches are all cured, the hotel is perfect, the whole experience is fabricated to perfection such that you will enjoy, relax and have fun. Everybody is stressed for \"real world problems\" as much as everyone else, everyone needs a break from it to look back at the past and remember the good old days. Enjoying this series is exactly what it's meant for and to me, it does a great job at it. It's no 9 or 10, but it's a sure 8 for me.",

            "content": "ARE YOU READY to hear my ONLY negative comment about this whole anime? There's this one backtrack that plays during serious scenes that's totally wrong for the mood of those scenes, and I don't like it. That's it.\r\nBecause everything else about this anime was tops. Story? Honestly? One the best I've ever seen in anime. I'm normally the type to settle for an average story as long as the  characters are amazing, but this anime really made me rethink that philosophy. To begin with, the overall premise of getting to relive your high school days is brilliant. There was a solid foundation going in,but the subjects this anime explores make it so, so good. It's a good message, I think, for people in their twenties because it resonates with those emotions very well. The way this anime handles loneliness, failure, and self-confidence is absolutely phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, like I said, you don't give me good characters, and I won't be able to get into it. Thankfully, ReLIFE gave me the full package. Do you know how difficult it is to find a set of characters in a work of fiction that you love completely? Harder than it seems. There's always that *one* character that you wish wasn't there. ReLIFE, though... I can't think of a single character that fits that description. Their conflicts were presented in such a way that, as a viewer, I didn't get bored, and I didn't get annoyed. I guess another way to say that is that the conflict in this anime held weight, but they didn't weigh down the characters' wonderful personalities. \\n\\n\r\nI will tell you that the plot-twist isn't really treated as a huge plot-twist... and it's a bit predictable. HOWEVER, as I said, that twist isn't a big part of the overall story of this particular season, so I was still able to enjoy it to the fullest. This anime may make it onto my favorites list, so I have nothing but high praise and recommendations for you to watch it. It's got a little of everything, and it's one the funniest anime I've ever seen. Off to finish the series I go!",

This anime made me recognize some events within my past and what I can do to better myself to prevent them.  I am glad I watched this anime.\r\nThe first season's pacing is way better then the OVA. The OVA tries to fit 110 + chapters in four episodes of the manga while the pacing for the first season is not rushed.  I was able to see myself inside this anime and wonder what would have happened if I chose to Re Life?  Also, Ilike how the character's are diffrent and feel alive.  For example, Ryou seemed mysterious yet questionable while Kaizaki seemed wholesome and noble.  Kaizaki's friend's went through hardships such as jealousy, bullying, or family issues that is very common in today's society.  I would definitely recommend this anime.",

The show quickly became my favorite this year (we are in August) and one of my favorites anime of all time.\r\nIf you are a fan of shows like Toradora, Yahari Seishun and Kokoro Connect, you're gonna love ReLife, since it's a rommantic comedy with realistic characters and of a lot of psychology mixed in it.\r\nI would say it's not as complex and deep as Yahari, but it doesn't need to be, the plot is still very enjoyable and creative. The charactersare all wonderful. It's one those anime that you wish you were there, hanging out with everyone in the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're around 30 years old, you're gonna enjoy it even more because there's A LOT to releate with the main character (at least that's what I felt). Even the ending credits... All episodes have a different song as ending, and they're all songs that the main character would be listening as a high schooler in the late 90's and early 2000's. And yeah, several of the songs and bands the main characters used to listen were also things I used to listen back in days. That was REALLY freakin' cool (though, this will only impact you if you used to listen Japanese music back in those days lol).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, excellent show, great characters, nice sound track.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is one of those anime you're gonna make you fell nostalgic right after the last episode, even if you watch everything in one afternoon like I did. Hell, at least we still have the manga to follow.",

            "content": "Even though ReLIFE is yet another high-school-set story of rather not-so-impactful-to-life moments and problems that our characters deal with, unlike others, it stays relatively glued to the ground in nearly all aspects (well, aside from the pill that magically makes you look ten years younger, duh), and never hangs on to a single problem for too long, nudging us to basically think the same thing we thought after all of us left high school: yap, everyone was right. High school doesn't really matter. \r\nHowever, as it's rather easy to forget, everyone's problems top the charts in their own lives, as it's simply basic human nature,and we see ReLIFE play off of that rather well. Whether it's using one of its rather interesting characters or the rather depressing notion of \"whatever I do for the next year quite literally doesn't matter because nobody will remember me\", the anime manages to shift itself away from the run-of-the-mill high school stories that are entirely focused on the main couple battling through twelve episodes of awkwardness to finally be able to properly communicate their feelings (well, you know, mostly at least). \\n\\n\r\nAs it's the case with most slice-of-life romances set in high school, story's its weakest part, but not that terrible actually. The premise plays off of many people's fantasies, as our lives most-likely turned out to be far different than what we'd imagined in high school, so we often think about what'd we do different if we had a chance to do it again. It shows that fantasy, in a rather detailed way, and as such prompts us to think what would WE do different if we were put in Arata's shoes. It's rather simple method, but quite effective nonetheless, to engage your audiences. Other than that though, it's just everyday presentation of high school life, as seen in nearly all shows of similar nature. Pick a character, find out their inner instability, go through the painful process of \"fixing it\", and move on to the next. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the formula, but most of the anime I've watched that followed it fell flat because they hung on to a single story for far too long. Although, to a certain extent at least, ReLIFE does the same, it manages to avoid the trap by having quite short, sporadic moments of drama that liven up the show, making sure they never overstay their welcome. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a success, really, when I don't skip a single scene in your anime, despite having watched several of these problems be presented in other series, so props. Still, however much praise I can give, it really is just another high school romance-like story. There's absolutely nothing different outside of the main character actually being an adult. But, even if you're tired of them, give ReLIFE a shot if that's your problem with the series. It might surprise you. \\n\\n\r\nProduction is what'd you'd expect from high school romances. Colorful, modern and crisp, with oftentimes dull animations due to budget. Comedic scenes were animated well, and the usage of chibi faces didn't really break the immersion that much, as they don't stay for too long. Character designs were directly copied from the comic, so if you liked them there, you'll like them here too.\\n\r\nSoundtrack, albeit a little dull, didn't hold the show back. It wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but it did well enough to support the scenes it was accompanying it, never dragging the scene down or completely taking over it. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough most characters start off as cliches, I'm happy to report that ReLIFe actually has development. One of the greatest issues I have with high school romances in anime is how one dimensional characters are, from start to finish. They oftentimes display a single trait, and that trait alone is what defines them. ReLIFE's characters grow alongside the show. Ones that have built defensive walls slowly start letting people in, dense f***ers we've grown to hate in these shows actually undense themselves (I'm applying 'undense' to be accepted as a valid word - it has to be), but there's one single issue I have with this show: Arata. Although he's basically just meant to be someone we can project onto and put our shoes in (I nearly wrote d*ck there, the hell's wrong with me), for a supposed main character he doesn't get developed that much, really. It's not all bad, because he actually DOES get development (this might've been the thing that surprised me the most about the show), and I suspect if there's 2nd season, he'll actually finally become the main character in all meanings of that word. \\n\\n\r\nAside from him, nearly all characters have something interesting to bring to the table, smiles accompanied by their own issues that they're trying to sort, their own ideas and dreams, and it's ... well, nice, actually. It's nice to finally see a show where the author recognizes that even single-trait-defined characters can have their own opinions and thoughts. Refreshing even. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, ReLIFE definitely has its problems - mostly from the genre it's tackling and the fact that, again, the story's set in high school, making most of the problems these kids are dealing with kind of moot (well, outside of two characters, which kind of makes up for it) - but it's a show can I still recommend. It's really an easy watch, as it doesn't have overdrawn melodramatic scenes that try to take a shot at your heart with all their might not realizing they never earned that right (call me the wickedest MC, 'cause I can't afford to buy VC), and it really did have me laughing more than a few times. \\n\\n\r\nIts greatest strength, though, is definitely that it plays off of our fantasy of youth, of the simple question: \"What could have been?\". It has us looking back at the decisions we made, friends we've hurt, loves we didn't act upon, and all the things we'd do differently now that we know more about ourselves, others and the world itself. \\n\\n\r\nRecommend: yes - just don't expect to have your mind blown, because it's not that type of a show (today I'm just a strap-on, but tomorrow I'll rap-on; ok, I'll stop. Bye. Sorry)",

            "content": "ReLife was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise hectic season.\r\n     I\u2019m a little ashamed to admit that, at first, I didn\u2019t really give ReLife much thought. But after they aired the whole thing in a single afternoon \u2014which was a great choice\u2014 I decided to check it out. This turned out to be one of the better decisions I\u2019ve made recently. \r\n     ReLife is a joy to experience; quirky, fun, sometimes predictable, but almost every episode left me smiling. Before I say more about what it is, its important to clarify what it isn\u2019t; ReLifeis not a \u201cIf you could fix your high school mistakes\u201d show, and although Arata, the MC, definitely has some regrets about his early life, they play second (or third) fiddle to him fixing, and finding happiness in his current situation. Put another way, instead of bemoaning the past, ReLife takes an optimistic look at the present; by going back to high school, Arata meets new people, forges friendships, and gains a new leash on the life he already has.\\n\\n\r\n     Part of the reason I found this show so refreshing is that Arata, a 28 year old man, brings a more mature, adult perspective to what is normally a \u201cteen-scene\u201d. His insight and wisecracks are usually well played and the humor he brings to the table is nothing short of hilarious. The other characters are fairly well done; quirky and distinct enough to be unique while still being realistic, and the way they interact with each other is never boring to watch.\\n\r\n     As for the animation, I\u2019ll say it did the show justice; ReLife didn\u2019t need a bunch of flashy animation to start with, but they maintain a constant quality that puts it a cut above average. The soundtrack doesn\u2019t really stand out, but the endings deserve special attention as they chose a different song for each one, ranging from what I assume are classics to more recent pop hits. Kind of similar to what guardians of the galaxy did with their music selection, they chose songs that the main character would listen to in his spare time, and it augments the mood splendidly.\\n\\n\r\nI could watch this show all day, and though this may sound rather trite and boring, I can honestly say my biggest problem with the show is that there wasn\u2019t more of it.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the rub,\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n- Fresh take on a tired topic (high school)\\n\r\n- Humor is well played and genuinely funny\\n\r\n- Characters are unique, but not absurd\\n\r\n- There\u2019s drama, not melodrama\\n\r\n- Ann is downright adorable\\n\r\n- Truly an enjoyable show\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- \u201cRomance\u201d could have been more fulfilling\\n\r\n- Can be predictable at times\\n\r\n- Only (13) episodes\\n\\n\r\nThe Ecchi:\\n\r\n- Many opportunities for it, but surprisingly little.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, ReLIFE, where do I start?\r\nI'm not much of a binge watcher, but every once in a while there's a show I just can't help but watch it all in a really short time. ReLIFE was one of those shows. -an experience I'd recommend to anybody. \r\nSo here's a quick review, just my overall thoughts mashed together in one place:\r\nStory:\r\nFailed adult takes pill that turns him back to highschooler. When you see that premise, you probably think it sounds interesting but could possibly go wrong/boring. And let me tell you, it does not. The story is great, the pace is great and the twists, while(at least in my case) pretty easy to predict, are still really impactful and strong, most of the time giving you a completely different look on the characters you thought you knew. The anime ranges from very funny and lighthearted to dealing with serious problems like suicide, NEETs and various everyday struggles.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\r\nWhile the art isn't anything to write home about, it does have its charm. Same thing with the animation. They certainly do surprise you with for example a realistic looking sunset or far-away shot at the city. The characters, while looking fairly generic in the design department, look pretty good and the transitions from regular to chibi comedy characters don't feel forced. Also, different stylistic animation choices really give a refreshing feeling to the anime despite it looking a bit outdated.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe music is, in my opinion, the most memorable part of the show. The OP is catchy (PENGUIN RESEARCH, didn't hear those guys since DRRR!! x2 Ketsu and they still sound awesome), the OST pretty memorable for a slice of life, but the real treat are the EDs, which are mostly late '90s and early 2000s rock songs which will give you that warm feeling of nostalgia. Those songs, combined with the slightly outdated feel of the animation, will possibly make you feel nostalgia for this show a lot sooner than for other \"new\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are fun. While they do fill tropes, they still feel unique and relatable. Can't get too deep into characters without stepping into spoiler territory, so trust me when I say they're enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe story is good, the characters are fun, the music is fantastic, it's funny, the running gags don't get old and the show is really addicting.\\n\\n\r\nEnd note: \\n\r\nIf you're in the mood for a fun slice of life with a twist, go for it. I cannot tell you enough how much fun I had watching this and I recommend it to everybody. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI personally wanted to watch this show back when it aired, but I kinda forgot about it so I got it in an anime roulette a year later and I'm so glad I did. Can't wait for season 2 coming in about half a year. \\n\r\nI'm actually starting high school tomorrow and I can see ReLIFE being a very important show to me because it certainly encouraged me to make the most of my time there, because at the end of the day there is no ReLIFE in the RealLIFE....or is there?",

            "content": "[Spoiler free]\r\nI began watching RELife after being recommended it by a friend and once I saw it's high ratings and popularity. The first two episodes engrossed me - however from there I found it got increasingly more boring with each episode, until I finally gave up after episode 9 - sure I'd like to know how Kaizaki-san's story ends, but can I really endure another 80 minutes of this show? No, I would rather just google the ending.\r\nI think my problem with the show is that it was framed as the story of Kaizaki, however the anime focuses more on his classmates, specifically the competitiveRena and socially inept Hishiro. The anime is thus more of a slice-of-life about volleyball and Kaizaki's story is neglected for the majority of episodes. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it's just my preference in genre - I like something a bit more gripping, but all in all I feel like I've wasted my time watching this. I've learnt one valuable lesson though - just because something's popular, doesn't mean its good.",

            "content": "[Story 10] - I like the story a lot.\r\nA \"NEET\" character gets the chance to change his gift by turning into a high school teenager. At first he just wants to spend the year at the bottom of the screens but over time he is getting more and more involved with the characters around him.\r\nIs this good?\r\nAt the end of it all, nobody will remember him, this is the agreement. He knows that. This creates a \"drama\" for those who watch, for at the same time they hope that something will happen. If it does, can be bad for Arata.\r\nWith this the story creates aspecial air, you wait for the next episodes with much anxiety. That's really good.\\n\\n\r\n[Art 9] - Character characteristics are well made. Each one with its quality exposed. Especially Chizuru, her macabre smiles are unbelievably cool. \\n\r\nThe stars that always appear around the characters' heads are very funny, it makes the scene funnier than it is. This helps a lot for the anime to get you involved.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound 9] - Nothing to complain about, the OST is very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n[Character 7] - Here is the X of the question. (Brazilian speaking)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters when presented are very good but, some have lost their essence.\\n\\n\r\nKazuomi was probably meant to be like that, kind of silly. But seriously? Did not you realize there was a romance between him and Rena? The genre of the anime is novel, it is unacceptable a character to be stupid thus dealing with the theme. He is a funny character but with a very weak personality. Thankfully that changed in the last episode, which by the way surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nRena, what about Rena? She was a proud character, was cool to the plot, but offended her best friend? Still with a trauma of the past? It took heavy, the character did not match with that. In the episode where she listens to Honoka talking about her, instead of reconciling, she runs away. Why?\\n\\n\r\nAn and Ryou are a very funny couple, probably the ones I liked the most.\\n\\n\r\nArata and Chizuru, in the last episode, I hated Arata very much. Chizuru too. Do you both have feelings but are afraid of hurting each other? Why? They spent the entire anime struggling to overcome this barrier and at the last minute they continued behind her. That did not please me. I expected more. Probably in manga the story continues better.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment 9] - The theme is really cool. It shows how people get lost in time and can not go back.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a teenager's admonition that you spend your youth spending your time on unnecessary things thinking that in the future \"everything will be as I want\". It's a slap in the face of lazy people.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked it.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall 9] - A complete story.\\n\\n\r\nThere was something else with Arata and Chizuru, but I can not deny that it was good.\\n\\n\r\nI will definitely continue reading the manga and recommend it to a friend.\\n\\n\r\nWaiting for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the grammar, this review is from a Brazilian.\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

The story also makes it so you can understand different struggles people go through daily. It is definitely a feel good anime and is wrapped up quite well. I will have to look into the manga now just so I can have more. \r\nThe artwork and sound is nicely done. I love the coloring as well as the character designs. The sound effects sound like the real deal. (Sound has improved so much since the older days haha)\r\nAgain, the characters had agreat design. I know anyone who watches it will easily have a favorite character and be able to relate to some of the struggles in some way. But, will also relate to the happy moments.\\n\\n\r\nI really want to emphasize the fact that they touched certain areas that you do not always see in your typical anime.

            "content": "For those who read manga after watching its anime, I'd recommend watching this. However, from an anime-only viewer's perspective (myself included), this MAY not be the case. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching the anime. \r\nStory: 6 \r\nThe story itself was okay. The pairing of the couples and the story in general were clich\u00e9 and predictable. Nothing melodramatic; in fact, the problems were realistic and relatable, making it interesting enough to watch. \r\nIt would have been more promising if the main plot was emphasized though. Sure, our main character did reLIVE his teenage life; however, I felt that the anime covered more sub-plots forthe supporting characters rather than finishing off our main characters' unemployment issue - what was the aftermath from reLife to both Chizuru and Arata? Unknown. Good cliffhanger to promote the manga but, if there's no sequel, the ending would just be incomplete. (And I, for one, hate half assed endings.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good. (Nothing to add really, I'm just personally more into a different type of animation.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3 \\n\\n\r\nHave you ever watched a horror movie muted? Not so scary anymore, huh? Sound plays a major role, believe it or not.\\n\\n\r\nI love classical music/instrumentals. As someone who plays piano and 'feels the music', I have to say that the background music was baddd.... So bad it would actually kill the mood because it did not match the scene. It just gave off an awkward vibe when it wasn't even necessary. Moreover, in some parts of the anime, no background noise was performed when the setting clearly needed it. \\n\\n\r\nIt may not mean much to some, but the sound greatly affected my overall rating for this show. \\n\r\n(The OP, ED and voice actors were fine.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\\n\r\nNothing too special but entertaining nonetheless. Character development for the supporting actors were fine, well done for Chizuru,  but lacking for Arata. He learned one or two things throughout his journey, but nothing too significant to actually have an impact on him. I feel like he has not really changed from the beginning of the series. To be honest, he actually did more of the helping than getting help from.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I did enjoy the anime. The comedy was light to a certain extent and although the story is fair and had slow pacing, if you were to binge watch the series like I did, I think it's a worth a try.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5 \\n\\n\r\nAs it is, the overall rating should be 6.\\n\r\nIf a season 2 gets published, I would give this anime an overall of 7. \\n\r\nSince there's no info regarding a sequel release yet, my overall average is 6.5. \\n\\n",

Well, ReLIFE is roughly based on that.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nReLIFE brings to the table a fresh concept with heaps of potential. The plot was relatively strong, and the story was well executed. The pace was consistent and there was good use of foreshadowing, hinting at a plot twist.\r\nArt 7/10\r\nThe art was standard-fare but smooth.\r\nSound 9/10\r\nThe OP was decent, but the EDs forced me to give ReLIFE a 9 for sound. Pieces of popular 00s Japanese music were chosen in good taste and there was adifferent track every episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were very well developed. The MC, Kaizaki, was mature and took strides to improve the lives of those around him, which is commendable. The existential crisis of the MC was truly thought-provoking and served to deepen the character. Furthermore, great care was taken to ensure that each individual had unique character traits and that played a big role in their development. Throughout the entirety of the anime, some of the characters innate feelings were well drawn out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nAlthough I consider this anime one of the best of 2016, the excruciatingly slow pace failed to engage me. To rub in salt, the MC's way of putting others ahead of himself was agonising.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI feel that this anime was very good and lived up to its potential. I would definitely recommend this anime.",

There are a lot of interesting scenarios within this story line, sadly none of them are explored at all. The main story holds no relevance to the series and could be extracted from it without anything feeling off. \r\nThe idea of the show is to resocialize somebody who has shut himself of from society by letting him relive his youth. Oddly the main character doesn't really need to be socialized. Hispersonality is warm and accepting from episode one. All the man needs is a job and some trauma-therapy. There is no real character development going on here as there is little progress for the main character to be made. \\n\r\nThat aside the story still might be interesting if you'd properly explore how an 27 year old man might feel skipping backwards in time, how a grownup interacts with the values and problems of teenagers, sadly this potential is left untouched. The main character does not come across as an adult who went through very depressing periods in his life. Instead he feels like a teenager himself, getting embarrassed over banal things, overly focused on group-interactions, accepting the authority of teachers over him (having him drop smoking, as they think of him as a teenager).... There is no conflict caused by his mental age in this new situation and there are very few moments where he seems somewhat mature. These moments are the better parts of the series, very sad to see that this was not integrated in the story. \\n\r\nAll in all this series has some loveable characters going through minor problems of growing up, everything else is an unused extra which leaves much to be desired. Sad to see an interesting idea falling flat on it's face. Watchable but nothing more.",

And, on top of that, made me re-think a lot of things about my own life and what I would do if I had the chance to re-live it. \r\nFor us millennials there comes a point in our lives, once we'vefinished high school and college, that you have to face the reality of becoming an adult. And it's not easy, at all. Mainly because, after years of picturing a perfect life that will eventually come once you finish all your obligations as an student, you realize being an adult is never as amazing or carefree as being a student was. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how to describe my experience watching ReLIFE better than this, but at least allow me to say this: if you're too young, maybe you will not enjoy this anime to the fullest. Maybe you should wait a couple of years to really, really get it. That being said, if you're a bit older like me, don't doubt: WATCH IT. And maybe it will have the same effect it had on me. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't recommend it more.",

            "content": "Depressingly close to a 9. This show's premise and execution on its core concept are excellent. The premise alone was enough to start the show at a 7 for me, and the way they handle things like how an adult (even one with a master's or doctorate) would deal with high school feels realistic. They also avoid - for the most part - the typical high school boy/girl awkwardness, because the main character just doesn't see himself on their level. It's refreshing to see the main character have the kind of poise and maturity that someone in their late twenties would have gained through yearsof social experience. This show could've fallen to a 6 or even 5 if he started blushing and freaking out like a high school kid would when talking to a girl, but thankfully they actually write him like his true age for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nStill, it's held back by the fact that they don't bother with a real ending, and all the potential issues that would come with it. The train rushing down on the main character is the eventual return to real society, and the effect that will have on him and the characters he establishes relationships with throughout the show. I think my other main gripe is how focused the protagonist is on the people around him. He's less a man with a limited lease on youth trying to recapture lost emotions and motivation than he is a disguised mentor to all the kids around him. I think in that sense both the show and the titular experiment fail. It's also the type of problem that almost certainly would have been fixed with more episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a few reasons they could have ended the show the way they did. A second season is possible. It could also be that they realized just how much time would have to be devoted to a true resolution. But either way, it drags the show's score down at least a full point for me. Still absolutely worth watching.",

            "content": "This review contains minor \r\n***SPOILERS***\r\nthat should not impact your viewing experience, or spoil you any secrets or plot points you'd only get to know by the end of it.\r\nStill, if you wish to avoid all spoilers, stop reading it now.\r\nAlso, this review includes the 2nd season:\r\nReLIFE: Kanketsu-hen\r\n-\r\nReLIFE is a show I've been putting off since it was added to MAL with its synopsis, because I could imagine only two ways it could play out.\r\nOne, it'll take a mature approach and tackle real, every-day problems, of both (high school) children and adults alike, through the eyes of the main character, which sounds very interesting to me.\r\nOrtwo, its premise is to be quickly forgotten for high school \"drama\" to appeal to the targeted audience: 13-16 years old kids, which I found to be more likely. \\n\r\nThe possibility of the second was so off-putting I couldn't muster up the willpower to start the show immediately, and as it turns out, I wasn't too far off the mark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~STORY - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as per the synopsis, is about a man who gets to experience high school life again thanks to a magic pill produced by \"ReLIFE\"...a company, I guess? But it's unimportant.\\n\r\nHe gets the chance to help the research in exchange for bettering his life. Should he succeed (how it works we'll never know), ReLIFE.co will hook him up with a decent job he needs so bad.\\n\r\nThe possibilities of this premise are nigh limitless, but for that, adding this convenient fiction is a must, to explain how it is possible in the first place,\\n\r\nand although I found it to be disappointingly unimaginative, I was quick to accept it without further ado because of the previously mentioned reason.\\n\r\nStill, I hoped that was all the fiction there is going to be...\\n\\n\r\nAs we're explained, the subject of this experiment is to go back to high school for a year.\\n\r\nImagine the possibilities! Entering a school under a different name! Having to learn or make up a story about this fake identity!\\n\r\nThe problems of love between an adult and a teenager! The sadness, the depression! The fun? The difference between the mindset of an adult and children (well, teens), and all its pros and cons!\\n\r\nNon-disclosure agreements! The threat being sentenced for breaking any (existing, real) law! Searching for a solution to the problem that result in a NEET!\\n\r\n\"Where did I go wrong?\" \"What should I do differently?\" \"Is it technically pedophilia if I was turned into a teen their age?\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah you get none of that.\\n\r\nNo real drama and no real problems an adult could face in the body of a teen back in school.\\n\r\nWell, except for bad grades, I suppose.\\n\r\nYou get children's drama and children's problems that are solved by children's ways, or aren't solved at all.\\n\r\nMoreover, the show quickly pulled a middle finger by adding a \"twist\" fairly early on to make things real simple for you.\\n\r\nI said expected the pill to be the only fictional part, but I was gravely mistaken. There was something else I really wish the synopsis did mention: Memoryfuckery.\\n\r\nWhen the experiment ends, all memories of all people who interacted with the test subject will be wiped,\\n\r\nalong with all proof of his existence too, as we are told later on. Every student, teacher, neighbour and stranger will forget about ever seeing the teenage version of the adult main character.\\n\r\nNo ifs, no buts.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the pill was necessary. It could've been more reasonable, it could've been explain better,\\n\r\nit could've taken more time to take effect, but it didn't, that wasn't the focus of the show, and I understand it. But why playing with memories? Is that the focal point of the show?\\n\r\nWhy not just a false identity with a fake story?\\n\r\nRhetorical question, OF COURSE it's all for the theatrical melodrama, and if that's not immediately obvious to you, then I'm really sorry for you. It's shitty, unreasonable and unnecessary drama.\\n\r\nIt's like bringing sand to a desert. There's absolutely no need for it because thanks to the premise, the potential for drama is off the bloody charts!\\n\r\nIt's literally everywhere, you just have to look around or just close your eyes and point in any direction and you'll find it, so why force this shit into it?\\n\r\nIt makes 0 sense, it's against human rights, and let's not even mention how it's impossible to mass-wipe the memories of everyone of a specific individual,\\n\r\nhow it's impossible to erase all trace of his existence (which isn't going to happen anyway) and most importantly,\\n\r\nhow living a fake life for a year BUT making real connections with real people only to suddenly sever them all\\n\r\ncould easily make things far, far worse than they were before.\\n\r\n\"Oh, you're suffering from crippling anxiety? Here's a feels-good therapy for you, followed by a push off a rooftop.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo the core of the story is bullshit, but there's more. Much of the story revolves around everything *but* the main character. High school kids with high...no, with grade school problems.\\n\r\nThey're supposed to be 17-18 years old but feel like 12-13 at most. Lots of unnecessary melodrama taking up way too much screen time (like half the season),\\n\r\nthat do not add anything to the main plot, the story of the main character, but nor do they change characters. In the meanwhile, MC either takes the backseat or a mediator position,\\n\r\neither way it will not develop his story, the story of an adult trying to find his way, in any way. It's what the show was supposed to be about, but isn't.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, even though it implemented memoryfuckery, the show really did not deal with any existential or moral questions that come with altering or removing memories, it was convenient for some melodrama then it was conveniently swept under the rug.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE, as in the...company or government project or whatever the hell, that came up with this \"solution\" to the NEET problem, well, we get to know nothing about it, and we'll only barely get to know two characters working for it. Not even scratching the surface.\\n\\n\r\nAs for ReLIFE (the show), it's not a finished story, it's half that. It's not like Star Wars or Lord of The Rings where each episode has an ending.\\n\r\nIt's a story that literally cuts off at the halfway point abrupltly. Its 2nd season finishes what the 1st started, which is why I decided to judge both \"halves\" as one.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while the first season was 13 episodes long, the second season was only 4 episodes long.\\n\r\nThe ending is the most important part of the story, it leaves the the strongest impression, it's what people will remember the best, but to give people the closure they desire, you need a good ending, a satisfying epilogue.\\n\r\nThese 4 episodes were noticably rushed, and the ending, while more-or-less satisfying in conclusion, wasn't detailed, and the epilogue was short and unsatisfying, barely covering two characters and leaving a lot of questions unanswered.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story is just unreasonable to a ridiculous degree, but even if I could turn off the lights at will and forget how stupid it is,\\n\r\nit'd still come across as weak and unimaginative. Nothing this show offers is new or exceptional.\\n\r\nThe writing is weak, magic is pulled out of nowhere for no reason while laws, rules and common sense is thrown out the window and forgotten when it's conventient.\\n\r\nWhether the ending makes you feel good or not is another matter entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy. The main character is flat. I expected a memorable, disturbed adult with real problems and flaws and maybe some merits, instead I got a blank cardboard cutout with no meaningful flaws but merits.\\n\r\nHe tries to act like a student to fit in, but at the same time he is pretty much like your average student character;\\n\r\nblushing like mad because he touched a girl's hand by accident, butting in kids' love life just for fun, making innocent fun of other kids, and having bad grades because he can't be perfect.\\n\r\nHe is not flawless, but if you expected a serious flaw in his personality that result in his NEET status which he needs to correct to better his life, you're going to be disappointed.\\n\r\nHe's portrayed as an all around good, helpful and honest guy. It's not disturbing to watch him, but it's nothing exceptional either.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters inlcude his misterious handler and observer, whom we'll never know nearly as much about as we should,\\n\r\na stereotypical hard-working tsundere with stereotypical problems of whom we'll know waaay more about than we ever wanted,\\n\r\na homeroom teacher who shows up like twice only to let us know the school isn't run by kids and there are adults too,\\n\r\ntwo naturally talented cardboard cutouts who are most of the time just there to make jokes or participate in the unneccessary melodrama,\\n\r\nand a couple more characters whom I'll not specify for spoilerish reasons. One of them should've been explored more like the handler, while the other should've been included and focused on more.\\n\r\nAll except one of these characters (aside MC) contribute near nothing to the story to the point they could be removed or replaced without anyone noticing, and all of the characters (including MC) could've been more fleshed out and more relevant to the central plot, to the point each character feels like a wasted opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nSo long story short, nothing about the characters is exceptional or unique. There's potential for greatness here (thanks to the premise) but it's botched by lacking writing skills, pacing and proper focus on what's really relevant.\\n\r\nThere's one thing though I find strange: I despise melodrama, and it makes me despise characters, which in turn make me despise shows.\\n\r\nHowever, for some reason I can't wrap my head around, it didn't really happened here.\\n\r\nWhile personally I didn't find any characters particularly memorable of likable, they didn't annoy the will to live out of me.\\n\r\nSo despite their mediocrity and the melodrama, they were kinda...likable, I guess?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~VISUAL/AUDIO - between 5-7/10 or so.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't care about it, and it's pretty much the case with this one also. It wasn't particularly good or bad.\\n\r\nI watch shows for the story and characters with the added bonus of occupying two of my senses, so unless it's outstanding or outrageous, I do not care much about it.\\n\r\nThere are two exceptions though. First, there was one fairly memorable piece of music in the show used mostly during the dramatic events that managed to add to the experience and generate some tension,\\n\r\nand second, the 2nd season's visuals weren't near as good, i.e. unimportant characters were replaced by hollow blue/pink translucent figures, it was noticably less detailed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nNow this is really subjective. While you can try your best to judge characters or the story objectively, you can't really do that with enjoyment.\\n\r\nTo me, this story was subpar. Bad, even. Each episode was a reminder of missed opportunities, and by the end, they really piled up. The comedy was fine, not exactly what I'd expected, but it made me blow air through my nose slightly stronger than usual.\\n\r\nThe melodrama was less fine. Even though I said it didn't make me despise characters like it usually does, it was still a chore to sit through it, and as I said, it covered a significant portion of the show.\\n\r\nBut now that I've sorted my thoughts, I realize I enjoyed it waaay more than I should've based on what I've written.\\n\r\nPersonally I'd give it a 4, maybe a 5 even, but again it's irrelevant as it's entirely subjective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL -\\n\r\nJudging it only by characters and story, it's about 3.5/10.\\n\r\nWith V/A included, it hovers around 4-5/10.",

            "content": "Personally I started watching this series without any expectation whatsoever. I literally just skimmed the synopsis and I thought \"hey, why not\". I'm always interested in a story where a character is forced to see the world in another perspective, technically. That's what relife is all about, no?\r\nStory-wise I think it's delivered okay-ish, not that good but not bad either. Though at the middle I kind of feel distracted by the err... side stories. Maybe it's because I'm not at that age anymore, but the high school drama bit feels a little dragged out for me. And I'd be more interested to see the developmentof the MC rather than seeing high school girls having beef with each other. Also about the Subject 001 thing, I'm not sure if we're supposed to guess throughout the story because I feel like it's hinted heavily already at the first episodes, so it doesn't have so much impact when it was revealed later.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the most about relife is it also illustrates the real life (haha, get it?) that the MC had to go through before which puts him in the current situation. There's a lot of stuff going on and it'll feel unfair, sometimes we have to act, but other times we need to bear with it in order to not make things worse. Neither one of the decisions is right nor wrong. It's up to the person making the decision how he assesses the risks and situation. That's just how real life works. I'd be really disappointed if the story heads into another clich\u00e9 that the hero saves the day and lives happily ever after.\\n\\n\r\nThe story feels a little rushed (and the way they end it is kind of awkward to say the least), but that doesn't take away a major amount of enjoyment. It's a good coming-of-age story. After seeing the ending, I'm pretty sure they're supposed to make season 2 because I don't see any conclusion to this series... yet, especially regarding Kaizaki himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a good anime but lacks any meaningful conclusion at the end.",

            "content": "*No Spoilers*\r\nThis anime surprised me.  I thought I had it all figured out after the first episode, but there's much more underneath the surface.  I went into this in hopes for a romance story, but as it turns out-- ReLIFE is about the adult main character, Kaizaki, re-experiencing a final year in high school, and what he learns from this bizarre occurrence.\r\nThe story primarily focuses on Kaizaki, and how his interactions with the people around him help him assess and rebuild himself.  Whether it's supporting somebody else, or overcoming his own issues-- the story is always driven towards his progression.  Consideringthis, I feel like this story is meant for a mature audience, despite it taking place in high school.  There's a direct relation to adults in their 20's who are still trying to find their selves.  As a result, the story is filled with life lessons in small gestures, and finding value in the things that can be easily forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nVery notable details in ReLIFE are the presentation, and the tone.  All of the characters in this anime are not sexualized in any way, which really is a breath of fresh air.  By sexualization, I don't simply mean character design and exchanges between others.  It's in how topics are conveyed and presented.  Changeroom scenes aren't seen as opportunities to give the viewers \"fan service\", and the topic of physical assets is minimal, along with the appearance of design.  ReLIFE is presented with a more mature perspective to the content, and rightfully so.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many stories very much like this one, where the main character is thrown into a place he shouldn't be.  Many of these main characters take advantage of their predicament at some point to do something that's not tasteful.  Konosuba's Kazuma, Mujaki no Rakuen's Shouta, even Your Name's Taki are a few examples to name.  Kaizaki in ReLIFE stays strongly in character, as you learn more about who he was, became, and strives to be moving forward.  His manners, way of speech, and even his posture and gestures are notably more adult-like than everybody else-- and people recognize him for it.  Even when tested, he doesn't waiver.  Yet, he learns from the experience.  \\n\\n\r\nA strong-minded lead was perfect for this story, yet somehow as a result, made it very unpredictable.  In a good way!  All of the key characters played different roles that impacted the story effectively.  Although weakness is expressed, it's thoroughly followed with triumph, whether it's a side character's hurdle, or a mountain for Kaizaki.  Tying romantic elements into this was a bonus-- a very good bonus.  The relations between characters and the story as a whole is wrapped up rather beautifully in the four-episode finale released in the final Blu-ray (available March 2018).  \\n\\n\r\nYou'll think you know where the story is progressing, but then it'll go another direction in a very sensible way.  And when it does go the way you were expecting, it still finds a way to hit you emotionally.  I can only consider that as good writing, and probably the best part of ReLIFE.  I've taken something away from this positively, and I'm sure I'll always remember ReLIFE's purpose.  I don't guarantee everybody would, since this anime is tailored to a very small demographic (Post-grad independent adult that still enjoys slice-of-life).  But I still recommend it.  This is a really, really good story.",

Opening Song is very nice got hooked by it.\r\nOverall the anime was wonderful. It has that nostalgia of you wanting to go back to high school or change something you did in the past. It will make you think of the regrets you might have done in the past as well as your successes. It is very rekatable cause I think wehave that feeling that we want to go back and change something or to experience something again. \\n\\n\\n\r\n10 out of 10 for my taste.",

            "content": "Do not jump to conclusions. That's what I \"learned\" with ReLIFE. ReLIFE was an anime that I really did not expect absolutely nothing interesting, especially considering the extremely nonsense synopsis. But with each passing episode, plus the anime was holding me and I could not stop watching until I realized that I had already finished.\r\nThe first impression I had when I saw the first five minutes, something that will not call attention visually speaking. nothing (which I will comment more calmly later). But at least that would be something different from other animations that rodeam the industry. And that's exactly what happened, but I honestlythought it would be the same difference that would make me drop the anime, it was the extreme opposite. What held me in relife was the plot of course would not make any sense. But over time I was watching, I realized that analyze the bit plot by bit it would make sense too, because if not this nonsense present it, relife would be a boring and common Slice of Life that both are often seeing in transmission .\\n\r\nThe more I watched, the more I realized that using the argument that \"the anime is bad because it does not happen in real life,\" or \"a pill that makes someone rejuvenate 10 years is madness\" is instantly disposable. For it is this argument that makes even the anime does not make sense, make sense as well. This is because it is he who makes the plot is not \"impossible.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched, I wondered if ReLIFE had some defect, and I especially could not see any, the system to develop a pill that makes the character \"back in time\" was something at least clever, if thinking. Because that way, you would not have to relate to more complex things like time machines, distorting realities, paradoxes and so on. And I'm sure the Yayoi thought about it when he was writing ReLIFE. And guess what? Even simple, which is great, from one point of view.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I said it would comment, the animation ReLIFE and the graphic is not up to snuff, and is far from it. TMS had no concern iota to let the animation a bit cooler, but I see this as default, but this would cause the person who was watching to stay at least a little more apt to be forced to watch the anime, if was not with the face of the plot. I say this because I am a strong example; when I'm not very interested in anime plot, if it has an animation and beautiful graphic, I get at least one more \"excited\" to continue watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is not also nothing more, in fact, they have been a few times where I could see her bottom, but do not see it as a very important defect, but as I already said when commenting on the animation/graphic anime, It would be even better if it were something better prepared.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is not amazing, but it's not bad, is that average around. The ED no comments. Not to be spectacular or awful, but simply does not exist. It was just some illustrations of what was the episode, and a different song each time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not from another planet, but they are not terrible. While I sympathize with some, not with the face of others, Kariu, for example, found nothing in it that was nice, but found nothing that would cause me to hate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe end is not considered by me, I end indeed as it was clearly made with intention to continue on a possible second season. I do not know if it was really the will of the director and TMS to do so, or if it happened by chance, but I think for them to have intended to leave a final so open and without end that way, TMS must be securely sales, because they hardly spend money on something that did not sell well in the debut, something that have double or triple sales reduction in the continuation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, in short, ReLIFE was a good anime, but sinned in some minimum aspects which, if they were better dealt, would turn into something very good, or even great.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(If you have something that's not how to read, I apologize, because I am Brazilian, and my English is not that great)",

            "content": "Outstanding execution of what it was going for. Despite being centered around high school, Relife feels like it was made for adults by adults. The themes are basic, but explored with such nuance that they leave a deep impact, and you find yourself caring for the characters and hoping for a happy outcome for them all.\r\nCharacters are not incredibly complex, and almost every character is lacking in any real flaws, but they are still totally believable, if not the most exciting. Their motivations and behaviors are never out of sync with reality or unjustified (problems that plague 99% of anime...). The main character, as anadult looking into the world of children, behaves appropriately and exactly as expected, and it's delightful to watch him try to adjust to and navigate in a world he technically left years ago. Anime tropes are used here and there (exaggerated responses, overly cute moments, paused frames of time where characters look at each other and realize their feelings for each other, all that fun stuff), but they're used sparingly, appropriately, and with enough subtlety that they seem endearing instead of obnoxious/distracting. And while each character doesn't really change a whole lot, the developments that happen are given appropriate exposition, and thus feel immensely satisfying in the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow, in all honesty, the story is nothing special, and not a lot unexpected happens. But it's telling that while nothing super exciting happens in Relife, you still find yourself surprisingly deep in your emotional investment. The thing is, with most anime, they try to piece together incredible stories with intense drama, strong emotions, and amazing plot developments - but with absolutely no subtlety and inadequate exposition, it ends up being campy.\\n\\n\r\nA little note: it's not that I don't like these things - Code Geass, for example, is often ridiculous, but its exposition, pacing, and handling of things is done so well (for the most part) that you still find yourself immersed in the story, and it's one of my favorite animes because of this. But most animes will screw it up...characters' emotions will seem unnecessary, their motives/behaviors unjustified for the events that preceded, and plot developments will unfold arbitrarily, introducing shock and drama for the sake of shock and drama. All these moments of disconnect serve to pull you out of the story and make you less invested.\\n\\n\r\nRelife aims for less grandiose heights, but it reaches what it goes for perfectly. The little twists and drama are handled with superb timing, and flashbacks are used perfectly to compel the narrative forward, with tiny bits of exposition that slowly reveal the backstory and leave you wondering instead of just being thrown in haphazardly. Relife doesn't take you for an amazing or thrilling ride, but rather, chugs along at a consistently pleasant pace.\\n\\n\r\nI guess...if you're a huge fan of anime and some of its more representative aspects of stylistic direction in general, Relife won't do it for you. It's beautifully understated, and its moments of catharsis/drama/etc occur organically without being thrown in your face, so much so that you might miss some of them. If you like huge random plot twists out of nowhere, moments  characters who burst out crying/raging and go on melodramatic rants about their motivations, characters with immensely sad/horrific/crazy backstories to justify their extreme views, and all the other standards of most anime - you probably won't like Relife. But if those things are the parts of anime that annoy you, maybe Relife is what you were looking for :)\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nIn truth an actual rating of Relife would be closer to 8/10, but I'm giving it a higher score for what it represents",

            "content": "ReLIFE is amazing. Why? BECAUSE 13 EPISODES ALL OUT AT ONCE! Nah i'm just kidding but ReLIFE was seriously a joy to watch consecutively without stopping and was incredible.\r\nReLIFE tells the story of Arata Kaizaki who is supposedly a \"failure\" in life. He takes a pill to become younger and attends high school with 17 year old young adults. So how was ReLIFE incredible? Well the 1st thing i'd look at is the characters of ReLIFE.\r\nThe characters of ReLIFE are interesting and are fresh. No unnecessary fan service or annoying tsunderes, just earnest high school students and our 27 year  old MC. All theside characters and MCs have different personalities and provide a palette of colors to ReLIFE, making it pleasant to watch. Arata has the mindset of a 27 year old and tries to act as a mature adult, Hishiro, a callous individual seeking to change herself, Rena, a hardworking high school girl who wants to be recognised, etc. These characters(and more not mentioned) provide varieties to ReLIFE and are receive ample character development which makes ReLIFE a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a bunch of characters that are interesting wouldn't instantly make an anime amazing. What ReLIFE did well was to use the characters in the show to allow the viewers to gain insights and grow alongside our MC, Arata Kaizaki. The characters in ReLIFE each have a different story and this provides many platforms for us to learn about life, hence embracing well the Slice of Life aspect of this show. The things we learn in ReLIFE are realistic and highly applicable to society and us humans-hard work, tenacity, etc. are important in our everyday lives and these are well taught in ReLIFE. So yay ReLIFE!\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely, there are mistakes that i wished wouldn't have appeared in ReLIFE. There are certain parts in episodes that I personally disliked but those parts only constitute a small portion of the anime and shouldn't be significant in impacting the pleasant ReLIFE experience.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i highly recommend this anime and would be a pleasant experience for people looking for \"depth-ly\" animes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOY YOUR ReLIFE EXPERIENCE!\\n",

Rather than start my review off by explaining the premise of the anime, I'll just say that you should watch this if you enjoy good character development in shows. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but the main character is able to interact with the rest of the cast very well, and the story evolves around those relationships. There's even a \"m night shyamalan\" twist in the story somewhere that REALLY surprised me. It started and ended well, and was overall a greatwatch. 8/10 - not perfect, but still great.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI\u2019m happy with the life I have.\r\nMy family is wonderful, I\u2019m in relatively good health, and my interests are rewarding to me on many different levels. Sure, some aspects could be better, but I don\u2019t like to think negatively. Instead, I tend to think with my eyes on the future and what I can do right here, right now.\r\nReLIFE provides a shot at such happiness, but, for the here-and-now, it does not quite succeed.\r\nSTORY\r\nReLIFE begins with the depressed and downtrodden Kaizaki. With no job, no friends, and no prospects, his life is in shambles. Yet,one day, a strange man by the name of Ryou offers him a chance at a new life. Or rather a do-over (hence the title). Kaizaki accepts, sending him down a path he never knew he wanted \u2013 let alone needed.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, ReLIFE is a mixture of comedy and drama. Arguably, the anime begins as a comedy and slowly transitions into a drama. But it\u2019s fair to say that both sides exist simultaneously throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nComparing the two, the comedy reigns supreme. Especially early on where Kaizaki\u2019s newfound situation leads to many antics. Nonchalance about cigarettes, his physical weakness, and the awkwardness of being around high-school girls lends itself easily to hijinks.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s all amplified by the supporting cast. Oga\u2019s denseness when it comes to love. Ryo and An teasing Kaizaki for the umpteenth time. Hishiro\u2019s \u201cinfectious smile.\u201d It\u2019s a playful anime, one whose exaggerated character reactions make it more fun than heavy.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, comedy persists in the second half of the anime as well, but it\u2019s not as prominent. Not just because Kaizaki has (for the most part) gotten used to his \u201cnew\u201d life but also because the drama itself takes priority.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s where the anime encounters a large problem.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, a lot of the drama is a non-issue. Take, for instance, Kariu\u2019s jealousy and Ryou\u2019s failure. The former has nice build-up through Hishiro\u2019s friendly attempts and showcases ideas on letting others learn through failure. The latter was an entire episode dedicated to establishing Ryou\u2019s character and providing some background information.\\n\\n\r\nWhere ReLIFE messes up is with the volleyball arc.\\n\\n\r\nTo start, it takes up too much time. Giving three whole episodes to an arc that has nothing (directly) to do with either Kaizaki or Hishiro is a bad move. Hishiro\u2019s reduction in screen time actually started in episode six, so it came off even worse for her.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, it shifts the focus. The anime is carried quite a bit by Kaizaki\u2019s leveled attitude and Hishiro\u2019s deadpan delivery. So, when they aren\u2019t the focus, as is the case during this arc, everything feels less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWho they choose to focus on is also a problem. Kariu already had her scenes from earlier in the season, and her jealousy being the issue again is repetitive and even belittles the change she had before. As for Tamarai, she is largely unimportant until this arc, and, even afterwards, she rarely seems like anything more than a background character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the drama is simply lackluster. Kariu quitting the team, listening through the locker-room door twice, and needing to get dragged to the tournament does not have enough weight to feel meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole arc is only three episodes, but, since it cuts into the comedy and the momentum that the first half started, it hurts the narrative more than it would otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime does make smart, if not correct, writing choices elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt explores Kaizaki\u2019s past. The audience knows something is up from the first episode, so the show taking the time to divulge what happened \u2013 even going so far as to include its effects in the present \u2013 was smart.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a couple of plot twists. An being a Support was unexpected. And, while Hishiro being a ReLIFEr like Kaizaki was no surprise (due to hints from Hishiro about this being her \u201clast year\u201d and Ryo\u2019s nothing-happened report on the first subject), it makes narrative sense. Having someone else going through the same situation, who is both similar (and not), leads to many parallels and outcomes ripe with drama and meaning. Plus, they made it clear. For a time, it was hard to say whether the anime would unveil this secret before the conclusion to the season.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps its best trait, though, is the theme that literally defines the show.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE. Re, life. In essence, the anime is about a do-over. Not a Groundhog-Day situation where the affected gets multiple shots. And not a complete redo either. Kaizaki receives another chance at gaining a life he always wished he had through trying out his final year of high-school again.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, he gets a second chance. That\u2019s something a surprising amount of people don\u2019t get to have when, as the show argues, they deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nTake, for instance, Kariu. She steals Hishiro\u2019s bag, but Kaizaki and even Hishiro don\u2019t ostracize her for it. Instead, they talk with her and come to an understanding. They don\u2019t let one moment of weakness tarnish the progress they have made between one another. Because, despite what she did, she deserves a second chance.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a direction that can be seen in almost every event. Ryou fails as his first time as a Support, but he gets another go at it with Kaizaki. Kariu gives up on the tournament, but Tamarai and the others persuade her to come back again. Hishiro\u2019s first attempt at a ReLIFE didn\u2019t work out, but the powers that be (and more importantly she herself) want her to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nEven the show\u2019s running gag \u2013 Kaizaki in a perpetual state of taking make-up exams \u2013 demonstrates that, sometimes, people need that second chance. To try it a different way, to get it right the next time, and to ultimately improve themselves when all is said and done (again).\\n\\n\r\nSo, while the anime may not officially end its story, leaving it open for a continuation (should there be one), it begins mostly with a solid start due in part to this theme and its other, smarter writing choices.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for ReLIFE, its art and animation worsens as the season progresses.\\n\\n\r\nNear the start, they are both at least passable. The comedic reaction faces that have larger eyes and squatter heads achieve laughs with ease. And the characters take part in gym events, hang out after school, and eat food. Nothing mind-blowing but also nothing egregious.\\n\\n\r\nAt about the halfway mark, though, it all starts to go downhill. Characters are drawn off-model. The dramatic events understandably reduce the comedic reactions but don\u2019t replace them with anything too nuanced or at least interesting. A lot more talking and sitting and general lack of movement.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, the background art isn\u2019t helping. The typical school and apartment settings make sense for the show, but they don\u2019t attract the eye. The same can be said for the lighting and the cinematography. At most, the show will have a sunset, and the shots keep focus on the characters. But, for the most part, ReLIFE tries next to nothing fancy.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are perhaps the art\u2019s only positive constant. The female students\u2019 beige cardigans with black skirts and black socks, and the male students\u2019 long-sleeve grey coats with black ties, give them a more adult look. Fitting considering the anime\u2019s content. Plus, all the important characters appear realistic enough. I.e., no uncommon hair colors or quirky accessories.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more specific level, Hishiro\u2019s design, with her soft green eyes and front-and-back twin tails, is simplistic yet refined, working well with her character\u2019s personality. Kariu\u2019s side ponytail and red hair go with her tomboy, fiery self. And Kaizaki\u2019s design, while arguably plain, is handsome without making him overly dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint in the designs is Tamarai and her eyebrows. Three horizontal lines above each of her eyes looks more like she has an unnaturally creased forehead.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is technically Kaizaki\u2019s story, so he gets most of the focus.\\n\\n\r\nHe was a man shown to be down on his luck. Pretending to hold a job, earning a stipend from his mother, and lacking any grand direction. While he was drunk, Ryou\u2019s proposition came as an opportunity that would not come around again.\\n\\n\r\nWhen he takes the drug and starts reliving his teenage years once more, he starts to reevaluate himself. He quits smoking, he finds new friends in Oga, An, and Kariu, and he gets out of his apartment more so than he ever has before.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also takes time to investigate his past. Once during the middle of the season and once at around the three-quarters mark. While nice that ReLIFE divulged Kaizaki\u2019s background, it almost ends up hurting his character.\\n\\n\r\nThe first time shows him as a convenience-store cashier; his way of earning cash. Ryou secretly leaves behind his wallet for Kaizaki to find. Which he does, returning it to his soon-to-be (but unbeknownst to him) Supporter.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the anime doesn\u2019t show much else besides this, making it hard to grasp Kaizaki\u2019s character before he became a shut-in. Did he have a lot of friends? He graduated from college, so what kinds of interests did he have? Were there any personal conflicts growing up that prevented him from changing his lifestyle?\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the anime\u2019s inability to showcase more of his life, especially when this anime is about a new one, does not give him much of a foundation.\\n\\n\r\nThe second time his past is brought up brings yet another problem. ReLIFE kept Kaizaki\u2019s trauma hidden for most of the season, alluding to it only on occasion (as early as episode one). Eventually, it all gets revealed: his mentor\u2019s bravery, the unfair treatment she received, and the eventual suicide she committed from all the bullying.\\n\\n\r\nHis response? Quitting his company. A righteous, noble move. Something that should be commended (and, indeed, that\u2019s what happens). But his subsequent redo then is based on something positive (relative to his actions and not his mentor\u2019s passing). It\u2019s not as though he was a mean alcoholic or that he failed at whatever he set out do. Rather, he\u2019s always been sociable, and he clearly has the right mindset when dealing with others.\\n\\n\r\nCompare his scenario to Hishiro. While the anime doesn\u2019t say too much about her (which is perhaps an issue as well), her ReLIFE is more reasonable. Transferring schools constantly desensitized her relationships with others to the point that she deemed them worthless since they would be gone within the year. That\u2019s something that can be fixed. But Kaizaki\u2019s goodness that is carried over across all parts of himself? Not so much.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it differently, Kaizaki being a good guy forced him into solitude, but Kaizaki being a good guy saves him from solitude. A weird paradox because the anime gave him the best of both worlds (per se) on all character fronts.\\n\\n\r\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate, the anime does try to make his speaking out against his mentor\u2019s bullies as a negative. Since he butted in, that only encouraged the men to harp on her more. This idea ties into the show\u2019s thoughts on letting others sometimes handle their own problems.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, arguably, this direction leads to what he must overcome. Namely, striking a balance between staying quiet and reaching out to others when they need it most. He failed his mentor, but his actions in befriending Hishiro, persuading Kariu, and supporting Oga demonstrate that he does not wish to make the same mistake again. That he is making the most out of this second chance he has received.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the rest of the cast, the anime does give them attention. Hishiro, slowly but surely, gains a social circle. Kariu and Oga finally form a romantic relationship. Tamarai likes volleyball again. Nothing groundbreaking, but ReLIFE obviously allows almost all its characters to grow in a meaningful manner.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what they represent is arguably more important, for each character has a certain representation when it comes to reclusion, to reaching out.\\n\\n\r\nKaizaki\u2019s mentor highlights how dire it can get keeping everything to one\u2019s self.\\n\\n\r\nRyou champions the let-others-help-themselves ideology.\\n\\n\r\nTamarai teaches what ignoring somebody can lead to.\\n\\n\r\nOga reveals that, sometimes, people can reach out in the \u201cwrong\u201d way.\\n\\n\r\nKariu shows that active avoidance of others is arguably worse than never trying at all.\\n\\n\r\nHishiro proves that some people absolutely need help from outside themselves.\\n\\n\r\nKaizaki demonstrates just how easy helping others can be and how wonderful such help is.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, their thematic relevance, how they each embody or relate to a reaching-out lifestyle, drives their purpose home. For, as they show, the most prosperous of lives are ones surrounded by those friends and those loved ones that a person holds most dear.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe music of ReLIFE is a whole lot of noise without much pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nFor each episode, a new ending track plays. They are usually the same type: pop songs or light-rock ensembles. To be fair, it\u2019s a nice sentiment. It takes a lot of effort to get this many different pieces, and the creators deserve at least some praise for trying to make the anime more special. Unfortunately, almost all the tracks are forgettable since their quantity is their downfall, for none of them ever stick let alone stand out from one another.\\n\\n\r\n(Kaizaki\u2019s balcony door cutting off the music when he closed it, though, was a nice touch.)\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side, the anime has practically one track in its original soundtrack. It contains a couple of clunky piano notes that are meant to come off as lonely. Instead, it sounds like a sorry excuse for a semi-sad piece. Even disregarding this piece and focusing on the others, they either come off as too corny or too erratic, pushing the OST down the same weak path as the set of EDs.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the opening track comes out feeling somewhat worthwhile. The vocalist, piano, and drum beat work well together, but the track\u2019s tone is more important. Its transition from somewhat slow and melancholic to faster and filled with energy reflects the journey that Kaizaki (and Hishiro) goes through. Plus, the ending few notes symbolizes how all journeys \u2013 even this ReLIFE \u2013 must come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, voice acting sees no notable performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile the drama was neither emotional nor impactful to me, I liked this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime shined brightest whenever Hishiro was on-screen. Her unintentional smirk and sincerity at trying to be friends with the others had me smiling a lot. Also, her naivety. Doing an unnecessarily excited team cheer or being overly straightforward in a situation that perhaps required more tact added to her appeal as a fun yet serious character.\\n\\n\r\nKaizaki was entertaining, too. He wasn\u2019t a complex person, but his general friendliness with everyone, such as the teasing that went on or his insistence that he leave his cashier job formally, made him a cool guy to root for.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like how they failed to follow through on the romance between the these two, though. Too much almost-there and not enough commitment. I get that he has a moral and rational basis for why he doesn\u2019t pursue Hishiro (at this time). But it\u2019s so obvious, and the anime is considered of the romance genre. So not getting anything between them is a big bummer.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Oga and Kariu make up for this frustration by getting together. It was a cute scene on that bridge, the two focusing only on their held hands. They are awesome for each other. It\u2019s just a shame that the show had to end before showing them as a full-fledged couple.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE isn\u2019t a subpar anime, but it\u2019s not a shining one either. The story has ineffectual drama but a strong theme on second chances. The characters aren\u2019t stellar but themes on reclusion exist. And the comedy and relationships are entertaining, but the visuals and the music fail to appeal. Right here, right now, this one is just all right.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, while a certain volleyball arc detracts the narrative, some smarter writing choices and plot points, as well as a strong comedic first half and a theme on second chances throughout, create a strong start\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, noticeably worsens over time, boring artistic direction, below average actual animation, and nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while Kaizaki may not be the most interesting or well-written of characters, he has arguable strengths, and his and the others reclusive representations coincide well with the overall themes at play\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, okay OP, bad OST, bad EDs, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, fun characters and some nice side romance yet unemotional drama and no main romance\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "ReLIFE is an anime that had a chance to be a solid 8, but fell short due to the common mistake in the market where a romcom will either fail to take itself seriously enough to deliver a real ending or put the status quo of the slice of life above everything else, providing with a generic, overused \"and my days continued like that\" ending, resulting in something vague, general, and unsatisfying.\r\nThe story centers around a 27 year-old \"shut-in\" who is offered a job by going through an experiment that makes him look like he's 17 years old, and puts him back in the lastyear of high school for rehabilitation. After that year is over, everyone he dealt with will forget about him. In theory this sounds like an interesting setting but it doesn't really do anything with itself. The character spends all of his time failing exams, socializing, and refusing to pursue the romance he knows he wants. It sometimes pretends adults are involved, but it's such a slight shift in focus that it may as well just be another generic slice of life high school anime.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to keep this spoiler free, the anime had two realistic endings it could've chased, the sad ending where the main character falls in love and is forgotten about, or the happy ending where a \"miracle\" happens, and he gets to stay with his sweetheart. Instead it chose to do what every other mediocre slice of life/comedy/harem/romance has done before, many times. Unless you like self-inserting or NEED to relate to your characters (which I consider a futile endeavor in anything that is supposed to be a fictional work, where you're supposed to accept an universe and its characters as a story told to you, not as a story starring yourself) don't waste your time on this.\\n",

When I look at on my high school years, I realize there are so many things that I wish were different, that if only I was as smart or maturethen as I am now. And this show hits that, perfectly. It makes you really think about life as a student, and makes you feel emotion towards your years that you didn't know you felt.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself constantly thinking about my last year of high school and how I don't see all my friends any more because we've all gone our separate ways, and it really hits home. It makes me want to reach out to them and see how life is going, and makes me wish that I tried a bit harder to get involved more with my friends.\\n\\n\r\nOver all ReLIFE is a great anime that give you a feel good, warmness inside that you just don't find from most shows or movies now a days, be it anime, cartoon, movie or what have. It's definitely a great show, and I highly recommend you to watch it. 10/10.",

You might even want this to happen to your very self.\r\nStory -\r\nIt was amazing, not so hard twisted around. It has a lot of stuff going on and you're pretty much looking forward to each next episode. That's exactly why I marathoned it in a day. You'll like it. I'll skip this so I don't spoil anything.\r\nArt -\r\nNot too shabby. It's cool. Characters are beautiful. It has comedy elementsso be ready to see them drawn bad intentionally. It's not a very colored palette, much of a greyish style like on the cover.\\n\\n\r\nSound -\\n\\n\r\nMeh. Nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it gets exciting. All the characters have something going on. You'll love to see how they reveal their secrets. How they feel and how they are attached to each other. There is a second fiddle, top scorers, representatives, socials and anti-socials. Everything you might see in an anime high school and they are very well written.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\\n\r\nWell you'll love it, I am pretty sure. Give it a go and if you have time you'll just finish it in one go. You might not like the END!",

            "content": "Regrets...\r\nWe all have regrets we had 10 years ago, wanting things to be different if it was possible enough to change ourselves for the better but our past selves was too dumb or too naive to think it could be better...LA can relate ALOT to ReLIFE.\r\nReLIFE tells a rather simple but complicated story of a de-aging ReLife Research Institute by enlisting in Arata Kaizaki voiced by Kensho Ono, a 27 year old down and out loser almost becoming a NEET to under take an experimental pill to age him back 10 years and must attend high school for a full year.\r\nFor the most part \"simple\"is the right word for ReLIFE for plot structures and everything, from character interactions in the classroom, to romantic subtexts and friendship problems here and there, typical of a school anime like this. However the \"complicated\" part comes in if you read between the lines of many of the characters to which ALOT of plot twists (though mild) do add up by the end of it making this \"simple\" cliche plotline into a rather interesting take on the \"de-aging plots\" we've seen time and again in media.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise like LA said, the devil is in the details and this is mostly the case to the characters as a character-driven anime this is. Arata obviously gains more confidence to his re-adjustment back into high school, but from that and his soon to be made friends, it does show even from that. There are romantic subtexts shown alot and for the beta couple of Rena Kariu voiced by Haruka Tomatsu the typical tsundere and the always genki yet dense Kazuomi Oga voiced by Yuuma Uchida but isn't dealt with until the final episodes of the anime. From that Rena gets development quite alot, from opening herself up in conjunction to Chizuru Hishiro to friendship friction to her best friend Honoka Tamarai voiced by Himika Akaneya. Chizuru gets some subtle ones through Arata and Rena as a result from her unintentional creepiness and social problems she has and although LA REALLY doesn't like the shy character plotline, let alone if it's together with \"I want to be more assertive\", Chizuru by all means blew that out of the water, no not as in Chizuru's development swayed away from this plotline, more like her development did this typically cliche plotline rather a unique and interesting way, mainly because of Chizuru's personality helped immensely in LA liking her further down the line to the point she was LA's favourite character in ReLIFE that and LA was oddly suspicious of her as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development does bleed a bit to a bit of \"world building\" in a ways to the observer of Arata, Ryou Yoake voiced by Ryouhei Kimura by showing us some detail to the ReLIFE facility in some ways and this at least does give us insight not to the facility but more to how Ryou ticks and wanting to help Arata.\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE's interesting themes of conformity, naive youth and regrets. Conformity comes in Arata's previous job before his near NEET transition and how his company dealt with it with as little tact as possible making Arata lash out on his company, showing that and this is just LA stretching but showing how heartless the hierarchy of the Japanese workplace cares more about the money than any empathy and care for the workers. This theme does drip into school as well and might as well be considering it's nearly the same system just without pay........and your depressed. LA says this as RENA also falls into this due to her jealously towards Chizuru taking the best mark in the school which caused the friction between them in the first place. The naive youth theme is pretty obvious due to one of the characters was an adult before turning back into a teen, showing us that our youths ARE extremely limited with the time they got, so use them as best you can and if romance is involved...well *ahem* same thing...moving on. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by TMS Entertainment, the character designs are striking and bold and even though the majority of the characters are in school uniforms LA at least could distinguish them very easily. The backgrounding was also decent enough and along with the chibified comedic moments, LA will say that at the very least the animation was decent overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well LA does have alot to say here and least. First would be Haruka Tomatsu and Reina Ueda doing their usual scthick (light hearted tsundere and genki trickster respectively). LA did enjoy many of the male seiyuu's Yuuma Uchida and Ryouhei Kimura as well as Kensho Ono to their respective roles but LA especially enjoyed Ai Kayano as Chizuru (LA KNOWS, favourite character and all but) however like Chizuru herself, Ai does her usual kuudere scthick that LA knows her doing (see Inori Yuzuriha from Guilty Crown and Irori from Unbreakable Machine Doll) however LA could see Ai utterly shine as Chizuru if only because of Chizuru expresses lots of emotions outside of her kuudere range (from sincere dramatic to deadpan comedic), almost like Ai honed in how to perfect her kuudere range to perfection. Yes Ai Kayano even got LA's favourite seiyuu as a result of this.\\n\\n\r\nLA thought if there was any flaws in ReLIFE, like the coincidences or teem drama shown but even that isn't a flaw, as the coincidences are more or less mainly coming from Ryou and helping Arata and the teen drama all things considered, though it happens it's not by misunderstandings (cept Chizuru and Rena) but even that is dealt with by talking it out in a serious and mature way stopping the misunderstandings in the first place and characters moving on from that, so yeah the \"typical teen drama\" and \"coincidences\" as flaws for LA are moot as flaws...though if there was one little flaw it would go towards...\\n\\n\r\nThe ending brought up what LA mentioned about the romance spouting up however the only problem (besides the beta couple) comes in with the ReLIFE situation. The ending also finally gave LA's suspicions to rest. The ending was decent enough but kept things rather open-ended, now LA could have been angry about this however with ReLIFE announcing not long ago it's getting a finale Graduation arc LA will definitely watch it if only to see ReLIFE's conclusion and those few plot threads the ending teased at us get a well meaning payoff.\\n\\n\r\nOhh and LA didn't binge watch ReLIFE, considering how it was released, LA was more or less taken a back by how it was released as LA usually doesn't binge watch anime (yeah...weird right?. Seriously the last anime LA binge watched was Maria Holic's first season, last LA remembers). LA just doesn't do it anymore but nonetheless how you watch anime or ReLIFE is none of LA's business. \\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is a sincere look at facing regrets right at our faces, something alot of people have to do, looking back at our naive youths and how we could have changed it for the better. Surface-level, ReLIFE is but a simple yet complicated plot involving de-aging and the regrets that shows from our past. ReLIFE's themes are strong and firm, characters are realized and aren't at all cliche (some even surprising!)  and how it dealt with teen drama/romance was even dealt with in a mature way and LA praises how ReLIFE for this. \\n\\n\r\nLA will be waiting til Graduation to see if ReLIFE the anime will have a great ending to round things off.",

Well the ReLife program is here to fix it!\r\n(No spoilers in this review)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is well written and has nice pacing to it. You follow a man that has a chance to retake high school for a year. He befriends others, and tries to help to get them all together.  At the first episode, it has to cover a decent chunk of backstory, and ReLife does that very well. After that, it paces itself consistently throughout the episodes. By the end, most things feel like they are explained, but there might be a missing link ortwo somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style isn't my favorite, but it isn't the worst animations I've seen. There are a few scenes I enjoyed watching, but about that the art is a solid 8/10. Not bad, but not extremely well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening is ok, it doesn't catch my attention at all and makes me feel immersed into the story. The sound during the episodes are average, and do a solid job of keeping the flow of things going.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nNow this is where it all happens. The characters are very well written and presented. We see their problems and selfish desires. The MC is made to be like a helper to connect all the students together. The other characters try to   get along with each other, but struggle b/c of problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this from the beginning of the series, and continued to binge watch it. It was exciting, and the ending was well done. My favorite thing about ReLife was the backstory of the MC, and what he has experienced before ReLife. It shows his experience can help the students.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nReLife kept me entertained and had my attention throughout the episodes, and I believe it is a worth while watch for new and old anime viewers.",

            "content": "To be honest, I was a little bit shock when they streamed 13 episodes in one day. But something is better than nothing so here it is, an early review of ReLIFE.\r\nFirst I will talk about my personal enjoyment for this series. As a busy and tired college student, I really enjoyed this series. Why? Well, maybe because I really want to go back to high school where I could enjoy my time studying, socializing, or doing club activities (I was in flag raisers team which was kinda huge pride among the students). ReLIFE did something that others don't : giving us, adults, a feelingabout cheerishing our memories. Sometimes adults just want to escape and say \"I want to go back\". This anime certainly gives me that feeling and made me want to watch more and more.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to the story and character. I love how they build their characters and make them interract. Especially our MC. Starting as a NEET, they perfectly build the MC from the very start, a normal person who should be shocked by sudden change of body and enviroment. We could see our MC struggling with his judgement and thinking about the future of the others and himself. What I like is our MC because he is totally a NORMAL human, like us. The difference is he got a chance to ReLIFE his high school days (talk about roll credits here). That's why I could feel shympatized for our MC.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is really great for starting this season. It's not really heavy yet it could maintain its storyline and comic relief perfectly. I would like to recommend this anime for watching in this summer. Have a good summer vacation!",

            "content": "I've always wondered if anyone would release all the episodes of an anime series on the same day, like Netflix does. So when I heard all episodes of ReLife will be released on the same day, I was a bit skeptical. As a fan of the manga, I wondered whether this was the right approach. But this anime adaptation proved all my doubts wrong.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nKaizaki Arata is what you'd call a half shut-in. Good in social interaction, but still unable to get a job. One day, he meets Yoake Ryo, a member of ReLife Research Institute, who says they'll help Arata get a job withina year, and take care of all his expenses until then. The catch is he has to become a test subject in an experiment that turns him into a 17-year old high school student. The story is a bit refreshing than most high school anime, since the MC is an adult, and he tackles his problems in a mature way, instead of whining. Except the first episode, which was a bit rushed in terms of pacing, the story unravels itself brilliantly. the emphasis is not only on the MC, but also on the students he becomes friends with. The decisions Arata takes also influences those around him.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not the highlight of this anime. It's mediocre at best. Character designs are average. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis may be conflicting for many. I myself loved the piano music, though in some places I felt it could've been avoided. Also the piano music felt a bit repetitive, which might be annoying for some people. Now, the best part are the ending songs. Each episode has a different ending track. They are 90's songs, which Arata would've listened to during his high school days. It's refreshing to hear the songs of T.M Revolution and L'Arc. The songs are catchy and relaxing to listen to. I myself would like to recommend the song \"HOT LIMIT\" by T.M Revolution. It just makes me want to get off my lazy ass and dance! The VA is also brilliant. I especially loved Tomatsu Haruka as Kariu Rena.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main strength of any Slice of Life anime are the characters. And ReLife has some of the best characters in that aspect. Take other shows where people start waifu wars saying one girl is better than others. In ReLife, each girl has her own charm, and it's hard to pick one over the other. Much of the story revolves around Hishiro Chizuru- who has difficulty in making friends, and has an adorable smile, and Kariu Rena- who is very competitive, which causes her problems. Along with the other characters like Ooga, Yoake, Onoya and Honoka, they bring the show to life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI watched all 13 episodes without any breaks. And I'm really glad I did. It was a really good experience. The best thing was it left me satisfied, no more weekly waits for the next episode. This anime works really well for a binge-watch. A few episodes inbetween shows the character's pasts, and were a bit slow-paced. Imagine the reactions if this aired weekly \"Oh the last episode was better. Today's episode is disappointing blahblahblah\". I'm really glad that this didnot happen. There are no pervy jokes, the MC is not a blockhead, or has girls falling for him in all directions. the jokes are something that makes you laugh from the bottom of your heart, without trying too hard. It's the simplicity of this show that makes it so great!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nReLife is easily one of my favorite SoL of all time. i finished it at 4 am and went to sleep with satisfaction and a smile on my face. The manga is currently at 133 chapters, and the anime adapted almost 104 chapters, so it'll be sometime before a S2, but anime like this are worth the wait. If anyone wants to watch something satisfying without too much adrenaline, this would be one of my first recommendations.",

            "content": "So I got finished with ReLiFE after binge watching it over the past two days. Now what to do I think comparing this to the manga? It's really good, it was a pleasure to watch this anime. Ugh I haven't really written reviews before so I'm probably gonna suck at this\r\nStory: You're introduced to a 27-year-old man, (Kaizaki Arata)who's life is a bad shape, after quitting his job after 3 months and is now barely making ends meet. After a meet up with his \"friends\", he meets a man named Yoake Ryo, who is a part of the ReLIFE corporation, and gives Arata a chanceto change his life, by making him 17 again, and also to do his third year of high school over again. You see him change and make others change around him as he goes through high school life again. Now what do I say about this part considering that I've read the manga. I really like the story, I love to see Kaizaki evolve as a character considering his past and also him influencing others around him, making them evolve as well. I don't really want to spoil anything so I won't go any further than that. All I'll say is that the story in the manga, had a slight darker tone which I really liked but that doesn't mean I'm against this. It also uses the cliche, highschool life problems story thing, but makes something new out of it, because of Arata actually being 27 years old in a 17 year old body of his. The story is a 9/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Uh, I don't really know what to say about this. I guess it pretty much follows the manga art. So 10/10? Sorry I'm not picky on art, unless it's that 3D anime stuff, ugh that makes me cringe.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening I really like, it's catchy and I love listening to it every time I watched each episode. The endings are meh to me, I never usually listen to ending really as I don't find them as good as the openings. When it came to the sound in particular scenes and moments, I think it was spot on. It made me more interested in the drama, or added comedic effect in scenes. Sound is a 8/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well I adore Kaizaki Arata, a lot as a character. As I said in the story bit it was so fun to watch him evolve and help his friend out with their problems. Kaizaki is a sociable person, who everyone likes and gets really bad grades. He is always ready to help, and get involved with his friends personal problems, though that can be a negative at times. But I admire that as a character about him. Yoake Ryou and Onoya An, they're great characters too, but I can't really tell you without spoiling their roles. Hishiro Chizuru, is a smart girl and get's top grades in school, but emotionally dumb, like really emotionally dumb. Honestly, she will ask you straight up about things you wouldn't be straight up about. She is also a very lonely person which makes me feel really sad for her. Though she evolves as a character a lot by the end of the anime, mainly due to Arata. Kariu Rena, she is a very competitive person, she hates losing against someone. She is a firm but kind loving person. Though she is stubborn as hell and won't show her true feelings to anyone. Her competitiveness , leads to a lot of negativity for her as you will see during the anime. But I like her character, although she seemed kinda tsundere, which is the cliche type of character which I usually don't like. She is a great character again none the less. Ooga, Kazoumi, he is the smart and good looking guy in this group. Though he is dense as fuck. Like really dense, thank god the MC was not like this, otherwise I would stab myself, *ahem* Infinite Stratos. He's a very likeable character as well, and cares about his peers a lot especially a certain someone \"wink wink*. Also on another note Hishiro is freaking dense as hell as well. I find him great to interact with Arata, they have a great connection as friends, and they are just funny and great together. The other supporting characters are good as well, though they aren't looking through as deeply as the main characters, excluding Tamarai Honoka. Overall I give a characters a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I truly love ReLIFE, there was never ever a dull moment for me. It was a great ride and pleasure to watch Arata's and his friends high school lives through part of the third year, and here's to hoping for another season of ReLIFE. Enjoyment 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I give it a 9/10. I would absolutely rewatch all these episodes if I had the time. It was not absolutely perfect, as there a few cliche moments in my opinion but it was damn good. Give it a watch I tell you.  Do it now.\\n\\n\r\nP.S Sorry for spelling and crappy construction of sentences don't usually write reviews as I say again",

            "content": "Just finish marathon the anime so I decide to write the anime as my memory and impression are still relatively fresh. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nRead the synopsis for plot overview. The story is very good with a pretty fresh concept. The writing and dialogues are solid. It manages to balance between drama and comedy extremely well. It neither forces down pointless and forced drama nor shoehorns in comedy for the sake of lighten up the atmosphere like other drama seinen anime. Everything feel genuine here which I like a lot. The story is not perfect however, as a lot of plot point are focus on a certaincharacter which annoyed me at times, but I do like that character and because of that character\u2019s problems that we get to as much interesting scenario as we get in the series.\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation getting a 10 may be an overkill for some, but the reason I gave it that score is because it captures the essence of the manga art style perfectly. Granted, the source material is a coloured web manga series so they can just copy and paste the character design over, but I\u2019m glad that they did just that since the art style is one of the reasons that I like the manga as much as I did. The animation of the series is also solid as they manage the flow between the normal style for normal situation and the chibi style for comedy perfectly as it helps the show unity and does not make the scenes feel segmented. \\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime is also solid if not a little questionable as it\u2019s mostly consisted piano pieces. They are fine for the most part if not a little repetitive and feel out place at times. However, the opening and endings more than make up for it. The opening \u201cButton\u201d is awesome and its presentation really do a good job to showcase the show as a whole and I did not skip it even once. The number of ending in this series is honestly insane as in almost every episode we get a new ending. As some might think that they would value more quantity than quality, therefore these ending must be suck. And by that I say no, all of the ending end up being quite enjoyable to listen to with some being very good, such as \u201cAsu e no Tobira\u201d and \u201cYuki no Hana\u201d. I\u2019m listening to these songs while reading this review right now so they must be quite good don\u2019t you think. Each ending also consists of a different picture that can pretty much summarize the whole episode which is a nice touch.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this series in this show are very likeable and fun to watch. I would not call them realistic as each of them have their own quirks. However, the way they act are very realistic and reasonable which making them really easy to related to. Even though I wish the character arc would have been more equally separated as I feel one character gets too much attention and some other don\u2019t. However, at this point in the show, it is quite early in the series so I don\u2019t really mind. The story arises from it is also interesting so I cannot complain. This also one of those rare show that I can confidently say that I like all of the character in the show, main and side characters included. They are very fun to watch (sorry to repeat myself here, I just want to clarify myself a bit further).\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI started the manga series since early last year and I have high expectation for this show when it was announced last year. It\u2019s also one of those show that not only meet my expectation but it even manages to even excel in every possible way. The show that was managed to do this in recent years for me was Shokugeki no Soma season 1. I enjoy the show from start to end and the so call \u201cending\u201d does not bother me at all. I even think that they end it perfectly.\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4\\n\r\nThe show is amazing and I believe that it would be one of the best this season and definitely in top 5 for me this season. I strongly recommend this show to those who want a relax show but don\u2019t want the show to be boring to death. Those who seek comedy and grown up problems will most likely find it enjoyable as well. I would like to end this review with one more line. \u201cRead the manga after this as shit is going down in the manga\u201d :]\\n\\n",

            "content": "What would you do if you were offered a pill that could make you look younger and give you the opportunity to re-do a year of your life? Well that is the basic premise of ReLIFE.\r\nThis premise is what drew me to this anime, because what adult hasn\u2019t wished they could re-do some part of their life. Even though stories like these aren\u2019t anything new and they are always told in some comedic way that in the end makes you glad that you can\u2019t have a do-over in life. I was still intrigued by how this story would be told.\r\nComico decided to take a pageout of Netflix book and released all 13 episodes in one day, so no waiting til next week to find out what happens. So if you are a Crunchyroll Premium Member, you can binge watch the whole series in just under 6 hours. \\n\\n\r\nSo here are my personal thoughts on this series ...\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nArata Kaizaki is a 27 year old unemployed man who fails to land a job after having numerous interviews. Due to complications at his last job, he quit after just three months with the company. As a result of not being able to find steady work he becomes a NEET, loses his confidence, and feels like a failure amongst his friends who have found success in their lives. One fateful evening he meets Ryo Yoake, a man who works for ReLIFE Laboratory who gives Arata a chance to redeem himself and possibly change his life. All he has to do is become a test subject for ReLIFE and they will pay his rent and all expenses for one year. Ryo offers him a pill and gives him the choice to use it or not. The next morning Arata wakes up and realizes that he looks 17 years old. Ryo shows up with a contract and a tells Arata that he will spend the next year as a third year high school student. In exchange for not telling anyone about the test he is participating in and showing that he can change his life,  has a chance to be offered a job when the year is complete. Arata accepts and so begins his ReLIFE journey.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters from our MC to supporting characters were very likeable and relatable. Their character development was amazing and you will become emotionally attached to every one of them.\\n\\n\r\nArata surrounds himself with classmates immediately and bonds with them all throughout the series. We meet Rena Kariu who is curt, competitive, and plays volleyball on the school\u2019s team. Next we have Kazumi Ooga who is smart, but a bit clueless and is the male class rep. An Onoya is a friendly new transfer student who struggles with her studies and hides a secret from most of the group. Ryo Yoake is the ReLIFE Labs employee posing as a student so he can monitor Arata\u2019s progress and support his ReLIFE choices. Lastly we have Chizuru Hishiro, she is a top student and female class rep who is socially awkward, blunt, and a bit oblivious to other people\u2019s feelings. Add to this mix are the supporting characters Tamarai, Inukai, Asaji, and Miss Amatsu that frequently have interactions with our main group.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting and Animation\\n\\n\r\nSeveral known voice actors/actresses make up the cast. The choices for each character were fitting and good choices. Each character\u2019s voice fit them and their feelings and dialogue were conveyed in a manner that drew you in. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation seemed to be the norm, not too flashy or dull, mostly clean and pleasing to the eye.  I did notice a few odd issues with facial features or expressions in the far away shots, but nothing that was unbearable or ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound/OST\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime that I\u2019ve watched that had a wide variety of music in just thirteen episodes. The OST consists of one Opening song and thirteen different Ending songs. The OP song fit the opening sequence well and has a nice catchy rhythm to it. The ED songs ranged from jazzy sounding music to piano riffs, all had a nice relaxing mood to them and fit the various endings well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a MUST WATCH for the Summer 2016 season! Going into this I was expecting a comedic, slice of life, typical high schooler anime, but I was surprisingly wrong. Not only did it tell the story of our MC\u2019s present situation, but it delved into his past and what actually caused him to quit his job and become a NEET. Arata\u2019s school life and home life were complete opposites, but that is what made him such a great MC. His personality and his life experiences are what made him so approachable and easy to talk to, that I could see myself hanging out with someone like him. All of the characters stories were well written and made you feel a connection with everything they went through. The overall story touched on so many subjects such as social awkwardness, jealousy, love, regret, friendship, competition self worth, and even death. Many of these situations were handled exactly the way most high schoolers would handle them. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was a nice twist to the adult do-over fantasy that is commonly seen in movies today. This anime has something that everyone can relate to and will probably draw the attention of older anime watchers. In the course of the story we only seen 4-6 months of Arata\u2019s year of ReLIFE, so I for one am hoping that we get a second season that covers the rest and maybe beyond. The reveal of Test Subject 001 surprised me as I was leaning towards a different character throughout the series. The ending was very satisfying, but left me wanting more episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this series a 9/10! Definitely take the time to check this one out!\\n",

It looks very clean and it's pleasing to the eyes IMO, and I love the chibi stylization in every comedy scenes.\r\nThe sound however, BGMs are very repetitiveand are most all of them are piano sounds nothing really gave a strong impression to me. Opening theme was very catchy, and the Ending themes were kinda cut awkwardly every time the song is about to end, they just cut the song or fade it out, making it very weird for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are very unique, most of all the conflicts were somehow related to Kariu tho (which is great for me)\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment was great, every joke was funny, the past of every character are very interesting. I can't believe I already finished it, I'm gonna miss this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave it a 9/10 for it's refreshing story, clean artstyle, and great characters. Would recommend for Slice of Life/Romance fans ^_^b\\n\r\nNow I'll start reading the manga, thanks for reading, and bye bye",

The trope of reincarnation and reliving is being played a lot lately but I liked how this story simplified the trope and made it more relatable. \r\nThe scifi element of age reduction isn't abused too much and is use appropriately to set up the premise of \"what if a 27-year old man got a chance to do highschool again.\"\r\nThe reveals are hit better in the manga but the pacing isgreat in the anime. The characters are given a lot of space to breathe and grow and be fleshed out. They are layered and all have strength and faults making them more realistic and relatable.  \\n\\n\r\nI really appreciate that the art didn't hyper-sexualize the teenagers. Again, this support this premise a lot better than being just another anime with super sexy teens running around. The art is simple but compliments the story.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it.",

As someone who just left highschool (at the time) I thought the story was very relatable. The different plot arcs in the anime are enjoyable and do change the mood in the anime quite heavily. The story overall is well written and doesn't fail to keep you interested.\r\nArt: 10/10 \r\nI really liked the artstyle in ReLife, the colours are nice andthe drawing in general doesn't drop the ball a single time. The drawstyle is a little bit different compared to the manga (I like the way they draw the characters better in the Manga) but it's definitely still a very strong point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have read my other reviews you know I'm not an expert in sounds so I will keep this short. The voice actors are good, the intro and outro music are good. And the music that guides the story, the soundtrack is also good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably THE strong point of this anime. They all have their own destinct personality and traits. The character progression is very noticeable and interesting to follow. While this show revolves around 1 main character it still succeeds in giving enough screentime to the other characters. The backstories are great and all characters are also realistically portrayed. In general very well written/designed characters!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show really entertains me every time I watch it and it will keep doing so in the future. If you liked the story but thought the series was a bit too short don't hesitate to read the manga, it's still ongoing and is incredibly detailed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely in my top 5 of best anime's I've seen. I would recommend this anime to everyone who likes a serious anime that still offers quite a lot of laughs. This is still one of the best Romcoms I've ever seen so don't hesitate to give it a shot!",

The show really worked well on thecharacter development but sometimes tends to stress too much on the \"drama\" or maybe I just think that since I'm a guy.\\n\\n\r\nSo i think you should watch the anime, just watch the whole thing even if you feel like you're getting bored at the 9 - 10th episode, just finish it, it really is a \"heartwarming\" anime with an apt ending.",

            "content": "ReLife is still one of my favorite romantic comedies thus far. Reason being is that this anime is so cute and enjoyable. I usually dislike how romantic comedies turn really melodramatic really quickly but this anime does a great job balanacing it all out. The story is amazingly really relatable. Although I'm not an adult, I did graduate high school and watching the anime through Kazaki's view(an adult) surprisingly made me realize how different high school is compared to other parts of life. The characters are absolutely adorable and likable. I LOVE the main MC and heroine and I LOVE the supporting cast, everyone isjust so helpful, understanding, and funny. Before I go off tangent about how much I love this anime lets get right into the review. \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story isn't unique. I've watched 17 again and other \"high school again\" storylines but this is really unique in the fact that everyone loses their memories after the experiment is over. This issue becomes an apparent problem later on in the anime/manga but it's an interesting concept of \"no one is going to remember me so should I do whatever I want or should I just do my best in the present. I liked the storyline as it's well done and developed really well. Everything makes sense and because of the clarity and unique aspects of the story I give it a 9/10.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI really liked the art. They integrated a lot of the webtoon art into the anime so it has it's own distinct feeling but the characters look great and the emotions they put forth is HILARIOUS. I love the little faces the main MC or the main heroine make as they tease their other classmates. Other than that, I had trouble distinguishing two characters while watching the anime but other than that the art is solid and really fits well with the story. \\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI usually am very lenient on my sound rating because in most anime, the voice acting is pretty top notch and ReLife is no slouch in that category. The OP is really cute, although the beginning makes it look like a super old anime, I REALLY like the op. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS ARE AWESOME. ALL OF THEM ARE GREAT. ALL OF THEM. The main MC is AWESOME AND REALISTIC. He thinks just how a guy thinks and is righteous is in own ways. The way he approaches the situation he's put in is very mature and he is HILARIOUS. He loves to tease his friends but also knows when to joke and mess around. Hishiro is one of the typical \"I'm the best student in the class with no social skills\" heroine but she's funny in her own ways. The way she smiles and handles social situations is just enjoyable. There's nothing really special about her but with character is well balanced and she isn't frustrating to watch unlike many socially awkward characters in other anime. The other side characters are amazing in the sense that they just get what's going on. They're aware of their surroundings and their shortcomings. Everyone has problems and this anime makes it clear that despite everyone's problems, people must go through them to become better people. And the side characters help the main MC and main heroine realize these important lessons in life. \\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime. I went into it not expecting much but I ended up loving it. Everything about this anime touched me in the right ways and the main attraction of this anime has to be its relatebility. Every lesson is a lesson that can be applied in real life and that's the best part of this anime. I recommend this anime to EVERYONE. I'm currently reading ReLife and it gets better trust me. I eagerly await it's new chapter everyday so that goes to show how much I love ReLife.",

            "content": "A high school slice of life comedy with no fanservice? Onoya to the rescue!\r\nStory:\r\nWho hasn't dreamed about going back and relive your life, but this time not making the stupid mistakes you did before? Arata gets this second chance (sort of) and tries to improve himself as good as he can. I haven't seen many similar works, which is kinda surprising, as this is a fantasy everbody can relate to. Maybe it's easier if you are past the age of going to school, but even high schoolers have regrets about the past, so I feel this should be relatable for everybody. The fact that Arataends up trying to fix other peoples lifes makes it even better, as he is growing as a person by acting helpful towards others. The only problem I have, is that we had the same story twice, but more about that later.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe character design is a bit lacking, often their animations look a bit subpar. For everything else however, this anime does a pretty good job. Especially the final episode is very beautiful to look at. You can also somewhat see who the animators favourite characters are (An looks much more detailed than the others  in close-ups for example).\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMany people say that the soundtrack is awful. Well, it certainly isn't great, but it is not as bad as everybody makes it out to be. I agree however, that Relife should have had a more fitting background music than just a bunch of expressionistic piano solos. The opening on the other hand was not bad, felt like a sitcom a bit. As far as I understand, the different ending themes are songs that were popular about ten years ago (when Arata was in school), which I thought was a pretty cool gimmick.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nArata is a very helpful boy, which makes him quite likeable. Provided you are of advanced age, he is also very relatable (kids these days, you know?). It was nice that nobody in this show was mean or evil in any way (excluding Aratas coworkers from his flashbacks), they just had self doubts, misunderstandings and other teenage problems. For me, Kariu was the most interesting and multilayered character, so I was a bit angry when they did the same thing with her twice (learning to cope with her inferiority complex).\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nRelife is a very enjoyable watch and something different for people who have seen every other slice of life anime. It has a very relaxing athmosphere, even though it is not free of drama, but you never really have to shake your head at the stupidity of the characters. The ending, which I won't spoil obviously, was very nice and brought somewhat of a conclusion, yet it leaves room for a possible second season. If one can ignore the problem with Karius story being repeated for no reason, this anime was quite enjoyable.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.8/10",

            "content": "This anime is pretty good if you're looking for a pseudo-school type of show. It's especially interesting if you're someone in your 20s. The concept is alright, but there are quite a few holes that they don't really attempt to give any explanation. For example, the premise of the show is that the protagonist, Kaizaki Arata, is part of an experiment to send NEETS back to high school to rehabilitate them in some way. However, they don't really ever explain the technology behind this, or why this experiment was begun, or who is funding it. It's just a bunch of faceless business people who apparentlywant to pay NEETs to return to high school. I'm also a little confused on the logic of how regressing a NEET back to high school is supposed to be a plausible solution, but whatever. I also find myself wondering just how many \"kids\" at this high school are actually the age they're supposed to be... \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself of Kaizaki in high school, etc, is pretty good as far as school animes go. It's nostalgic without being overly dramatic and most of the characters are likable for the development they've received so far. Most of the main characters are interesting enough to make you want to know more, and the ending is a good twist to keep you intrigued for next season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that this show is relatively entertaining for what it is. It's not an action anime; there are not thrills each episode. But the story moves along at a decent pace and the characters aren't bad. It's nothing particularly special or great, but it's not particularly bad either.",

That sentence doesn't sound that interesting but the anime is actually better.\r\nSo there is an organisation that has a purpose to \"rehabilitate\" old people who are no good in society? It isn't clearly stated but that seems to be their purpose. If you don't look into the logistics of making your body younger while maintaining the insides of an old person then the anime is quite enjoyable up to a certain point. The character developement and backstory that was introduced in the beggining is actually interesting, it differsfrom a normal slice of life because it gives you the view from an old person who has already done that stuff. He tries to befriend classmates and socialises and rethinks his life. There is also some cool lore about the organisation and a mystery about the previous subject. Half way through it sadly messes up pretty bad. It wavers from the main story line and starts focusing on other characters. If they had some small influence over a couple of episodes then it would be fine but they get full episodes dedicated to their backstorys and that is complete poop.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progressed so well in the first 3 episodes with enjoyable character developement, information about the lore and plot moved on, they just stabbed themselves in the leg when they wanted to focus more on the other classmates.\\n\\n\r\nYou can also check out my full review on it on Youtube and maybe give some feedback which is greatly needed to improve my channel at MudanTV ReLIFE Anime Review",

He pops the given pill and dives in...\r\nSpoilers--\r\nThis anime had some really good lines in it and also a tonne of jokes that had me in stitches with deathly frequency. \r\nAt the same time, I really enjoyed the more serious themes - such as why Kaizaki Arata would throw away a year of his life to go to high school everyday (just to be forced to take remedial tests), how he ended up from grad school to quitting his first job in 3 months (unheard of in Japan...unlessyou want to end your career entirely) to being a NEET.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end ReLIFE also reveals what happened to Kaizaki's senpai and also the absurdity and inhumanity of the \"black\" company he worked for. These companies have a really bad name in Japan so it made Kaizaki's background story more believable for me. \\n\\n\r\nCompared to \"society\", the episode centered on the emotional ups and downs in school were much more lighthearted. The two parts of the story balanced out very well and I doubt I would have enjoyed ReLIFE as much, if one of the two were missing. \\n\\n\r\nOther comments:\\n\r\nFor those of us who love a bit of 90s nostalgia...the ending song changes every episode. Most of the songs are from the 90s and are part of Kaizaki's MD collection.",

            "content": "First review so really bad. (Ok done with revisions.)\r\nRelife is about a \"NEET\" (he has a part-time job) who was given the choice to take a drug that'll make him 10 (?) years younger and study as a high school student, again, and use it as a means to be reintroduced into society. The concept of getting back to one's feet is something that I really appreciate but the means the anime used, which was turning younger does not really make me that happy (and somewhat disappointed) since it is akin to that of him getting reincarnated. In other words, another device for the NEETSin Japan for escapism. So, that\u2019s basically the premise of the anime. As for the main theme/s, we\u2019ll talk about that later.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of the show, as always, are like any typical modern anime, people who has problems, which is really not a bad thing, since that means that there is a potential for them to develop as better ones. The problem with most modern anime characters is that they have backstories that are seriously very dramatic that you\u2019d find it very unrealistic. That is not the case here in this anime. It being unreal is toned down considerably that it can be considered as realistic. It is quite interesting to see the other cast of the show being fleshed out and some being also given slight developments. Although that is the case, it still means nothing since they are completely forgotten after their stories end, NOT. I am quite surprised that this is not the case in this anime. Most of those with resolved problems are still actually given important roles for the next arc or so, which is really good. But, of course, there is a problem again, which is the fact that there is a lesser time given to the main character. Rather than being the main character, it is more like he is now the main support character, which is VERY BAD in my book (the red(?) haired girl seems to be the mc, lol). Although this is the case, I guess it is still okay since the problems and solutions made by the author to the real side characters are more than satisfactory, NOT! Although they are relatable to most viewers (which are adolescents), I still think that the solutions given are VERY basic, aside from the solution shown for the girl bestfriends, which I consider as basic to ok. As the show has 13 episodes only, when some characters say things that one would normally say to close friends or whatnot, I find it quite hard to believe. With so many problems involved, there actually aren\u2019t enough time to actually show the closeness of the characters with each other (or at least within their groups). And yeah, most characters are one or two dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe anime (until 10th episode, actually) has 3 main themes that are not really related to each other and are only connected with one thing, which is society. This already means a VERY bad thing in my standard. Although this is the case, as parts, they are quite good enough to watch, albeit, again, the solutions to the problems are not things that one would really appreciate much. It was all good and well up till the 10th episode. 11th episode made every thing downhill. Why? Because it became romance all of a sudden. Although there had been foreshadowing on the previous episodes, the fact that there were no problems mixed with these romances made me have a bad feeling towards this anime, but not that much. Why? Because there is still the possibility of a case of a 27 year old guy presumably starting a relationship with a 17 year old one, which is still an interesting thing to see. The actions brought by two supporters making them have a relationship even though they know the real age of both parties irritated me though, until that part, which completely made me disappointed with the anime altogether since I know, the possibility that it\u2019ll turn into a low-tier anime was just raised exponentially with that. And most climaxes are quite done melodramatically which is shit. Shit, I tell you. But who cares anyway, right? They are, after all, high school students (15-18 years old), right? NO F WAY! And gee, have I already said that theme explorations are basically thrown out of the window? Not yet? Yeah, it is thrown out of the window. You don\u2019t present your themes in only 2-3 episodes. That\u2019s basically what this show did. This is a series, damn it! This is not a movie. Writer, you are not Miyazaki so quit dreaming of writing something like Princess Mononoke. Ok, this\u2019s quite excessive. Anyway, the story\u2019s basically shit.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION and SOUND (7/10) & (6/10):\\n\\n\r\n[Original: I have little knowledge about these but I think art & animation is slightly above average (6/10) and sound average (5/10) ] \\n\\n\r\nI skimmed through the episodes to confirm my conjecture and it seems it was a wrong one. So here goes, but still amateurish: The art seems okay, ordinary, but it fits with school life so it is still great. The change of the art style to fit with what a character feels or something like that is also good. Character designs are okay. Animation is also fluid, nothing great but still good. Sound is nice, osts come whenever you need them and op and ed are alright, I guess. Voice actors and actresses fits with their characters, too.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first modern anime in a long time that captured my interest and made me watch till the end without feeling bored. Good job with that.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT (5.4/10):\\n\\n\r\nA nice time waster that has ok themes not fully explored. Characters are average, art and sound are above average. It has no conclusion so you might want to try reading the manga after.\\n\\n",

This one has the kinda 'supernatural' feel (about changing your appearance and re-living your highschool years), so no wonder I was hooked. \r\nEven though I didn't have that much free time, I still finished this in two days, which is a great sign for any anime I watch.\r\nCharacters are totally relatable. Everyone, from our failed, past-haunted mc, to support characters who are casual high schoolers, struggling to achieve their goals and enjoy their last year in high school.

Maybe I just watch too much Danganronpa).\\n\\n\r\nWhat I absoutely hated was Hishiro-san, one of the mc's in this anime.

But that's just me and that's subjective.\\n\r\nWe even got some romance in the end...\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was trying to say with this messy review is that you should totally watch this if you want a lighthearted, somewhat inspiring and fun anime with characters you can relate to by all 100%.",

But after a while they stopped even mentioning that or making it the prime feature of the story. They could have given the main character any type of backstory, and the anime would have stayed the exact same. That's how pointless that \"going back in time\" part was. They hardly mentioned it ingreat importance throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the anime threw out that novel idea out the window, it just ended up being a slice of life, kind of drama kind of romance kind of comedy type show. But instead of focusing on any one of those categories, it instead tried to mosh it all together and now you don't know what exactly you're looking at. The drama was very weak, like how one character is competitive and is jealous that someone took her spot for student representative for her class. But instead of leaving it at just a mediocre drama and sort of a side thing, they blew it up out of proportion and tried to make something of it. And that wastes about a good half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for other aspects of the story. The romance doesn't go anywhere far and actually just teases you. The comedy was humorous but nothing new, granting you a giggle every now and then. But honestly that's it. Everyone on MAL is praising it to high heavens and honestly I don't know why. This show ended up being a badly made mediocre type slice of life show with a slightly novel idea that they decided to throw out the window. I found no enjoyment in the show in any regard because it didn't feel as though they knew where they wanted to go. They didn't know whether to be a drama a romance or a comedy or maybe they wanted to be all of it but either way none of the those aspects of this show really went there for me.",

            "content": "ReLife is probably one of the most enjoyable shows I've ever seen in any medium. It's not the typical anime show that uses anime tropes either. It's got a simple premise: Ryou Yoake, offers Kaizaki Arata a drug that will make him appear much younger externally, and to attend high school in an attempt to rehabilitate him into society after quitting his first job out of university.\r\nReLife's greatest strength is that it's a drama concerning that very topic. As a guy that didn't enter university until he was 26 I was able to empathize with Kaizaki when he couldn't pass his math tests. I waspretty good at math in high school, but by the time I got to university I had forgotten everything. It was one of those use it or lose it things. I also thought it was a little funny.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will say that my biggest caveat about this show is that it ended. I wished it had continued on. Hopefully there will be a second season, but knowing how anime is produced mostly to get people to buy and read the manga, it probably won't happen.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the strength of the characters and the narrative the show didn't have to fall back on innovative tricks, like using \"interesting\" and \"difficult\" angles in shots to be a more compelling experience. That's not to say that those things aren't important, it's just that sometimes it's refreshing to see something stripped down to the basics, and not getting fancy. Such things probably would have also been incredibly distracting here.\\n\\n\r\nI would probably recommend ReLife as one of the anime to start anybody off with the medium.",

            "content": "I have a pretty simple test to whether or not I recommend anime to others: if it makes me watch the entire series in one go, then I recommend it. The degree to which you\u2019ll like this show is going to depend on your life experiences \u2013 if you\u2019ve tried to work as an adult in society, I think this show will really click with you. Throughout the series, it addresses one of the most common questions young adults face: what does it mean to \u201cgrow up\u201d and become an adult?\r\nStory 7.5/10:\r\nThe premise of the story sounds a little bit like an eroge \u2013 Imean come on, a 27 year old reverting to the body of a 17 year old? Girls tend to be easily attracted to guys around their age that \u201cseem\u201d older, and Kaizaki not only seems older, but is older (just not on the surface). Luckily, the story itself is non-sexualized so I can definitely say that this show wasn\u2019t directed towards adolescent males, otherwise there would have been a lot more boobs and hot springs scenes, and to me, not having more of that is a big plus in the current state of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Kaizaki is the protagonist, the story doesn\u2019t really revolve around him. It focuses more on the inter-relationships between all of the other characters, with him being more of a mediator/observer. Other than the magic pill that turns his outer appearance to a 17 year old, everything else is pretty standard slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to go too deep into the character development and relationships here since I want to cover that in-depth in my full blog post (you can find that here: http://bit.ly/2a4nhuG). Let\u2019s just say ReLIFE has some of the most realistic depictions of characters that I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nI can pretty much sum up the moral of the story in one sentence: all of our insecurities and problems are self-inflicted. Yup, that\u2019s right: self-inflicted. And since they\u2019re self-inflicted, we can self-fix-it too. ReLIFE follows this moral throughout the show and if you keep an eye out for it, you\u2019ll find that pretty much every flaw and problem each character has was self-inflicted. This really resonates with me because I\u2019ve seen this happen time and time again in real life, including myself. I think you\u2019ll enjoy the show tenfold if you introspect while watching the characters develop and you\u2019ll find a lot of similarities and real life lessons.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a pretty simple guy when it comes to animation, I just take it at face value and if it doesn\u2019t really disturb my viewing experience then it\u2019s pretty good in my books.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 7.5/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was pretty on-point, although a bit loud at certain points (maybe it was just my headset). I thought they did a pretty good job of syncing up the music with the atmosphere of various scenes throughout the show. They even had Mika Nakashima\u2019s \u201cYuki No Hana,\u201d although I\u2019m a lot more familiar with the Korean version sung by Park Hyo Shin. Overall, the music wasn\u2019t good enough for me to go digging for the OST, but it still did pretty well as a behind-the-scenes support to enhance the different atmospheres in each scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI have to give this series a 9/10 because although most of the aspects of ReLIFE weren\u2019t super original, we shouldn\u2019t judge anime by its ability to be original (since then, everything is a copy of something else). Instead, I thought ReLIFE did an excellent job in doing one thing very well \u2013 character development. I think this series will really appeal to those who are young adults now and have experienced the ups and downs of human relationships and the difficulties of adapting to society.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nI have the full write up on my blog (https://closetsenpai.wordpress.com/2016/07/23/review-relife/), where I go over the review in more detail as well as discuss the characters in depth. If you're interested in Anime reviews or just talking about life and growing pains, I do that on my blog too.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\n-Closet Senpai\\n\\n",

It sounds depressing and not something you'd want to get to. But one day, a mysterious man shows up before you and tells you that you could change your life by taking a pill that'll make your body look like it was 10 years younger and you could restart your life and make it something worthy (there is your ReLIFE) all without any cost. Would you take the risk and start it all again?\r\nThis is what this storyis about. Kaizaki Arata, an unemploted 27 year old man that fails to get any job and make his life stabilize that is jumped by someone working for a company called ReLIFE, which promises Kaizaki to give him a second chance at life. It has its fair share of comedy and drama, with good moments that leave you asking yourself about life and decisions, how to act, what to feel, who to speak to. All characters have their own personality and their very own stories that seem simple, but yet, as simple as they sound they do represent real life personalities from people you might've known in school or know atm in your workplace.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a SOL worth watching due to its relatable content to whatever age group you're most close to. Are you a highschool student? Watch it to see what you can do and learn to prevent your life from going downhill. Are you almost 30 or in your mid 20s and still haven't done anything for yourself to be somewhere? Watch it and then have a good look inside you to figure out what you did wrong and start again with your head high and stop living in the past.",

            "content": "I guess you've all seen \"17 Again\" with Zac Efron. Well, this anime is kinda an anime version of it. So give it up for our 17 again protagonist and his story in the anime ReLIFE. Enjoy!\r\nPlot and Story Line\r\nBe honest with your self. If you met a complete stranger in the middle of the night offering you a pill that would make you 10 years younger for one year, would you take it? I don't know if I would. I guess it'd depend of the situation. But our protagonist, Kaizaki Arata was reckless and took the pill, turning him into a teenager again.\r\nThe storyof ReLIFE follows him, a NEET and jobless man, that fails every job interview after quitting his first job only after three months. Without any thought he takes the pill and accepts the offer to be part of an experiment for one year. For one year, he becomes a 17-year-old-teenager and goes to school again. And this is were all the fun and drama begins.\\n\r\nThese two words are exactly the words that describe the anime in the best way possible. \\n\\n\r\nDRAMA-It's high school and of course drama is an indispensable part of it. As a slice-of-life, school and romance anime, ReLIFE really didn't disappoint me when it comes to that. ReLIFE is all about the usual problems of every teenager. Trough various side stories, ReLIFE brings us back to all the high school drama everyone, literary everyone has been trough. It reminded me so much of my high school time (even thinking about it makes me sad). The most interesting thing about ReLIFE are its side stories. There is a side story for nearly each of the main characters. In that way you don't get the feeling that Kaizaki Arata's story is the focus of the story. The story that takes up most of the limelight is probably the one about the friendship of Rena and Honoka. But it is also important because trough that happenings, the relationship of Arata and the main female character of ReLIFE, Hishiro Chizuru develops on a higher level. You might think that their relationship is mostly in the background trough out the first half of the show, but quite the plot twist happens afterwards. And believe me, this is the one think you never expected to happen. As said, drama, drama, drama but enjoyable drama. It keeps you interested in all the happenings the whole time and when you finish the 13th episode you just want more.\\n\r\nStill high school isn't the only drama you have. A kind of serious drama happens in the adult life of Arata. He is well known for quitting his job only after three months but the story to it gives you quite the goosebumps. It is a story that pictures the unfortunate truth of our society in a very direct way. Yet the anime isn't that dark and serious as you might think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFUN-I don't know why there is no \"comedy\" written in the genre description of this anime. ReLIFE is mainly a slice-of-life but I really LMAO-ed in almost every episode. It was hilarious to see Arata dealing with high school again. I mean he still has a mind of a 27-year-old and he also thinks that way. Being way maturer than the others he puts him self in awkward situations that are just entertaining to watch. Arata often scolds the others or gives them helpfull advice. He literary turns into that \"when I was in high school...\" adult every time someone needs help. The most hilarious moments are definitely the Chizuru-Arata moments later on in the anime and trust me it will just get more hilarious if they stick to the manga for the second season. (Yes, ReLIFE is a manga adaptation and it is amazing. And colorful.) TMS Entertainment hasn't announced the second season yet, but considering the popularity of ReLIFE, it will probably happen. \\n\r\nON THE WHOLE-This anime definitely deserves a 9,5/10 for the story. It is interesting, it is fresh, it is dramatic and as said a couple of times, it is hilarious. MAL rated it as a 8.37 but it definitely deserves a higher score. No plot holes at all, the story is smooth and the development is not forced. Thumbs up for the story and plot of ReLIFE. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAnd another amazing thing about ReLIFE. The makers of this anime really put in a lot effort to make this show awesome in every aspect. When I think about the overall impression of all the characters I can surely say that the characters of this anime are among the best I have ever seen. They are all so unique and interesting in each way. Also you get to know all of them because the anime really concentrates on the personality of each character. The characters become alive and you really feel them and their stories. When I now look back at each character I really get the feeling that they are all so important for the story development. And on top of that, I love them all. They all undergo a different personality development and that's the thing that counts the most. A good story that each characters brings along with their personality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nIt is a 2016 anime, of course the animation is good. It is as colorful as it should be, whereas the colors are bright and smooth. No objections. The style is nothing special. The usual slice-of-life style with some funny animations in the hilarious scenes of the anime. That's it. I really need to add something to this section of the review. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nTo conclude, the anime is amazing. The story is really something new, something fresh and it stick out as a unique story that you don't get to see every day. It keeps you on tenterhooks the whole time and makes you crave more and more. It is extremely entertaining. With amazing side stories you get to know each character in the anime which is really helpful because as good as they are you want to know everything about them. The animation also doesn't have any flaws just like the anime in general. I really loved it and I am sure you'll love it too. And while waiting for the second season of ReLIFE, why not just ReWATCH, the first one.\\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl <3\\n",

ReLIFE is a breath of fresh air whilst containing familiar tropes in a romance of school of life because of how extremely endearing the characters are and how quickly they crept into my heart. People will argue that it's not at all special. Yes, it is true that there is nothing new about many of the elements here but the way it delivers on the characters and their interactions is what the appealing thing is. \r\nOur main character, Arata, is particularly great because of what we are able to get from him. Most people in Japan,I believe, think extremely badly of \"NEETs\" or hikikomori's. But, we don't really know what happened to them. We judge too quickly. From Arata's perspective, we were able to understand and get to know him as a person instead of as the \"half-NEET\" he was first introduced as. He shows that struggles in life does not automatically make a person bad or detestable. \\n\\n\r\nThe series features many genuine and relatable lessons from life's ups and downs to the complexity in the simplicity of falling in love. ReLIFE is something that I will recommend to those who want to witness and can appreciate a short journey of a guy changing others as he learns to change himself. It is heart-warming as well as hilarious. A great gem!",

            "content": "Every new season we anime fans are treated with countless slice of life shows; shows which do nothing more than make us watch other people living their life. These type of shows tend to attract a certain audience and also are hit or miss. Thankfully ReLIFE is a 13 episode hit.\r\nStory\r\nThe story follows Arata Kaizaki, an unemployable 27 year old single man living off his parents money. After leaving his job three months after his graduation, Kaizaki's life never got any better and spiralled downwards. After going to another interview he was turned down, to make matters worse his mother calls him and tells himthat she is cutting off his money. Beaten down and having already given up on the world, Kaizaki finds himself face to face with a mysterious man, Ryo Yoake, who asks him to be part of a yearlong experiment with Yoake's company paying for Kaizaki's living expenses and a guaranteed job at the end of it. And all Kaizaki has to do is swallow a pill. Oh and redo the last year of high school while he looks like a 17 year old.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes really drive home that Kaizaki is out of his element, looking around his classmates he keeps reminding himself and the viewers that he in fact ten years older than all of them, and hell, his homeroom teacher is only 25!\\n\\n\r\nThese first couple of episodes really brings home the comedy aspect of the show; it's slightly off-the-wall, it's incredibly awkward as Kaizaki has to pretend to be a normal 17 year old student. His interactions with the other characters are joyous to watch and eventually he starts becoming quite comfortable with his new one year life. While the premise of the show isn't anything new, the way ReLIFE handles it gives a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nAs the episodes go on Kaizaki becomes closer and closer to Chizuru Hishiro, a stoic and friendless girl and through his influence she starts opening up and becomes part of his little circle of friends. However I did find that after a while Hishiro became somewhat of a side character, especially in the latter half of the show where it was more focused on another girl in the show, Rena Kairu, but I'll get into that later.\\n\\n\r\nAs a story it does little to change up the typical romcom/drama format that we've seen countless times but that never stopped it being enjoyable for me. Admittedly I'm a sucker for those type of shows but alas. The show does start falling into the typical romcom format after the first few episodes but I found that it didn't bother me all that much, it's what happens in the last year of school and as viewers we are more akin to Kaizaki and his opinion of his surroundings as a fully grown adult.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm no expert in this department, I did really enjoy the look of this anime. It's not the greatest designed show in the world but it does what it needed to. The backgrounds are typical high school setting and don't do anything to change that up, not that I was expecting anything groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few moments when the characters become quite chibi-like or their facial expressions become less designed and over-the-top, which I found really fit the scenes in which they were used. As you can probably expect, this happened more in the comedy moments the anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was fairly decent, as was the OP theme and the different EDs for every episode. Nothing really stood out for me and I didn't rush to download the songs but that doesn't mean they were bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was really good though, each voice actor played the character very well. As in a romcom, there will be a variety of quick comedic timing that require a certain charm to bring the humour while there are also heartwrencing moments that need something to make the audience feel some emotion and I feel like everyone did that very well for their characters. Speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nReLIFE is a heavily character driven show, as such the characters will make or break it. The main character, Kaizaki, is incredibly enjoyable to watch and seeing how a 27 year old man copes with now being 17 is really entertaining. I found Kaizaki was my favourite character at the end of the show, something which shocked me as I normally find main characters to be some of my least favourite.\\n\\n\r\nHishiro is arguably the second main character and reminds me very much of Sawako from Kimi ni Todoke. For anyone that never watched/read that, Sawako is a shy/anti-social girl who doesn't have any friends, is always alone and when she smiles it looks like she's cursing you. Eventually Sawako gets two girl friends that are very close to her and she becomes incredibly close to the main male character. Hishiro is very much like Sawako - who admittedly wasn't an incredibly unique character, despite how much I adore her. As such I found myself really liking Hishiro, it's just a shame I liked her for another character and not herself.\\n\\n\r\nYoake, while not the main supporting character, is still a big character as without him the show couldn't exist. As part of Yoake's job he has to keep a distance from Kaizaki and observe him. As such he spends the majority of the beginning as a background character. It works though, it really really works and he's my second favourite character in the show. There is a flashback episode about him around halfway through the show which further explains this mysterious man but I always felt like there was more to him and I can't wait to find out more about him when I start reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI'd consider Kariu the third main character, and pretty much is the main focus of the latter half of the show. I'd say there around 5 story arcs in the show, 3 of which have Kariu as a big focus, 2 of which are the final two arcs of the show. She gets quite a lot of character development; starting off as someone who always wants to win and becoming... well what she ends up becoming, I'm not going to spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters come and go as they please and don't really add anything to the overall story. While Kariu and Honoka become the two girl friends that Hishiro has and they both have an arc about them, I never felt Honoka's presence was needed all that much. She also has two childhood friends; Nobunaga and Akira, who seemed really interesting to me but get little to no backstory and are there just for the sake of it. It would've been nice for these three to have been more relevant outside of the Kariu/Honoka arc but that's just not how this show goes.\\n\\n\r\nAn and Ohga are really good characters but fell flat overall as they weren't really expanded upon. An has one moment a few episodes in and Ohga has some in the last arc of the story but apart from that they just seemed to be there for the sake of it. While I liked Ohga's connection to Kariu I felt like it was added to further expand on her character rather than his character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall ReLIFE pleasantly surprised me with its beginning. Kaizaki trying to cope in this semi-new enviroment and freaking out about some of the new rules - mobile phones being confiscated for a month back in his day yet are perfectly fine now - were really great, though it did lead me to one question.\\n\\n\r\nWho exactly is this show aimed at?\\n\\n\r\nOn one hand it seems to be focused more towards the mid-20's audience; we're in Kaizaki's perspective 99% of the time and therefore his thoughts would match the thoughts the audience have about school. On the other hand though it seems like it targets the 17 year olds with how the show quickly progresses to a typical romcom/drama show. As such it makes it very difficult to recommend.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of romcoms then you will most likely enjoy this. The same can be said about drama too, however if you're a pure comedy fan and don't like the drama/romance aspect then you may want to steer clear of this. While the first few episodes will draw you in as it shifts genres you may feel thrown off, though there is the possibility that you'll become slightly attached to some of the characters and want to see more of them and their progression.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the genre though then you should not give this one a miss. It may not be the best romcom of all time but it's an enjoyable ride all the same. You won't be disappointed.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nstory\\n\r\n 7/10\\n\r\nanimation\\n\r\n 6/10\\n\r\nsound\\n\r\n 8/10\\n\r\ncharacters\\n\r\n 8/10\\n\r\noverall",

Story was paced perfectly and you can follow it easily without any problems.\r\nThe drama between some characters is well... dramatic and depressing, you can relate to some moments how you felt in your time at school.

This is a well written show that brings everything in one small package (EVEN THOUGH I WISH IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER) and makes you feel a lot of different emotions like happiness, sadness and even grief. \\n\\n",

It will help you get better at dealing with self-doubt. It maintains a consistent level of storytelling.\r\nCharacters?, You're going to love one of them, if not all of them. Each characters has a unique personality and this is what makes thisshow enjoyable, especially with the MC's development.\\n\\n\r\nArt? trendy. It matches the story and it's atmosphere. I even like those hilarious character design.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? It earned a spot to be one of my favorite anime in 2016. It's probably not a legendary anime. I just love it because it was so exciting to watch. I can't stop smiling.\\n\\n\r\nSounds? The opening and ending tracks did not left an amazing impact to me. But I like it how they set the tone for each moment. Especially the \"piano instrumental\" makes me calm and focused at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall= Anyone looking for a change of pace?, then this could be your answer to that question. I'm not really that good in expressing what I feel, feel free to witness the show so you can better understand some of the reviews and even make one yourself. I know not everyone is going to like this, but I hope you do! :D\\n\\n\\n\r\nGood day!!!",

            "content": "ReLIFE\r\nArt: The art in this show is pretty standard. In all honesty I felt that it was lacking a bit. My biggest complaint has to be that there was a few characters that looked nearly identical, and when we see the difference between young and old versions of these characters, the difference is negligible, hardly even noticeable. But when I wasn\u2019t focusing on how closely these characters were in the facial structure area, i did like the way the uniforms were presented at the school. While this isn\u2019t really a major part of the show, it is just something I liked because it wasn\u2019t youreveryday skirt or pants.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There wasn\u2019t a lot of sound to focus on in this show. I do remember it being nice to listen to, but often it was under the action. When I did hear it, mostly it was repetitive and catchy. I can\u2019t say I remember it well because I am writing this review in retrospect and It has been a couple weeks since i finished it. However, I can promise the sound isn\u2019t what will get you hooked to this show.\\n\r\nStory: The story is about a 27 year old NEET named Kaizaki, who is presented with an opportunity to take a pill to make him look 17 so he can go back to high school for a year and re-learn social skills. While this seems like something out of a twilight zone episode, Kaizaki takes the chance because the organization ReLIFE will pay for all his expenses for the year he is in school. Through his time in classes he meets friends and even tries to have good friendships with other 17 year old girls (as creepy as that sounds at first). He really wants to better himself and through this whole series we watch him Grow and learn from his friends. We also learn more about the people of ReLIFE and where this project all began. This show\u2019s story really pulls you in.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: I have to say; I was so excited when starting this show, it was a little weird that they put the whole series on Crunchyroll from the start, rather than week by week, but I\u2019m not complaining. From the start of the PV to the end of Episode 13 I was hooked. Every twist and turn I was there with the characters and the story. I must say that this show is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of slice of life stories. The comic relief, the serious moments, the friendships, and the story is all so amazing. I would\u2019ve like a little bit more diversity in the character art, but I figured it out before too long. At the end of the day, ReLIFE is a show that you can binge watch and not feel bad about. Watch this show!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10\\n\\n",

It also works to someone \"grown-up\" who gets really nostalgic about school.\r\nGave it a \"good\" 7 at almost every aspect, which to me is a nice grade I would give to any anime I enjoyed watching but wouldn't just rewatch...\r\nStory: 8 The story is gentle going, from the cover you get to think is another slice of life school anime, which it is but it has some special nostalgic feel all over and is a very smooth feeling because it doesn't really make yousad, it just makes the interactions around the story more interesting. This is also the first open ending anime I dont get bothered with, since its pretty much obvious what happens next or at least to me it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 fair, is not bad nor good, anything specially bad though, it's just average, a lil worse than I like anime art to be but it doesn't deserve the \"mediocre\" 5 since there are just too many BAD art animes out there. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 opening is okay and I do like a lot what they did with the soundtrack, it makes the correct awkward/suspense/funny feel whenever needed, there's a good job there with some really simple piano-based soundtrack that fits the anime perfectly and also gives it somewhat a silly but fun comedy atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 they did well with the characters,  you can automatically notice the grown-up signs protagonist shows which other characters he interacts with lack. The fact that despite he is more eperienced, he still has a lot to learn from younger ones is a quite realistic fact, also. Well-made personalities, not too much development on each of their stories but that's okay since aiming for more would have been greedy for a 12 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7, I watched the anime really fast. After finishing with puella magi madoka magica I wanted something to chill, feel calmer and have a bit of fun, this did it.",

The difficult thing is accepting the premise and idea behind the Relife experiment. In Western society, a company that can invent a drug that has both the ability and authority to put grown adults back into high school is a stretch, and potentially on a thin line between being completely okay and highly unacceptable. However if you manage to get past this, you'll find that ReLIFE focuses around core relationships and dealing with problems such as loneliness, trauma, depression, social anxiety and how sometimes over-achieving terrifies an individual due to another's jealousy. Every episode follows Arata's relationship with the friends he creates throughout his first term and seeing how far he'll go in order to create a meaningful impact in life and inspire self-confidence. \\n\\n\r\nThe bonds and connections Arata makes with these characters are enjoyable to watch. Although the setup does have a hint of tragedy, It\u2019s made highly clear that not only will Arata go to high school, but after the year is over, no one he interacted with will remember him. It\u2019s a looming feeling of loneliness and causes him to hold back on certain ideas or options. Regardless, he powers on and manages to create friendships that he'll most likely never forget.\\n\\n\r\nA short series, with just about enough impact to make you feel somewhat satisfied at the end of a hard day. It doesn't require an in-depth amount of knowledge, or seasons upon seasons of pointless filler episodes in order for you to finally hit the ending. It is simply a very well made anime, with a simple plot, enjoyable characters, heart-warming moments and a sense of fulfilment for anyone out of their high school years who wish to experience nostalgia for the more simple times. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7",

To the current workers in a society hell bent on work culture and to the youthful students going into the real world with bright dreams of what awaits them. \r\nWhat grabbed my attention right away was in episode 1, it showed the difference in thinking that 27 year old has compared to a High School-er. What has become Normal to us because of the society around us is still an unfathomable taboo to them in their sheltered years. Case in point: Cigarettes. It was also great to see how theMC's age lets him appreciate many thing we failed to noticed back HS.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many people who might consider ReLife to be a self-insert Travel back in time show. I disagree, unlike those shows, ReLife, doesn't give you a \"Forget your troubles\" vibe, instead it addresses those troubles and  speaks directly to it's audience about the choice they have and what to do with those troubles. 10/10 for me.",

Nothing's perfect.\r\nAnyhow, story is pretty straight forward, read the summary and you get the just of it, well I mean there's plot twist and all that but the general premise is pretty straightforward.\r\nArt (8) and sound (9) are, while not outstanding, well crafted and chosen, well above average actually. I don't know the ED songs, as I'm not Japanese and cannot understand the actual lyrics, but I'm going to wager aguess and say that they were from the 2000s and maybe the 90s and 80s, to reflect on the nostalgia felt by the MCs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10) are very well defined and have immense depth to them. It's often been said that an anime's quality is defined by the quality of its support cast. And this one have a awesome crowd of support cast. That or, there's just a lot of main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis might have something to do with the fact that the anime followed the plot of the manga almost to the letter. But still, well done in character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) and overall feel (9).. well I'm coming close my 30s myself so I can definitely relate to the general feel of this series...big time. I suppose I just haven't seen an anime like this before, I'm sure there are similar ones out there. But it's not every day you get watch an anime this relatable, despite this also being in a high school setting.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the charm of this anime for me I think, is that it's just so plain - it's got no outrageous plot and battles, or overarching continental/cosmic conflict, there's little sexualization or caricatures. It's just so realistic and so sweet... so.. so sweet it's giving me tooth decay...\\n\\n\r\nBut then I've always had a sweet tooth\\n",

Now we all have that regret of not doing something at some point in our lives.In truth, there's no going back to that. However,this series promises a better resolution to our dilemma. And this is exactly what the plot of this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nArata, the MC, is someone we adults can relate with. Let's face it: the outside world sucks. That's when ReLife comes into his life. He was given another chance to relive his youth, something all of us desire. What makes him more memorable as a character is that we have that characteristic similar to his. I can't name them exactly, but it's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was... familiar, at least to me. Then I found out that the series was based off a webcomic. Then it all made sense.

            "content": "Life is a bitch. If we get stuck on something in life and we don't know how to deal with it we end up realying on others, and if nobody's around to rely on it turns a pretty significant portion of your life into a big fat turd. Maybe your best friend dies, perhaps a family member passes throws you off the boat as you come out of the closet. At either of these points you may as well shut off your emotions, perhaps double-up by losing faith in your own abilities, or just block all social communication. From there, imagine getting the opportunity torelive one of the most socially active environments in the world: high-school. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nRelife tells the story of Arata Kaizaki, a 27-year-old man who's given up on finding a job at a company that aspires to something more than creating hearts of ice. Ryou Yoake, an employee at a company that's developed an experimental drug that makes people look 10 years younger. His job is to find adults with shitty lives and help them find their way in a high-school environment to support their progress in finding themselves (and a job) again. It's an interesting premise, and while story covers a lot of authentic subjects we rarely see this well-portrayed it doesn't quite do the characters justice. But the characters have enough traits to maintain interest. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters in anime rarely carry much depth. It's hard to write complex characters and keep an interesting narrative, one of many reasons why Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- has seen so much praise, but they don't necessarily make a story. There's more to storytelling than the lines and complexity of different characters, there's also the matter of how well you manage to transfer a level of empathy to the audience. Chances are that, if you haven't experienced a sense of dread or lifelessness you won't like this anime. That's because it's designed for people with those experiences: Students with no ambition other than making a living and hang out with friends; hard workers who lost their passion; emotional zombies; and plenty more. Relife manages to capture the individual moments that lead to losing your way, we witness the student life through the eyes of those who have experienced it. This is supported by a simple but effective animation style.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nIt can be hard to find enjoyment with certain anime when you take away their unique artstyles. Some anime earn a huge portion of their legacy from their artstyle, but that's not the case here. But considering the obvious budget limitations TMS Entertainment has done a good job of keeping it low-key and efficient. By utilizing style rather than fluid animations they've managed to retain the essence of the emotional states of all characters. Emotions like fear, dread and shame are accompanied by dark colors and hidden eyes. Any lecture on handling life is done in an interrogative, parental manner. Prolonged scenes and silences aren't always as welcome, but for the most part they work pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nPutting aside the music for a moment, there's not much to say about the voice acting either. Every actor fulfill their expected part in this story, but there's often a distinct warmth to the voices. If you were to consider a series like Natsume no Yuujinchou where the main character provides the iconic calm and kind atmosphere, Relife provides a similar atmosphere with a mellow piano and an earnest character gallery. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAs discussed in the story section of this review, the characters aren't as complex as they could have been. But they do fulfill their roles. Regarding the downward slope, as some may call it, I find that shift in focus came pretty naturally. It was a necessary arc in order to establish how far the other characters had gotten in their personal development. More complex characters come at the expense of sole focus on a single one, and that's what you get towards the second half of this series. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for this series, the characters have to step aside to allow for the retrospective emotions caused by the observation of events in the classroom. Love and dating are as awkward as you'd expect, but it's all so heavily influenced by the emotions that make us give up on life that you'll likely find yourself either dismissing or accepting this series depending on how well you can emphasize with what happens in the series. Things like romantic relationships seem little more than keys to unlock various topics on hopelessness, dread, detachment, and the like. For someone who's been stuck there for a long time it's a welcome reminder of just exactly what it is we should strive for in life.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nPersonally, this series holds the key to a lot of flashbacks. But sometimes it's not even a flashback, the issues brought up in Relife are as relevant today as they ever were. Putting together an well-structured story with a slightly prolonged build-up arc it does a stellar job of keeping the viewer coming back for more. I started watching this in the evening and didn't go to sleep until early in the morning, despite having a job to go to. But perhaps that says more about my poor time management habits than the anime itself.",

            "content": "Anyone else in their 20s and having difficulty relating to high school anime? Well don't worry because ReLIFE has found a way to appeal to audiences of ages 15-30.Our protagonist, Kaizaki Arata, is a washed up and jobless 27 year old man who accepts ReLIFE's proposal to become a high schooler again in exchange for paid living expenses and a job upon the experiment's completion in one year. Who wouldn't jump at the chance to repeat high school again by swallowing a magic pill handed to you by a complete stranger? Frankly, the plot of this series is rather unoriginal and definitely overused by othermovies and dramas. BUT, even a simple story can be great if it's executed well and that's definitely the case with this series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are in many ways the most important aspect to story telling and ReLIFE does an excellent job at delivering the motivations and personalities behind its characters. What the show lacks in originality, it makes up for in characters, who are in many ways its defining feature. Nearly every story arc (2-3 episodes) applies focus to only one or two characters. As a result, the series effectively provides backstory to individual members of the cast and gradually builds their relationships over the course of the series. Overall, I found most of the characters relatable from the standpoint of a someone living a very normal life. This is partly due to the show's excellent portrayal of everyday issues and a fantastic performance from the voice actors/actresses. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think it's important to go into this series understanding that there is a slice of life tag. In other words, ReLIFE is NOT entirely focused on romance. There are other themes explored in its 13 episodes, such as ambition, confidence, and of course friendship. Other reviews have given this show slightly lower marks mainly due to its rather slow pacing and lack of romance between episodes 7-10. While I can agree that the show might have benefitted from devoting more time to its lead couple, it's only a personal preference and I don't think it's appropriate to fault the studio for including episodes that address other equally important themes. In fact, those episodes add depth to the characters and a measure of realism because normal lives are not only filled with instances of intimacy and romance. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we arrive at the anime's greatest fault which is unfortunately its predictability. From episode one, I could tell that even though there was some great writing and surprising sequences, I got the vibe that every scenario was going to be wrapped up nicely and neatly. Admittedly, it was difficult to actually feel sad for any of the characters even when they were struggling because I just knew that things were going to be resolved for them. The bright atmosphere of the show and the optimism of its characters just doesn't allow for prolonged somberness. It's clear to me that the author enjoys happy endings so I never feared for the possibility that certain couples would not end up together. There is also a small mystery concerning the identity of one character throughout the series and when my suspect was revealed, I thought it was every obvious because it resulted in the perfect ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, ReLIFE is a humble and satisfying addition to anime of school and slice of life genres. Romance is not as prevalent in this show as in others, but it is still substantial and interwoven neatly into sequences of realism. I'd recommend checking this anime out if you enjoy stories that are more balanced in these elements as opposed to overreaching in any single one. Tuck into this anime when you're feeling down and unmotivated because you might just find yourself smiling.",

            "content": "ReLife: If you want a quick fix for a slice of life anime, this'll pretty much do.  \r\nGenerally, other than its premise (which you read in ReLife's synopsis) being pretty interesting even if it's not completely original, this anime is pretty average and standard slice of life drama and comedy.  The bulk of the show that doesn't focus on our main character and his ship was a bit slow for me to get through simply because these high schoolers weren't inherently dealing with problems that I cared about.  Most of their problems just made me want them to get over it, butagain, that's just a very slice of life/high school type problem to have, so it's not that bad.  Otherwise, the main character and his ship both go through some fulfilling character development, and the show itself isn't that bad to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation can get a little stiff at times, it still passes as average.  As for sound, I'm gonna address the soundtrack just because I didn't like it.  It's different in that it's jazzy and strictly keyboard, which is cool and everything, but I didn't like it and it gave me an impression of under-budgeting for the show as a whole.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for how much I actually liked it, again, I didn't really like the bulk of the show because it felt like a lot of the show didn't deal with our main character of interest, but the parts that did make him and his ship develop were extremely enjoyable.  Check it out!  It's a nice time killer ^_^\\n\\n\r\n-MSYN",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free\r\n*Enjoyment Rating: 9\r\nReLIFE overall contained moments that were extremely expected and other moments that were extremely not. Nevertheless, this anime contains several lessons that any age group can relate to on a personal level. Do not be fooled by its chill, laid back, and comedic visuals and atmosphere. But for watchers who would like to watch something chill, laid back, and comedic this anime can still be considered for you -- just expect a little bit of drama.\r\n*Story Rating: 8\r\nAs I mentioned already, this anime had moments that watchers could have already expected from simply reading the summary of the anime. The idea ofbeing able to become a high schooler again for a year in of itself an obvious comedic route. However, with the individual being a grown adult and NEET, one can imagine that such a comedic route would contain a sad ending due to the obvious time limit of one year. The grown attachment to individuals that, if you were your actual age, would get you caught in jail. Needless to say, this is where the anime takes a different turn as the main protagonist keeps this fact as a constant reminder when interacting with peers. What was unexpected were the interactions and development that watchers are shown that make this anime more dramatic. \\n\\n\r\n*Art and Sound Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI personally did not find anything unique regarding this anime's art and sound. But I did find character expressions and art style shifts during comedic moments incredibly entertaining. \\n\\n\r\n*Character Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nPart of the unexpected moments in this anime had to do with character development. At first glance, each character beyond the protagonist would appear to have static characteristics that would label them as obvious side characters. The cliche character tropes in most anime are all gathered here: the loner, the oblivious one, the try hard, the talented one, the childhood friends, the glasses character, the sadist, etc. As most can be seen as side characters, each character received a fitting amount of screen time and character development that changed these static foil characters into independent and dynamic ones. It is from these characters that watchers are able to find the individual that they are able to relate to personally. Overall, with the variety of characters and situations present in this anime, the watchers will be able to relate to something on some level and accordingly receive an inspirational message as they watch the characters overcome it themselves in the anime. \\n\\n\r\n*Overall Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nI personally give this anime an overall rating of 9. The comedic and dramatic genres were executed great. The pinch of romance that all anime watchers secretly want from these characters are given at a satisfying amount as well. Hoping for a season two.",

This anime definitely provides some great life lessons we can follow, and delivered in a beautifully meaningful and balanced way. It never seems like the lecture on life ever overshadows the episode or the plot, but we come away with a basic understanding anyway and a satisfied mind. \r\nThe comic timing was perfect, and as a character, protagonist was stop-notch, even if he was generic-ish. every single character had their own little complicacies and back stories and it was so much fun to watch. I absolutely adored the way they showed agrown up trying to fit into a high school and take and interest in their lives. \\n\\n\r\nSub plots were superb!! they had be squealing in delight or groaning in embarrassment or laughing out loud! <3 Music was on point, and i really liked that there were different EDs every time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a refreshing concept and not too far-fetched, so we are allowed to actually believe what we're being shown. I definitely want to see more of this anime.",

            "content": "Hmm, just binge watched this show and after looking at the reviews I felt like I wanted to give my own opinion, so I thought I'd give my two cents on the show.\r\nI didn't read the manga of reLIFE, in fact I actually turned away from the manga due to small interest in the concept. At first glance the whole process of an older man going to a school with a bunch of young individuals is fairly unappealing. I mean, who wants to see an anime with the romance tag when the protagonist will be several years older than the kids in school? At firstI thought this was pretty disgusting to be honest (lol). Although once you get past the struggle of getting through the synopsis, the show itself exceeded my expectations tremendously I must say.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was actually more interesting than I thought it to be. Although it was unappealing to me at first glance, once you start to experience the execution of the story it's much better than it appears to be. I'm sure there are people out there that would appreciate this kind of story regardless of how I was being pushed away from the synopsis, but don't judge this show like I did prematurely. The setting takes place in school which isn't exactly uncommon, although the process to get to the setting is unique. An older man taking a drug to once again turn himself into a high schooler isn't the general process to achieve a school/slice of life anime. Throughout the series ReLIFE the main character is basically interacting with the teenagers, giving advice and help them advance as adults. The point of this show is for development of the main character through the experimentation of sending adults back to their school lives. It's actually enjoyable to watch, as there are plenty of problems with everybody in their lives in high school such as romance, relationships, personal stuggles, and so on. The main character is forced into an environment that he has experienced before, and he helps students solve their problems while also solving his own problems that he has unanswered to in his personal life along the way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty easy on the eyes. It was easy to look at, although nothing exceptional from the average anime. I did think the colours were done really well though, it kind of brought life and easiness into the show which gave it a relaxation feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST/Opening were really well done. I love the opening a lot, it's enjoyable to listen to and really friendly/positive. The endings though, were EXCEPTIONALLY well done. There was a different ending to each episode with different visuals for each ending, and it was extremely enjoyable to listen/watch to considering they took the mood of the episode and basically embodied it into a song. The song choice for the endings were nearly perfect in my books, and I thought it was genius. Like 10/10, they brought plenty emotion to the end of episodes with fairly strong closures on the small arcs of each character. The soundtrack was strong in my eyes. The background music at some particular moments were sometimes a little wonky (didn't feel like the perfect fit for certain particular moments to bring out the emotion in certain scenes) although there was plenty of variety which made it fun nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the highlights of this anime. I don't want to delve too deep into the characters as they would contain spoilers, although the story is basically highlighting the character development. We get to see and experience the teenagers interacting with the main character and witness the development of the main character AND the other characters simultaneously. The character designs were good and bad at the same time, some characters stood out as unique and interesting, although some characters were just dull and two in particular look extremely similar and it was somewhat hard to tell the difference between the two (Yoake and Ooga).\\n\\n\r\nThis show was certainly enjoyable, had strong drama and character development while being enjoyable. The animation wasn't anything special, and the art was decent. Those are the weakest points, although the anime quality is there and I had a fun time with this series. Anime is all about the enjoyment, and I certainly enjoyed ReLIFE =)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show had flaws but the pros outshines the cons very well. I think this show is worth the watch, especially if you're looking for an enjoyable comedy/romance/slice of life.",

            "content": "~Spoiler Free~\r\nBeing able to fix our mistakes might as well be a dream to strive for. We all have regrets in life no matter who you are and it is up to the individual to work their life around it. Well, ReLife takes the concept by the horns and directs it to a path that is not necessarily different, but interesting.\r\n(Optional)This series is an adaptation of a web comic by the same name and takes on the story of Kaizaki Arata and his life of high school. Funny thing, he is a full grown adult. Acknowledging the fact that life is going downhill due toan unstable job and bad habits, Arata enrolls in the ReLIFE program that gives him the persona of a 17 year old. With this new identity, Arata is then tasked to live one year in this state while attending High school. (Optional)\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story itself is not something to be the determining factor of whether the series is worth to pick it up or not. Keep in mind, this show is a slice of life/school life anime. It follows an ambiguous plot which tends to branch off into sub arcs that are not necessarily relevant to the main conflict of ReLIFE. Although that may not sound very pretty, what drives the anime's story is through character interactions. The plot is more or less a character-driven narrative which is built upon our cast learning more about each other and branch off from there. From then, it depends on whether you, the audience, will find interest in drama that are found through what has been given throughout the series. ~ While the story gets progressively interesting, I will be honest, it is slow. \\n\\n\r\nWith how the anime is presented, the ART and SOUND are both not the greatest and not the worst. The animation is definitely keeping up with its modern day counterparts. It does not necessarily do anything out of the ordinary aside from adding in comedic chibi art (and might I tell you, the anime uses that aspect very well) here and there. Now SOUND is what I want to talk about for a bit. It is unique with how music is used in ReLIFE. Initially looking at this series, I was thinking that modern synthesizers will be used for how I viewed the premise. It was not too serious nor did not give a classic vibe as if the series is taking place way back when. However listening in, it was interesting to hear that a lot of jazzy rhythms that capitalize on piano riffs are what consisted in ReLIFE's bgm. It was weird in a way that kept me interested to see how the music would affect the tone of where the anime is heading towards. \\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTERS are a very interesting bunch. A bulk of the series is our casts' development, so it will be apparent to the viewers how much they change through their interactions. Personally, Hishiro stood out the most for me due to her portrayal as the \"quiet girl\".\\n\\n\r\n~~~Personally, I did enjoy the series. It was a wonderful take on the Highschool/SoL genre by adding in an odd aspect. It is definitely interesting to watch and understand our casts' character development. But the way ReLIFE presented itself may not appeal to the general crowd. Some may shy away with how the plot progresses and that is understandable, but it is all for the sake of tying knots together in the end.\\n",

            "content": "[Some spoilers]\r\nReLIFE was a promising anime. It had an interesting concept and interesting characters. At first glance, I thought this was your generic high school anime but I saw that it had a high 8.21 rating on MAL so I was curious to see how good this actually was. In the end I was somewhat disappointed with the poor execution of what could've been a good anime.\r\nStory 6/10 - The story starts with a man named Arata Kaizaki who then meets Yoake Ryou, a worker in the ReLife Research Institute, programmed to help NEETs...not be...NEETs...basically. Yoake gives him pills and Arata accepts them. Like howI accept ice cream from a guy in a white van.\\n\\n\r\nThe next morning he becomes a High Schooler and begins his life in High School again. There he begins helping people because they need helping. He also befriends a couple of friends like Hishiro, Ooga, Onoya, and surprisingly Yoake himself. \\n\\n\r\nThis seemingly good summary changed in the next few episodes however. 2 characters known as Kariu and Honoka suddenly take the spotlight. One of the most one-sided characters i've seen, Kariu is your simple high school tsundere. Okay that might be an exaggeration but seriously, she's fucking stubborn as hell. Excuse my language. Anyways, does this affect the anime positively or negatively? Unfortunately the latter is chosen. \\n\\n\r\nWe get to see how Honoka and Kariu go from best friends to disliking each other then getting back together. And it's all thanks to Kaizaki and Hishiro. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say I was incredibly disheartened at this. Why didn't they focus on the actual interesting things? I mean I get it's supposed to be \"relatable\" but when watching this, one word came up to my mind. \"Simple.\" \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there were some things I liked. Arata and Hishiro's relationship developing while Arata learning from his previous mistakes when he was actually a high schooler. However, most of the things I remember about ReLIFE is the stupid conflict that could've been solved if Kariu wasn't so stubborn. Basically, the adventure of Arata's problem solving skills.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 -  The characters who got the most screen time were one dimensional. Your tsundere Kariu, Your \"big\" and clumsy Honoka, and even the emotionless archetype of Hishiro. Although, I like Hishiro's character development. With the help of Arata she overcomes her once previous \"loner\" nature and becomes more sociable. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also Ooga who is extremely dense but smart. Also the love interest of Kariu. Objectively, he wasn't a bad character but he also one who wasn't really worth noticing except with his conversations with the main lead. \\n\\n\r\nAh, don't forget about Onoya and Yoake. They provide the backbone of the anime. Onoya was one of the more interesting characters and Yoake was  as well. Mysterious with that smile of his, you can't really tell what goes in that guy, Yoake's head. In contrast to his personality, Onoya is more laidback and free. This leads to arguments between them with Arata being pulled in as well.\\n\\n\r\nLast of all, there's your \"emo kid\" Inukai and overly caring Nobunaga. \\n\\n\r\nSo back to the question. There were many good characters so why was Kariu and Honoka in the spotlight? I'm pretty sure that the better characters deserved more development as it looks like both of them didn't really develop at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 - This is where ReLIFE failed the most. The art was old for a 2016 anime but in my opinion I liked it. But objectively, there could've been a vast amount of improvement in this category. It wasn't bad but it could've been way better.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - I loved the OP and ED. The OP represents ReLIFE with it's bright colors of high school life and depictions of the environment.  As for the ED, there was a bunch of them and as I skipped some of them (unfortunately) I don't have an accurate opinion but I could say that it was decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 - I enjoyed Arata and Hishiro's relationship the most. That was it though. I mean I also liked the others but they weren't as interesting as the 2 of them. I do want to say that the comedy was amazing. It was simple but I laughed and laughed. But that still doesn't make me overlook the once again mentioned conflict. That was what made this a 7 rating. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.8/10 - Overall, this anime is relatable as some reviewers have said but objectively, this had great potential and lost it. Does it live to it's 8.21 rating? I would say no but it was a good watch nonetheless.",

            "content": "- My first ever review -\r\nWhen I started to watch this, I didn't know what I got myself into. I didn't even know what it was about because I'm the type that watches anything randomly that I might find myself liking or disliking them.\r\nI thought this anime is one of those random, plot-less, nonsense, mundane kind of series that shows the typical day-to-day interaction between each characters, but I was definitely wrong. Very wrong. This anime is way deeper than I thought it would be. To be honest, it is hard to find anime that has story that I can relate too. The last timeI ever felt like this is when I was watching AnoHana and Clannad and that was quite a while ago.\\n\\n\r\nWatching each episodes really got me thinking about my life, mainly because I feel like a failure myself. I'm 20 years old but I don't really have the drive to continue on living anymore. Everyday I'd think to myself, \"What's the point?\". Despite all that, I'd still wake up each day even though I don't know what to do. I'd just go with the flow, accepting whatever that comes to me, but that made me feel very much like an empty vessel.\\n\\n\r\nThen, I encountered this anime today. That encounter feels like fate or something. It was life-changing, if I'm being honest. I saw myself in the character 'Hishiro Chizuru'. She is exactly like me. I can totally relate when she said the words, \"My heart grew numb\". \\n\\n\r\nThe interaction between each characters and how they grew is really fascinating and very heartwarming. It is interesting how events are triggered when the characters decided to take action or not. It does make you question about the 'what-ifs' in life, what will happen if you decided to do this or what will happen if you decided not to do it. This anime is so real. It touches the issues that I'm sure most people are thinking about, although some might only do it in their subconscious mind.\\n\\n\r\nHere is my rating~\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe story might seem mundane and typical but it is very deep and special (Personally, super special to me) in its own way. I know that I have said this before but it is rare to find such a heartfelt story that I can't help but focus to it. The story is very thought-provoking too, really made me think about life and the people around me a lot. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nTo be honest, the art is not that special. It look like most typical anime out there (although the 3 horizontal lines eyebrows on the characters 'Tamarai' and 'Asaji' caught my attention because I have never seen that before). The reason why I gave it a 10 out of 10 is because the simplicity of the art allows the story to shine more and I think that it is really, really great. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 (Fair)\\n\r\nI actually didn't pay much attention to the sound used in the anime but every time they came on, the sounds used were very appropriate for each important moments in each episodes. They don't have much impact but they do fit the moments very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime is very well-made and it is nice how they are not rushed or anything. They grew when they are meant to grow and that is fantastic. Each of them have their own unique selves and the way they interact with each other is always interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nOverall, I really, really enjoyed watching this anime. It is so interesting that I watched the whole anime in one sitting. That is how interesting it is. I am so glad that I came across this anime. I laughed and cried as I watched it and is always curious of what is going to happen in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nPlease give this anime a chance. You will not regret it. :)",

I really love all the characters and watching them go through all their ups and downs while watching them grow as individuals. Arita's character is the perfect example of him affecting others to help them I prove their high school experience and he is changing with them without always knowing how much.  Everyone has problems and this anime really does justice tontgem and their true feelings. Beautiful animationand character development. Sad to see the season end but desperately wanting to read the manga so another season can be made. It feels incomplete so I really hope to see more. I'll buy it for my collection for sure.",

            "content": "As a working adult (this probably doesn't apply to some of you), do you ever regret how you spent your adolescent years? Kaizaki is twenty-seven years old yet has low self-esteem and literally no future after his parents decide to cut chipping in for his rent. Luckily, he is chosen as a human experiment for Relife, a one-year long second chance at adolescence (and which will cover his living costs).\r\nI absolutely love shows where people are introduced into new situations (Kuromukuro, and FMP being strong examples) and this fits the bill quite well. In this case, Kaizaki has a ton more life experience than hispeers and so he is able to help others around him while simultaneously healing some of his own personal anguish. It's a very well thought out concept and likewise well executed. For those looking for a slightly more mature taste in their anime (no I don't mean hentai), look no further.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Animation:[/b]\\n\r\nThe animation in Relife isn't anything particularly special, if anything I'm actually surprised that a fair number of school backgrounds are drawn rather than generated. The show has a light atmosphere overall with bright, fairly saturated coloring. The characters have an average level of detail though they do a pretty good job of aging Kaizaki and Yoake. The characters are fairly standard overall though there are many scenes where characters are drawn as humorous and occasionally cute chibi caricatures. Hishiro's smile is definitely one thing that never gets old. There isn't any action and this is isn't an ecchi-based show.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound:[/b]\\n\r\nThe show opens with a decent piece with a good main melody but more interestingly, ends with a different ED in every episode. These EDs are all hits in Japan from the late 90s or early 2000s; fittingly, these pieces should resonate with Japanese viewers in Kaizaki's age range. For us culturally deprived foreigners, Natsumatsuri in episode 12 will probably be the most recognizable tune as the ED from Watamote. The BGM in the show is very minimalist, most of which is just a sole piano; though simple, some of the melodies will become familiar by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a lot of star VA power. Our protagonist is supported by Ai Kayano playing a extremely smart yet socially awkward Hishiro, Haruka Tomatsu playing a humorously tsundere Kariu and up and coming Reina Ueda as the supportive fellow transfer student Onoya. This show is mostly dialogue driven and they do a great job keeping things interesting.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story:[/b]\\n\r\nKaizaki takes a magic pill to enter the Matrix er... to make him look like a teenager and re-enrolls in high school. There he befriends those sitting around him and eventually helps them resolve interpersonal issues. The story is a mix of hilarious comedy and really good character development. It flows like a slice of life and is pretty light most of the time. There's one central plot line following Kaizaki's new daily life, there isn't any particular rising action or climax though for me the last few episodes were particularly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThough this sounds really light and fluffy, underneath the hood it's a human experiment to try to rehabilitate NEETs. And though I won't spoil exactly what it is, there's a pretty good twist at the very end of the show. It's a great watch overall, especially for us older viewers, and ends on a pretty positive note.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Character:[/b]\\n\r\nIf you like exploratory character relations, this show is gold. Placing someone who's mentally older than their teacher is hilarious, and seeing how he has to readjust to cultural norms for those a decade younger are likewise comically explored. There are a lot of interpersonal issues between characters in the show, many of them surrounding Hishiro, who initially doesn't get along with anyone despite being the smartest brain in the cast, and Kariu, whose tsundere shield ends up offending and hurting multiple people. There is a lot of growth in the characters throughout the show, and the last few episodes are particularly exciting for those who like reliving the hatsukoi experience. The cast is relatively small, and just enough exposition is given to supporting characters to keep the focus on the central protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Value:[/b]\\n\r\nThough the story isn't as engaging as ReZero, this show has a vibrant, playful personality and makes up the difference through outstanding characters. I found myself rooting for the protagonist at one moment only to start laughing uncontrollably the very next scene as a result of Hishiro's innocent antics. This was an absolute pleasure to watch and, due to the late plot twist, definitely has re-watch value. If you're tired of the fantasy genre and or overly moe characters, this show has a compelling package.",

            "content": "I should start by pointing out that there is a very clear target audience for this type of show; a more mature demographic will relate more to the main character(s) and understand most of the content than other (younger) demographics will. The concept of being able to go back and redo high school with all of your knowledge and experience in tact can seem like a very romantic one to those who've graduated from it; and even more so for those who have not necessarily been too successful after-the-fact. Whilst not necessarily being something that crosses the mind of someone still in it as it'sthen not a retrospective.\\n\\n\r\nSo for me there is some obvious bias here as I not only relate through the age range of the characters as a late 20 something (the fact that the show does target this age range is in itself refreshing), but I also relate to the main character perhaps a little too acutely regarding their personal hurdles as well. Partialness aside, what is endearing about the show and what I feel gives the show some real integrity (if not quality) is the fact that the show doesn't stray too far from reality, magical age pill that can also conveniently erase memories notwithstanding, a lot of high school based anime's can be quite abstract from the mostly subtle (Lovely Complex, ToraDora!) to the most extreme (Kill la Kill, Assassination Classroom). The character designs are quite conservative (no overtly bright hair) and the character personalities are generally not that eccentric (obligatory exception to the rule being Hirisho).\\n\\n\r\nThe art does leave a little to be desired, it is by no means the best, it might even be a little disappointing when compared to its contemporaries as there is a lot of really refined stuff being released these days, but the show is still easy on the eyes as i'm mostly comparing it to above average shows setting a high bar here. I suppose this is my roundabout way of saying that it's average in aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with the sound either (per s\u00e9), though in one or two episodes the piano based mood music was a tad strong/melodramatic which jolts your suspended disbelief briefly.\\n\\n\r\nBut really it's just a nice, tidy, neat show in which most obstacles are overcome quickly and concisely giving the story an enjoyable pace and though this isn't relevant months after publication, the fact the shows first season was released entirely in one go was perfect for people who like to marathon content.",

The music of the OP was good but the ENDcredits were just amazing they always had well, in my opinion, catchy music that made me want to stay at the end to watch and to listen to the music. I loved the characters in the show as all of them some of them I wasn't a big fan off like some of the volleyball girls. overall I did enjoy the show and you should too they made a good anime with this idea that they had in there mind and pulled it off well, And I know since I'm writing this there's another 4 eps so ima make another review for it so this is part one. ill link part 2 when I finished watching it.\\n\\n\r\n12/21/2018",

Ahahaha but seriously it's a good anime, the story was really interesting and the characters had good stories.\r\nBut there was one thing that I didn't like, 3/4 through the series, I feel like the anime became clouded in filler, I feel like the start of the anime and the relationship between the two characters just vanished because the writers forgot to talk about the other characters. Long story short, I felt like a few episodes were rushed and some relationships wererushed. \\n\\n\r\nBut other than that, It was really good! The ending off the anime was really good, even better when the ovas actually continue the story! So not going to spoil anything but keep an open mind when you finish the first season, because the ovas are great!\\n\\n\r\nThere are some scenes from the manga which I feel like should have been shown in the ovas so I suggest starting from chapter 220 in the manga after you finish the ovas. But the ovas make a good ending anyway but just feels like there is more to the story, WHICH THERE IS! \\n\\n\r\nThe art was good, nothing crazy good. Just good. If you're looking for a chill anime about romance but guys will like, go check this out! This anime has a lot off funny moments which remind me off awkward things back when I was in High School and it really does make you appreciate those times. It's a good show but I hope maybe a season two comes along with new material, I think the ending off the manga really sets up a whole new story!",

            "content": "If you had a chance to relive your youth, would you take it? \r\nThe story follows Kaizaki Arata, an unemployed 27-years-old man who is given that chance. After accepting it and taking a pill his body is now that of a 17-years-old adolescent and he must attend highschool again for a year.\r\nThis anime is kind of a \"deconstruction\" of teenage social relationships, mixing that with SOL and a bit of romance-comedy, with the addition that in the cast of youthful adolescents full of energy and love to give there is a grown up dude in the body of a teenager who sometimes acts like thevoice of experience, trying to relive his youth at his fullest and making his new friends enjoy their youth while they still can, though not making their lives simpler.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow I feel that this anime falls into the same category of Kokoro Connect. ReLIFE explores those relationships from the point of view of a 27-years-old man. The basis for the plot of ReLIFE (the pill and stuff) are rather incredible (as seen in Detective Conan) but it never affects the unraveling of the story. It has its tedious moments of slowness and repetitiveness that I feel are important to get more in touch with the characters, but overall it's fairly good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are rather clich\u00e9 (but honestly where do you see characters in a school based SOL that aren't clich\u00e9), you have the silent girl, the tomboyish-girl, the laid-back boy, et cetera. Character development is really slow at the start of the series in my opinion and feels very rushed when it actually happens. At some point the development is stationary (the tedious part I mentioned earlier), when the series focuses on the past of some characters. There are little to no interventions of background characters or even side characters that are important for like a half of an episode though. In any case, again, this doesn't affect the unraveling of the plot towards the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the characters is very solid, they never lose their shape nor feel off while out of focus. Somehow the drawing and their reactions feel exaggerated like those of an anime of the past decade (you know, very \"anime-ish\") and I personally feel that it's pretty nice (sometimes I miss them watching new shows). The backgrounds aren't tough but simple, and visually the series is very pleasant to watch. Voice acting has nothing much remarkable in my opinion, as it's well done but in some few moments the tone of the voice feels uncompatible with the expressions of the character. Talking about the soundtrack I really liked those eccentric piano passages that are played in tension moments, and the rest of the soundtrack fits the atmosphere of a SOL but is not memorable at all, mostly because the whole soundtrack is rather absent for the majority of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case this is a fun and pleasant series to watch, besides everything I really enjoyed the series. The jokes are ok, the drama is nice and the plot is easy to follow along. I highly recommend it if you like SOL with a bit of insight in social relationships.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to have watched this series when I was in high school.\\n\\n\r\nQuantifying:\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

No overt fanservice was present and only brief, very minor things could be quantified as fanservice.\r\nThe main character does, however, frequently remind himself that the situation he is in, that of hanging out with high-schoolers (girls included), could be potentially illegal in some situations. He is also jokingly reminded by his handlers to not \"jump\" girlsthat visit his apartment.\\n\r\nSome characters joke about getting a girlfriend. One adult character briefly begins describing an illicit situation before getting cut off.\\n\r\nOne song has some suggestive lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nMisc. Suggestive Content:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\nThe whole premise begins with the main character receiving and consuming a pill given to him by a stranger... needless to say, this is not the best example. In general, I suppose, the main character isn't supposed to be a good example for the first part of this show. Does that bother someone? Well sheesh, then why don't you just go watch a show about perfect people who never do anything wrong... oh wait... that would be boring.\\n\r\nAlso, literal stalking is a job some characters hold. Complete with elaborate layers of deceit, counterfeit, and corporate support.\\n\\n\r\nDetached Assessment\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe story remained entertaining throughout and managed to sell it's comedy and drama well.

Some were exceptionally well done to the point were you could almost cringe with how real they seemed. Sometimes the motivations people have in real life aren't pretty, just messy and visceral.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe show was based of a web comic, so the art style is somewhat simplistic. Not bad by any means though. It does a good job and never feels too much or too little... except when the crowds get partially (???) replaced by silhouettes in the last episodes.\\n\r\nThe show often cuts into a comedic chibi art-style during certain jokes and stuff. However, it is these parts that end up being more stylized than you'd expect and it's great.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThe OP is good.\\n\r\nThere is a different ED for EVERY SINGLE episode. I'm not even kidding. Some of these EDs are absolutely amazing, others are very unique and definitely noteworthy, some are just good.\\n\r\nOST fits and doesn't cause any problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe pacing kept the hijinks and drama rolling at equal paces. I could easily sit down and watch six of the episodes at a time.\\n\r\nNot once was I bored with the way things were going, it was all quite well done.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good high-school comedy/drama with some light romance and almost no fanservice, this is the show for you.\\n\r\nI can't really think of a reason why someone shouldn't watch this show, it's very good with almost no drawbacks for what it is.",

Re:Life is your answer\r\nRe:Life answers the one question everybody encounters at some point in their lives: What if i could have done things differently??\r\nOur story follows a principled and hard-working 27 year old Arata Kaizaki, who wonders mysteriously upon one Ryo Yoake, whom subsequently offers Kaizaki the  opportunity for a Re:life. The opportunity to take a specially developed pill which returns his features to that of a high schoolstudent. Kaizaki will then return to high school for the year where his interactions, friendships, love interests and educational studies will all be monitored and finalised in a report at the end of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama and comedic elements stem from the fact that Kaizaki whilst having the features of a high school student, will still have the memories, experience and physique of a non-physical 27 year old and therefore will have to be very careful when interacting with others, so as not to give away any information which could unfurl his little secret. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is a very well paced anime, the music fits the anime and scenes very well and furthermore the animation style is very crisp and accentuates the often comedic humor almost perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the criticism stems from unfair comparisons with the Light Novel, the detail (in particular in the OVA's Kanketsu-Hen) has been methodically trimmed in order to compensate for the 13 short episodes and 4 short OVA's. However for non-LN readers this is largely unnoticeable as the information within the story provided is more than enough to not cause any issues, in particular the visual hints provided within the OVA's provides a great conclusion (not to mention how brilliant the ending scene was). As they say a picture speaks a thousand words and this is utilised to great effect throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen RE:Life and your able to delve into shows completely open-minded (in particular you LN readers) then you won't be disappointed. You'll laugh, cry and be emotionally connected with Arata and his friends (in particular Hishiro-San) and end up completely satisfied by the end of the OVA (a must watch 4 episode OVA if you watch the 13 episode anime).\\n\\n",

The main protagonist (an adult in a high schooler's body) who was planning to keep a low profile in the beginning eventually delved into the high school shenanigans. \r\nHis adult insight provided a fresh perspective on the ordinary rom-com scenarios. At times it would be mature and constructive, but at times it would reflect his pessimistic take on life, which is later on greatly influenced by his new teen friends.\r\nCharacters:\r\nThe show does a good job developingthe distinct characters in the story. Even besides the two main protagonists, the supporting characters had their own dilemmas and arcs which kept them relevant and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. It's also a fun anime that has gags to keep you entertained throughout the show, and the ending is a shocker :)",

It has to deal with how difficult adult life can be and how many of us wish that there was a chance to go back into the past and try to fix things. It truly makes you reflect on your own life and how you could have done things differently.  It is filled with so many different emotions and surprises that literally make you speechless.\r\nThe art:\r\nI am quite the fan of themore modern art style so this is right up my ally and anyone else's who likes this type. I just love the little expression the characters make.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\nThis usually isn't that important to me. I really enjoyed listening to the intro over and over. It is so lightweight and very relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nThe character:\\n\r\nOh my, I have no idea where to start. There is just so much character development in just these 13 episodes. You really get to see each character and how they change over time. You begin to just fall in love with these characters and want what is best for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment:\\n\r\nI stayed up until 4am to complete the whole series. I even missed my morning class that next day. I just could not stop watching it. After each episode, you just want to continue and find out what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMy favorite thing about this is how well it goes with the manga. I have read up to chapter 151, impatiently waiting for the next ones to come out. I didn't expect the anime to be as good because....well they usually aren't. When I started watching the anime I was so shocked by how well it copied the manga, even the character design and faces and everything! This has become one of my favorite anime for sure!",

            "content": "The causal effect of our actions are very complex and in totality,very hard to decipher.However,what if those actions affected only you? What if there was no one to remember what you did? On the one hand: you could break all rules,steal,be promiscuous,etc.If no one is going to remember me,all this will be inconsequential after a while.It's the easier way out.However,this simulation can also be a road to get to know yourself better.To understand new people,gain new experiences and be a stimulated and totally different person when the simulation ends.ReLife deals with the latter possibility.\r\nKaizaki Arata is a directionless,jobless person who seems to have no friends.Heis drunk and returning back home alone when a stranger offers him a 'ReLife': For 1 year,all his expenses will be paid for.In exchange,he will be a part of a simulation where his appearance will be that of a teenager in high school,but he will have all memories of his present life.The stranger will be his support for this duration.Post this 1 year,he will be the same old self but with new memories and hopefully,new mindset.\\n\\n\r\nI had very low expectations from this show.So,I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was.The humor flowed naturally and the characters were well chalked out.Almost every episode revealed a new facet of a character or about the relationship between characters.We also learn about Kaizaki's backstory.During all this while,it stays an entertaining show.Inspite of his reservations,the central character cannot hold back his actionable nature.He influences the lives of students around him.Inspite of knowing that all his actions will eventually have no effect and no memory in peoples' minds,Kaizaki continues to be a positive influence.Thus,performing one of the most selfless acts an individual can do: Doing good not only without reward,but also without any relationship or any good publicity to gain.However,the last few episodes seem to take a tonal shift.The writers decide to play against their strengths and it dampens the flow of the anime.Not that the episodes are bad,but they just...seem off.Also,the twist towards the end does little to add to the show.It's predictable and a tad unnecessary imho.\\n\\n\r\nStill I liked the central idea of the show and the message it conveys.Definitely a one-time watch.",

            "content": "This anime in my honest opinion is not the best visually, it has it's flaws but it helped me realize into something on my my life. This anime is a ten in story, in the characters, and enjoyment because it deals with seeing the error in our ways and fixing them. By the MC going back to his youth the MC is able to regain confidence in life whilst also still finding a better future by the people he meets. The MC is also able to better his and others. It connects to me and has help me realized that I myself have watched allthese type of genre anime about restoring life such as Clannad, Angel beats, Plastic memories, Erased where the MC is hopeless and depressed or just no good at life until he meets or reunites with someone from their past. i must be honest i just recently got into anime when i moved out two years ago. I was depressed and in state where i was unstable like the girl I fell in love with in high school, I tried anime then and it never appealed to me, but somehow now I'm obsessed with Japanese culture, and anime. This anime and many others like these have made my mind click that the reason i watch anime is to lift myself a tad when i remember her, when i remember that there might be that little bit of hope of reuniting with her, where this time there will be more to talk because i now know more. This anime will speak to the ones who had someone in their lives they wish to reunite with, this anime will appeal to ones who feel they've reached a point of life where it's all just a weekly cycle of the same events, get up, work, anime, sleep, and reset. This anime is a ten in story because it's the story we want, the story we hope for, to have a second chance, meet new people, and or reconnect with someone who we haven't talked to in a long time. But trust me if you're anything like me the end will make you cry, just thinking About it now i am starting to jerk a few tears. That's it, I'm going to go re-watch the end now.",

            "content": "Wow.. Just.. Just wow! I know my scores are normally high for every anime but this one was amazing.. SPOILERS AHEAD.. duh..\r\nStory 10/10: At first, I skipped over this anime because I didn't think it appealed to me from what I had read and I thought the ending was bad so I normally skip over the sad ending ones.. But onwards! I don't think I've really come across a anime with such an original story like this yet and it will definitely leave a memory in the back of my mind to a point where I'll go \"Wow, I remember that anime! Ima go re-watchit!\" So.. The story is amazing, but the only thing I had a moment of thought about was the science part of the show and I'm probably thinking to much about it but I'm sort of second guessing how the whole mind erasing, 10 years younger stuff works?.. Maybe it's just me but eh! I did however like how it all came together, I already knew that Hishiro was a test subject and a few others thing because It's just what I do.. I spoil the anime for myself because I don't like things I don't know and I have the control to know what will happen.. Just how I am?.. The ending was sweet and romantic and I really loved how it went, kind of stupid how they both chose ReLife to work and the company was like \"Damn nothing can go wrong here can it?\" but it was cute and innocent so I'll forgive them! I'm salty on how they erased everyone's memories but as long as they got together in the end I don't really care. It was also really nice to see that they took shut-ins, depressed people who are actually caring to give them a chance at a 'ReLife' and it is a really nice watch from a viewers point! I did feel like the romance was abit rushed towards the end but I still really enjoyed it!\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Art was really nice, none of that arm waving stuff when they get embarrassed or they run off at 200mph.. There wasn't many sad/romantic scenes but the ones we got was really nice and sweet! Nothing I can really claim that was bad for the animation but it wasn't perfect aswell..\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I honestly don't care much for sound/music in anime and maybe this is because I'm more focused on reading subs or listening to dubs.. but as long as it sounds good I don't really care and nothing really seemed out of place!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Characters were amazing, even the supporting ones! It was really nice to see how they came together and it was nice they used people who were having trouble with their life's to do the experiment and it was really nice to see both the main characters come together in the end. Supporting characters were fairly decent and had a decent about of weigh in on the rest of the story. They weren't overly used to a point where it came annoying or to a point where you'd hate them but it was really nice seeing them give a push sometimes!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime is really nice, sweet and innocent! It's a good romance story along with a mysterious side to it sometimes. It's not overly romantic to a point where it's fully focused on romance but it's not never used.. it's a good amount and i appreciate that. I highly recommend this to someone who loves romance and love all the soppy crap that comes with them!",

It also gives a feel of how this show would be; fast paced with a comedic yet serious tone. I absolutely loved the story in this. \r\nAnimation: Nothing much to say for the animation besides it being great andcomplementing the tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Probably the most memorable part of this anime are its characters. They all have their uniqur traits which in turn helped make the episodes all the more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a great anime, defimetly will stay with you and tempt you to watch it over again.\\n\r\nRate: 9",

He\u2019s down and out, but that\u2019s because of problems in his first life where he tried to be a nice guy and it backfired on him. Still, he\u2019s interesting enough, and watching his older life and his current one clash.  Watching someone try to go back to high school.  It\u2019s nice to see acknowledgement that he\u2019s older and thus will tackle certain situations differently.  \r\nThe main problem with this story is that he mostly doesn\u2019t come across half the time as the main character.  In fact, theperson with the most hang-ups is Rena.  I really ended up not liking her.  I kinda liked that she understood what her own problems were and that she was being an idiot, but watching her just fail because of her situations makes her a really annoying character to deal with. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, there\u2019s a few too many grownups in the story.  That might sound weird, but if I go into more, I go into spoilers.  \\n\\n\r\nNow if this had the main character dealing with individual stories in some way that fleshed out the class more and didn\u2019t make the series seem more like the \u201cRena problem of the day\u201d thing, I think I would have liked it more.  But overall it is a rather cute and harmless bit of fluff to watch. Though the whole \u201clet\u2019s deal with trauma by putting him in high school\u201d seems really stupid.\\n",

            "content": "A very entertaining and at times moving romance, although not without its flaws.\r\nRelife does a pretty good job balancing out comedy, entertainment and the more serious moments. The humour is usually spot on, although there were some jokes which were dragged on too long during the first few episodes. The series also delves into more serious topics really well like social isolation and self esteem. Relife was usually well paced, especially towards the later episodes where it focused on specific characters and their challenges.\r\nThe characters are all very likeable and relatable. Each character gets their moment in the spotlight, so we get to learn moreabout them and their insecurities. Arata, (a 27 year old who takes a pill to turn 10 years younger) for example at first seems to be a young adult struggling to find a job after he quit his previous one, but later on we learn more about his past and how it has continued to affect him now. Although some of the character\u2019s development felt rushed as we learn nearly everything about them all at once without getting to know them prior to that episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories of the characters are presented really well. Most episodes focus on a specific character and their personal struggles, and how they cope with it. Whether it\u2019s about a crush, or coming to terms with the past, the challenges the characters face makes them more relatable and makes us care about them even more. \\n\\n\r\nRelife is a really good romance with lots of entertaining moments, although there are times the quality drops. Nevertheless Relife has some fantastic characters and stories to tell, and is well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nAny constructive feedback is appreciated :) \\n",

            "content": "In my opinion, this review contains minor spoilers, do read with that in mind. Also, I didn't read the Manga which apparently existed, so this review will be based on the Anime only.\r\nFor starters, I have to say, this was a series that hit really close to home. \r\nAlthough I didn't end up like any of the characters, but it really makes me feel my age (despite only 24, which is at least 3 years younger than main characters). \r\nAs for artwork: I don't think it was really beautiful like Shinkai Makoto's work, but it was really close to real life. There's a clear reasonwhy I made this comparison, you will know why when you run through it.\\n\r\nAs for animation: There was hardly anything to say about animation. However, the image impression and how everything moved at important scenes was really well matched with the scene. \\n\r\nWhich should be why I give Art and Animation another 10. \\n\\n\r\nFor story line, \\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, it hits close to home. Although I didn't have problems with finding a job, and never fell that hard, it hits really close to home. Although I can't quite express how that is, I can say overall story line hits me right the spot it hurts the most.\\n\r\nI am also the kind to predict how the story is going to come out to be, so I had predictions through out this series like usual too. However, I was greeted with surprises for almost all episodes. First, I didn't predict the plot to go with \"rehabilitation program\" but something more like somehow go back to highschool life. Then later episodes give me some surprises too as my prediction gets up turned every time. \\n\\n\r\nWhile portraying a great school life with fun and laughter, story line still stick with the gloomier part of the plot and keeps reminding both characters and audiences. But then still make you forget, or at least realize it. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, as for the end, although my predictions for earlier parts were all wrong and upturned, my prediction of the end was spot on. All I can say is that it's not anything like Shinkai Makoto at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor Sound and Music, I realize almost right away that the music tracks are 2000s and 1990s music. It really fits main character as he was 27. A great attention to details, I would say. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a good series I highly recommend it to anyone who is working in their first 5 years or are having trouble at work or finding one.\\n\\n\r\nP/S: \\n\r\nI'm not used to writing anything but argument about history so you might find it hard to understand. That's why I hardly write any reviews. But this one series made me want to spend 1 hour to write this review, even though it was late. From that, I suppose you can say how good this series is.",

            "content": "Story: 4 / 10\r\nYoake approaches a part-time worker Arata and asks him if he wants to re-do a year of his high school life. There's a lot of things that could be done with this premise, but nothing is done and instead the show opts for a typical slice of life melodrama with some romance I suppose. The dialogue is awkward even for an anime, the drama itself is rather stupid and at least to me is not entertaining. It's a thing I've seen in other anime where the drama is caused by a partial or complete lack of communication, one other example of thisbeing Citrus. This is the most annoying type of drama because it is simply solved if the characters were to stop for a minute and have a decent conversation with each other, but if they did that, we wouldn't have an anime. It's weakly constructed drama that falls apart very easily if the characters were to take basic actions and for that reason, it's not entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3 / 10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, there's nothing spectacular going on here. You have a romantically dense guy who is happy the majority of the time and unaware of one of how one of the females who is his friend, who is aggressive and causes most of the drama in the show btw, is attracted to him. Apart from those two, the main character, despite going to college and grad school, can't pass some high-school level tests and is thus in the dumbass role, the main female character is emotionally dead for the most part and struggles to understand what her classmates are saying and has a hard time communicating with them (sounds like a real-life mental illness), and every other character is just a tag-along that gets serious when they need to and is otherwise just there for comedic relief occasionally. Tamarai and her two guys are so irrelevant it's not even funny. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters are so cliche. It makes watching them rather annoying at times, and the comedy style gets boring after a while. The main character is secretly 27 and as such, sometimes, he gives platitudes appropriate to the situation, but they're the most bland messages ever. Things like \"Don't give up,\" and then they're followed up by a flashback of an experience in his life.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 4 / 10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special. In fact, the animation is bland and the OST is not memorable at all. I barely even noticed the music that was playing most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is just lackluster. The main character is essentially given in a pill form a life changing experience and the writers opt to have this man go through a slice of life high school experience and occasionally reference the fact that he's 27. Other than that, he's nothing more than the involved, bland high school anime protagonist that you'll see in a lot of other high school dramas. I felt like I wasted my time watching this anime and if I were you, I'd watch the first two episodes to see if the comedy is up your alley, and if it's even remotely boring, skip the anime altogether. Hell, you don't even need to watch the second episode, just watch the first.\\n\\n",

Everything happens in real time. The protagonist eats a pill instead of using a machine.\r\nI honestly didn't know what to expect from this anime as this \"becoming a kid\" stuff has never been tackled before. I was half expecting some dark seinan shit to go down but it turned out to bea slice of life rom-com instead.(Not that I'm complaining) One of the characters is a bit cringing BUT that doesn't stop the show from having one of the most unique love confessions of all time! All I can say is I did not see it coming at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does a good job of portraying a grown up in a classroom and how outdated he feels by the current generation and the differences between a school life and working life. All in all, I really enjoyed this anime and really hope a 2nd season is on the way",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nA very bittersweet and melancholic story about a man who got screwed up by ugly \"adults\" and rotten society, which made him to become NEET and was a given to relive his high school experience.\r\nI did enjoy this story quite a lot, maybe it wasn't as amazing, but I did love all the emotions that went through there. The progression and growth of the story was as well quite  bliss to look at. Many bittersweet moments and with a really satisfying and cute way to wrapthings up. Lot of great dialogues and quotes.. ah.. kinda sad that words don't really affect me anymore in positive way. Otherwise Anime would give so much more strength in life. But nevertheless I did enjoy the story aspect of this Anime, it was sweet, sad and quite beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nIt was good but nothing special. Nothing else to comment regarding art.\\n\\n\r\nAs for OST & Music, I did love many endings. But the OST felt really odd. It had strong presence which I did like quite a lot, but the issue with OST I had, was that it felt really all over the place and inconsistent. As if they crammed possible as much artist they could into one show. A way to self-promote. But nevertheless there were bunch of OST I liked and loved some ending songs. Whilst opening, I cannot even remember.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nMC being some \"NEET?\" More like really good person who cares and is able to manage himself got screwed over by corrupted human trash. Funny how \"adults\" are often described as lying rotten pigs who only think how to get more money or step over someone and if they don't like someone or honesty and straightforwardness then they use their position to pressure peers or even blackmail. And outcome in this Anime was shown great. I mean I personally would also disagree with deception, lies, using  others for self-profit etc... but I would end up more likely like that woman. As I don't really have the kind and strength trait like the main character of this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow.. did love Chizuru as well a lot.. hurt person with a strong sense of mystery and \"weirdness\"  love such people. They mostly quiet which is a strong charm point but also in a sense very weak and have really important values. Her emotions were really suppressed, but once they leaked, it was such a nice feeling..\\n\\n\r\nThe \"observers\" were odd but very pretentious.. I hate people \"acting\" ... they are simply such fake and I find it moronic how society is grown by such acting. Being \"self\" is most important IMO. Not putting up fake smile and personality to have an \"image\" . For such bs., go in theater or become an actor.\\n\\n\r\nAlso bunch of really nice and cute sidekicks. Although cannot be bothered to comment them.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nIt started good, but then the emotions over time became stronger and the really sweet way to wrap things up was another point to raise score for me. Nevertheless as mentioned at the start, it was very bittersweet melancholic Anime, which is probably the thing I loved about the most.",

            "content": "The short review: Read the manga instead.\r\nStory: Adapted from some source material with some obvious love and nuance put into it, unfortunately this 13 episode anime only ends up as glorified setup with no resolution. Instead of rewriting the source material to fit in the season's run, they instead chose to shove the HUGE amount of plot into a 4 episode OVA. To do this, they had to drop large plot points and emotional moments, and the story suffers for it. \r\nCreep Factor: With a very tricky setup of an adult male hanging out with high schoolers, it's staggeringly clean of major skeeze. The worstof it is a few leers at the high school girls, but it's acknowledged as icky and chastised. Largely the relationships between the 21 Jump Street characters is paternal or uninvolved. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Easily the weakest point as the art style doesn't lend well to the story being told. The transformation between adult and high school versions of these characters is framed to be dramatic, but in practice the versions are drawn nearly identical. There was also a particularly hilarious moment where the dialogue was saying \"Wow, he's so strong, how did he get so built!\" and as the character does a loving, slow-mo pan over the character, it's revealed he's drawn with the same stick thing character model as every single other character. The animation itself is rudimentary and looks pretty cheap, relying heavily on visual tropes and loops to cut frames. There are a few good visual gags, Chizuru's smile being a good example with some great timing at points.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There wasn't much about the in-episode music to write about. It was largely stock piano noodling. I did had a lot of fun with the ending credits music, recognizing a lot of them from my j-pop days. It took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize that they were being played because they were \"oldies\". Whuf, show. Don't mock my teenage Hyde obsession. Rude. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Issues like these are what frustrate me with anime a lot. Trying to adapt large breadths of work into short series shows. I have no idea if the original plan was to condense the last half into the OVA, or if they had intentions to do a second full season but since is what they released, it doesn't matter much. It's this sort of bad pacing and let-down ending that drove me away from anime the first time round. Disappointing.",

It has a point to all the build up, the characters that has been going through this build up felt like it has more use in the manga than the anime.\r\nSame for the art the art style for the anime was quite mediocre itdoesn't have the same feel to it's manga witch had very good art work.

            "content": "If you are looking for a slice of life anime with great humor and plot, don't bother looking any further, THIS IS IT! ReLife's main plot revolves around a failed 27 years old adult (Arata Kaizaki) who gets a chance to get his 17 years old appearance back and gets back to high school on his senior year.\r\nNow, I've put years between today and my high school days, but I think the majority of us who are now an integral part of society with a 9 to 5 job, have found ourselves longing for those high school days! This is exactly what Arata gets todo.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\nNow have you ever thought about what getting back into your senior year entails? Well the writers of ReLife have, and boy are they seriously stop on! This anime is filled with humor and pretty much anybody can sympathize with the main character. you have typical classroom/anime characters as well as characters who fall off the stereotypical wagon. These two types however still carry much depth and their backstories are well spread out throughout the anime. Many anime will take a whole episode or half of it to give you a sob story about a character. ReLife doesn't do this, ReLife gives you enough information in a short amount of time in order for you to get the picture and moves on to better things.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime got me hooked from the second episode, and I have already re-watched it twice. that's how fun it is! It's light, yet has some drama. It's fun but does portray some serious topics. And the plot is just extremely well thought out and complex enough to make the anime last three or four seasons without leaving any unanswered questions by the end of the last season. Frankly ReLife has brought me joy and laughter all the way and I can't think of any other anime of the genre that has entertained me as much.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\nAlthough there isn't much to complain about in ReLife, I still found that sometimes the story was being dragged on and some people did things way too out of character for them. I did argue with myself that it must be due to hormones and that teenagers do stupid things so who cares. Also, the anime ends with only 13 episodes so that really blows!\\n\\n\r\nMISC:\\n\r\nThe anime is very well drawn and I did enjoy the opening and ending as well as the little skits at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, ReLife is amazing and you should definitely watch it whether or not you are a fan of the genre. In fact, if you like comedy, slice of life genre, drama or romance, don't hesitate to watch this. And if you don't but want to introduce a girlfriend to the world of anime, definitely go with this one!",
