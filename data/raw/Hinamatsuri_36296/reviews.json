            "content": "Once every now and then, we get comedic showstoppers that does what it needs to do: entertain. I\u2019ve seen a lot of comedy shows in the past few years and believe me, Hinamatsuri belongs in a category of its own. It\u2019s entertaining not just on the level of being able to make me laugh but also able to capture the magic of what comedy really is about. It\u2019s only 12 episodes but manages to make an addicting impression.\r\nAs a fan of the manga, delightful is just one of many words that came to mind when I heard about the adaptation. The manga contains over 70+chapters of memorable content and to fully deliver that value isn\u2019t an easy task. Luckly, Hinamatsuri does something that I noticed many shows doesn\u2019t do these days and that\u2019s being aware of itself. On first viewing, it felt like a challenge to realize what this series is all about. The premise itself can make some people\u2019s eyes roll while the character cast consists of a variety of colorful personalities. To me, Hinamatsuri is like diving into a world of absurdity but coming out of it brings me nothing but a smile and the realization of being entertained. \\n\\n\r\nFrom watching the show, I can tell that the director wanted to for entertain the audience. The most evident is the selling of the comedic character reactions. Main characters Hina and Nitta does this the best as they come from very different backgrounds. On the surface level, the two are nothing alike but through interacting with one another, they form a strange bond that makes them almost inseparable. The anime does a phenomenal job at capturing the character expressions with well-timed body language. It creates the sensation of wanting for more every episode and see what characters will do under certain situations. Each episode consists of segments of everyday life activities although there are abnormal events happening from time to time involving psychic powers. Beyond just selling the comedy, this show also does contain some interesting emotional elements too.\\n\\n\r\nOne particular episode showcasing Anzu depicts the realism of homelessness. It\u2019s one of those episodes that you would least expect to see from this particular anime. What attracts me about this show is how it ties in a lot of ideas together. The thematic storytelling may feel random at first but overall has a connection together. Every main or supporting character also delivers moments that are hard to forget. This also includes Hina\u2019s classmates such as Hitomi as she works discreetly at a bar that few knows. It\u2019s also noticeable that the show doesn\u2019t just take place at school or the city either. In a big change in mood, an episode focusing on Mao shows what life is like in isolation. By experimenting ideas like this, it feels like this show constantly evolves and has something for fans to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already mentioned some of the characters but a big question is if the show puts enough value to make the audience care about them. While some characters may not stand out much as the others, I can definitely say with confidence that the main cast is worth watching for their roles. It would have been easy to just let the characters do the talking but instead, the series remarkably showcase their personalities in the most humorous ways possible. A general sense of fatalism can also be felt as some characters are destined to meet or events fated to happen. While some storytelling elements can be predictable in later episodes, it doesn\u2019t hold back with how characters connect with each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there\u2019s an elephant in the room. Once you\u2019ve seen a good amount of episodes, it\u2019s not hard to say that the anime portrays characters in some inappropriate ways. Fan service is present in some episodes and there may be some uncomfortable scenes thrown in by the creators. While this is true on the surface, it should be realized that the anime isn\u2019t presented as a shock value. At its core, Hinamatsuri serves to entertain its audience through creative comedy. The fan service adds more fuel to the fire that way. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio feel, the anime has production quality that I can say works quite well. The character reactions are the big selling factor animated with extreme style. Somehow, it remains faithful to the overall tone of the show without ever going off-track. It also impresses me that we get to see emotional moments bought to life. It\u2019s very human and despite how silly the anime can be, the show contains episodes that are tearjerking. Character designs looks sharp with the vibrant outlines that makes them stand out too.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not being a powerhouse in the music department, Hinamatsuri does boasts a great voicing cast. Nitta, Hina, Anzu, and Hitomi are the primary examples that perfectly fits with their personalities. Every now and then, they can say lines with a straight face under certain circumstances that can\u2019t help but make me laugh. It\u2019s a comedy show and definitely never forgets its intentions. The music also makes certain scenes and montages feel more meaningful. \\n\\n\r\nAh, if only Hinamatsuri had more than 12 episodes. The manga contains more material that I would love to see animated on TV. However, it did adapt the series to the extent that made a great impression to me. From character chemistry to the peculiar storytelling, every episode left me with something to talk about. This is a dark horse of the year that I hope people won\u2019t overlook. Crafting comedy isn\u2019t easy these days but I feel that Hinamatsuri accomplished that so well. I am entertained.",

            "content": "Back when I first started Hinamatsuri in the midst of other shows for the Spring season Hinamatsuri felt different. Compared to the others, it pulled me in and in a different way too. In the first five minutes I was slightly taken aback by the artstyle but when I continued watching it, it hit me with it's wonder. Hinamatsuri is exactly that kind of anime, and it continued to be so till it's end, it calms you down, then immediately rushes out with the comedy and before you know it, you're laughing out loud. Oh and there are tons of heartfelt moments too, what morecould you ask for such an innovative and hilarious anime? Original Review published June 22, 2018 on MAL\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Hinamatsuri is a fresh take among the many comedy anime we see nowadays. It's not a school romance comedy and thanks to that it pushes out a huge cliche (there are exceptions) right out of the window, add to that it's supernatural nature mixed with clever comedy and you've got a fresh anime that people not only laugh with, but cherish for the coming seasons because you won't see such an anime so common, not every season, not every year either. Hinamatsuri uses tons of elements and jokes in it's run and it was very hard for me to find recycled jokes among them, it was all new and innovative and that says a lot about it's quality as a comedy anime. Oh and by saying it's supernatural you might think it relies too much on supernatural stupidity to tickle your funny bone? No, the best part is that Hinamatsuri can stand even on normal comedy and make everyday situations so hilarious despite having a huge arsenal of supernatural jokes at its disposal but Hinamatsuri uses both of them very wisely with the end result being us viewers holding down our stomachs while we laugh. \\n\\n\r\nA huge reason why Hinamatsuri is so incredibly amazing is because it's got various approaches to the comedy, and it almost always nailed them, first off it has a buildup of jokes, the situation starts getting crazier and crazier and you're left laughing at every second. This is common in comedy anime since you can put up over the top situations and make people laugh as well, but Hinamatsuri unlike many others not only looks at that but it also looks at the premise where it's using it in, something surprisingly uncommon in other anime. What am I talking about? Many times we see anime attempt at comedy but use the wrong approach at the wrong time, thus even though the joke was actually funny, the wrong approach didn't give the writers the result they wanted and this anime thankfully crosses that hurdle. \\n\\n\r\nAnother approach it has to it's comedy is somewhat of the opposite, it sets your expectations low on purpose before hitting you with the punchline, this also has a largely positive effect since if the joke is successful, it can almost equal the hilarity of the previous take and on the other hand serve as an element of surprise to its viewers which as well plays a huge part in making it so funny since Hinamatsuri rarely failed at this as well. Yet another approach Hinamatsuri took was to use the \u201cstraight man\u201d principle to effectively. What is the straight man principle you may ask? It's when the characters do something stupid and another character takes the \u201cstraight man\u201d role and points out the stupidity in shock and while on paper this may seem unfunny, in reality it's very successful if implemented properly, two of the best and most famous examples of characters using the straight man principle excellently in anime are namely Saiki Kusuo (Saiki Kusuo no PSI Nan) and Shimura Shinpachi (Gintama). Instead of attributing this principle to only one character, Hinamatsuri gives the role to multiple characters depending on the situation and thankfully does it well. \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I list these and explain the different approaches to comedy? It's because few anime use so many approaches and few of them are successful in doing so as well, and the good news is that Hinamatsuri can use those very well, reason being it keeps them fresh with the comedy and helps keep things varied. \\n\\n\r\nNote: The following is a comparison of Hinamatsuri, Saiki and Gintama, if you haven't watched the latter two completely, please skip the next paragraph as you may not understand the references talked about. \\n\\n\r\n***COMPARISON BEGIN: Since comedy shows get compared a lot, why not compare Hinamatsuri with an anime it shares a lot in common with arguably the giant of comedy anime, Gintama along with a relatively recent anime that's also been doing fabulous, Saiki Kusuo, note that I used these both as examples as well above for the straight man principle. First off with Gintama, Hinamatsuri shares the nature of smile+tears, meaning that both anime make you laugh with it's jokes, but it also has it's sad arcs that give you the feels and usually make many cry. Apart from this, both are supernatural anime (along with Saiki of course) that use their premise very smartly and have varied approaches to comedy, not just one. For Saiki, both feature modern-day Earth but retain the supernatural nature along with the occasional school comedy (but good) thrown in. COMPARISON END***\\n\\n\r\nAll three feature this element and excellently use their numerous weapons at their disposal wisely along with using one of the best comedy methods as well, unpredictability. You never know what comes next and when it does, you're left laughing your ass out. What does this entail? This entails that Hinamatsuri is an anime comparable to such greats and can stand on its own as well without having to mooch off anything else. Much like the other two, Hinamatsuri also at times jumped straight to the comedy itself without any caution (although this wasn't used much) and served as possibly the best form of surprise it could muster. Moving away from the comparing and looking at the points that set Hinamatsuri apart from the others is that Hinamatsuri uses an outsmarting \u201clazy approach\u201d, such that when you're watching Hinamatsuri, much like Hina, it looks sluggish and slow and lazy as well but the moment you think that this is how the whole episode will be, it lands in a sudden joke and you're left flabbergasted in laughter (can people be flabbergasted in laughter? Maybe :P) so you'd be dumb to write Hinamatsuri off if you think it's a bit slow at first because there's a huge punch coming really soon as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's step aside from the comedy for a bit since that's not exactly everything Hinamatsuri offers, we also have the occasional sad arcs. These were usually of Anzu (primarily) and at times a few other characters realising the importance of friendship or a life lesson as well. The reason why people loved Anzu to the point that people very soon ranked her higher than Hina for the best girl of the anime was because her arcs were so damn powerful. Poverty, learning to live as a homeless person, the community you make with them, and many other things beyond that I can't cover since they're spoilers, her arcs have a lot of thought and emotion into them and no person with a heart could not at least get a lump in their throat when they see the way she works hard to do her best for her friends who she treats like family as the feeling is mutual, this is really what should make us smile and laugh, the happiness of a human being doesn't come from being rich, but from enjoying what's next to us, what we have, not what we want, and this serious message was shown through her in these arcs. Getting why the anime is so amazing? \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum we have the duo who we started with, Nitta and Hina, these two are like father and daughter, despite one being a Yakuza and the other having dangerous superpowers, they went like bread and butter, and for the opposite reasons. If you took them individually, Hina wouldn't be as funny by herself and Nitta could only be used as a straight man if he's not with Hina. The anime is such that not only can Hina and Nitta not live without each other, but their comedy as well can't live without each other, and this is a testament to the genius mangaka behind this. As such, this erases most doubts about people possibly thinking of possibly axing one of the two, but much like Nana and Popo in the Ice Climbers (I s'pose no one will get that NES reference), they both need each other not only to live, but to make us laugh. Needless to say, Hina and Nitta\u2019s sketches leave their mark clearly. \\n\\n\r\nLet's move to arguably the most powerful character of the show, Hitomi. Why did I call her so? It's because she highly influences both Hina and Anzu. Anyway, Hitomi is fantastic as a character since she's very relatable thanks to her being given the straight man (or woman if you may) role by handling the BS that her daily life gives her and her arcs as well were hilarious as well as cute. She suddenly gets forced to work as a bartender and surprisingly becomes adept at her job and this is used as a baseline for many of the jokes at her. She also as mentioned played the straight woman for the crap that she has to deal with Hina and sometimes Anzu and her work. The best part is that she's amazing since she's so ordinary in the midst of idiots around her that it's hilarious in its own right and I seriously can't complain when even this is used well for it's jokes. Pretty reflective of the anime itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is that Hinamatsuri has its own share of flaws as well. Even though it's comedy is almost always on point, if the jokes DO fail, the episode can fall apart pretty quick if nothing is done, and although this did happen once or twice, it pretty much saved itself in the next joke and went on, but this issue does exist and could be done better. And one issue that many point out is that since the anime is named Hinamatsuri, it still doesn't focus much on Hina in the first place. Although Hinamatsuri's purpose is to follow and balance screen time for all characters, many times Hina felt off the mark either because she wasn't given too many lines or she wasn't the person making the joke at that time. This is also a problem since based on Hina\u2019s character, it's hard to bring in new stuff for a lazy brat since a lazy brat doesn't do much in the first place. This shows that you can't do much with the character as you would with others so Hinamatsuri's comedy gets held back at times when Hina doesn't do much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hinamatsuri is an anime that does a lot, and a lot of that is different from the usual. Apart from being able to stand on its own legs for support, it is comparable to the legends in its genre and can hold its own to a respectable level. It's truly an all round comedy in part because it makes you cry then laugh in just a span of a minute. Why is that you may ask? It's because comedy isn't just laughing at stupidity, comedy is also trying to find the funny in tragedy and the sad times, that's what Hinamatsuri is all about. And that's what comedy should be all about isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nP.S: This season has a multitude of amazing last episodes demonstrating the best of the show\u2019s offerings overall and Hinamatsuri was no exception. The last episode excellently showed us everything that made the show so amazing. A combination of feels, slapstick comedy and recent nostalgia made for an epic end to an epic anime (despite that minor cliffhanger?), and as a fan, I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a fan\u2019s dream come true. Here's hoping we see a season 2 anytime soon!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9.5\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5",

            "content": "In every way, Hinamatsuri goes above and beyond what is expected of comedy anime. \r\nIt is not simply one of the best because it\u2019s absurdist humor is well directed and often hilarious, it\u2019s one of the best because it doesn\u2019t stop at just making funny jokes. Every character is so well rounded to be believable and the story develops in a surprisingly organic fashion. Jokes don\u2019t bog down the pace because they\u2019re seamlessly woven into the story and character arcs.\r\nHinamatsuri tells the bizarre but heartwarming story of three young girls; Hina, Anzu, and Hitomi. Starting off the series is the most prominent of the three,Hina. A girl with psychic powers from a strange world who randomly appears in a yakuza member\u2019s apartment penthouse apartment, Nitta. Right away he tries to kick her out, and she uses her powerful supernatural abilities to trash his apartment and break his precious vase collection. \\n\\n\r\nBegrudgingly he lets her stay, even surprising himself at how quickly he slips into the role of a surrogate father. Gradually they become a sort of found family, at first because he fears her power and doesn\u2019t want to end up like one of his poor vases. But it doesn\u2019t take long for Nitta to realize that Hina\u2019s just a lazy kid who wants a lot of things because she was denied them in the whatever strange world she came from. Seeing Hina\u2019s deadpan personality perfectly sells the ridiculously stupid and unknowingly cruel things she does to people, namely Nitta in the first episode as he acts as the show\u2019s straight man. There are a fair few cartoonishly ridiculous reaction faces shown off to sell his dismay, which surprisingly is quite detailed and used often with many characters throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nNitta quickly realizes he can use Hina\u2019s powers to make some money like any greed fueled adult would, and she points out his similarities to the organization she came from. He corrects himself by trying to not treat her like a tool, the first great change in his character arc. Once she sees he actually cares about her, she feels a commitment to helping him out with yakuza work and beats the crap out of a bunch of gangsters. Comically, they\u2019re all thrown from their company building with cries of \u201couchy!\u201d from all of them. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really weird, but it sets up the show\u2019s themes perfectly. From the beginning they have a long way to go, there\u2019s even a part where Hina gets disowned, but from then on they learn to forgive one another for their mistakes like a real family. It\u2019s a consistently heartwarming dynamic that, despite the many hilarious bumps they hit along the way, always feels like they\u2019re on an upward trajectory. \\n\r\nTheir story, and for that matter, every story in Hinamatsuri feels like it could carry its own series. The plot is never just an excuse to string gags together, but honestly, even if it was I wouldn\u2019t mind because they\u2019re really well directed. Jokes are always edited not a second longer than need be, but they also linger long enough to be savored with perfect line delivery from the boisterous voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nEvery person has multiple sides to them, as long as you can find people you care for you as much as you do for them, then connections like these can be found anywhere. It\u2019s a genuine and uplifting message that\u2019s seen throughout the series as more characters and plotlines are introduced. As the first episode is the most straightforward with only one plot line it follows, Hina and Nita, it\u2019s the simplest. There are a few background characters who are introduced, and never forgotten, and because they\u2019re all connected to one another they pop up throughout the show. Gradually the relatively small part of the city the show is set in becomes more lively as we learn who lives where and where they often spend their time, it\u2019s a great method of world building for a comedy series because it allows for long-running gags and a melting pot of various personalities that get defined then later clash with one another. This growing cast is reflected in the show's changing ED taking place in the bar owned by Nitta's original love interest Utako. Plus, Nitta's voice actor performs the wonderful song and it evokes a warm-hearted 80s style. \\n\r\nHinamatsuri is in my opinion at the highest level of comedy writing, and I wish all anime would follow it. Even when the gags are presented deliberately at a slow pace is to show that you can probably guess how the joke will play out from context clues, but the outcome is so unfathomably absurd that you can't believe it until you see it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second psychic that sent to arrive on Earth, Anzu, a girl with far more attitude but less power than Hina. She\u2019s too proud to tell Hina that she can\u2019t go home when her teleportation device gets broken, so instead she chooses to live on the streets. Oh, what a fool I was for thinking Hinamatsuri would let this be a one-off gag. Instead, it starts with her stealing, then learning the value of money from the local homeless people who mentor her and give her a home in among them in the public park. Anzu learns how much money is worth through spending her days collecting cans, offering plenty of growth for her character who started as a thieving punk. The simpler life she lives is detailed immaculately to be believable; how much money she earns, what foods she can buy, how she can or can\u2019t spend her free time, not being able to go to school. This is a more dramatic area of the show, but to balance out the tone there are laughs to be had when she interacts with Hina (supported by a wealthy yakuza) and Hitomi (middle schooler with a well-paying job). The contrast between the three lives they lead is hilariously skewed and used to bring about plenty of long-running and escalating jokes because they're ones who get the most screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe homeless people who mentor Anzu are expectedly incredibly humanized like the rest of the cast. At first, they don't accept her for obvious reasons, it\u2019s dangerous, but after she sings terribly for them, they become endeared by her and are reminded of their own grandchildren. By the end of that arc, they genuinely come to want her to have a good life. Seeing the impact she had on them once their found family is torn apart by the town moving them out of the park is truly moving, as well as how Anzu comes to cope with her new home at the ramen restaurant. It's a surprising gut punch after all the lighthearted jokes that you'll likely not get through without watery eyes. Despite being one of the more sentimental characters, the show still finds juggle jokes with saccharine moments. As Anzu becomes more aware and appreciative of the kindnesses people show her as a result of having so little, the show draws comparisons to the lazy Hina, at times and Nitta even begrudges how he ended up with the ungrateful one. \\n\\n\r\nThe third leading girl is Hina\u2019s studious classmate Hitomi. She\u2019s basically the nicest of nice people who just want to help others but is somehow always being punished for just being nice. Like how she helped out at Utako\u2019s bar then ended up getting blackmailed into becoming an employee. It never gets mean-spirited because she\u2019s always making tons of money from her jobs. Her whole shtick is that adults can\u2019t stop being stupid jerks to her but she somehow makes the most of her situations. Seeing her overwhelmed with anxiety at the beginning of the series when she had to bartend for her middle school teacher was hilarious, and well telegraphed by the great character animation as always, but then she overcomes it and becomes confident enough in herself to make drinks that wowed all of her customers. Hitomi\u2019s arc is my personal favorite because of how she takes overwhelming workplaces and somehow is still able to try her best at it and manages to help her own self-confidence and others around. Which is especially crucial when all the adults around her can\u2019t seem to get their shit together. Her compassion is what makes her so likable, but with rapidly escalating career situation also comes a really weird but worthwhile character arc. \\n\\n\r\nShe sees Anzu homeless and despite being exhausted from overwork, she still takes the time to play tag with her. Even if it ends with the joke of her falling asleep standing up, it's still a testament to how much she wants to do right by everyone while also being absurdly hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOK so you may be thinking, some of the jokes derived from the characters may be too mean-spirited right? Well, that\u2019s all part of the show\u2019s appeal, it\u2019s absurd and realistic while also not becoming overly sugar-coated. Overall it\u2019s characters are written more with an inclination for humanizing them rather than realism; take the homeless characters for example. Anzu\u2019s situation is portrayed as not purely nihilistic suffering but instead as a slightly unrealistically safe environment for a young girl. In spite of this, I prefer the show\u2019s inclination to humanize its characters with in-depth personalities, that's what makes them so resonant.\\n\\n\r\nEach cast member is flawed in many ways, no one is a completely good or bad person. Take Utako for example, she\u2019s kind of terrible for blackmailing a middle schooler into working for her, but also she leads marches against the city trying to drive the homeless community from the park. The series is never content with leaving a character underdeveloped, there\u2019s always more to them than their first impression implies. However, it\u2019s not as if the series has time to give everyone fully fleshed out backstories with an episode worth of dialogue. Instead, studio Feel makes use of its generous budget and stellar character animation to give them each minor mannerisms constantly clueing you in on what they\u2019re thinking. Like the nervous gestures Hitomi frequently shows early in the series, but gradually becomes more composed as she learns self-confidence. \\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is truly the gold-standard of modern comedy anime; exceeding the expectations in animation quality, story, characters, and directing. It\u2019s not every day we see anime that strive to defy the expectations we have been conditioned to have for the comedy genre, and for the medium as a whole.",

            "content": "A lot of comedy anime are based on formulas. Here is a premise. Here are jokes that arise from that premise. Basic sitcom stuff. Hinamatsuri takes these fundamentals and grows them to reach a much higher form of comedic storytelling.\r\nFirst the Fundamentals of Comedic Storytelling\r\nIt should first and foremost be stated that humor is subjective. Though this doesn\u2019t mean that there are not techniques used to craft jokes. Just because the jokes do not land for everyone doesn\u2019t make them not jokes. This can make it hard to discuss comedy. If we disregard everything as subjective, the ability to have a conversation is lost, solet\u2019s talk about some fundamentals.\\n\\n\r\nIn gag like Azumanga Daioh, much of the humor is derived from the conversations the characters have and extreme versions of everyday life. Meanwhile, in the serialised harem anime Nisekoi, it often had episodes where the humor was created by an event, often putting the protagonist and one of the heroines in a situation where they naturally bounced off each other to create humorous dialogue. Nisekoi is a traditional sitcom-like premise, but in many ways, they are forced to stunt the development of their characters to ensure that the jokes can continue as they always have. This is where Hinamatsuri comes in.\\n\r\nlets talk about 1st eposode...plz dont read this before watching.. \\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri benefits from smart presentation. It presents its most ridiculous moments in a straightforward, unapologetic manner, as if a girl in a metal pod teleporting into a high-rise apartment and landing on a yakuza officer's head is no big deal. As the show's comedic straight man, Nitta's personality helps out on this front. His reactions tend to fall on the \u201cstunned speechless\u201d end of the spectrum, which is more understated than the panicked, cartoonish screaming we'd likely see from an everyman teenage protagonist. The contrast between those low-key responses and Hina's bizarre behavior (not to mention her hilariously odd-looking transport egg) places extra emphasis on just how strange this all is, and that in turn makes the humor more effective.\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is about yakuza and psychics\u2026 kinda?... omegalul ... just watch it ...\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is a story that follows the life of the yakuza Nitta, who ends up having to take care of Hina, a girl with physic powers. As the series goes on its cast expands to include other yakuza, psychics and Hina\u2019s classmates. The comedy arises from interactions between these characters, and absurdist situations that the characters end up in. The anime spends a lot of time establishing who the characters are and how they act through the humor. artwork and sense of comedic timing really shine in gags .\\n\\n\r\nThe Maturation of Comedy\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is not the only comedy to tackle these elements. Even so, it\u2019s success at it is certainly worth the look. It so perfectly creates something greater out of an already great manga. Comedy genere are often accused of focusing on flat, un-developing characters. While that critique is both misguided and generally wrong, Hinamatsuri provides a perfect counterpoint to that argument. As the characters grow, so does the storytelling and the jokes. Hinamatsuri proves the sheer height of perfection that a comedy series can strive to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\noverall\\n\r\nI'm enjoying its particular brand of lunacy, so I'll be sticking around to see where it goes. If combining Cromartie High School levels of weirdness with an \u201cunusual dad raises weird kid\u201d story sounds like your idea of a good time, by all means give this show a try.",

            "content": "What makes a great comedy anime?\r\nComedy\r\nTiming\r\nCharacter reactions\r\nDirection\r\nCharacter relationships\r\nThese are all ways to make a comedy anime better. However unlike my 3D Kanojo real girl and Love is hard for an Okatu reviews where I compared them with each to see which one was overall better (spoilers Wotaku Love is hard for a otaku won) but instead I just want to talk about I believe that Hinamatsru or Hina Festival is by far one of the best comedy/slice anime to ever come out. Am not saying that its competitor Comic Girls was bad or anything in fact Comic Girls was a good comedy/slice of life animethat made me laugh a couple of times. However it still wouldn\u2019t have a chance against Hina Festival.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made Hina Festival so great?\\n\\n\r\nHow did it end up dominating the Spring 18 season?\\n\\n\r\nYou will find out soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nOne night, a strange object falls on the head of Nitta, a member of the yakuza. Inside the box is a strange young girl named Hina. She has tremendous supernatural powers, and Nitta finds himself reluctantly taking her in. Her powers can come in handy for his yakuza business, but he also runs the risk of her using them on him! Not to mention, if she doesn't use her powers, she will eventually go berserk and destroy everything around her. Nitta and Hina's strange life together is just beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is brilliant and very well crafted.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters the show a great job a building it\u2019s own world where the anime perfectly showcases every social group in the city from the middle school students, the Yakusa, workers from the shopping distract to even the homeless people. The show also does a fantastic job at displaying character interaction based on different social groups.\\n\\n\r\nFor example in Hitomi\u2019s \u00a0character arc where she was forced to work as a bartender, we see that many social groups like the Yakusha\u2019s seeing the fact that there was a middle school girl working in a bar. Like with Hitomi classmates where they thought that Hitomi is working in a bar as bartender as well doing naughty things with adults and Yakusa. However as soon they enter the bar that there was no naughty activity going on as Hitomi is just severing the adults beer meaning the people in the ear are not pedofiles \u00a0as they just want a drink.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Hitomi's character arc being the most comedic of the bunch her rise to fame was handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in Hina Festival is brilliant to the core. The comedy and jokes are really funny as they are all timed and most importunity that are not repetitive. What makes the comedy more brilliant is how the characters react to the comedic situations that goes on in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really adored about Hina Festival is doing a great job at tackling serious topic and themes such as homeless, humanity, running way, acceptance, family, gambling, and money and does a great job at exploring them in full depth as well treating the themes and topics with respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that sold me about this series the most is despite being heavily a comedy/slice of life show character actually gets development. You see most comedy anime would often return to the status quo meaning once these characters had they spotlight by the next episode they return to they usually self\u2019s removing all of character development in the process. This never happens in Hina Festival as the characters and even the world itself change and evolves as the series goes.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\r\nThe best example of this was in Anzu's character arc where she started off as this rough girl who came to earth to take Hina home as well stealing food and drinks from the local shopping district however all of this changes when she cannot return back of where she came from and because of that she became homeless as a result. Eventually, Anzu lives with a bunch of homeless people and while she\u2019s was living with them she learns about the value of money and the power of community and friendship.\\n\r\nUnfortunately at a certain point of the series she would have to leave the homeless community so she can be live with a couple that owns a restaurant. After that point we the audience see how her time in the homeless community has affected her both psychically and mentally to a point where she is seen trying to adapt to her new surroundings and things that she can now do such as having a bath to learning the value\u00a0 and importance of money.\\n\\n\r\nThere are thing that I want to see in anime more often because the anime medium itself has the potential to present life lessons and serious topics to the viewer and I glad Hina Festival did a great job at handing it\u2019s serious topics and themes.\\n\\n\r\n(End of spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Hina Festival was great and well handled.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Hina Festival are all brilliant and very likeable in they own ways. The one thing that I praise about this show is despite being a comedy slice of life show characters actually have characters development. A lot of comedy anime such as Konosuba, School Rumble and a few others are afraid of leaving \u00a0its comedic ways. I know some of them are padorys where they are perfectly happy of being comedic but the problem was especially for Konosuba where at many times the show cock teases the audience about being more than a comedy/padory where characters get developed but instead of doing that and taking risks that show decided to be the same comedic show from episode 1 however in the progress the show completely lost its charm to a point where it became unfunny and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nHina Festival completely avoids all the pitfalls and traps that caught other comedy where not only the characters were likeable but the actually get development plus they are still actually funny and they don\u2019t repeat the same jokes/gags to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nNitta is a great character that I really liked. Sure may appear as your generic Yakusa member in the beginning but he honestly have a softer side to him that makes him an interesting character to watch. I also loved his father and daughter relationship with Hina as it well executed and was intriguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHina is unfortunately my least favorite character in the series. Don't me wrong she's not a character by any means as she is a good character in her own right. The problem is that if you compare to the other girls in the series especially Anzu who has the most character development she didn't really stand out. Yes she's has a good character arc with Nitta where they learn the importance of a father and daughter relationship but honestly I thought Nitta learned a lot more than Hina did. Yes she can be interesting characters at times but I thought she was nowhere as interesting as Anzu, Nitta, and Hitomi. Overall Hina is a very good character but she sadly get's overshadowed compare to the other girls in the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my favorite character in this show I would pick Hitomi. As a character Hitomi was a absolute joy to because she went from being a typical middle school girl who is timed to a general hard-worker who is very skilled at the things that she does to a point where became a key member in several businesses. I also really adored her character interactions and arcs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Hitomi is my personal favorite character in the series Anzu is by far the best character in the show in terms of writing and character development. Compare to the other girls in the series she's probably the most flawed and human character in the series despite being Superman with powers. Not to mention her character arc was well written to the core.\\n\\n\r\nMao who is comes in late in the series is an interesting character.\\n\r\nShe a esper girl who has been stuck in the island who is trying to find her fellow espers .Despite have way less screen time in the due to her coming\u00a0 in the series very late she\u2019s still manages to be a intriguing character that I really liked. More than Hina who had way more screen time than Mao.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are great characters in they own as they all memorable and intriguing to watch from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Hina Festival were nothing but amazing.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nVisually Hina Festival is great.\\n\r\nStudio feel did a great job at sticking with the rough style of it's source material with its\u00a0jagged, textured linear and gratuitous overlays. The show also has great use of lovely and modern color\u00a0palettes which gives the show it's own visual flare. The characters desgins were great and appealing to the eye\\n\\n\r\nI really adored the facial character expressions that series has to offer as it's more tension to both the comedic and serious situations that go one in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite characters expression in the series was defiantly Hitomi because the way she opens her month sticks her tongue out whenever she things that she going to get caught by someone important because after all she is working as a bartender at a young age.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good for what it was so I have no complaints whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Hina Festival is great as it perfectly represents the daily life of Ashigawa.\\n\r\nThe opening theme Distance by Rie Murakawa is easily the best opening from this spring 18 anime season as it's very catchy and perfectly captures the setting and tone of the series.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Sake to Ikura to 893 sung by Nitta's Seiyuu actor was a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we get to the sub vs dub section of the review I just want to praise the fact that both the opening and ending evolving as the show goes along and this was perfectly shown by a character named Utako where if you keep on watching the opening each episode you will start to see how less important the character actually became and for this case was Utako where only appears once in the opening in episode 10 while she's never present in the ending at all in episode 10. Another thing I really like is how it the ending theme features evolving supporting characters where I honestly hope more do theses evolving opening/ending themes in the future because one it really makes them unique and two instead of pointless recap episodes we the viewers actually see visually of how did the series progressed.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is very good overall and I have no complaints of it however what really surprised me about Hina Festival was the dub. The dub for Hina Festival is brilliant and well-acted.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is brilliant.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really adored Hina Festival. I can safely say that not only Hina Festival had single-handily dominated the Spring 18 season but it's also one of the best slice of life/comedy series period.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was amazing and well created. The characters were wonderful and interesting. the productions were great and the soundtrack is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIt truly feels like the creators for this show put a lot of care and effort when making this anime and am glad.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, this show gets a second season sometime in the future as well as a great DVD/Blu Ray release by Funimation in the US and UK.\\n\\n\r\nIf you looking for a slice of life/comedy anime that is very funny and has great character development than I recommend Hina Festival.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri is an anime about this Yakuza-bro who is totally a badass. He meets this weird alien girl AND THEN THEY FUCK. Oh wait, wrong series. And then they become something like \"friends\" or \"family\", and instead of developing as characters they rather start a trip to self-discovery and find new sides within themselves, but also from each others. Pretty neat.\r\nMy favorite part of this series is Hina. Her whole presence radiates disinterest. Whenever she does anything, it comes off as a combination of curiosity and not giving a fuck. For example, even when she is impressed she be like \"woah\", but also, \"meh\". Thiscreates quite interesting comedic situations. The same thing is also done with drama. This, on the other hand, quite (tedious word incoming) subtly hints about the complexity of their personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEvery character introduced thus far has had an important role in the series, expanding its universe and viewer's understanding of the main characters, however, never feeling like they solely exist for the main characters. Instead, for once they feel like real people. The series also contains quite a few pop culture reference that can be seen as eastern eggs for popular movies that did it before Hinamatsuri. For example, the room scene is clearly a reference to The Terminator (1984). Our biking scene is obviously from E.T. (1982). Without a doubt, the series has a lot to offer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art represents its source material quite faithfully. The battle scenes/super natural powers are animated quite neatly. Especially those parts where airflow effects characters' facial expressions. The voice acting can only be called a smart choice. Since none of the characters comes off as purely comedic, the seiyuu work is what essentially makes our character feel like real people. This plays a huge part in making the series look like a believable Yakuza space oddity. It's a job done right. The OST, and especially the ending and opening songs quite well capture the uplifting nature of the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter 4 episodes, I can pretty much recommend Hinamatsuri to everyone. Especially those who are looking for airing series to try. This is the one you should be currently following.",

Yes, it does have some moments that it actually gets you of guard, but most of the time you can easily guess when it will break expectancy, and how. \r\nCharacters are poor, or at least they can't shine alone, and there is very few interaction between them, many jokes are about the adversities of a single character, many of those aren't funny. I understand that good part of jokes comes from sad things, but that doesn't mean sad things are fun by themselves. I don't really thing the writeror the director worked well together, but on my opinion both are bad. \\n\\n\r\nStory is weak as in any comedy, yes it tries to give some pregression to the side characters, but Hina, which, is the funniest one of them progress very little. And a main problem is that it doesn't keep the premise at all. The superpowers, are barely used, even when they should. Yes, in good part it would brake the jokes, exactly beacuse those jokes are made for a powerless sitcom, and not this kind of thing..\\n\\n\r\nArt style is weak and plain creepy on those closes. Maybe that was the intention, the author thought it was funny, but for me, it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you can skip this one.

            "content": "They say life will either make you laugh or cry, and that\u2019s exactly what lies in the power of comedy. Comedy is a form of art and it\u2019s reflective of the times we live in, this art can be a powerful tool and the great comedies know how to wield it. As the saying goes, humour is like a rubber sword\u2013it allows you to make a point without drawing blood. Beneath the humour in Hinamatsuri lies a rich layer of social commentary and life lessons, it\u2019s what makes this series much more memorable. It perfectly balances the thought-provoking themes and gut-busting segments through a combinationof situational comedy, visual gags, emotional punches and plenty of misunderstandings. \\n\\n\r\nMost comedies aspire to be able to work in those registers but few actually do them well all at the same time. Hinamatsuri fits within the very small group that manages the feat and does it exceptionally well. What becomes apparent is that it\u2019s an absurdist comedy that enters the realm of farce. With its absurd premise and the dubious mixture of young girls and adult men, many might mistake the true nature of the show. Hina falls from the ceiling in Nitta Yoshifumi\u2019s condo, he is a high-rising yakuza. Anzu ends up living in a forest camp amongst old homeless men, vulnerable and alone. And Hitomi Mishima inexplicably finds herself tending a bar all by herself as a drunk man wanders in. It\u2019s hard not to view these scenarios and expect the worst. But this is when the show takes bizarre situations and fills it with wholesome comedy. There isn\u2019t a gag that feels heartless or an emotional moment that feels cheap, it understands its boundaries, always finding the underlying humour without sacrificing its virtues. Hinamatsuri pigeonholes itself through three parallel stories: Hina, Hitomi, and Anzu\u2013each one has their own distinctive tone but we do see where each one intersects and eventually tie together.\\n\\n\r\nHina is the problem child of the three and her and Nitta are the main protagonists. The comedy in her segments has a more sarcastic edge. While there are a few sweet moments between Hina and Nitta, for the most part, they conclude with a cynical or confrontational punchline. It doesn\u2019t undermine their relationship, but it gives more of a traditionally comedic vibe of two individuals who are heavily flawed but learn to tolerate each other and hardly getting sentimental about it. Hina\u2019s scenes put on a clinical display in deadpan comedy. Even when she was interacting with the other characters she took on the role of the disinterested observer. This had the effect of cleverly transforming her into the most rational character, something that comes as a shock due to her interactions with Nitta. Hitomi\u2019s path thrived on consistently escalating absurdity, mainly caused by Hina\u2019s actions or the selfishness of her boss Utako who owns a bar which she works at. Hitomi has trouble saying no to good people (who happen to be extremely incompetent), no matter how crazy their requests may sound. She piles on more responsibility and stress since she\u2019s prodigious at everything she does. Her segments end in punchlines too, so there\u2019s not a lot of breathing room for a heartfelt moment. Through these circumstances, the viewers are treated to incredulous reactions to her completely unasked-for rise into success.\\n\\n\r\nHitomi\u2019s life is spiralling completely out of control, having to balance these absurdities along with her childhood makes up a lot of the more hilarious content in the show. It makes it all worth it when she eventually has the power over those that took advantage of her. Anzu\u2019s mission at first was to pursue Hina, but after failing to retrieve her, she ends up in the Fastlane that leads her to shoplift for food, collecting garbage for pennies and living under a bridge. It\u2019s as if life dealt her a bad hand and she struggles to understand how society works. What follows next is definitely the biggest gut-punching moment in the series and it\u2019s how Anzu\u2019s arc depicts homelessness in the most realistic way, it\u2019s truly moving. Hinamatsuri\u2019s comedy revels in subverting our expectations so as absurd as the premise looked, everything has come full circle\u2013Nitta ends up adopting Hina as his daughter and takes care of her. The drunk man teaches Hitomi how to have more self-confidence. The homeless men treat Anzu with compassion and teach her about kindness and how to survive on the fringes of society. \\n\\n\r\nAnzu grows to love and care for her homeless family and she learns that separation is integral to the growth and new beginnings which leads into another heart-wrenching moment. Anzu becomes the heart of the series. It lets her story\u2019s emotional peaks stand on their own without trying to undermine them with cynical gags, and in doing so illustrates that it truly understands that good comedy doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of emotional sincerity. Now on to Nitta and the curious situations he ends up in whether he\u2019s finding himself in a cement barrel due to a misunderstanding or prepping for a date with Utako (the bartender who hired Hitomi), the run of bad luck he finds himself in could be considered curse-related which is one of the funny gags. The father and daughter pairing of Nitta and Hina makes them such the odd duo, but their relationship creates many laugh-out-loud moments. Nitta\u2019s role is often that of wry, jaded spectator to this farcical circus called Hinamatsuri and when all characters interact with each other, it\u2019s when the show is at its best.\\n\\n\r\nStudio feel adapts Masao Ohtake\u2019s manga and visually it is amazing from character designs, backgrounds, colour scheme, and animation. And most importantly the facial expressions and it\u2019s great when you see anime that blends cartoony reactions with realism in the way Hinamatsuri does\u2013e.g. Hitomi\u2019s signature shock face. Great news about the voice acting is not only is each character\u2019s performances are pitch-perfect but both Sub and Dub are great. Special mention to Kaeda Hondo and Tabitha Ray\u2019s portrayal of Hitomi that makes the tough journey she travelled a lot more hilarious. The score captured both the funny and the tender side of the show. The proficient use of classical instruments, great for the heartfelt scenes. The funny scenes used a lot of upbeat electric piano melodies and funky percussions. Opening and Ending compliment the themes of the show. The last oddball thrown into the mix that comes late in the series is another psychic-powered girl in Mao who is introduced in the very first episode in what is immediately revealed to be a flash forward three years after Hina arrived in Tokyo. Her story arc is pretty interesting and pays homage to the movie Castaway, you have to see it. \\n\\n\r\nThere is quite the character study going on here, we see how people of similar backgrounds can perceive the world from their surroundings. Hina is living a luxurious life where food is prepared for her daily, while Anzu is living the life of poverty where she works all day for her meals. It teaches us not to take things for granted. I fully recommend to watch it, both the Sub and Dub. It\u2019s an amazingly great comedy with stunning world building themes, fully fleshed out and developed characters who have many layers, great chemistry and they\u2019re humanized throughout the series. Plenty of hilarity segments that is balanced out with tear-jerking moments. It\u2019s not what you have in life that matters; what matters is whom you share your life with, and that\u2019s what Hinamatsuri is all about.\\n",

The art is nice although it's liek they are catching up with the new flashing style of A place further than the universe and Yuru camp, but the character design is funny, fressh and hillarious as well. Absolutely a must watch for this season.",

This show is very episodic, with very little in the way of a contiguous story line. You would think a show about girls with telekinetic powers and some shadowy organization would have more violence, fights or anything really.\r\n Instead you are treated to 12 episodes of Hina wanting food and lazing about. Nitta caring for and often complaining about Hina (all the while being a singularly uninteresting Yakuza member). Ansu's life as a homeless teen (which was probablythe most interesting part of the show) and finally Hitomi working in Nitta's favorite bar and occasionally helping Hina or Ansu.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 12 episodes there was no indication of where these super powered girls came from, or what the organization is, why they exist etc. Like I said, it's 12 episodes of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was fine. If you care, there was little to no fan service.\\n\r\nSoundtrack was fine.\\n\\n\r\nGo into this one with low expectations and maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.\\n\\n\r\n5.5 out of 10",

            "content": "TLDR: Hina is a fun and bubbly anime which focuses on unique experiences in unique circumstances. It's a funny side watch that doesn't focus on the sci-fi tag, but centralises on the interactions of random individuals. You're at the right place if you want a nice watch that will brighten your day, even if it's by a little. \r\nScores~ Story [7] Art [6] Sound [6] Character [8] Enjoyment [8] Overall [7]\r\nStory [7]\r\nHinamatsuri's story isn't spectacular, but something that develops at a nice pace and is enjoyable. While the anime doesn't particularly explain the context of the story (pre-Hina appearance), any need for this closure iswashed away as you are immersed in the interactions within the series. \\n\r\nYou want to see how the blank Hina (character) acts and grows, how Anzu works her way through life and how the characters interact, develop and react to each other. It's not a large metaphoric story, but a collection of stories; a good slice of life story.\\n\r\nAs a result, the interesting and everchanging development, combined with its comedic tone, make Hinamatsuri's story enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n*And to those expecting the explosions of sci-fi/magic, be prepared to be disappointed as this anime doesn't particularly focus on this aspect and is more of just a drive for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt [6]\\n\r\nNothing much of note here. While the drawings are quite consistent throughout the series so far, the art doesn't particularly stand out at in any major way and can feel a bit dated for 2018. It does a good job characterising the temperaments of the characters and that's all that is needed of an adaption. Not yet mediocre but not quite great either.  \\n\\n\r\nSound [6]\\n\r\nSimilar things can be said here, as with art. The OP and ending tracks are good, but it isn't much of a step over fair. The voice acting is consistent, solid and set the tone for every character making them fun to follow. Again, the sound is not great, but not mediocre either, making it a fair attempt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8]\\n\r\nPerhaps The series' strength, it really makes it up here by introducing a variety of unforeseen characters into the mix. The interesting attitudes of various characters make us curious to see the how the characters interact and develop. We want them to be together, to talk and to wander aimlessly into conversations. \\n\r\nIt keeps it fresh and entertaining as we move through the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8]\\n\r\nI can't help but be fixated on the interactions of Hina (character), and perhaps that is my fault (I'm a sucker for the clueless). As such as a shot from the blue, Hinamatsuri takes \"not belonging\" to a unique level as it shoots various situations into the mix, making it really enjoyable. I want to see what happens next, what happened after that and after that. \\n\r\nHinamatsuri keeps it fresh and the unknowing chemistry is keeping me pinned to this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [7]\\n\r\nEven though this isn't a top quality production digitally (art and sound), the characters and story within the show drag the quality back up and make this a very worthwhile watch. Through its left-field characters and the chemistry they develop off of one another, Hinamatsuri leaves you wanting for more as it keeps it fresh and interesting within it's cute, yet mature, world.\\n\\n\r\nP.S\\n\r\n\"Don't you dare break that vase\" they said...\\n\r\n\"I'll disown you\" they said\\n\r\nAnd disown you they did...\\n",

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n _____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nSometimes you are better off leaving your expectations low and not getting enraptured into something too quickly. For someone that has watched a lot of television and film, I still haven\u2019t broken the habit of brushing my cynicism aside when I see something exceptionally well made. Whether it be the first episode of Kill la Kill, which is vibrant, eccentric, and perfectly paced, or the hook in Nichijou, as we witness a well-known anime clich\u00e9 get upturned in its opening sequence, setting lofty expectations for the series. The point here is, when a show gives you everything in its opening, you either buy intoit or don\u2019t. It shapes the future of the product for the viewer. Next time you sit down to consume an anime, try and pay attention to the way it attempts to hook you. How does that introduction affect your outlook on the rest of the episode?\\n\\n\r\n            Hinamatsuri fits snuggly with the \u201cload-blowers\u201d of the industry; clearly wanting to showcase an especially impressive fight sequence that was not only exceptionally animated but solidly funny as well.  A sporadic, nimble cut filled with substantial smears and smooth frames. It instantly captured me. Unfortunately, it peaked right then, for nothing else in the series reached that level of entertainment. I can\u2019t help but feel as though I would\u2019ve enjoyed it more if my expectations weren\u2019t taken through a proverbial lap dance only to get a high-heel to the nads.\\n\\n\r\n            That\u2019s not to say that Hinamatsuri is bad. It just doesn\u2019t really attempt to be anything it established past the first episode. We meet Nitta, a Yakuza member who finds a metallic pod in his home with an odd girl trapped at the center of it. That girl is Hina. Her origins are unknown. We do quickly figure out she\u2019s a bit of deadpan brat with telekinetic powers. From there, Nitta proceeds to unwillingly take care of her in continuously absurd situations as he makes use of her powers, her naivete, and their general relationship stays at a comfortable medium between hating each other and genuinely loving each other. \\n\\n\r\n\tHinamatsuri proceeds to introduce a decent secondary cast. A second, power-infused girl with Anzu, who gets left in our strange world as she tries to make ends meet with a bunch of homeless men, and Mishima, a classmate of Hina who gets thrust into a bartending job while still in elementary school. The idea here is that every character must face a situation firmly out of their comfort zone. Nitta, who is somewhat of a lady\u2019s man and rogue, living alone in his apartment, is forced to become a pseudo-parent. Anzu needs to learn about this alien world and survive. Mishima must adapt to the new job she was burdened with. Each one has a miniature arc and plenty of B-stories. Some work, others resoundingly don\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe show is at its best when it is shooting the shit. Mishima is constantly the most entertaining character, not because she\u2019s well-written, mind you, but simply because the situations she\u2019s put in are farcical and almost always comedy-oriented. Meanwhile, Anzu, who is stuck living with homeless people, must go through a less-funny and more saccharine arc, as she deals with loss and growth. Her arc is perhaps the show at its weakest, as I found myself cringing at the overly-sugary emotions that were not only undeserved but completely dissonant from the appeal of the series to me. \\n\\n\r\n\tHina and Nitta are well-balanced enough. One moment they hate each other, another moment they have a connection. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it is serviceable. With above-average animation for TV anime, Hinamatsuri elevates its presentation just enough to retain my interest. Unfortunately, the character designs are boring, to put it kindly. If I were in a worse mood I\u2019d easily call them flat-out ugly. This doesn\u2019t do too much to detract from the series, however, the generally serviceable animation, when compared to other shows of its ilk, is truly the only stand-out element in the presentation. Everything else in Hinamatsuri, from directing to shot-composition is uninspired, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\n\tPeaking so early didn\u2019t do it any favors, either, as the initial spectacle wears off and we get what I can only call a slightly above average slice of life. The comedy here is passable for anime, a medium which seriously struggles to be funny on its best day. The characters are generally unmemorable barring a few situations they find themselves in. Particularly earlier on the series before the character dynamics began feeling repetitive. There were flashes of inspiration in the general malaise, what with Hina begging Nitta to go to a \u201cgirl\u2019s club\u201d, and Mishima\u2019s journey through unwilling student to a professional bartender. It was a positive experience, if only barely. I see copious praise for a series that does the bare minimum to stand-out from the crowd, but honestly, for a medium that loves repetition so much, maybe that\u2019s enough. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This Spring 2018 season, we are given sequels of popular shows that ever aired on the anime community. From My Hero Academia 3, Tokyo Ghoul:re, Steins;Gate 0, High School DxD Hero to SAO Alternative GGO (even tho its a spin-off). Then we are blessed with Romantic-comedy segmented shows like Wotakoi, Tada-kun and 3D-Kanojo Girl. Of course this are not the only anime the aired this season. There are countless of them as well as leftovers from the last season which is Winter 2018. However, despite of many choices of anime to watch, there is one lacking the season without this genre. The \"Comedy\" genre. Sure,we have rom-coms all over the place but that doesn't stop me for hoping a show that will air this season that is pure comedy. Not only comedy, but some drama as well that can make my or our hearts feels warmth. And I am glad I stumbled upon Hinamatsuri (Or Hina Festival).\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Hinamatsuri is quite simple. You have a young psychic girl named Hina got transported in a form of a weird-metallic capsule to the apartment of a yakuza named Nitta. This two relationship servers one of the primary comedic acts of the show. We have Nitta who doesnt want to adopt Hina but leaves him no choice to adopt her because of her powers. Thus, this embarks the journey of Hina and Nitta, from parenting to just silliness.\\n\r\nComedic anime revolves mainly on the characters for the story. And Hinamatsuri's characters are well-developed with their own unique attributes. For example, Hina's attitude on the show is very unique unlike any other main protagonist on comedy anime. She is dumb, boring, annoying in the eyes of Nitta, spoiled and has a very unique voice that really reflects her personality. Although this personalities are very bad, in the show, it is just fun. She is what she is and we viewers enjoy how boring she can get through episode. Whether or not she tries her best to fit to Nitta's apartment, there will still be laughter on our faces. The chemistry of Hina and Nitta being on one scene is priceless enough to make you laugh. Her boredom plus Nitta's annoyed face are just good. Not to mention the other characters as well like Anzu and Hitomi. This two gave plus points on this show. We have Anzu here who was like Hina at the start but due to her having different experience, her character changed. We can compare the two psychics being like one child on a poor family and one child on a rich family. the two's relationship reflects the real world's perspective between these two. Then there's Hitomi who really adds the comedic material to the top. With her being a part-timer but a middle-schooler, who knows that if she is found out, trouble can get her. Thus, this leads to some whacky comedy skits and her faces making us laugh.\\n\r\nThe other characters as well supports the genre of this show. From Utako forcing Hitomi, the band boys, the yakuzas, journalist, Hitomi's Mom. Everyone is part of the show. Everyone have elements of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOn every anime out there, art style is a must. In Hinamatsuri, its art is one of the things that made it stand out this season. I am not talking about beautiful animations, fight scenes, scenery and all. I am talking about there facial reaction. The art of the facial reaction of the characters are splendid. It makes anyone giggle or laugh whether it is Hitomi screaming or even any other character with a gloomy face. It is just well-done.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are quite stunning as well. On the opening, we see every character from Hina to Utako, their possible roles on the upcoming episodes with their visuals. The music is very good along with the visuals as well. Speaking of good music, the ending really stands out for me. With the electric guitar on the beginning showing Hina and Nitta or Nitta only walking through the streetlights are just beautiful. Then seeing the facial expression of Nitta throughout the ending with the male voice are just well-synchronized. They are all good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hinamatsuri is not that much of a well-known anime this season because of the other anime out there. However, it stands top for me as one of the great anime that came out this season. Its drama and comedy are well fuse up with each other and can either make you laugh or sad (well you feel sad because of only one character) on every episode. I really recommend anyone seeing my review right now to give this anime a go because of its unique intake on comedy and hidden reflections of youth on our generation.",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri! My 100th anime completed ! I found out about this anime through a youtube video from Sydsnap around when I completed by 90th anime or so. Scrolling about this anime , I already knew it was going to be good. If you watched a lot of anime you can already tell an anime is going to be good even before watching it. So I saved this anime for my 100th special.  \r\nAnd to no surprise it was amazing. The comedic parts of this anime is so fresh and sometimes subtle. It never gets boring and repetitive like a lot of the comedy animeI have watched. In addition to the comedy, there are several instances where the anime is \"Feelzy\" and I did not expect that at all. It really strengthened the anime and I feel the non-funny scenes made the anime even more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all unique and funny in their own way. I find with a lot of anime I watch , if it is good , almost all the time I end up liking all the characters like Stein's Gate. The opening,ending,and general sound in this anime is so soothing. I always kick back in my chair with my arms behind my head and listen to the ending. This anime should not be skipped. Give it a try , you will enjoy it!",

            "content": "Man, was this anime a ride or what? I previously wrote my review on this series when I reached the midpoint of the anime but I thought I'd update you guys since my opinion's changed a bit. Hinamatsuri is an anime that primarily follows the titular character, Hina\u2014a psychic girl that finds herself living with a wealthy yakuza member, Nitta, after mysteriously appearing in his house one night. While the premise is a bit unoriginal, it still has a few interesting moments.\r\nThis series is considered to be a comedy, but I find some of the jokes failing to land. Don't get me wrong, I findmyself laughing a bit at a joke or two each episode, but I just don't find most of them particularly funny. The beginning started off flat, but it got a bit wackier and it doesn't take itself too seriously, which I liked. However, when it has its emotional moments, that was when the series shines as it really reels you in. The series lacks a extended storyline but the story-of-the-week theme is at least interesting and you don't get bored by the short stories too often. What I'm not fond of is the implementation of a supernatural element to the anime, but the failure to address it. The series is about a psychic girl literally appearing out of nowhere, and the deurotagonist doesn't even address it after the first episode. What's up with that? Other than that, the story is OK but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we start off the series, the main characters are a bit generic and we knew little to nothing about them. Hina was more-or-less just an apathetic girl who finds herself confused yet intrigued by the human customs (how original), and Nitta was kind of just the caretaker meant to be the comedic relief. After a bit, we saw Hina grow into a more empathetic character but she still retains her apathetic attitude which I've grown to actually like. Nitta, on the other hand, is still lacking in the personality department but he's a lot more tolerable then he was before. While Hina and Nitta are supposed to be the stars of the show, I find myself particularly drawn to the supporting character, Anzu, another psychic girl who mysteriously appears through unknown circumstances. While Hina was lucky to be picked up and pampered by Nitta, Anzu is raised by a homeless community and learns to be humble and resourceful. Anzu has a lot more depth and growth than our main character, and I always find myself looking forward to her story more than I do Hina's. Unfortunately, the series is about Hina and not Anzu. The rest of the supporting characters are also not too bad. We even get a few episodes dedicated to them, which I surprisingly liked!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good as well. While this anime is mean to be a comedy, there were a few action scenes and the animation looked smooth! The colors were nice and it fits the comedic tone of the series very well. The character designs are also pretty good. None of the main characters look alike, so you won't be confused by who's who. That's a plus for me! The soundtrack is your generic anime OST, so there's not much to talk about in regard to that. The opening originally seemed like another cliche anime opening but it's gotten catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't put this series on my top list for this season, it's still pretty good. As I said before, the series lacks an extended storyline but the story-of-the-week theme is at least interesting. I wouldn't say that this series is quite binge-worthy, but it's fun to watch when you're bored. Check it out if you have the time.\\n\\n",

Jokes don\u2019t bog down the pace because they\u2019re seamlessly woven into the story and character arcs, the jokes are not part of the story, the story is part of the jokes and its amazing.\\n\\n\r\nComedy is so well directed in this show, that even the exaggerating animated faces are so well timed, the fact that the gags stick even into further episodes, makes this show gold, it reminds me a lot of Konosuba first episodes (Aqua being eaten by a frog). Amazing Humour.\\n\\n\r\nFInal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nI really want to write a lot on this section but I dont want to ruin it for you, Hinamatsuri is really worth it as a comedy show, it has one the freshest comedy I have seen in years in any mean possible, it has no underdeveloped or unnecessary characters, the slice of life in this is just perfect, not to much to be consider a drama but enough to make a balance for the really amazing story, in the same episode you might find yourself crying of laughter and suddenly tearing apart, its such a rollercoaster. I havent seen something like this in a while, so I hope you can feel the same way this show made me feel.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, you wouldn't be disappointed.",

It's a show that doesn't necessarily do anything out of the ordinary, but does it well. It has nice quirky jokes hear and there and its a real feel-good anime. If you do watch this, I can guarantee you will have that creepy smile on your face all the way through. It's jokes are very innocent and wholesome. \r\nI didn't think there were any stand out character designs or music in the show, but they all played a part in the anime. I hope for season 2, theybring a lil bit more action as the bits and pieces of action/comedy scenes were definitely the funniest parts of the show. \\n\\n",

The gags are quick and funny, and never failed to make me laugh. The infamous 'fight scene' from the second episode and the ever brilliant 'girly club' scene are particularly great. But as the show expands, it not only maintains its comedy and writing, but also touches on themesof childhood, growing up, and parent hood.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Hina, and her adopted father Nitta develop a healthy relationship throughout the series- Nitta learns of how much a child can change your life, and Hina learns that the world doesn't revolve around her. Anzu's character arc explores how lives can be influenced by surroundings, and things loved ones tell you when you're young can stick with you forever. And finally Mishima, while her story is substantially more comedic than the others, it still briefly explores growing up, coming to terms with ones place in the world, and how tough the adult world can be.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters, main and secondary, are interesting, memorable, and each have their fair share of hilarious moments. By the end of the series, you'll no doubt love the characters and really sympathise with their troubles. While I'm not particularly in the position to comment on the themes of life and growing up, I can certainly respect the maturity these ideas are handled with, and I can definitely respect the brilliant humour sprinkled within. Truly a pinnacle in comedy slice of life anime!",

            "content": "I fell in love with this anime. Hinamatsuri is a real masterpiece, from the start to the end. First of all, i just loved how things happen fluently, the plot and its cohesion just don't fail. If the previous events would take the next episode to a sad episode of a funny one, it just happens, the concern with the plot is the priority of the series, and is makes everything happen naturally, taking us to all kinds of episodes, and every of them very emotional, beautiful, funny or cute. The fact is that in the end of each episode you will love it forsure if you like to feel real emotions watching something, whichever they are.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10) - Well, that's not much to talk about, we just know that Hina and Anzu are from other universe or planet and Hina seems to be in trouble because of this. Mao getting lost is hilarious, but it kinda disturbs us from knowing the stiry behind the three girls. Despite this, the plot developed on the 12 episodes is very nice, i just love how the anime shows the different paths of life taken by Hina and Anzu, each one of them becoming a diferent \"grown up\" person in society. Besides that, every supporting character have it's own time, development and \"respect\" in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - The art of Hinamatsuri is an ordinary but flawlessly made art. The colors are common, the trace is simple and the backgrounds are normal. But everything is made perfectly, in no time you see yourself troubled with something and even being so ordinary, it still has value representing perfectly the streets, the interior of houses and everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - This part is quite complex for me to comment, because a slice of life anime can't do much as action animes. Of course the drama sound matters, the comedy and cute moments too, but it's hard to determine without an epic soundtrack. I liked it, but none of them called my attention as for example Hunter x Hunter OST did.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10) - That is my favourite part in this anime. Hina is a cute \\n\r\nand distracted girl that is so captivating in many ways. I feel just like Nitta in their cute moments when i look at her. Nitta is a great character too, he's outspoken, simple and a nice guy. I love how characters never lose their personalities convenently, they just act like true people would act, i mean, following their natural personalities. Anzu and Mishima were my favourite, they had such a great development. Anzu went to a crazy lost alien to a hardworking humble girl, and as i said before, always keeping her personality. Mishima in the other hand just can't say no, and it takes her to a big world of business and employment, that was very funny and again, very respectful to her personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - After all i've written here, it couldn't be anything besides a 10. Each episode had it own value, it own emotions and story, just indescribably beautiful. I loved Anzu with the homeless, loved Nitta and Hina fights and reconciliations, every funny moments. The only scene i really didn't appreciate was Mao lost in the island. Every other thing i liked or loved, a great experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10) - I think i don't have much to talk here, it's just the result of all i mentioned here. Great characters, a credible plot (despite the supernatural factor), beautiful episodes, a touching drama and a lot of emotions involved. And oh, the last scene is incredibly funny, it hyped me for season 2.\\n",

From Yakuzas to naked girls coming out of some sort of spaceship... Oh and, they have powers, psychic powers. I really like this story because it remembers me what I'm watching, it remembers me that I'm watching anime. This story is the kind of story I want a newbie in the anime world to watch, because this is exactly what you will find in the overall of anime. This story, is the pinnacle of the anime.\r\n* Art *\r\nI'm not the one totalk about art but, for the most part, I can tell that it does have a good animation, talking about how the movements come to scene and how the backgrounds are draw. It feels like a normal animation, some kind of animation that you can enjoy without any problem, it isn't a Kyoto Animation new graphic animation, but is still really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n* Sound *\\n\r\nGod, the feels you get from the music are awesome. I'm not trying to do a spoiler but this anime does have some scenes were the melodrama comes out and it plays beautifully. I don't like melodrama, but I liked this one because the feel I got from it was like remembering me why I like this community, really a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n* Character *\\n\r\nLike I said at the very start, you can find from Yakuzas to Girls... Is awesome  the kind of character you can find, the main story focus in a boy who is a Yakuza and a kuudere girl which comes to his house by some sort of a spaceship, this kind of combination is the one you can tell is gonna be a disaster and as the result of the fact it is gonna be a disaster you know it is gonna be funny or sad at some point. The character development isn't great tho, mostly because the story of Hino isn't clear at all, you can tell some things that happened, but it isn't clear at all.\\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment  *\\n\r\nSo... Nothing to say, I really love this show, I love how it plays the melodrama, I love the disaster of the characters, I love every single frame of this anime and I totally recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nAs an overall: 9/10\\n\r\nThat's something to add in your list.",

            "content": "Once every now and then, we get comedic showstoppers that does what it needs to do: entertain. I\u2019ve seen a lot of comedy shows in the past few years and believe me, Hinamatsuri belongs in a category of its own. It\u2019s entertaining not just on the level of being able to make me laugh but also able to capture the magic of what comedy really is about. It\u2019s only 12 episodes but manages to make an addicting impression.\r\nAs a fan of the manga, delightful is just one of many words that came to mind when I heard about the adaptation. The manga contains over 70+chapters of memorable content and to fully deliver that value isn\u2019t an easy task. Luckly, Hinamatsuri does something that I noticed many shows doesn\u2019t do these days and that\u2019s being aware of itself. On first viewing, it felt like a challenge to realize what this series is all about. The premise itself can make some people\u2019s eyes roll while the character cast consists of a variety of colorful personalities. To me, Hinamatsuri is like diving into a world of absurdity but coming out of it brings me nothing but a smile and the realization of being entertained. \\n\\n\r\nFrom watching the show, I can tell that the director wanted to for entertain the audience. The most evident is the selling of the comedic character reactions. Main characters Hina and Nitta does this the best as they come from very different backgrounds. On the surface level, the two are nothing alike but through interacting with one another, they form a strange bond that makes them almost inseparable. The anime does a phenomenal job at capturing the character expressions with well-timed body language. It creates the sensation of wanting for more every episode and see what characters will do under certain situations. Each episode consists of segments of everyday life activities although there are abnormal events happening from time to time involving psychic powers. Beyond just selling the comedy, this show also does contain some interesting emotional elements too.\\n\\n\r\nOne particular episode showcasing Anzu depicts the realism of homelessness. It\u2019s one of those episodes that you would least expect to see from this particular anime. What attracts me about this show is how it ties in a lot of ideas together. The thematic storytelling may feel random at first but overall has a connection together. Every main or supporting character also delivers moments that are hard to forget. This also includes Hina\u2019s classmates such as Hitomi as she works discreetly at a bar that few knows. It\u2019s also noticeable that the show doesn\u2019t just take place at school or the city either. In a big change in mood, an episode focusing on Mao shows what life is like in isolation. By experimenting ideas like this, it feels like this show constantly evolves and has something for fans to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already mentioned some of the characters but a big question is if the show puts enough value to make the audience care about them. While some characters may not stand out much as the others, I can definitely say with confidence that the main cast is worth watching for their roles. It would have been easy to just let the characters do the talking but instead, the series remarkably showcase their personalities in the most humorous ways possible. A general sense of fatalism can also be felt as some characters are destined to meet or events fated to happen. While some storytelling elements can be predictable in later episodes, it doesn\u2019t hold back with how characters connect with each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there\u2019s an elephant in the room. Once you\u2019ve seen a good amount of episodes, it\u2019s not hard to say that the anime portrays characters in some inappropriate ways. Fan service is present in some episodes and there may be some uncomfortable scenes thrown in by the creators. While this is true on the surface, it should be realized that the anime isn\u2019t presented as a shock value. At its core, Hinamatsuri serves to entertain its audience through creative comedy. The fan service adds more fuel to the fire that way. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio feel, the anime has production quality that I can say works quite well. The character reactions are the big selling factor animated with extreme style. Somehow, it remains faithful to the overall tone of the show without ever going off-track. It also impresses me that we get to see emotional moments bought to life. It\u2019s very human and despite how silly the anime can be, the show contains episodes that are tearjerking. Character designs looks sharp with the vibrant outlines that makes them stand out too.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not being a powerhouse in the music department, Hinamatsuri does boasts a great voicing cast. Nitta, Hina, Anzu, and Hitomi are the primary examples that perfectly fits with their personalities. Every now and then, they can say lines with a straight face under certain circumstances that can\u2019t help but make me laugh. It\u2019s a comedy show and definitely never forgets its intentions. The music also makes certain scenes and montages feel more meaningful. \\n\\n\r\nAh, if only Hinamatsuri had more than 12 episodes. The manga contains more material that I would love to see animated on TV. However, it did adapt the series to the extent that made a great impression to me. From character chemistry to the peculiar storytelling, every episode left me with something to talk about. This is a dark horse of the year that I hope people won\u2019t overlook. Crafting comedy isn\u2019t easy these days but I feel that Hinamatsuri accomplished that so well. I am entertained.",

            "content": "Back when I first started Hinamatsuri in the midst of other shows for the Spring season Hinamatsuri felt different. Compared to the others, it pulled me in and in a different way too. In the first five minutes I was slightly taken aback by the artstyle but when I continued watching it, it hit me with it's wonder. Hinamatsuri is exactly that kind of anime, and it continued to be so till it's end, it calms you down, then immediately rushes out with the comedy and before you know it, you're laughing out loud. Oh and there are tons of heartfelt moments too, what morecould you ask for such an innovative and hilarious anime? Original Review published June 22, 2018 on MAL\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Hinamatsuri is a fresh take among the many comedy anime we see nowadays. It's not a school romance comedy and thanks to that it pushes out a huge cliche (there are exceptions) right out of the window, add to that it's supernatural nature mixed with clever comedy and you've got a fresh anime that people not only laugh with, but cherish for the coming seasons because you won't see such an anime so common, not every season, not every year either. Hinamatsuri uses tons of elements and jokes in it's run and it was very hard for me to find recycled jokes among them, it was all new and innovative and that says a lot about it's quality as a comedy anime. Oh and by saying it's supernatural you might think it relies too much on supernatural stupidity to tickle your funny bone? No, the best part is that Hinamatsuri can stand even on normal comedy and make everyday situations so hilarious despite having a huge arsenal of supernatural jokes at its disposal but Hinamatsuri uses both of them very wisely with the end result being us viewers holding down our stomachs while we laugh. \\n\\n\r\nA huge reason why Hinamatsuri is so incredibly amazing is because it's got various approaches to the comedy, and it almost always nailed them, first off it has a buildup of jokes, the situation starts getting crazier and crazier and you're left laughing at every second. This is common in comedy anime since you can put up over the top situations and make people laugh as well, but Hinamatsuri unlike many others not only looks at that but it also looks at the premise where it's using it in, something surprisingly uncommon in other anime. What am I talking about? Many times we see anime attempt at comedy but use the wrong approach at the wrong time, thus even though the joke was actually funny, the wrong approach didn't give the writers the result they wanted and this anime thankfully crosses that hurdle. \\n\\n\r\nAnother approach it has to it's comedy is somewhat of the opposite, it sets your expectations low on purpose before hitting you with the punchline, this also has a largely positive effect since if the joke is successful, it can almost equal the hilarity of the previous take and on the other hand serve as an element of surprise to its viewers which as well plays a huge part in making it so funny since Hinamatsuri rarely failed at this as well. Yet another approach Hinamatsuri took was to use the \u201cstraight man\u201d principle to effectively. What is the straight man principle you may ask? It's when the characters do something stupid and another character takes the \u201cstraight man\u201d role and points out the stupidity in shock and while on paper this may seem unfunny, in reality it's very successful if implemented properly, two of the best and most famous examples of characters using the straight man principle excellently in anime are namely Saiki Kusuo (Saiki Kusuo no PSI Nan) and Shimura Shinpachi (Gintama). Instead of attributing this principle to only one character, Hinamatsuri gives the role to multiple characters depending on the situation and thankfully does it well. \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I list these and explain the different approaches to comedy? It's because few anime use so many approaches and few of them are successful in doing so as well, and the good news is that Hinamatsuri can use those very well, reason being it keeps them fresh with the comedy and helps keep things varied. \\n\\n\r\nNote: The following is a comparison of Hinamatsuri, Saiki and Gintama, if you haven't watched the latter two completely, please skip the next paragraph as you may not understand the references talked about. \\n\\n\r\n***COMPARISON BEGIN: Since comedy shows get compared a lot, why not compare Hinamatsuri with an anime it shares a lot in common with arguably the giant of comedy anime, Gintama along with a relatively recent anime that's also been doing fabulous, Saiki Kusuo, note that I used these both as examples as well above for the straight man principle. First off with Gintama, Hinamatsuri shares the nature of smile+tears, meaning that both anime make you laugh with it's jokes, but it also has it's sad arcs that give you the feels and usually make many cry. Apart from this, both are supernatural anime (along with Saiki of course) that use their premise very smartly and have varied approaches to comedy, not just one. For Saiki, both feature modern-day Earth but retain the supernatural nature along with the occasional school comedy (but good) thrown in. COMPARISON END***\\n\\n\r\nAll three feature this element and excellently use their numerous weapons at their disposal wisely along with using one of the best comedy methods as well, unpredictability. You never know what comes next and when it does, you're left laughing your ass out. What does this entail? This entails that Hinamatsuri is an anime comparable to such greats and can stand on its own as well without having to mooch off anything else. Much like the other two, Hinamatsuri also at times jumped straight to the comedy itself without any caution (although this wasn't used much) and served as possibly the best form of surprise it could muster. Moving away from the comparing and looking at the points that set Hinamatsuri apart from the others is that Hinamatsuri uses an outsmarting \u201clazy approach\u201d, such that when you're watching Hinamatsuri, much like Hina, it looks sluggish and slow and lazy as well but the moment you think that this is how the whole episode will be, it lands in a sudden joke and you're left flabbergasted in laughter (can people be flabbergasted in laughter? Maybe :P) so you'd be dumb to write Hinamatsuri off if you think it's a bit slow at first because there's a huge punch coming really soon as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's step aside from the comedy for a bit since that's not exactly everything Hinamatsuri offers, we also have the occasional sad arcs. These were usually of Anzu (primarily) and at times a few other characters realising the importance of friendship or a life lesson as well. The reason why people loved Anzu to the point that people very soon ranked her higher than Hina for the best girl of the anime was because her arcs were so damn powerful. Poverty, learning to live as a homeless person, the community you make with them, and many other things beyond that I can't cover since they're spoilers, her arcs have a lot of thought and emotion into them and no person with a heart could not at least get a lump in their throat when they see the way she works hard to do her best for her friends who she treats like family as the feeling is mutual, this is really what should make us smile and laugh, the happiness of a human being doesn't come from being rich, but from enjoying what's next to us, what we have, not what we want, and this serious message was shown through her in these arcs. Getting why the anime is so amazing? \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum we have the duo who we started with, Nitta and Hina, these two are like father and daughter, despite one being a Yakuza and the other having dangerous superpowers, they went like bread and butter, and for the opposite reasons. If you took them individually, Hina wouldn't be as funny by herself and Nitta could only be used as a straight man if he's not with Hina. The anime is such that not only can Hina and Nitta not live without each other, but their comedy as well can't live without each other, and this is a testament to the genius mangaka behind this. As such, this erases most doubts about people possibly thinking of possibly axing one of the two, but much like Nana and Popo in the Ice Climbers (I s'pose no one will get that NES reference), they both need each other not only to live, but to make us laugh. Needless to say, Hina and Nitta\u2019s sketches leave their mark clearly. \\n\\n\r\nLet's move to arguably the most powerful character of the show, Hitomi. Why did I call her so? It's because she highly influences both Hina and Anzu. Anyway, Hitomi is fantastic as a character since she's very relatable thanks to her being given the straight man (or woman if you may) role by handling the BS that her daily life gives her and her arcs as well were hilarious as well as cute. She suddenly gets forced to work as a bartender and surprisingly becomes adept at her job and this is used as a baseline for many of the jokes at her. She also as mentioned played the straight woman for the crap that she has to deal with Hina and sometimes Anzu and her work. The best part is that she's amazing since she's so ordinary in the midst of idiots around her that it's hilarious in its own right and I seriously can't complain when even this is used well for it's jokes. Pretty reflective of the anime itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is that Hinamatsuri has its own share of flaws as well. Even though it's comedy is almost always on point, if the jokes DO fail, the episode can fall apart pretty quick if nothing is done, and although this did happen once or twice, it pretty much saved itself in the next joke and went on, but this issue does exist and could be done better. And one issue that many point out is that since the anime is named Hinamatsuri, it still doesn't focus much on Hina in the first place. Although Hinamatsuri's purpose is to follow and balance screen time for all characters, many times Hina felt off the mark either because she wasn't given too many lines or she wasn't the person making the joke at that time. This is also a problem since based on Hina\u2019s character, it's hard to bring in new stuff for a lazy brat since a lazy brat doesn't do much in the first place. This shows that you can't do much with the character as you would with others so Hinamatsuri's comedy gets held back at times when Hina doesn't do much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hinamatsuri is an anime that does a lot, and a lot of that is different from the usual. Apart from being able to stand on its own legs for support, it is comparable to the legends in its genre and can hold its own to a respectable level. It's truly an all round comedy in part because it makes you cry then laugh in just a span of a minute. Why is that you may ask? It's because comedy isn't just laughing at stupidity, comedy is also trying to find the funny in tragedy and the sad times, that's what Hinamatsuri is all about. And that's what comedy should be all about isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nP.S: This season has a multitude of amazing last episodes demonstrating the best of the show\u2019s offerings overall and Hinamatsuri was no exception. The last episode excellently showed us everything that made the show so amazing. A combination of feels, slapstick comedy and recent nostalgia made for an epic end to an epic anime (despite that minor cliffhanger?), and as a fan, I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a fan\u2019s dream come true. Here's hoping we see a season 2 anytime soon!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9.5\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5",

            "content": "In every way, Hinamatsuri goes above and beyond what is expected of comedy anime. \r\nIt is not simply one of the best because it\u2019s absurdist humor is well directed and often hilarious, it\u2019s one of the best because it doesn\u2019t stop at just making funny jokes. Every character is so well rounded to be believable and the story develops in a surprisingly organic fashion. Jokes don\u2019t bog down the pace because they\u2019re seamlessly woven into the story and character arcs.\r\nHinamatsuri tells the bizarre but heartwarming story of three young girls; Hina, Anzu, and Hitomi. Starting off the series is the most prominent of the three,Hina. A girl with psychic powers from a strange world who randomly appears in a yakuza member\u2019s apartment penthouse apartment, Nitta. Right away he tries to kick her out, and she uses her powerful supernatural abilities to trash his apartment and break his precious vase collection. \\n\\n\r\nBegrudgingly he lets her stay, even surprising himself at how quickly he slips into the role of a surrogate father. Gradually they become a sort of found family, at first because he fears her power and doesn\u2019t want to end up like one of his poor vases. But it doesn\u2019t take long for Nitta to realize that Hina\u2019s just a lazy kid who wants a lot of things because she was denied them in the whatever strange world she came from. Seeing Hina\u2019s deadpan personality perfectly sells the ridiculously stupid and unknowingly cruel things she does to people, namely Nitta in the first episode as he acts as the show\u2019s straight man. There are a fair few cartoonishly ridiculous reaction faces shown off to sell his dismay, which surprisingly is quite detailed and used often with many characters throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nNitta quickly realizes he can use Hina\u2019s powers to make some money like any greed fueled adult would, and she points out his similarities to the organization she came from. He corrects himself by trying to not treat her like a tool, the first great change in his character arc. Once she sees he actually cares about her, she feels a commitment to helping him out with yakuza work and beats the crap out of a bunch of gangsters. Comically, they\u2019re all thrown from their company building with cries of \u201couchy!\u201d from all of them. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really weird, but it sets up the show\u2019s themes perfectly. From the beginning they have a long way to go, there\u2019s even a part where Hina gets disowned, but from then on they learn to forgive one another for their mistakes like a real family. It\u2019s a consistently heartwarming dynamic that, despite the many hilarious bumps they hit along the way, always feels like they\u2019re on an upward trajectory. \\n\r\nTheir story, and for that matter, every story in Hinamatsuri feels like it could carry its own series. The plot is never just an excuse to string gags together, but honestly, even if it was I wouldn\u2019t mind because they\u2019re really well directed. Jokes are always edited not a second longer than need be, but they also linger long enough to be savored with perfect line delivery from the boisterous voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nEvery person has multiple sides to them, as long as you can find people you care for you as much as you do for them, then connections like these can be found anywhere. It\u2019s a genuine and uplifting message that\u2019s seen throughout the series as more characters and plotlines are introduced. As the first episode is the most straightforward with only one plot line it follows, Hina and Nita, it\u2019s the simplest. There are a few background characters who are introduced, and never forgotten, and because they\u2019re all connected to one another they pop up throughout the show. Gradually the relatively small part of the city the show is set in becomes more lively as we learn who lives where and where they often spend their time, it\u2019s a great method of world building for a comedy series because it allows for long-running gags and a melting pot of various personalities that get defined then later clash with one another. This growing cast is reflected in the show's changing ED taking place in the bar owned by Nitta's original love interest Utako. Plus, Nitta's voice actor performs the wonderful song and it evokes a warm-hearted 80s style. \\n\r\nHinamatsuri is in my opinion at the highest level of comedy writing, and I wish all anime would follow it. Even when the gags are presented deliberately at a slow pace is to show that you can probably guess how the joke will play out from context clues, but the outcome is so unfathomably absurd that you can't believe it until you see it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second psychic that sent to arrive on Earth, Anzu, a girl with far more attitude but less power than Hina. She\u2019s too proud to tell Hina that she can\u2019t go home when her teleportation device gets broken, so instead she chooses to live on the streets. Oh, what a fool I was for thinking Hinamatsuri would let this be a one-off gag. Instead, it starts with her stealing, then learning the value of money from the local homeless people who mentor her and give her a home in among them in the public park. Anzu learns how much money is worth through spending her days collecting cans, offering plenty of growth for her character who started as a thieving punk. The simpler life she lives is detailed immaculately to be believable; how much money she earns, what foods she can buy, how she can or can\u2019t spend her free time, not being able to go to school. This is a more dramatic area of the show, but to balance out the tone there are laughs to be had when she interacts with Hina (supported by a wealthy yakuza) and Hitomi (middle schooler with a well-paying job). The contrast between the three lives they lead is hilariously skewed and used to bring about plenty of long-running and escalating jokes because they're ones who get the most screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe homeless people who mentor Anzu are expectedly incredibly humanized like the rest of the cast. At first, they don't accept her for obvious reasons, it\u2019s dangerous, but after she sings terribly for them, they become endeared by her and are reminded of their own grandchildren. By the end of that arc, they genuinely come to want her to have a good life. Seeing the impact she had on them once their found family is torn apart by the town moving them out of the park is truly moving, as well as how Anzu comes to cope with her new home at the ramen restaurant. It's a surprising gut punch after all the lighthearted jokes that you'll likely not get through without watery eyes. Despite being one of the more sentimental characters, the show still finds juggle jokes with saccharine moments. As Anzu becomes more aware and appreciative of the kindnesses people show her as a result of having so little, the show draws comparisons to the lazy Hina, at times and Nitta even begrudges how he ended up with the ungrateful one. \\n\\n\r\nThe third leading girl is Hina\u2019s studious classmate Hitomi. She\u2019s basically the nicest of nice people who just want to help others but is somehow always being punished for just being nice. Like how she helped out at Utako\u2019s bar then ended up getting blackmailed into becoming an employee. It never gets mean-spirited because she\u2019s always making tons of money from her jobs. Her whole shtick is that adults can\u2019t stop being stupid jerks to her but she somehow makes the most of her situations. Seeing her overwhelmed with anxiety at the beginning of the series when she had to bartend for her middle school teacher was hilarious, and well telegraphed by the great character animation as always, but then she overcomes it and becomes confident enough in herself to make drinks that wowed all of her customers. Hitomi\u2019s arc is my personal favorite because of how she takes overwhelming workplaces and somehow is still able to try her best at it and manages to help her own self-confidence and others around. Which is especially crucial when all the adults around her can\u2019t seem to get their shit together. Her compassion is what makes her so likable, but with rapidly escalating career situation also comes a really weird but worthwhile character arc. \\n\\n\r\nShe sees Anzu homeless and despite being exhausted from overwork, she still takes the time to play tag with her. Even if it ends with the joke of her falling asleep standing up, it's still a testament to how much she wants to do right by everyone while also being absurdly hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOK so you may be thinking, some of the jokes derived from the characters may be too mean-spirited right? Well, that\u2019s all part of the show\u2019s appeal, it\u2019s absurd and realistic while also not becoming overly sugar-coated. Overall it\u2019s characters are written more with an inclination for humanizing them rather than realism; take the homeless characters for example. Anzu\u2019s situation is portrayed as not purely nihilistic suffering but instead as a slightly unrealistically safe environment for a young girl. In spite of this, I prefer the show\u2019s inclination to humanize its characters with in-depth personalities, that's what makes them so resonant.\\n\\n\r\nEach cast member is flawed in many ways, no one is a completely good or bad person. Take Utako for example, she\u2019s kind of terrible for blackmailing a middle schooler into working for her, but also she leads marches against the city trying to drive the homeless community from the park. The series is never content with leaving a character underdeveloped, there\u2019s always more to them than their first impression implies. However, it\u2019s not as if the series has time to give everyone fully fleshed out backstories with an episode worth of dialogue. Instead, studio Feel makes use of its generous budget and stellar character animation to give them each minor mannerisms constantly clueing you in on what they\u2019re thinking. Like the nervous gestures Hitomi frequently shows early in the series, but gradually becomes more composed as she learns self-confidence. \\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is truly the gold-standard of modern comedy anime; exceeding the expectations in animation quality, story, characters, and directing. It\u2019s not every day we see anime that strive to defy the expectations we have been conditioned to have for the comedy genre, and for the medium as a whole.",

            "content": "A lot of comedy anime are based on formulas. Here is a premise. Here are jokes that arise from that premise. Basic sitcom stuff. Hinamatsuri takes these fundamentals and grows them to reach a much higher form of comedic storytelling.\r\nFirst the Fundamentals of Comedic Storytelling\r\nIt should first and foremost be stated that humor is subjective. Though this doesn\u2019t mean that there are not techniques used to craft jokes. Just because the jokes do not land for everyone doesn\u2019t make them not jokes. This can make it hard to discuss comedy. If we disregard everything as subjective, the ability to have a conversation is lost, solet\u2019s talk about some fundamentals.\\n\\n\r\nIn gag like Azumanga Daioh, much of the humor is derived from the conversations the characters have and extreme versions of everyday life. Meanwhile, in the serialised harem anime Nisekoi, it often had episodes where the humor was created by an event, often putting the protagonist and one of the heroines in a situation where they naturally bounced off each other to create humorous dialogue. Nisekoi is a traditional sitcom-like premise, but in many ways, they are forced to stunt the development of their characters to ensure that the jokes can continue as they always have. This is where Hinamatsuri comes in.\\n\r\nlets talk about 1st eposode...plz dont read this before watching.. \\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri benefits from smart presentation. It presents its most ridiculous moments in a straightforward, unapologetic manner, as if a girl in a metal pod teleporting into a high-rise apartment and landing on a yakuza officer's head is no big deal. As the show's comedic straight man, Nitta's personality helps out on this front. His reactions tend to fall on the \u201cstunned speechless\u201d end of the spectrum, which is more understated than the panicked, cartoonish screaming we'd likely see from an everyman teenage protagonist. The contrast between those low-key responses and Hina's bizarre behavior (not to mention her hilariously odd-looking transport egg) places extra emphasis on just how strange this all is, and that in turn makes the humor more effective.\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is about yakuza and psychics\u2026 kinda?... omegalul ... just watch it ...\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is a story that follows the life of the yakuza Nitta, who ends up having to take care of Hina, a girl with physic powers. As the series goes on its cast expands to include other yakuza, psychics and Hina\u2019s classmates. The comedy arises from interactions between these characters, and absurdist situations that the characters end up in. The anime spends a lot of time establishing who the characters are and how they act through the humor. artwork and sense of comedic timing really shine in gags .\\n\\n\r\nThe Maturation of Comedy\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is not the only comedy to tackle these elements. Even so, it\u2019s success at it is certainly worth the look. It so perfectly creates something greater out of an already great manga. Comedy genere are often accused of focusing on flat, un-developing characters. While that critique is both misguided and generally wrong, Hinamatsuri provides a perfect counterpoint to that argument. As the characters grow, so does the storytelling and the jokes. Hinamatsuri proves the sheer height of perfection that a comedy series can strive to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\noverall\\n\r\nI'm enjoying its particular brand of lunacy, so I'll be sticking around to see where it goes. If combining Cromartie High School levels of weirdness with an \u201cunusual dad raises weird kid\u201d story sounds like your idea of a good time, by all means give this show a try.",

            "content": "What makes a great comedy anime?\r\nComedy\r\nTiming\r\nCharacter reactions\r\nDirection\r\nCharacter relationships\r\nThese are all ways to make a comedy anime better. However unlike my 3D Kanojo real girl and Love is hard for an Okatu reviews where I compared them with each to see which one was overall better (spoilers Wotaku Love is hard for a otaku won) but instead I just want to talk about I believe that Hinamatsru or Hina Festival is by far one of the best comedy/slice anime to ever come out. Am not saying that its competitor Comic Girls was bad or anything in fact Comic Girls was a good comedy/slice of life animethat made me laugh a couple of times. However it still wouldn\u2019t have a chance against Hina Festival.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made Hina Festival so great?\\n\\n\r\nHow did it end up dominating the Spring 18 season?\\n\\n\r\nYou will find out soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nOne night, a strange object falls on the head of Nitta, a member of the yakuza. Inside the box is a strange young girl named Hina. She has tremendous supernatural powers, and Nitta finds himself reluctantly taking her in. Her powers can come in handy for his yakuza business, but he also runs the risk of her using them on him! Not to mention, if she doesn't use her powers, she will eventually go berserk and destroy everything around her. Nitta and Hina's strange life together is just beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is brilliant and very well crafted.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters the show a great job a building it\u2019s own world where the anime perfectly showcases every social group in the city from the middle school students, the Yakusa, workers from the shopping distract to even the homeless people. The show also does a fantastic job at displaying character interaction based on different social groups.\\n\\n\r\nFor example in Hitomi\u2019s \u00a0character arc where she was forced to work as a bartender, we see that many social groups like the Yakusha\u2019s seeing the fact that there was a middle school girl working in a bar. Like with Hitomi classmates where they thought that Hitomi is working in a bar as bartender as well doing naughty things with adults and Yakusa. However as soon they enter the bar that there was no naughty activity going on as Hitomi is just severing the adults beer meaning the people in the ear are not pedofiles \u00a0as they just want a drink.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Hitomi's character arc being the most comedic of the bunch her rise to fame was handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in Hina Festival is brilliant to the core. The comedy and jokes are really funny as they are all timed and most importunity that are not repetitive. What makes the comedy more brilliant is how the characters react to the comedic situations that goes on in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really adored about Hina Festival is doing a great job at tackling serious topic and themes such as homeless, humanity, running way, acceptance, family, gambling, and money and does a great job at exploring them in full depth as well treating the themes and topics with respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that sold me about this series the most is despite being heavily a comedy/slice of life show character actually gets development. You see most comedy anime would often return to the status quo meaning once these characters had they spotlight by the next episode they return to they usually self\u2019s removing all of character development in the process. This never happens in Hina Festival as the characters and even the world itself change and evolves as the series goes.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\r\nThe best example of this was in Anzu's character arc where she started off as this rough girl who came to earth to take Hina home as well stealing food and drinks from the local shopping district however all of this changes when she cannot return back of where she came from and because of that she became homeless as a result. Eventually, Anzu lives with a bunch of homeless people and while she\u2019s was living with them she learns about the value of money and the power of community and friendship.\\n\r\nUnfortunately at a certain point of the series she would have to leave the homeless community so she can be live with a couple that owns a restaurant. After that point we the audience see how her time in the homeless community has affected her both psychically and mentally to a point where she is seen trying to adapt to her new surroundings and things that she can now do such as having a bath to learning the value\u00a0 and importance of money.\\n\\n\r\nThere are thing that I want to see in anime more often because the anime medium itself has the potential to present life lessons and serious topics to the viewer and I glad Hina Festival did a great job at handing it\u2019s serious topics and themes.\\n\\n\r\n(End of spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Hina Festival was great and well handled.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Hina Festival are all brilliant and very likeable in they own ways. The one thing that I praise about this show is despite being a comedy slice of life show characters actually have characters development. A lot of comedy anime such as Konosuba, School Rumble and a few others are afraid of leaving \u00a0its comedic ways. I know some of them are padorys where they are perfectly happy of being comedic but the problem was especially for Konosuba where at many times the show cock teases the audience about being more than a comedy/padory where characters get developed but instead of doing that and taking risks that show decided to be the same comedic show from episode 1 however in the progress the show completely lost its charm to a point where it became unfunny and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nHina Festival completely avoids all the pitfalls and traps that caught other comedy where not only the characters were likeable but the actually get development plus they are still actually funny and they don\u2019t repeat the same jokes/gags to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nNitta is a great character that I really liked. Sure may appear as your generic Yakusa member in the beginning but he honestly have a softer side to him that makes him an interesting character to watch. I also loved his father and daughter relationship with Hina as it well executed and was intriguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHina is unfortunately my least favorite character in the series. Don't me wrong she's not a character by any means as she is a good character in her own right. The problem is that if you compare to the other girls in the series especially Anzu who has the most character development she didn't really stand out. Yes she's has a good character arc with Nitta where they learn the importance of a father and daughter relationship but honestly I thought Nitta learned a lot more than Hina did. Yes she can be interesting characters at times but I thought she was nowhere as interesting as Anzu, Nitta, and Hitomi. Overall Hina is a very good character but she sadly get's overshadowed compare to the other girls in the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my favorite character in this show I would pick Hitomi. As a character Hitomi was a absolute joy to because she went from being a typical middle school girl who is timed to a general hard-worker who is very skilled at the things that she does to a point where became a key member in several businesses. I also really adored her character interactions and arcs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Hitomi is my personal favorite character in the series Anzu is by far the best character in the show in terms of writing and character development. Compare to the other girls in the series she's probably the most flawed and human character in the series despite being Superman with powers. Not to mention her character arc was well written to the core.\\n\\n\r\nMao who is comes in late in the series is an interesting character.\\n\r\nShe a esper girl who has been stuck in the island who is trying to find her fellow espers .Despite have way less screen time in the due to her coming\u00a0 in the series very late she\u2019s still manages to be a intriguing character that I really liked. More than Hina who had way more screen time than Mao.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are great characters in they own as they all memorable and intriguing to watch from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Hina Festival were nothing but amazing.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nVisually Hina Festival is great.\\n\r\nStudio feel did a great job at sticking with the rough style of it's source material with its\u00a0jagged, textured linear and gratuitous overlays. The show also has great use of lovely and modern color\u00a0palettes which gives the show it's own visual flare. The characters desgins were great and appealing to the eye\\n\\n\r\nI really adored the facial character expressions that series has to offer as it's more tension to both the comedic and serious situations that go one in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite characters expression in the series was defiantly Hitomi because the way she opens her month sticks her tongue out whenever she things that she going to get caught by someone important because after all she is working as a bartender at a young age.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good for what it was so I have no complaints whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Hina Festival is great as it perfectly represents the daily life of Ashigawa.\\n\r\nThe opening theme Distance by Rie Murakawa is easily the best opening from this spring 18 anime season as it's very catchy and perfectly captures the setting and tone of the series.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Sake to Ikura to 893 sung by Nitta's Seiyuu actor was a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we get to the sub vs dub section of the review I just want to praise the fact that both the opening and ending evolving as the show goes along and this was perfectly shown by a character named Utako where if you keep on watching the opening each episode you will start to see how less important the character actually became and for this case was Utako where only appears once in the opening in episode 10 while she's never present in the ending at all in episode 10. Another thing I really like is how it the ending theme features evolving supporting characters where I honestly hope more do theses evolving opening/ending themes in the future because one it really makes them unique and two instead of pointless recap episodes we the viewers actually see visually of how did the series progressed.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is very good overall and I have no complaints of it however what really surprised me about Hina Festival was the dub. The dub for Hina Festival is brilliant and well-acted.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is brilliant.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really adored Hina Festival. I can safely say that not only Hina Festival had single-handily dominated the Spring 18 season but it's also one of the best slice of life/comedy series period.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was amazing and well created. The characters were wonderful and interesting. the productions were great and the soundtrack is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIt truly feels like the creators for this show put a lot of care and effort when making this anime and am glad.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, this show gets a second season sometime in the future as well as a great DVD/Blu Ray release by Funimation in the US and UK.\\n\\n\r\nIf you looking for a slice of life/comedy anime that is very funny and has great character development than I recommend Hina Festival.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri is an anime about this Yakuza-bro who is totally a badass. He meets this weird alien girl AND THEN THEY FUCK. Oh wait, wrong series. And then they become something like \"friends\" or \"family\", and instead of developing as characters they rather start a trip to self-discovery and find new sides within themselves, but also from each others. Pretty neat.\r\nMy favorite part of this series is Hina. Her whole presence radiates disinterest. Whenever she does anything, it comes off as a combination of curiosity and not giving a fuck. For example, even when she is impressed she be like \"woah\", but also, \"meh\". Thiscreates quite interesting comedic situations. The same thing is also done with drama. This, on the other hand, quite (tedious word incoming) subtly hints about the complexity of their personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEvery character introduced thus far has had an important role in the series, expanding its universe and viewer's understanding of the main characters, however, never feeling like they solely exist for the main characters. Instead, for once they feel like real people. The series also contains quite a few pop culture reference that can be seen as eastern eggs for popular movies that did it before Hinamatsuri. For example, the room scene is clearly a reference to The Terminator (1984). Our biking scene is obviously from E.T. (1982). Without a doubt, the series has a lot to offer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art represents its source material quite faithfully. The battle scenes/super natural powers are animated quite neatly. Especially those parts where airflow effects characters' facial expressions. The voice acting can only be called a smart choice. Since none of the characters comes off as purely comedic, the seiyuu work is what essentially makes our character feel like real people. This plays a huge part in making the series look like a believable Yakuza space oddity. It's a job done right. The OST, and especially the ending and opening songs quite well capture the uplifting nature of the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter 4 episodes, I can pretty much recommend Hinamatsuri to everyone. Especially those who are looking for airing series to try. This is the one you should be currently following.",

Yes, it does have some moments that it actually gets you of guard, but most of the time you can easily guess when it will break expectancy, and how. \r\nCharacters are poor, or at least they can't shine alone, and there is very few interaction between them, many jokes are about the adversities of a single character, many of those aren't funny. I understand that good part of jokes comes from sad things, but that doesn't mean sad things are fun by themselves. I don't really thing the writeror the director worked well together, but on my opinion both are bad. \\n\\n\r\nStory is weak as in any comedy, yes it tries to give some pregression to the side characters, but Hina, which, is the funniest one of them progress very little. And a main problem is that it doesn't keep the premise at all. The superpowers, are barely used, even when they should. Yes, in good part it would brake the jokes, exactly beacuse those jokes are made for a powerless sitcom, and not this kind of thing..\\n\\n\r\nArt style is weak and plain creepy on those closes. Maybe that was the intention, the author thought it was funny, but for me, it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you can skip this one.

            "content": "They say life will either make you laugh or cry, and that\u2019s exactly what lies in the power of comedy. Comedy is a form of art and it\u2019s reflective of the times we live in, this art can be a powerful tool and the great comedies know how to wield it. As the saying goes, humour is like a rubber sword\u2013it allows you to make a point without drawing blood. Beneath the humour in Hinamatsuri lies a rich layer of social commentary and life lessons, it\u2019s what makes this series much more memorable. It perfectly balances the thought-provoking themes and gut-busting segments through a combinationof situational comedy, visual gags, emotional punches and plenty of misunderstandings. \\n\\n\r\nMost comedies aspire to be able to work in those registers but few actually do them well all at the same time. Hinamatsuri fits within the very small group that manages the feat and does it exceptionally well. What becomes apparent is that it\u2019s an absurdist comedy that enters the realm of farce. With its absurd premise and the dubious mixture of young girls and adult men, many might mistake the true nature of the show. Hina falls from the ceiling in Nitta Yoshifumi\u2019s condo, he is a high-rising yakuza. Anzu ends up living in a forest camp amongst old homeless men, vulnerable and alone. And Hitomi Mishima inexplicably finds herself tending a bar all by herself as a drunk man wanders in. It\u2019s hard not to view these scenarios and expect the worst. But this is when the show takes bizarre situations and fills it with wholesome comedy. There isn\u2019t a gag that feels heartless or an emotional moment that feels cheap, it understands its boundaries, always finding the underlying humour without sacrificing its virtues. Hinamatsuri pigeonholes itself through three parallel stories: Hina, Hitomi, and Anzu\u2013each one has their own distinctive tone but we do see where each one intersects and eventually tie together.\\n\\n\r\nHina is the problem child of the three and her and Nitta are the main protagonists. The comedy in her segments has a more sarcastic edge. While there are a few sweet moments between Hina and Nitta, for the most part, they conclude with a cynical or confrontational punchline. It doesn\u2019t undermine their relationship, but it gives more of a traditionally comedic vibe of two individuals who are heavily flawed but learn to tolerate each other and hardly getting sentimental about it. Hina\u2019s scenes put on a clinical display in deadpan comedy. Even when she was interacting with the other characters she took on the role of the disinterested observer. This had the effect of cleverly transforming her into the most rational character, something that comes as a shock due to her interactions with Nitta. Hitomi\u2019s path thrived on consistently escalating absurdity, mainly caused by Hina\u2019s actions or the selfishness of her boss Utako who owns a bar which she works at. Hitomi has trouble saying no to good people (who happen to be extremely incompetent), no matter how crazy their requests may sound. She piles on more responsibility and stress since she\u2019s prodigious at everything she does. Her segments end in punchlines too, so there\u2019s not a lot of breathing room for a heartfelt moment. Through these circumstances, the viewers are treated to incredulous reactions to her completely unasked-for rise into success.\\n\\n\r\nHitomi\u2019s life is spiralling completely out of control, having to balance these absurdities along with her childhood makes up a lot of the more hilarious content in the show. It makes it all worth it when she eventually has the power over those that took advantage of her. Anzu\u2019s mission at first was to pursue Hina, but after failing to retrieve her, she ends up in the Fastlane that leads her to shoplift for food, collecting garbage for pennies and living under a bridge. It\u2019s as if life dealt her a bad hand and she struggles to understand how society works. What follows next is definitely the biggest gut-punching moment in the series and it\u2019s how Anzu\u2019s arc depicts homelessness in the most realistic way, it\u2019s truly moving. Hinamatsuri\u2019s comedy revels in subverting our expectations so as absurd as the premise looked, everything has come full circle\u2013Nitta ends up adopting Hina as his daughter and takes care of her. The drunk man teaches Hitomi how to have more self-confidence. The homeless men treat Anzu with compassion and teach her about kindness and how to survive on the fringes of society. \\n\\n\r\nAnzu grows to love and care for her homeless family and she learns that separation is integral to the growth and new beginnings which leads into another heart-wrenching moment. Anzu becomes the heart of the series. It lets her story\u2019s emotional peaks stand on their own without trying to undermine them with cynical gags, and in doing so illustrates that it truly understands that good comedy doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of emotional sincerity. Now on to Nitta and the curious situations he ends up in whether he\u2019s finding himself in a cement barrel due to a misunderstanding or prepping for a date with Utako (the bartender who hired Hitomi), the run of bad luck he finds himself in could be considered curse-related which is one of the funny gags. The father and daughter pairing of Nitta and Hina makes them such the odd duo, but their relationship creates many laugh-out-loud moments. Nitta\u2019s role is often that of wry, jaded spectator to this farcical circus called Hinamatsuri and when all characters interact with each other, it\u2019s when the show is at its best.\\n\\n\r\nStudio feel adapts Masao Ohtake\u2019s manga and visually it is amazing from character designs, backgrounds, colour scheme, and animation. And most importantly the facial expressions and it\u2019s great when you see anime that blends cartoony reactions with realism in the way Hinamatsuri does\u2013e.g. Hitomi\u2019s signature shock face. Great news about the voice acting is not only is each character\u2019s performances are pitch-perfect but both Sub and Dub are great. Special mention to Kaeda Hondo and Tabitha Ray\u2019s portrayal of Hitomi that makes the tough journey she travelled a lot more hilarious. The score captured both the funny and the tender side of the show. The proficient use of classical instruments, great for the heartfelt scenes. The funny scenes used a lot of upbeat electric piano melodies and funky percussions. Opening and Ending compliment the themes of the show. The last oddball thrown into the mix that comes late in the series is another psychic-powered girl in Mao who is introduced in the very first episode in what is immediately revealed to be a flash forward three years after Hina arrived in Tokyo. Her story arc is pretty interesting and pays homage to the movie Castaway, you have to see it. \\n\\n\r\nThere is quite the character study going on here, we see how people of similar backgrounds can perceive the world from their surroundings. Hina is living a luxurious life where food is prepared for her daily, while Anzu is living the life of poverty where she works all day for her meals. It teaches us not to take things for granted. I fully recommend to watch it, both the Sub and Dub. It\u2019s an amazingly great comedy with stunning world building themes, fully fleshed out and developed characters who have many layers, great chemistry and they\u2019re humanized throughout the series. Plenty of hilarity segments that is balanced out with tear-jerking moments. It\u2019s not what you have in life that matters; what matters is whom you share your life with, and that\u2019s what Hinamatsuri is all about.\\n",

The art is nice although it's liek they are catching up with the new flashing style of A place further than the universe and Yuru camp, but the character design is funny, fressh and hillarious as well. Absolutely a must watch for this season.",

This show is very episodic, with very little in the way of a contiguous story line. You would think a show about girls with telekinetic powers and some shadowy organization would have more violence, fights or anything really.\r\n Instead you are treated to 12 episodes of Hina wanting food and lazing about. Nitta caring for and often complaining about Hina (all the while being a singularly uninteresting Yakuza member). Ansu's life as a homeless teen (which was probablythe most interesting part of the show) and finally Hitomi working in Nitta's favorite bar and occasionally helping Hina or Ansu.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 12 episodes there was no indication of where these super powered girls came from, or what the organization is, why they exist etc. Like I said, it's 12 episodes of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was fine. If you care, there was little to no fan service.\\n\r\nSoundtrack was fine.\\n\\n\r\nGo into this one with low expectations and maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.\\n\\n\r\n5.5 out of 10",

            "content": "TLDR: Hina is a fun and bubbly anime which focuses on unique experiences in unique circumstances. It's a funny side watch that doesn't focus on the sci-fi tag, but centralises on the interactions of random individuals. You're at the right place if you want a nice watch that will brighten your day, even if it's by a little. \r\nScores~ Story [7] Art [6] Sound [6] Character [8] Enjoyment [8] Overall [7]\r\nStory [7]\r\nHinamatsuri's story isn't spectacular, but something that develops at a nice pace and is enjoyable. While the anime doesn't particularly explain the context of the story (pre-Hina appearance), any need for this closure iswashed away as you are immersed in the interactions within the series. \\n\r\nYou want to see how the blank Hina (character) acts and grows, how Anzu works her way through life and how the characters interact, develop and react to each other. It's not a large metaphoric story, but a collection of stories; a good slice of life story.\\n\r\nAs a result, the interesting and everchanging development, combined with its comedic tone, make Hinamatsuri's story enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n*And to those expecting the explosions of sci-fi/magic, be prepared to be disappointed as this anime doesn't particularly focus on this aspect and is more of just a drive for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt [6]\\n\r\nNothing much of note here. While the drawings are quite consistent throughout the series so far, the art doesn't particularly stand out at in any major way and can feel a bit dated for 2018. It does a good job characterising the temperaments of the characters and that's all that is needed of an adaption. Not yet mediocre but not quite great either.  \\n\\n\r\nSound [6]\\n\r\nSimilar things can be said here, as with art. The OP and ending tracks are good, but it isn't much of a step over fair. The voice acting is consistent, solid and set the tone for every character making them fun to follow. Again, the sound is not great, but not mediocre either, making it a fair attempt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8]\\n\r\nPerhaps The series' strength, it really makes it up here by introducing a variety of unforeseen characters into the mix. The interesting attitudes of various characters make us curious to see the how the characters interact and develop. We want them to be together, to talk and to wander aimlessly into conversations. \\n\r\nIt keeps it fresh and entertaining as we move through the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8]\\n\r\nI can't help but be fixated on the interactions of Hina (character), and perhaps that is my fault (I'm a sucker for the clueless). As such as a shot from the blue, Hinamatsuri takes \"not belonging\" to a unique level as it shoots various situations into the mix, making it really enjoyable. I want to see what happens next, what happened after that and after that. \\n\r\nHinamatsuri keeps it fresh and the unknowing chemistry is keeping me pinned to this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [7]\\n\r\nEven though this isn't a top quality production digitally (art and sound), the characters and story within the show drag the quality back up and make this a very worthwhile watch. Through its left-field characters and the chemistry they develop off of one another, Hinamatsuri leaves you wanting for more as it keeps it fresh and interesting within it's cute, yet mature, world.\\n\\n\r\nP.S\\n\r\n\"Don't you dare break that vase\" they said...\\n\r\n\"I'll disown you\" they said\\n\r\nAnd disown you they did...\\n",

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n _____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nSometimes you are better off leaving your expectations low and not getting enraptured into something too quickly. For someone that has watched a lot of television and film, I still haven\u2019t broken the habit of brushing my cynicism aside when I see something exceptionally well made. Whether it be the first episode of Kill la Kill, which is vibrant, eccentric, and perfectly paced, or the hook in Nichijou, as we witness a well-known anime clich\u00e9 get upturned in its opening sequence, setting lofty expectations for the series. The point here is, when a show gives you everything in its opening, you either buy intoit or don\u2019t. It shapes the future of the product for the viewer. Next time you sit down to consume an anime, try and pay attention to the way it attempts to hook you. How does that introduction affect your outlook on the rest of the episode?\\n\\n\r\n            Hinamatsuri fits snuggly with the \u201cload-blowers\u201d of the industry; clearly wanting to showcase an especially impressive fight sequence that was not only exceptionally animated but solidly funny as well.  A sporadic, nimble cut filled with substantial smears and smooth frames. It instantly captured me. Unfortunately, it peaked right then, for nothing else in the series reached that level of entertainment. I can\u2019t help but feel as though I would\u2019ve enjoyed it more if my expectations weren\u2019t taken through a proverbial lap dance only to get a high-heel to the nads.\\n\\n\r\n            That\u2019s not to say that Hinamatsuri is bad. It just doesn\u2019t really attempt to be anything it established past the first episode. We meet Nitta, a Yakuza member who finds a metallic pod in his home with an odd girl trapped at the center of it. That girl is Hina. Her origins are unknown. We do quickly figure out she\u2019s a bit of deadpan brat with telekinetic powers. From there, Nitta proceeds to unwillingly take care of her in continuously absurd situations as he makes use of her powers, her naivete, and their general relationship stays at a comfortable medium between hating each other and genuinely loving each other. \\n\\n\r\n\tHinamatsuri proceeds to introduce a decent secondary cast. A second, power-infused girl with Anzu, who gets left in our strange world as she tries to make ends meet with a bunch of homeless men, and Mishima, a classmate of Hina who gets thrust into a bartending job while still in elementary school. The idea here is that every character must face a situation firmly out of their comfort zone. Nitta, who is somewhat of a lady\u2019s man and rogue, living alone in his apartment, is forced to become a pseudo-parent. Anzu needs to learn about this alien world and survive. Mishima must adapt to the new job she was burdened with. Each one has a miniature arc and plenty of B-stories. Some work, others resoundingly don\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe show is at its best when it is shooting the shit. Mishima is constantly the most entertaining character, not because she\u2019s well-written, mind you, but simply because the situations she\u2019s put in are farcical and almost always comedy-oriented. Meanwhile, Anzu, who is stuck living with homeless people, must go through a less-funny and more saccharine arc, as she deals with loss and growth. Her arc is perhaps the show at its weakest, as I found myself cringing at the overly-sugary emotions that were not only undeserved but completely dissonant from the appeal of the series to me. \\n\\n\r\n\tHina and Nitta are well-balanced enough. One moment they hate each other, another moment they have a connection. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it is serviceable. With above-average animation for TV anime, Hinamatsuri elevates its presentation just enough to retain my interest. Unfortunately, the character designs are boring, to put it kindly. If I were in a worse mood I\u2019d easily call them flat-out ugly. This doesn\u2019t do too much to detract from the series, however, the generally serviceable animation, when compared to other shows of its ilk, is truly the only stand-out element in the presentation. Everything else in Hinamatsuri, from directing to shot-composition is uninspired, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\n\tPeaking so early didn\u2019t do it any favors, either, as the initial spectacle wears off and we get what I can only call a slightly above average slice of life. The comedy here is passable for anime, a medium which seriously struggles to be funny on its best day. The characters are generally unmemorable barring a few situations they find themselves in. Particularly earlier on the series before the character dynamics began feeling repetitive. There were flashes of inspiration in the general malaise, what with Hina begging Nitta to go to a \u201cgirl\u2019s club\u201d, and Mishima\u2019s journey through unwilling student to a professional bartender. It was a positive experience, if only barely. I see copious praise for a series that does the bare minimum to stand-out from the crowd, but honestly, for a medium that loves repetition so much, maybe that\u2019s enough. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This Spring 2018 season, we are given sequels of popular shows that ever aired on the anime community. From My Hero Academia 3, Tokyo Ghoul:re, Steins;Gate 0, High School DxD Hero to SAO Alternative GGO (even tho its a spin-off). Then we are blessed with Romantic-comedy segmented shows like Wotakoi, Tada-kun and 3D-Kanojo Girl. Of course this are not the only anime the aired this season. There are countless of them as well as leftovers from the last season which is Winter 2018. However, despite of many choices of anime to watch, there is one lacking the season without this genre. The \"Comedy\" genre. Sure,we have rom-coms all over the place but that doesn't stop me for hoping a show that will air this season that is pure comedy. Not only comedy, but some drama as well that can make my or our hearts feels warmth. And I am glad I stumbled upon Hinamatsuri (Or Hina Festival).\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Hinamatsuri is quite simple. You have a young psychic girl named Hina got transported in a form of a weird-metallic capsule to the apartment of a yakuza named Nitta. This two relationship servers one of the primary comedic acts of the show. We have Nitta who doesnt want to adopt Hina but leaves him no choice to adopt her because of her powers. Thus, this embarks the journey of Hina and Nitta, from parenting to just silliness.\\n\r\nComedic anime revolves mainly on the characters for the story. And Hinamatsuri's characters are well-developed with their own unique attributes. For example, Hina's attitude on the show is very unique unlike any other main protagonist on comedy anime. She is dumb, boring, annoying in the eyes of Nitta, spoiled and has a very unique voice that really reflects her personality. Although this personalities are very bad, in the show, it is just fun. She is what she is and we viewers enjoy how boring she can get through episode. Whether or not she tries her best to fit to Nitta's apartment, there will still be laughter on our faces. The chemistry of Hina and Nitta being on one scene is priceless enough to make you laugh. Her boredom plus Nitta's annoyed face are just good. Not to mention the other characters as well like Anzu and Hitomi. This two gave plus points on this show. We have Anzu here who was like Hina at the start but due to her having different experience, her character changed. We can compare the two psychics being like one child on a poor family and one child on a rich family. the two's relationship reflects the real world's perspective between these two. Then there's Hitomi who really adds the comedic material to the top. With her being a part-timer but a middle-schooler, who knows that if she is found out, trouble can get her. Thus, this leads to some whacky comedy skits and her faces making us laugh.\\n\r\nThe other characters as well supports the genre of this show. From Utako forcing Hitomi, the band boys, the yakuzas, journalist, Hitomi's Mom. Everyone is part of the show. Everyone have elements of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOn every anime out there, art style is a must. In Hinamatsuri, its art is one of the things that made it stand out this season. I am not talking about beautiful animations, fight scenes, scenery and all. I am talking about there facial reaction. The art of the facial reaction of the characters are splendid. It makes anyone giggle or laugh whether it is Hitomi screaming or even any other character with a gloomy face. It is just well-done.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are quite stunning as well. On the opening, we see every character from Hina to Utako, their possible roles on the upcoming episodes with their visuals. The music is very good along with the visuals as well. Speaking of good music, the ending really stands out for me. With the electric guitar on the beginning showing Hina and Nitta or Nitta only walking through the streetlights are just beautiful. Then seeing the facial expression of Nitta throughout the ending with the male voice are just well-synchronized. They are all good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hinamatsuri is not that much of a well-known anime this season because of the other anime out there. However, it stands top for me as one of the great anime that came out this season. Its drama and comedy are well fuse up with each other and can either make you laugh or sad (well you feel sad because of only one character) on every episode. I really recommend anyone seeing my review right now to give this anime a go because of its unique intake on comedy and hidden reflections of youth on our generation.",

Scrolling about this anime , I already knew it was going to be good. If you watched a lot of anime you can already tell an anime is going to be good even before watching it. So I saved this anime for my 100th special.  \r\nAnd to no surprise it was amazing. The comedic parts of this anime is so fresh and sometimes subtle. It never gets boring and repetitive like a lot of the comedy animeI have watched. In addition to the comedy, there are several instances where the anime is \"Feelzy\" and I did not expect that at all. It really strengthened the anime and I feel the non-funny scenes made the anime even more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all unique and funny in their own way. I find with a lot of anime I watch , if it is good , almost all the time I end up liking all the characters like Stein's Gate. The opening,ending,and general sound in this anime is so soothing. I always kick back in my chair with my arms behind my head and listen to the ending. This anime should not be skipped. Give it a try , you will enjoy it!",

            "content": "Man, was this anime a ride or what? I previously wrote my review on this series when I reached the midpoint of the anime but I thought I'd update you guys since my opinion's changed a bit. Hinamatsuri is an anime that primarily follows the titular character, Hina\u2014a psychic girl that finds herself living with a wealthy yakuza member, Nitta, after mysteriously appearing in his house one night. While the premise is a bit unoriginal, it still has a few interesting moments.\r\nThis series is considered to be a comedy, but I find some of the jokes failing to land. Don't get me wrong, I findmyself laughing a bit at a joke or two each episode, but I just don't find most of them particularly funny. The beginning started off flat, but it got a bit wackier and it doesn't take itself too seriously, which I liked. However, when it has its emotional moments, that was when the series shines as it really reels you in. The series lacks a extended storyline but the story-of-the-week theme is at least interesting and you don't get bored by the short stories too often. What I'm not fond of is the implementation of a supernatural element to the anime, but the failure to address it. The series is about a psychic girl literally appearing out of nowhere, and the deurotagonist doesn't even address it after the first episode. What's up with that? Other than that, the story is OK but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we start off the series, the main characters are a bit generic and we knew little to nothing about them. Hina was more-or-less just an apathetic girl who finds herself confused yet intrigued by the human customs (how original), and Nitta was kind of just the caretaker meant to be the comedic relief. After a bit, we saw Hina grow into a more empathetic character but she still retains her apathetic attitude which I've grown to actually like. Nitta, on the other hand, is still lacking in the personality department but he's a lot more tolerable then he was before. While Hina and Nitta are supposed to be the stars of the show, I find myself particularly drawn to the supporting character, Anzu, another psychic girl who mysteriously appears through unknown circumstances. While Hina was lucky to be picked up and pampered by Nitta, Anzu is raised by a homeless community and learns to be humble and resourceful. Anzu has a lot more depth and growth than our main character, and I always find myself looking forward to her story more than I do Hina's. Unfortunately, the series is about Hina and not Anzu. The rest of the supporting characters are also not too bad. We even get a few episodes dedicated to them, which I surprisingly liked!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good as well. While this anime is mean to be a comedy, there were a few action scenes and the animation looked smooth! The colors were nice and it fits the comedic tone of the series very well. The character designs are also pretty good. None of the main characters look alike, so you won't be confused by who's who. That's a plus for me! The soundtrack is your generic anime OST, so there's not much to talk about in regard to that. The opening originally seemed like another cliche anime opening but it's gotten catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't put this series on my top list for this season, it's still pretty good. As I said before, the series lacks an extended storyline but the story-of-the-week theme is at least interesting. I wouldn't say that this series is quite binge-worthy, but it's fun to watch when you're bored. Check it out if you have the time.\\n\\n",

Jokes don\u2019t bog down the pace because they\u2019re seamlessly woven into the story and character arcs, the jokes are not part of the story, the story is part of the jokes and its amazing.\\n\\n\r\nComedy is so well directed in this show, that even the exaggerating animated faces are so well timed, the fact that the gags stick even into further episodes, makes this show gold, it reminds me a lot of Konosuba first episodes (Aqua being eaten by a frog). Amazing Humour.\\n\\n\r\nFInal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nI really want to write a lot on this section but I dont want to ruin it for you, Hinamatsuri is really worth it as a comedy show, it has one the freshest comedy I have seen in years in any mean possible, it has no underdeveloped or unnecessary characters, the slice of life in this is just perfect, not to much to be consider a drama but enough to make a balance for the really amazing story, in the same episode you might find yourself crying of laughter and suddenly tearing apart, its such a rollercoaster. I havent seen something like this in a while, so I hope you can feel the same way this show made me feel.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, you wouldn't be disappointed.",

It's a show that doesn't necessarily do anything out of the ordinary, but does it well. It has nice quirky jokes hear and there and its a real feel-good anime. If you do watch this, I can guarantee you will have that creepy smile on your face all the way through. It's jokes are very innocent and wholesome. \r\nI didn't think there were any stand out character designs or music in the show, but they all played a part in the anime. I hope for season 2, theybring a lil bit more action as the bits and pieces of action/comedy scenes were definitely the funniest parts of the show. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I came to this show expecting a silly show about psychokinetic girls and yakuza members getting up to mischief, but I left with a lot more than I was expecting. \r\nThis is my first MAL review, and it will contain *spoilers*!\r\nThe show starts off as a normal enough comedy, with great animation and well designed characters. The gags are quick and funny, and never failed to make me laugh. The infamous 'fight scene' from the second episode and the ever brilliant 'girly club' scene are particularly great. But as the show expands, it not only maintains its comedy and writing, but also touches on themesof childhood, growing up, and parent hood.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Hina, and her adopted father Nitta develop a healthy relationship throughout the series- Nitta learns of how much a child can change your life, and Hina learns that the world doesn't revolve around her. Anzu's character arc explores how lives can be influenced by surroundings, and things loved ones tell you when you're young can stick with you forever. And finally Mishima, while her story is substantially more comedic than the others, it still briefly explores growing up, coming to terms with ones place in the world, and how tough the adult world can be.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters, main and secondary, are interesting, memorable, and each have their fair share of hilarious moments. By the end of the series, you'll no doubt love the characters and really sympathise with their troubles. While I'm not particularly in the position to comment on the themes of life and growing up, I can certainly respect the maturity these ideas are handled with, and I can definitely respect the brilliant humour sprinkled within. Truly a pinnacle in comedy slice of life anime!",

            "content": "I fell in love with this anime. Hinamatsuri is a real masterpiece, from the start to the end. First of all, i just loved how things happen fluently, the plot and its cohesion just don't fail. If the previous events would take the next episode to a sad episode of a funny one, it just happens, the concern with the plot is the priority of the series, and is makes everything happen naturally, taking us to all kinds of episodes, and every of them very emotional, beautiful, funny or cute. The fact is that in the end of each episode you will love it forsure if you like to feel real emotions watching something, whichever they are.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10) - Well, that's not much to talk about, we just know that Hina and Anzu are from other universe or planet and Hina seems to be in trouble because of this. Mao getting lost is hilarious, but it kinda disturbs us from knowing the stiry behind the three girls. Despite this, the plot developed on the 12 episodes is very nice, i just love how the anime shows the different paths of life taken by Hina and Anzu, each one of them becoming a diferent \"grown up\" person in society. Besides that, every supporting character have it's own time, development and \"respect\" in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - The art of Hinamatsuri is an ordinary but flawlessly made art. The colors are common, the trace is simple and the backgrounds are normal. But everything is made perfectly, in no time you see yourself troubled with something and even being so ordinary, it still has value representing perfectly the streets, the interior of houses and everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - This part is quite complex for me to comment, because a slice of life anime can't do much as action animes. Of course the drama sound matters, the comedy and cute moments too, but it's hard to determine without an epic soundtrack. I liked it, but none of them called my attention as for example Hunter x Hunter OST did.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10) - That is my favourite part in this anime. Hina is a cute \\n\r\nand distracted girl that is so captivating in many ways. I feel just like Nitta in their cute moments when i look at her. Nitta is a great character too, he's outspoken, simple and a nice guy. I love how characters never lose their personalities convenently, they just act like true people would act, i mean, following their natural personalities. Anzu and Mishima were my favourite, they had such a great development. Anzu went to a crazy lost alien to a hardworking humble girl, and as i said before, always keeping her personality. Mishima in the other hand just can't say no, and it takes her to a big world of business and employment, that was very funny and again, very respectful to her personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - After all i've written here, it couldn't be anything besides a 10. Each episode had it own value, it own emotions and story, just indescribably beautiful. I loved Anzu with the homeless, loved Nitta and Hina fights and reconciliations, every funny moments. The only scene i really didn't appreciate was Mao lost in the island. Every other thing i liked or loved, a great experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10) - I think i don't have much to talk here, it's just the result of all i mentioned here. Great characters, a credible plot (despite the supernatural factor), beautiful episodes, a touching drama and a lot of emotions involved. And oh, the last scene is incredibly funny, it hyped me for season 2.\\n",

From Yakuzas to naked girls coming out of some sort of spaceship... Oh and, they have powers, psychic powers. I really like this story because it remembers me what I'm watching, it remembers me that I'm watching anime. This story is the kind of story I want a newbie in the anime world to watch, because this is exactly what you will find in the overall of anime. This story, is the pinnacle of the anime.\r\n* Art *\r\nI'm not the one totalk about art but, for the most part, I can tell that it does have a good animation, talking about how the movements come to scene and how the backgrounds are draw. It feels like a normal animation, some kind of animation that you can enjoy without any problem, it isn't a Kyoto Animation new graphic animation, but is still really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n* Sound *\\n\r\nGod, the feels you get from the music are awesome. I'm not trying to do a spoiler but this anime does have some scenes were the melodrama comes out and it plays beautifully. I don't like melodrama, but I liked this one because the feel I got from it was like remembering me why I like this community, really a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n* Character *\\n\r\nLike I said at the very start, you can find from Yakuzas to Girls... Is awesome  the kind of character you can find, the main story focus in a boy who is a Yakuza and a kuudere girl which comes to his house by some sort of a spaceship, this kind of combination is the one you can tell is gonna be a disaster and as the result of the fact it is gonna be a disaster you know it is gonna be funny or sad at some point. The character development isn't great tho, mostly because the story of Hino isn't clear at all, you can tell some things that happened, but it isn't clear at all.\\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment  *\\n\r\nSo... Nothing to say, I really love this show, I love how it plays the melodrama, I love the disaster of the characters, I love every single frame of this anime and I totally recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nAs an overall: 9/10\\n\r\nThat's something to add in your list.",

            "content": "First and foremost, Hinamatsuri is a gag comedy. It relies heavily on the reactions of the characters and less so the actual situations they are put in. For me, the comedy almost always landed. It was a ton of fun to watch. As the anime progressed, it even got a little touching at times. The theme of family was really strong in this anime and it definitely got more heartwarming with each episode. After a certain point however, it kind of lost the charm for me. The last 4 or so episodes ranged from genuinely bad to okay at best. They lacked the usual charmof the characters, the overall fun of the anime, and good jokes/visual gags in general. While most of the characters were lovable and funny in their own ways, a lot of the characters (almost every adult) were a pain to see. They were pretty annoying and unbearable at times and helped to lower the enjoyment value at certain points. The general themes of family that the anime built up were gladly sacrificed for the sake of a few jokes. Character development was sacrificed at times too. Overall, it was still good. It\u2019s nothing truly special that I\u2019ll remember a year down the line, but I am interested enough to maybe check out the manga.",

Hina is a girl who appeared to our protagonist who is a yakuza and ended up living with him for some reason or another. Just your common plot, really.\r\nAnyhow, that doesn't really affect the quality overall.

Go read a book if that's what you want. Here you have an anime that will make your lungs burst and potentially have you sent to the hospital. Just make sure you sue the producers if that happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThat's probably the most notable thing once you start watching the anime. The art isn't the greatest, to be frank. And at first it felt odd. It certainly is unique. However, it needs some getting used to. In the end of the day, it actually became a trademark to this anime and a characteristic trait it has.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nAmazing voice acting that's on point. Expect the same level as you have seen in Gintama or dare I say even better. Certainly, couldn't have asked for better than what I was given. Each character is just too fitting in their role and you can feel everything is placed just right in its place. The OST isn't something special. It is good, but not unique as the rest of what this anime offers. However, it doesn't play any big role in the anime, anyway. So that won't affect my score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nNow to the real talk. Is it enjoyable? HELL YEAH IT IS! It's one of my top anime in terms of comedy and I just started watching it on a whim. I entered completely blind and now I'm absolutely addicted. My one and only complaint is that we don't have enough of this. It's a crime that this isn't a long-running series. Leaving me with the feeling that I need to rewatch it and I just finished it is certainly unsatisfactory and not what an anime should accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, each character gets their own share of development. I won't go in the details here as I think this will diminish their worth once you actually get to see them. But the arcs are equally emotional and enjoyable. Certainly, the girls are the ones who get development in their arcs. Anzu being the one having the most emotional arc and the most beautiful one as well(Anzu for girl of the year).\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, despite Hina being the main heroine, she gets the least amount of development. But arguably this might be the most fitting for her monotone personality.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all,\\n\r\nIf you went through this description then I hope you realize by now how much I'm fanboying over this anime. I haven't read the manga nor did I ever hear about this anime before this spring. I just fell in love with it because of how good it is. I wrote this review in hopes of showing you how much I love it and potentially giving you the chance to experience what I have. That being an amazing journey of laughs and tears called Hinamatsuri.\\n\r\nDefinitely recommend watching this and will most likely rewatch it a ton of times unless they decide to make a second season.",

Well give me a jingly hat and some silly shoes, because one particular characters arc stood far aboveany emotional impact seasonal competitors like Darling in the Franxx had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows plot is loosely centered around young Yakuza member Nitta and his miraculous encounter with Hina a girl of unknown origin and magical powers.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is first and foremost a comedy show and it gets a solid A+ in this regard. The gags mostly come from subverted expecations of a scene's outcome and recurring gags such as Nitta's unamused and defeated faces or Hitomi's inability to say no to people.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows OP and ED didn't particularly capture me, and although the soundtrack did well to fit the mood; the circumstances of characters are what made most scenes have an impact or entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nA minor complaint I may have would be that either the show is very faithful to the source material (which I have no idea if it is or not) or it was clearly made with a constrained budget. The show LOOKS great visually with use of low quality CG being a rarity rather than the norm but the show had a very common occurrence of reusing faces, poses and animations. Often I felt this was for comedic effect but the more I saw the same shocked, wide eyed tongue out expression the more the industry savvy part of my mind whispered \"did they use this gag to pad out time or cut cost on frames?\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hinamatsuri provides a comedic experience that will literally have you shedding tears of laughter and tears of sorrow in the same episode. I eagerly await the second season.",

            "content": "\"How often in life do you get angry at balls\" (Episode 8)\r\nLet's get down to business. You're either utterly disappointed by this season or super hyped about SG0. Well let's just say if you are planning on losing any more hope for this season, fear not, this is an anime that well deserves your attention. Let's get to it.\r\nSo why should you watch it. Firstly, memorability. I remember this anime. It stands out as something that isn't just a bunch of students dicking about. Studio Feels delivered the damn feels. Anzu may not have the layering and depth of clannad but it's there. A sliceof life, comedy anime that actually has sad scenes. It's just unexpected. Asides the feels, I noticed how it doesn't just cover school scenes, in fact there's an oddly lack of school scenes, mostly circulating around bars, yakuza office, your local strip club. Totally refreshing to know that japan isn't just a bunch of classrooms connected to each other. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, lovable characters. They are all lovable. All of them. They are like the opposite of Darling in the franxx. Completely. I would write a love letter to Studio feels for this. The sort of emotional bond between me and basically any character, even side characters are great for 12 episodes. There's not a lot of standout which means there's a lot of interaction between the main and side characters, not just the \"I'm the only guy in Japan\" syndrome. Awesome. And the main characters just bond so damn well that I feel emotionally attached and want to watch it. All well scripted, all fit in perfectly, all of them are awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThird, execution. This series has everything well laid out. Everything from how Hina responds to how bad dad Nitta thinking that bringing a kid to a strip club is a good idea. It's just clever as the jokes made are of similar style but not the same. Jokes are rarely if ever repeated, they are just made in a manner that fits a characters style. That's comedy right there. This doesn't have the funniest jokes, but it just fits in so well to a character's style that it's automatically funny. It doesn't feel too forced but rather a balance of crudeness and idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nAnything bad? Not much.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is fine i guess. The only issue I may have is that the colors seem a bit muted and there's less glow to it compared to even last years anime. Maybe you dig it maybe not, just look it up.\\n\\n\r\nAudio is fine i guess. I did a sample on a pair of borrowed Stax and while sound quality isn't quite violet evergarden mind blowing, it's definitely not horrible. Right down the middle. Not very open, not a lot of background liveliness, but voice actors are doing ok. Dub is fine i guess, just as equally weird as every other anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, I think in this particular genre, it probably blows away most of your average comedy series of course. Sure maybe it won't beat Gintama despite their similarities, Gintama has that extra bit of depth and arguably more cruder in jokes and sure maybe it won't beat Nichijou in terms of sheer explosiveness and unexpectedness, but it gets darn close. Just right behind them and arguably matching kobayashi dragon maid which btw is also great comedy slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThis is basically what the ideal comedy slice of life series looks like. Just stop whatever comedy series you are watching, just watch this.",

            "content": "Just so that we are clear: Nitta thought Hina was a dude, even though he had a full-frontal look at her unclothed body.\r\n\u2026\u2026seems legit.\r\nAnime comedies never seem to tickle my \u201cfunny bone\u201d the way The Simpsons did in its heyday (circa 1991-1999).  While there are notable exceptions (i.e. One Punch Man and Gintama), the vast majority fall under the zany category of school-aged hijinks.  To distinguish itself from the heard, Hinamatsuri throws in girls with psychic powers, who, for the most part, use them to generate obscure situations for the purposes of setting up the proverbial punch line.  And while a handfulof the joke\u2019s secure a half-smile-to-a-grin, nothing resonates enough with the viewer to burst out into laughter over.  In fact, I would wager that my expression resembled Hina\u2019s blank face when I watch this particular anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe funniest jokes, in my estimation, are the one\u2019s that have a modicum of relevance to one\u2019s own life experiences.  In animation, this begins by creating a character that embodies a distinguishable characteristic that is shared by most people (e.g. laziness), allowing the audience to live vicariously through them.  If the audience feels disconnected from the experiences of the character\u2019s on the screen, their actions come off as being ridiculous, and, god forbid, \u201ccartoonish.\u201d  To exemplify this point, juxtapose a typical Adam Sandler movie with a comedy classic, The Big Lebowski.  In the former\u2019s case, we have situational character\u2019s who fit a particular mold to tell a particular joke, usually to the point of exhaustion.  Whereas, with Lebowski, we have three character\u2019s who epitomize the human condition, that being: laziness, anger, and awkwardness.  Thus, allowing the comedy to sprout naturally from the essence of the character\u2019s themselves, rather than being forced through nonsensical happenstances \u2014 as is the case for Hinamatsuri.\\n\\n\r\nHina, to the detriment of the series, is a vacuous character with little-to-no remorse for her discourteousness, and only the slightest inclination of empathy.  She doesn\u2019t sound like a typical school girl to me, she sounds more like a sociopath, but that\u2019s none of my business (slurps Lipton tea).  Her unassuming lifestyle parallels that of an annoying, adolescent child, making her behavior all the more irksome; consequently, her immaturity extinguishes the impact of her \u201ccomedic\u201d moments. The singular moment where her deadpan personality did serve a purpose, was to set up the final joke in episode 8 (when Nitta celebrates being a \u201cfree\u201d man again \u2014 now that was hilarious!).  That aside, her monotonous, imbecilic behavior was simply excessive to the point of infuriating the viewer.  We get it, she\u2019s ceaselessly hungry, it\u2019s not cute when a three-year-old says it, and it\u2019s certainly not cute or funny when Hina says it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not really sure what to make of the homeless scenes with Anzu (there\u2019s some feels there, I suppose) and the bar scenes with Hitomi.  They, you know, happen, because\u2026\u2026the anime staff\u2019s gotta fill 12 episodes?  Also, how come Anzu\u2019s hair/appearance never looked disheveled when she was homeless?  It literally takes a day for anyone to look like utter garbage without the proper bathroom \u201cessentials.\u201d  Just saying.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my \u201charsh\u201d criticisms, its not an awful anime, its just not really good, either.  It offers a specific brand of comedy that may appeal to a cohort of the anime community; nevertheless, its staying power is substantially limited, due to the inane nature of the show.  If you have roughly 4.5 hours to kill (who am I kidding, I know you do) then give it a go, it may be a source of great enjoyment and copious laughter \u2014 but, if you\u2019re like me, it will be fairly jejune.",

That's why while I put only 6/10 for the story, i can easily put a 10/10 for all characters, since almost everyone in this series has a different way of living and have to deal with things in a sufficiently realistic way. \r\nSo... Since the character development is great enough to enjoy this series, why 8/10 overall? Just becausethe series are becoming very standard and are abandoning the idea of superpowers, yakuza and etc that they shown at beginning. I dunno if i can expect that they do any story progression so we can know something about where Hina and Anzu are from and what they can show about Nitta's yakuza life since they suddenly stopped focusing on that, and now it seems like they doesn't have anything to worry about besides family problems. They have to rush fast enough to do it in 12 episodes.",

Based on a manga with the same title, this comedy tells a story about Nitta, a young, lonesome but full of life Yakuza member minding his own business. Luckily enough he has all fingers. One day, a space cocoon falls from the sky (?) straight to his room. Inside, there is a little girl named Hina who has telekinetic superpowers. Once released and fed, she starts to adapt to terrestrial life, including going to school and eating caviar. Later on Anzu, another space girl, comes to town. And may Godbe my witness, they differ! What is going to happen will blow your mind and you will laugh hard.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also multiple pop-cultural references. I watched the first episode.

Later it recalls the scene and it makes sense ans you understand whathappened to end like that\\n\\n\r\nthe character development isn't the strongest feature of the anime but some characters are really well developed, and breaks the atmosphere of only comedy, though Hina is just Hina the whole anime\\n\\n\r\nBUT the anime calls for a second season, leaving a perfect hook for it, so the author could fix some things of the history which is not very explored, the anime just show the present and doesn't explain nothing about some questions you would have about the characters history\\n\\n\r\nalthough some problems I recommend this anime, it's a good comedy with some drama parts",

But I saw the first episode and went 'Ok, I'm interested', and as I progressed realized this was no 'Mob Psycho 100' but a whole different beast. Please put whatever your currently watching aside and watch this instead, you won't regret it.\r\nHinamatsuri is a Masterpiece, though hard to put into words it has now become my standard for excellent story telling and comedic timing. It has redefines what one should expect from a comedy, orslice of life. \\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri doesn't push any agenda instead just lets the story unfold in a way that is not profound or unexpected. It gives you time to take in the view and then punches you with the hilarity of the situation. It's natural comedy not derived from some back end joke we don't all understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, what Hinamatsuri does best is develop the side characters beyond what is expected. They have lives they have emotions and you understand who they are as people. It's unexpected and refreshing to know that these people have lives to and aren't just bartender A, lacky B, and hobo C.",

            "content": "When i watched the first episode of Hinamatsuri i was walking in the street with a stupid smile in my face as this surprised me like only a handful of shows can. The first episode was a good introduction to what would the series be but it was only the tip of the iceberg as it ended up being a complete experience.\r\nThis is a comedy and a good comedy know how and when to make you laugh and enjoy the jokes and the way it plays with it's characters, Hinamatsuri takes this to a whole other level as it does an almost perfect combination ofpace, jokes, hilarious moments and inspiration. This isn't a simple comedy althought, this has the comolete package and the prime examole for it will forever be episode 6 as it will forever be cherished in my memory. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fantasy part is only a minor part in the story aside from being the reason behind Anzu and Hina being able to come to this world but it is visually beautiful and let's a great impression in the spectators.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great as i liked both the Opening that it's titled Distance and was a great work to help rise the amvient mood in order to watch every episode as high on it as we possibly can and the Ending as they were a piece of art, it had two endings the first one called Sake to Ikura to 893 to Musume and the second one titled Shashinchou and directed by Yoko Ishida. Every single song had a feeling attached to them and were as beautifully done as humanly possible. \\n\\n\r\nYoshifumi Nitta is an emerging yakuza that cares about his family but doesn't want to live that life as he feels uneasy when he has to do one of the encommended jobs but one typical day as he is casually drinking a glass of wine a capsule appears through the roof of his house making him throw the wine in his face with a surprised face, inside the capsule is Hina a girl who will change his life. \\n\\n\r\nHina is the protagonist of Hinamtsuri, she is from an advanced civilization with tecnology way ahead of human comprehension, the civilization that she is from still call themselves as human eventhough they have extra skills like \"telekinesis\" that they use to their advantage in their everyday life. Her personality is simple and some may call it even annoying because she doesn't that deepness of other characters but that's what also make her be Hina. \\n\\n\r\nAnzu is from the same civilization as Hina and have the exact same powers althought not at the same level, she comes to this world with a mission to find Hina and complete a task encommended to her by her superior but she fails to beat Hina in a duel and decides to stay in this world. I loved how deep was Anzu's character and how she was in the middle of almost every emotional moment. The bond she created with the homeless comunity will forever be in their hearts, also how she adapted to living with her foster-parents, she was like a favorite daughter should be. \\n\\n\r\nHitomi is a highschool student that is responsible in every task she might have and the most hardworker girl in the show, she in a certain day is forced to work as a bartender in a bar as the owner of the bar saw her talent and later she resolves in every possible job she might have it could be firefighter, Mistress or officer althought at the end she had to stay with only one job because the weitgh of having so many jobs at the same time was too much. She is a prime example of how a woman needs to work hard to suceed in today's proffesional world. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so beautifully done, each one with it's own background, motivation and mission that anyone can feel identified with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe things i liked the most of Hinamatsuri series was how well it took care of it's characters and how well-developed they were. The relationshio between Hina and Nitta that was as clean as a daughter-father relationshio should be and how determined and efficient it was in the moments it intended to be comic and in the moment it intended to be emotional. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't as dark to call it a dark series. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't a simple comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a well-done work of love towards us and all people that enjoy anime around the world.",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nEach ep is usually split into two well-written self-contained halves that could each stand on their own. There's a beautiful blend of emotion and comedy in every episode that leaves you feeling fulfilled but wanting more.\r\nWe really never find out much about the backstories of the characters, but that's okay because it really is about the development of the characters and what they're doing right now.\r\nThere's a great focus on modern issues: homelessness, taking things for granted, over-work, enjoying what you have, economic disparity, even the legitimate side of the modern Yakuza. You really get the feeling that a lesson is learned every epeven if nothing was accomplished.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe focus is never really on visual spectacle so whilst the animation is quite average for a one-off production it does the job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI have a similar opinion to above, the focus is really on the writing and development of the characters which is really well done so while it's only done good enough it doesn't detract from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThere was never any unnecessary characters which seems to plague a lot of series. There was never time when more than four characters were present at a time which can really draw you in and make it feel personal. Each and every one of them experiences growth throughout the series that is highlighted heavily during each episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. The characters were adorable and funny and it really just did what it was supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nEssentially just a good, worthwhile watch. Nothing mind-blowing or to really rave over it was just a really genuine and enjoyable time. None of it feels too forced despite the half-ep style and even when it does you forgive it.",

            "content": "Spring 2018 was a pretty strong season, having heavy sequels like My Hero Academia and Steins;Gate 0 and having great original anime like Megalo Box and Love is Hard for Otaku. It was pretty hard to stand out this season, but Hinamatsuri did it by not having a original premise, but just by being damn good. Grab your guns and work your ass off, this is my review of Hinamatsuri.  \r\nStory: 8/10  \r\nHina falls with its... spaceship or whatever in Nitta's home. Now Nitta has to care for Hina so that she doesn't go on a big rampage. This causes astrange life for Nitta, only making it stranger when other characters from space come to earth, like Anzu. Not much to say about the plot: It's solid.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10  \\n\r\nHoly hell the animation is amazing. The character movements are fluid, the facial expressions are amazing and the action scenes are great to watch. This is a joy to watch with my eyes.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OST is also really damn strong. The OP and ED are fantastic and the rest of the OST is atmospheric ans also great to listen to. If it weren't for Megalo Box this would've been my favorite OST of this season.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10  \\n\r\nThe quality continues with its strong characters. You have Hina, a space loli who doesn't give a shit about anything other then food, Nitta, a yakuza who is just a good guy, Hitomi, a hard working girl who can't say no, and my favorite character, Anzu. She starts of bratty and wants to work alone, but she quickly grows into one of the purest characters I have ever seen. She is so sweet that her smile can already cause diabetes. A really strong cast overal.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10  \\n\r\nI already knew from the start that this was going to be the comedy of the season. The facial expressions make the jokes tons and tons more better and that is saying a lot because the humor itself is already really strong. This anime is also pretty emotional and handles its sad scenes really good. I especially loved the Anzu scenes. Goddamn it almost made me cry.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  \\n\r\nThis anime is not only a contender of aots, but also as aoty. It is a mutch watch. You will laugh, you will cry, but you will mostly laugh.\\n",

I could have definitely done with at least one actual high-stakes fight scene. With that said, Hinamatsuri definitely makes up for this with the sheer amount of genuinely funny comedy as well as emotionally-gripping scenes and character development that will surely tug at your heartstrings. \r\nItsuncommon that I find myself rooting for almost EVERY SINGLE character in an anime, but in just 12 episodes Hinamatsuri had me invested in every single one of these charming characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give the series an 8/10, but believe me when I say I 10/10 recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and wholesome time.",

            "content": "I've always been fan of comedy. What is wrong with this genre in anime nowadays is that it usually goes hand in hand with ecchi and harem which is the most boring stuff to watch. So it's amazing to see show like Hinamatsuri in spring season of 2018.\r\nLight mood of the show is packed with bit of drama too and sad moments too, as it should be. But it manages to balance these out perfectly while maintaining light-hearted atmosphere.\r\nFor slice of life series, it still produced interesting and well-written characters and didn't fail to surprise me with their development as well, which, again, is somethingnot many comedy SOLs are capable of and these characters usually just never stand out and are forgotten few weeks after you've finished watching the show.\\n\r\nYou are welcomed with psychic girl in care of member of yakuza, cheerful blonde girl who learns value of money and living, middle schooler who keeps the realistic factor and bunch of others also with good traits nonetheless. All of them jumbled into one delightful, enjoyable and humorous show.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say the show might use more fighting and such, but that would remove the satire aspect of it and it wouldn't prosper that way. That is to say, we have yet to see what kind of wild ride Hina and Yoshifumi will experience in the future.\\n\\n\r\nIf you'd like to see something different than infinite 'isekai', shounen, ecchi, harem, sports anime or if you are new to the community, I couldn't recommend you anything better than this show.",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri is a comedy anime which does more than purely focus on comedy. As a lot of comedy anime tend to just focus on the comedy, Hinamatsuri also throws great characters, with good character interactions and a pretty good story in the mix.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story of Hinamatsuri isn't out of the ordinary, but is a pretty good story overall. The story is about Hina, who has supernatural powers and gets taken in by Nitta, a yakuza, because he finds her in his apartment. Besides Hina, two other girls with supernatural powers show up throughout the anime as well. The premise of the story is relativelysimple, but causes great character interactions, causing a lot of comedic situations as well. The story also teaches the viewer certain life lessons, which also offers the viewer something to learn besides just being for comedic purposes. The first scene of the anime also takes place 3 years after the rest of the story, giving some foreshadowing for what's to come and introducing you to the absurdity of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: 8/10\\n\r\nThe most important part of a comedic anime, the comedy. Hinamatsuri uses its story and characters well, to create comedy in the show and the timing of the jokes is also done very well. Some jokes might miss the mark, but the comedy is very good overall with the anime using interesting ways to implement their jokes in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall the art and animation in this anime is pretty good. A lot of the scenes have a lot of detail and the characters facial expressions are animated in a great way as well, adding to the comedy in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound in the anime is pretty good overall, with a nice opening theme as well. The music fits the scenes pretty well, although there weren't many themes which stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of the best points of the anime is the characters, their interactions and their development. The character development is a point which isn't seen often in comedy anime, as some tend to forget about what happened in the episodes before it. Hina and Nitta have pretty great character interactions on their own, which cause a lot of comedic moments. However, they don't get a whole lot of character development throughout the anime. Anzu, another girl with supernatural powers and Hitomi, one of Hina's classmates do get much character development, causing their interactions with other characters to change as well. Seeing their character and interactions change is one of the highlights of this anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a very enjoyable anime for me, having a lot of comedy, a pretty good story and great character interactions and development. It was very easy to go through the episodes, leaving me to wait a few weeks in order to watch them one after the other. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (7,83/10)\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a comedy anime with a pretty good story, great character interactions and good character development as well, Hinamatsuri will be an anime for you. I would personally recommend it, because it does some stuff different from the usual comedy anime. The combination of comedy, story and characters makes the anime pretty easy to watch, causing a lot of enjoyment in the meantime. I will give this anime an 8 overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri, a new slice of life made by studio feel, is certainly a breath of fresh air in the spring 2018 season. The story and characters are one of its strong points and it gets to a point where the viewer can feel the same emotions as the characters on screen. I would heartily recommend this anime if you are the type that enjoys fun, easygoing anime with lots of character building. \r\nFirst of all, story and plot. 'Plot' is something that is usually invisible in a slice of life anime and Hinamatsuri is no exception. However, it does not mean it is boring oruninteresting. Each episode brings something new to the table and I for one was engrossed in it till the very end. On the flipside, this show feels very rushed. The backstory is almost nonexistent and some characters are forgotten in the ensuing episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNext, art and sound. The animation feels fluid and the art style is great as expected of an anime produced in 2018. The sound, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre. The soundtrack was not very memorable but the OP and ED songs were pretty decent. The voice actor all captured their roles spectacularly so it's a 7 overall.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the best part of this anime. Each character is likable and has a distinct personality that helps progress the story. Character development is superb and it doesn't waste time in doing it. You can almost feel like the characters are realistic and alive. The emotions are conveyed perfectly by the artists and voice actors and it actually hurts when the best girl Anzu sheds tears and you feel happy when Hina smiles her cute and innocent smile.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe this show deserves all and even more attention than it gets. It would have been better if there were more episodes but the existing 12 certainly did a great job of entertaining me. A final warning DONT watch this anime if you like action shounen or high adrenaline fighting shows.",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri is one of the funniest animes I've seen in years.  Even the premise of the anime was a joke, because it's supposed to be about super powered girls getting involved with the Yakuza, but there are barely any Yakuza activities or superpowers being used outside of the first two episodes.   It's basically just the bunch of them hanging out around bars and going out to eat, with the exception of Anzu.  \r\nRegardless of a lack of superpower use or Yakuza violence, the anime is one of the most entertaining of the season and has one of the most lovable castsin I've seen in a while, especially Hina, Anzu and Hitomi, with Hitomi being my personal favorite.  There are moments of comedy in here that I will never forget, but don't want to spoil it.  You will definitely crack up hard on every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint, and what kept this from being an all-time favorite was a weak final episode in the mountains.  It just kind of fell flat for such a terrific anime.  Also, I feel like they kind of missed an opportunity by not having more action, solely because the fight scene at the very start of the anime shows that if they did have more fighting, the fights would be very well animated.  But, that's not really what this anime is about.   It's more about the trials of parenting and experiencing life.  Especially with Anzu. I really liked the homeless angle they had there with her. It made you root for her very similarly to Honda Tooru from Fruit Baskets.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a surprisingly good anime.  And I only have one thing to say: \"Not cool.\".  I will remember that for a long time.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "- Finally my review of Hinamatsuri, starting with the story that is simply one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen, the story is completely in the sense, though the story also discusses various elements of Slice of Life in addition to showing several interesting situations always with some message to pass; I will admit that I liked the first part of the anime, not that the second part is bad, but in the first 6 episodes there are better moments directed, but overall Hinamatsuri has a good story.\r\n- On the other hand, Studio Feel. did a spectacular job in Hinamatsuri, the scenesare colorful and detailed, plus a great animation and best of all is that the technical part keeps good from beginning to end of the anime, of course have a little problem here and there, but in General Hinamatsuri gives a show in question of technical part, taking into account that it is a comedy anime and slice of life; now the soundtrack is good but could have been a little better; already the direction, undoubtedly one of the strongest strengths of Hinamatsuri, the direction is simply excellent, can perfectly create great scenes, be they comedy scenes or more emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\n- Now about the characters, this is another point that Hinamatsuri stands out, the cast is extremely charismatic, a more funny (and bizarre) character than the other, all with their own personalities and a good development; Anyway, all I can say about the characters is that they are simply excellent and very funny.\\n\\n\r\n- Conclusion, Hinamatsuri is undoubtedly the best comedy anime of the spring season 2018; the anime has a dazzling technical part, plus a bizarre but interesting story, and of course a great cast of characters; Hinamatsuri is one of my favorite anime's of the spring season 2018, but it's also one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen so far, no doubt I recommend Hinamatsuri, a simply spectacular anime !! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9b !!\\n\\n\r\n- My favorite song by Hinamatsuri \ud83d\udc99 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSz-qPHxB88\\n\\n\r\n- My page about animes on facebook \ud83d\udc9b : https://www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9b !!",

Seeing that Hinamatsuri just ended their season, I got back to my laptop in my room at my parent's home almost immediately and had a whole day just to marathon them. And you know what? The hardest part of watching this anime is trying as hard as I can to not be scolded by my parents as I was laughing so loud while watching this anime. This anime is very funny yet it is very touching at its own and this anime is called Hinamatsuri.\r\nHinamatsuri is a story about agirl that assumed as thirteen years old who suddenly appears in a Yakuza gang member's house and the Yakuza decided to take care of her as she threatened him by destroying his precious vase collection. From there only, I have known that this anime would be so much hilarious as they started to reference the Terminator franchise and did not bother to add that \"DU-DUN-DUN-DU-DUN\" thing from that 1984 movie. Such huge kudos for the writer who had delivered the punchline right onto the guts. If something was going so well in Hinamatsuri, there must be a huge punchline creeping behind them and it was waiting for the right time to show up.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I would like to give so much kudos for Hinamatsuri's writer as they perfectly handled the character development. While still being infinitely hilarious, this anime did not shy away from developing each of the characters and having them into a touching character progression. For example is how Anzu grows as a character. She started from a rowdy petty criminal to an independent homeless and ended to be a daughter of a couple who runs a local Chinese restaurant. All of her doings were based on one thing : learns to survive in the harsh world. The character development were anchored to one major theme for each character and Hinamatsuri did the execution perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is maybe the only anime that had made me laugh while crying at the same time. Hands down, I declare that Hinamatsuri is one of the best anime of 2018 Spring season. I would like to see the story of Hinamatsuri continues to the second season.",

It will give you good laughs, the feels, hilarously cringy moments (in a good way) and really cute heart-warming moments. It's just amazing.\r\nI recommend everyone to watch this even if you aren't a huge fan of comedy-focused animes like me. I tend to like 'dark' psychological-ish animes more and usually avoid animes that are focused on comedy. However Hinamatsuri was worth every secondI watched this. \\n\\n",

This show beautifully captures something very elusive about the relationship between fathers and their daughters.\r\nAs the series progresses the supporting cast becomes more important and their individual character arcs are very well developed.

We've got a mob boss sorta post-urchin type fellow that has a sphere with a face on it turn up in his house.turns out that sphere contains a middle school girl that coaxes him into taking care of her through fear of death, since she is also gifted with telekinetic powers. The story isn't important it just provides a setting for the idea that middleschool girls from another world end up in this city and have to deal with living normal lives but does a good enough job of giving us something we have to take into account when figuring out 'whats gonna happen next'. Seems like this is the sorta thing that's popular recently. I blame One Punch Man but it's probly the logical extension of the Shounen enthusiasts leaking into the slice of life comedy sphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt; Non-immersion-breaking/10. Exactly the same as everything else.  It's not Violet Evergarden, its not Nichijou and its not episode 25 of NGE.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; Neat/10. Consistent and understandable characters exist in this show, its more the situations and the reliable tactics to which characters interact with them that really hits the mark in the comedy genre. \\n\\n\r\nComedy; Guffaw/10.  New and interesting stuff. Hitomi is a riot. Anzu is her own miracle too, an excellent use of an existing character trope.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall; Another title to pad your 'hours watched'/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm just now starting MAL scoring even though I've only been watching anime a few years. Hinamatusri was one of the early animes I watched and has held the position of#1 anime on my personal list.\r\nWhat do I like about it. The comedy is never a throw-away one liner. If something is said or done in one episode, it can pop up again in later episodes, be it humorous or heart warming. We see which vase is Nitta's special vase nearly every episode after he receives it, if nothing else, as an important part of the background art.\r\nA Yuppie Yakuza (best way I can describeNitta) has a super-powered ESPer girl fall on his head while celebrating an auction win of a very expensive vase. The girl, of course, is the main character and linchpin of the series and story, Hina. While the first few episodes their relationship is a bit of a roller coaster ride, they finally settle into a father/daughter style relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is more than just a bunch of laughs: it mixes pathos well with the humor, and there will be times that you have to grab your Kleenex because the scene is heartwarming or heart-wrenching. At one point, two side characters will pretty much tell you to do so. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the humor and pathos are always laid in earlier episodes. Regardless, everythiing points in one direction: the ESPer girls you meet all show a lot of personal growth. HIna starts out as being totally self-centered, demanding clothes because, when she emerges from her transport shell, she's naked. (must be a design flaw. as it happens with all of the ESPers in the show, and even one non-ESPer) Being a self-centered kid, that expects grown ups to provide for her is interesting, because we learn in the first episode, that the grown-ups that \"raised\" her in the lab were greedy and she was created to only follow orders. This is how she forges her bond with Nitta, the Yakuza.\\n\\n\r\nWhile occasionally, she uses her powers to threaten him, it turns out that they are helpful. The anime ended too soon, though, but then manga, now in volume 16, follows Hina and friends into high school. The personal growth level is amazing, although she does keep a bit of her selfishness, too. \\n\\n\r\nOne supporting character, Anzu, is an ESPer sent to eliminate Hina. Like Hina, she's also part of the experiment, but not as powerful. A successful failure is the best way she could be described. She \"battles\" Hina (episode 2: the best animation I've ever seen is this battle) She's stranded here because Nitta accidentally ran her transport ball through the washer. She now takes on the life of a homeless person. She starts by stealing her meals and eventually ends up in a hobo camp with homeless men who teach her how to survive without committing crimes. Her growth through this arc is amazing, and one where you'll need a hankie. \\n\\n\r\nThe last ESPer girl is summoned to bring another transport ball to send Hina back \"home\". Instead of arriving in Tokyo, though, she spends \u00bd a year on a desert island. We only see glimpses of her life after she leaves the island using her powers, ending up in China. She is the first of the ESPers to produce any super human powers, but is the weakest of the three. Even the lab pretty much wrote her off as being worthless. With that in mind, you're given a glimpse of what she becomes at the beginning of the series and again, at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is excellent to watch with family members and loved ones. Violence? When you have a Yakuza as a main character, it's expected, but you'll laugh your ass off at such encounters. (as mentioned, although not Yakuza related, the battle between Hina and Anzu. Even hardened Yakuza, Nitta, Can't keep from laughing) \\n\\n\r\nFeel Studios did a fantastic job on this series, and I hope that, should they do a second season, they do just as good.  These are just some of the reasons why this anime is at the top spot on my list",

I was drawn to this show because I heard that it was one of the funnier shows that aired during that season but it feels more like a drama with strong comedic elements.

            "content": "Sometimes you watch an anime because the premise speaks to you, it just sounds like something you have to watch, something that matches your tastes or interests in some new way. Sometimes you watch an anime because you see an ad or a commercial for it, and maybe there's a cool character design or a funny line, and that's all it takes. Sometimes you watch an anime because someone who's opinion you respect singles it out as a great thing that is absolutely worth your time and attention.\r\nI watched \"Hinamatsuri\" because of the latter, namely the good word of Scott, Ben, and Kirran from AnimeFMK.A series about young girls and psychic powers and yakuza is not something I would normally watch of my own browsing around, and the fun I got out of this show is testament to why keeping an ear out for recommendations is such a boon to your life.\\n\\n\r\nActually talking substantively about \"Hinamatsuri\" is a bit of a challenge for me, because it's just a solid series and those are sometimes the hardest to describe, but I'll do my best to elucidate my opinion. This is a series that works entirely in execution: the characters, the animation, the comedy, none of it is exactly ground breaking on paper. The series never even really delves much into the most unique thing about it, namely the psychic kids from a secret organization. Instead, the anime uses the budget it has as well as possible, making what only needs to be passable look good and what needs to look good look really good.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned in my review of \"Toradora!\" that comedy is a hard thing to translate, culturally, because Western society and Eastern society have very different comedy traditions, and that's even more true when specifically talking about the Japanese. This anime has timing that much better fits American sensibilities, with fast jokes that draw on absurd facial expressions and dialogue. Humor is subjective, of course, but as far as my taste goes this is one of the few anime that can regularly make me laugh my ass off even when I'm by myself.\\n\\n\r\nBut the comedy isn't just \"Haha, let's move on.\" The characters, even down to some who only appear for an episode or two, have such well-defined personalities, ones that really help drive the comedy, that the jokes make you invest more and more into their characters as time goes on. Then, when the show starts really pulling at your heart string by putting these characters through genuine drama, it actually works and doesn't hurt the tone like it can in other comedies that try to pull towards more serious emotions. If you're the kind of person who loves a good comedy, especially ones that can hit you in the feels while they're at it, then I really recommend this show, with the caveat that it has a non-ending, with the possible hope of a season two.",

            "content": "I've always despised reviews which compare manga with their anime adaptations. But after watching hinamatsuri, I've come to know the pain of the reviewers who wrote them, for the first time!!!\r\nIf you laughed at jokes of \"school rumble\" then hinamatsuri will make you laugh 10 times more.\r\nIf \"Disastrous life of Saiki kusuo\" made you laugh once in 5 minutes then hinamatsuri will make you laugh twice in that duration.\r\nIf \"Detroit metal city\" killed you with laughter by using sex jokes, beware for hinamatsuri will make you laugh in the same way but without anything sexual at all. Hinamatsuri is one the most comedic gag storieswritten.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all these praises, you must be wondering, so what the hell with the given rating????\\n\\n\r\nWell, all those things you would experience only while reading the manga. But the stories used in anime is also the same, so why isn't this anime good?????\\n\\n\r\nTwo important things a gag anime should have and this doesn't have is:\\n\\n\r\n\"Timing and execution\"\\n\\n\r\nWithout those two the whole purpose of a gag anime is ruined. While watching the anime, the execution was so slow that you wouldn't even notice if that was a joke. Many times I had to think back a few seconds and make a discovery- oh this was a joke and it seems I have to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important mistake done here was that this anime was made as if to give you smile at the end of the day, like a person goes through lots of trouble in the episode and he/she gets a happy ending by the end of the episode....which is really wrong in the case of hinamatsuri!!!!\\n\r\nBecause this isn't a slice of life like \"Usagi drop\" where a single father adopts a cute orphan girl.\\n\\n\r\nThis is rather a story of a dumb supernatural girl who forces a person to take care of her. It contains so many eccentric characters, with their weird habits that make you die with laughter.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I dropped this anime since the jokes were boring and it seemed that the 23 minutes of content wasn't worth to just give a small smile like \"Aria the animation\".\\n\r\nBut when I read the manga, I've realized how much of potential was wasted just due to missing of proper \"timings and execution\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really weird, it's just not the common facial features you see in other anime and it is more prominent in anime due to colors, hence it takes nearly 2-3 episodes to get adjusted.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the music is good. The opening is good to hear. But I don't think you need to watch this anime for those when you can't even enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying this anime is trash, but it's just that, why to watch 23 minutes x 12 episodes of pointless things just for a few smiles. Yeah tbh, it's a pointless story with no morals, but it was written only for laughing at your heart's content. So instead of missing out the masterpiece, go read the manga and let all your sadness be taken away from you.",

This shows biggest strength is how it subverts expectations of either the audience or it's characters. Hearing that Nitta is part of the Yakuza, you probably think that he's some sort of bad-ass, but in actuality he's a down to earth guy that only sometimes flaunts bad parenting decisions. These subversions might be simple and even predictable, however the style in which these characters react to these situations is hilarious and are also welldirected. There's this absurd side plot with Hina's classmate Hitomi, gets strong armed to work as a bartender. This is a running gag through out the whole show that just kept getting more and more absurd to the point where Hitomi finds herself in her own high end apartment working multiple jobs for big companies. All in while still attending middle school. This anime is good at making you laugh, but unfortunately when it tries to make you feel anything else it does't do as well. Nitta and Hina occasionally have there sweet moments, but it's inconsistent. Another girl with telekinesis, Anzu tries living life homeless with a bunch of Californians. This adventure leads into Anzu having some drastic character growth, which was cool to see, but was also a lot of the time kind of boring. Hinamasturi might not do anything to interesting with its premise, it's still a show that has a lovable cast of characters with intertwining stories that'll make you laugh. Check it out.",

It somehow manages to fit great characters, an interesting plot, perfectly timed comedy and lessons to take with you within each episode into a tightly made package; it is the kind of Anime you wouldn't want to really end within 12 episodes.\r\nThe story is very interesting and greatly put together. Each episode has a structure of two different stories relating to a few different central characters. One of these stories are usually antics the characters get up to in their spare time and the other half serves as a kind of message to societyand people in general in the form of a heartfelt narrative. This is pulled off exceptionally well as both halves work together flawlessly at times however there are some moments which aren't as interesting as you'd expect them to be which, for me, is the final episode which didn't keep my attention for the second half very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style along with animation is fantastic. It has the general look of a modern Anime with clean lines and great use of shading so I can't find much criticism in that category.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is also extremely well put together with my personal favourite being 'Sake to Ikura to 893 to Musume' used in the credits. The voice acting is phenomenal and truly serves to keep you immersed in the stories; it doesn't feel or sound like it's a person in a booth so kudos to the voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is where this show stands out the most. Each character from main roles like Nitta to the smaller roles like Yassan are developed and fleshed out incredibly well and evolve through the season extremely well. They seem more like actual people with actual problems in the world rather than fictional characters so they all pack some sort of punch in the general story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hinamasturi is a very well produced piece of work, it served as amazing entertainment for me personally and i would rank it a 10 overall. Not many Anime have had the ability to make me feel how I did with each episode so this one earned a special place in my heart.",

            "content": "A heartwarming and humorous tale about unconventional families.\r\nHinamatsuri, despite the misleading synopsis is not really about Hina's psychic powers, after the 1st episode there is barely any action or even use of powers. Indeed, the anime isn't entirely focused on Hina herself. Overall, it's a beautifully done slice of life that is absurdly heartwarming with plenty of laughter and some tears along the way. The anime's main focus is showing the caring bonds between people who you do not expect to interact normally. \r\nPositives: \r\nWell developed characters, you see the gradual evolution of most of the main cast throughout the series\r\nPlenty of humor throughout, comedyisn't the main goal here, but you definitely get much from the fish out of water situations \\n\r\nYou cannot get through the anime without feeling the warm and fuzzies.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nDifficult to find any, but I want to be clear it is not an action, supernatural, scifi anime. You could take away Hina and Anzu's powers and the series would be 90% the same.\\n\r\nThe comedy is fun, but not always well timed. This isn't the comedy of the year.\\n\\n\r\nSoL rating: 9/10. A calming show focusing on character interactions through their everyday lives, even if it isn't the normal everyday life we expect.\\n\\n\r\nComedy rating: 6/10. Hina and Nitta have a great Boke-Tsukkomi routine going and Hitomi falling from one trouble to the next is always good for a laugh",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Hinamatsuri. This show is a fun watch. The synopsis given and the reviews will lead you to believe it is funnier than it is, perhaps a little more crazy too. However as good as the show is, its rather tame on the comedy, and really boils down into the unlikely parent taking care of the unlikely child shows.\r\nThe story starts off like the synopsis says. Nitta is hit on the head by a strange girl in a casket who has strange powers. She then strong arms him into staying in his apartment and buying her food andand many expensive things. However after the first episode after they get these two characters together they no longer care about this power or the yakuza for that matter. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl is named Hina and she basically becomes Nitta's child from that point on. They live together, and aside from maybe an episode or two have very little interaction.\\n\\n\r\n(Light Spoilers)\\n\r\nA large portion of the show is dedicated to Anzu, a supporting character and she is easily the best written part of this show. Unlike Hina she has no one to take care of her and becomes homeless when she is unable to return where she came from. The show really goes into her struggles and her character and compares her to Hina a few times. It's not particularly funny, but it is great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is great. A catchy soundtrack, nice art, great characters. The only flaw I had with it was false advertisement. The synopsis doesn't really cover what the show is about. Labeling it a comedy also feels like a stretch though I know different people will find different things funny. Its a fun show, a bit light on the main character interaction but has great supporting characters to hold their flimsy story together.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Not really as funny as I hoped, synopsis is a bit of a misdirection. Still great, and worth a watch.",

            "content": "Nitta Yoshifumi is a wealthy Yakuza member. One day, a young blue-haired girl with telekinesis powers called \"Hina\" appears in his apartment out of nowhere in a metallic cocoon. Worried he'd be killed he lets her stay with him. Before long, he learns she must unleash her powers frequently or she will overload and go out-of-control briefly. Nitta ends up becoming her guardian as she tries to fit in and obviously things don't go quite so smoothly when you have a Yakuza gang member trying to live together with a girl with super powers. Meanwhile, Anzu has been ordered to destroy Hina but ends upstuck on Earth and finds out how harsh life can be as she finds shelter amongst the homeless. Life just isn't the same for everyone they cross paths with.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall vibe reminds me of Barakamon another great comedy but without the super powers and alien elements. In fact, the direction and art is so similar I'm surprised I couldn't find any staff that worked on both! Art style with the thick highlight lines reminds me of Poco's Udon World but different studio. Facial expressions alone are hilarious to watch let alone the ridiculous scenarios that come up in the show. Even the eyecatch commerical break images are fun and there's a lot of references to Terminator too.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time you'll probably be in tears laughing but there are also some tear jerking moments too as you see life from both sides of the coin, the wealthy and the poor. Despite being aliens, both Hina and Anzu act just like their childlike appearances - just two innocent kids. Yet, Hina learns how spoiled she is and Anzu learns there are times when you must put aside your pride so there's some great character development. And even though there are supposed to be some not so down to earth elements, very little actually happens that remind you that they are aliens with powers so over all it's like another slice-of-life comedy.",

            "content": "You ever watched something and thought to yourself, \"Only in Anime?\"\u00a0 This.\u00a0 This is that.\u00a0 And it's hilarious.\r\nStory:\r\nYoshifumi Nitta is a member of the Yakuza who is quite the connoisseur for vases.\u00a0 After purchasing a new vase for his collection, a portal from fucking nowhere appears in his house and drops a pod with a face affixed on the side.\u00a0 This close encounter introduces Hina, the (more or less) titular character of the show who's seen to have psychic powers and through means of circumstance, is now under Nitta's care.\u00a0 Much to his dismay.\r\nHinamatsuri is a strange phenomenon.\u00a0 Focused around a myriad of colorful charactersranging from middle schoolers to Yakuza, as well as going so far to dip its toes into martial artists and rock musicians, much of what can be said about Hinamatsuri's story boils down to how well its cast performs and how funny a certain situation can be.\u00a0 Comedy is the name of the game here, and this show splits many of its episodes in A and B parts each with its own self-contained story that feature situations that spiral out of control in more ways than one.\u00a0 Wanting to keep a secret can lead to having enough company connections to make sure you have a job throughout your entire professional life, wanting to do something nice for your guardians can end up with you betting on horse races, and plotting to make it obvious that someone is still the devil can lead you to owning a dog.\u00a0 You know, normal situations.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the series's incredibly outlandish stories and comedic situations, Hinamatsuri becomes more about entertainment and unpredictability, which it succeeds in many aspects.\u00a0 Even more unpredictable however is the fact that the show strays away from its usual wacky and comedic self to create some heartfelt moments that caught me off-guard primarily because they were well executed and were generally better than many shows who try to pull off the same thing.\u00a0 As such, the show nails its pacing and comedic timing to a scary degree, which is actually a welcome thing, though sometimes I feel a joke is pushed TOO far, the reason of which I'll get to a little later.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Hinamatsuri is a solid show that combines both the genuine and the funny, an odd mix that actually works to its favor cause it makes a number of its characters very likable and actually worth investing into the more they were in the spotlight.\u00a0 Unless you're Hina.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Very solid comedic timing\\n\r\n+ Some genuinely heartwarming moments\\n\r\n+ Very unpredictable, which is good in a comedy series\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe titular character, Hina...is the worst character in this series.\u00a0 For the majority of the show, Hina is an emotionless, lazy character who doesn't really do things unless it benefits her.\u00a0 It's not really selfishness, it's more of the fact that she demands things and expects them much to her caretaker's dismay.\u00a0 This schtick doesn't really change\u00a0 throughout the entire series, and I honestly think Feel knew this, because funnily enough, the further you get into the series, the less Hina you see.\u00a0 (Which I see as a plus.)\u00a0 A character without any obvious positive traits irks me, and Hina is the ultimate example of that in this series.\u00a0 I feel like any section solely focused on her has to be warped around her terrible personality in order to work, and that leads for things to go too far and not really that funny as a result.\\n\\n\r\nBy comparison, her guardian, Nitta, is a much better character by comparison, which is ironic because he's a Yakuza member and his coworkers over the course of the series have done some shady things (as typical of mafia portrayals).\u00a0 Though it's clear from the getgo that he's a guy who loves vases, wants to get with the hot bartender, and loving his bachelor life to the extent of wanting to do anything to get it back (which is understandable, actually), much of Nitta's personality and presence harkens back to Hina and how much he cares for her, acting like her guardian and taking up all of the responsibilities a parent has for their child.\u00a0 It's this weird dynamic that makes him a really likable character and in many instances, justifies his anger towards his 'daughter' who does nothing but cause him trouble, which becomes exponential when the child you're caring for has psychic powers.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the prominence of the main two characters, I feel like the side cast contributes a lot more to the overall quality of the show.\u00a0 Characters like Hitomi and Anzu get entire sections of the cast and episodes tied to them, and both of them feel like so much better characters by comparison to what we get with Hina.\u00a0 There's development and growth with their characters, which is one of those qualities I never expected in a show that's primarily comedy-based.\u00a0 That being said, there is one character that I feel personally cheated on, and that's Mao.\u00a0 Mao doesn't really exist.\u00a0 She's sort of a gag to the show as she shows up a grand total of 3 times, each of her appearances painting a rather strange picture that the show just gives to the audience without any explanation whatsoever.\u00a0 I wish we got more of her since she is prominent in the opening and one of the four featured girls in the show, but I admit what they did with her was pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Amazing side cast\\n\r\n+ A lot of positive character growth\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Hina as a character kinda sucks\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by feel, the art in Hinamatsuri has a very distinct style to it where the hair specifically utilizes a lot of white lines, and the overall color scheme is muted, but is very much on the white scale.\u00a0 Not only that, but the standard designs for the character, the girls in particular, have a very round face which is very uncommon in shows that don't try to give an obvious 'cute' design to its younger female characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis unique style is further shown during the show's comedic showings, where rather than use the typical exaggerated expressions or an overuse of addons on the screen to convey an emotion, the show uses a lot of dark lines and darkens the entire screen to comedically portray the severity of the situation as if it's the end of the world, or it's a grave mistake, which is not only interesting as this sort of portrayal is usually coupled with the previously mentioned 'exaggerated expressions', but gives the show a standout identity in the comedy space.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Very unique artstyle\\n\r\n+ Uses usually unconventional comedic techniques well\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth the OP and ED tracks for Hinamatsuri are...interesting, to say the least.\u00a0 Rie Murakawa's \"Distance\" is an uplifting song that I feel doesn't really stack up to the show that it's attached to, as while it's good, doesn't really prepare you for what exactly you're going to be going into.\u00a0 It really doesn't.\u00a0 By contrast though, we have a slow rock piece in Yoshiki Nakajima's \"Sake to Ikura to 893 to Musume\", which is kind of a sobering piece to let you take in and process the madness one can witness when watching this show.\u00a0 It's a nice piece that I feel is much better than its OP counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch a show that has Yakuza, psychic children, a middle school bartender, sage advice from homeless people, and a girl who goes from Castaway to martial arts master in the span of 3 years, you tell me what I'm supposed to say.\u00a0 (Well I suppose I could write a ~1400 word review about it, but that's not my point.)\\n\\n\r\nThe simplest way to describe my experience with Hinamatsuri is \"I enjoyed it.\"\u00a0 And that's about it really.\u00a0 It's such a weird show combining just a mishmash of whatever the hell it wants to add that works.\u00a0 It just.\u00a0 Works.\u00a0 It has heartfelt moments that are pulled off better than many drama shows I've seen, it's got better comedic timing than a show purely about comedy, and it's pretty much the definition of \"Anime\" when anyone utters the phrase \"Anime is weird\".\u00a0 The only shame I could make note of here is the fact that Hina is not a great character, but that's counteracted by the fact that she gradually has less and less appearances as time goes on, so she becomes a lot more bearable in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nAs for recommendations, this is one show I would highly recommend simply for the fact that the show is in this strange middle ground of ideas that on paper seem ridiculous, but in reality, becomes a successful dark horse that gets some attention, but not enough to warrant it to become a show under everyone's radar.\u00a0 It's also pretty funny, so if you're looking for a comedy, this works too.",

            "content": "\u201cWATASHI NO SMARTPHONE GAAAAAA!!\u201d\r\nI\u2019ve never been a big fan of Western sitcoms with their occasional punch lines and automated laugh tracks. It only took Hinamatsuri a few seconds for me to start giggling hysterically in a manner that belies my 17 year old, pubescent self. It was at this precise moment where I decided that Hinamatsuri would be something rather special and refreshing, a show that could genuinely impress me with its ridiculousness. \r\nI was not disappointed. Hinamatsuri delivers its humour in spades. The absurdism of this series was both amusing and perhaps ironically, surprisingly realistic. Of course, the realism stems from the bizarre contextof the show; the dynamic relationship between an airhead girl with psychokinetic powers and an affluent Yakuza thug gives the series room to circumvent conventional perceptions of daily family life. Queue hardworking, hobo girl and middle school bartender girl and you have yourself the foundation of comical greatness.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly makes Hinamatsuri\u2019s humour so impressive and universal? The show fully exploits the unique interactions between characters that possess ideals and characteristics polar opposite from one another. But not in a way like Fate/Zero, for instance, where contrasting ideals give way to tragedy and nihilism. Instead, the show often sets up circumstances and events that deflect the viewer\u2019s attention from the comedic nature of the show. Genuine character development and dilemmas through various interactions - all done in a surprisingly organic way \u2013 before we are hit by something preposterous just when we least expect it. Sometimes, humour of this nature can feel jarring and inappropriate but somehow, Hinamatsuri absolutely nails it either by forcing out the belly laughs or by bringing in the feels with impressive subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, what probably impressed me the most about Hinamatsuri was its ability and proficiency in oscillating between comedy and matters of real seriousness. This is most aptly demonstrated in Anzu\u2019s homelessness arc. The title \u201cHobo life 101\u201d sounds like an attempt to compliment the show with another source of humour and Hinamatsuri does capitalize on Anzu\u2019s gullibility and almost tragic misperception of the value of money. However, this arc sheds light on homelessness with a level of sympathy and depth rarely seen in any media, let alone a screwball comedy anime. The show poignantly reminds us that not all homeless people are lazy vagabonds with selfish intent. Sometimes, particularly in nations like Japan, the homeless are simply old, single men - cast away by society, perhaps as a result of the recession of the nineties or other societal preconceptions. These people can still be hardworking, caring and compassionate; sometimes displaying a level of humanity lacking in the rest of the world. While Hinamatsuri\u2019s portrayal of the homeless is certainly somewhat romanticized, the message retains its potency. It reminds us to be thankful for our circumstances, and to demonstrate empathy for those less fortunate than us.\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri treats other stereotypes with the same level of attention. Through Nitta and his interactions with both Hina and the Yakuza, we can see that the Yakuza and its members are more than cruel, bloodthirsty criminals. They can be tender, considerate and tragic personas \u2013 attaching themselves to the infamous Yakuza not because they want to, but because they have to. Hitomi, on the other hand, epitomizes the terrible overwork conundrum that has plagued Japan over the past decades. Hina\u2019s characterization hints at the failings of a society which accepts laziness in its youth\u2026 It\u2019s heartening to see this comedy use its core characters not only as sources of humour, but as thematic pillars to propagate its messages.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are excellent. Nitta, Hina, Anzu and Hitomi are all well characterized and well developed through the course of the anime. This isn\u2019t a comedy which uses its characters once in a skit before refreshing. The characters grow from each experience and develop into real, relatable, three dimensional beings. Even the side characters get their fair share of love and attention \u2013 the consequences of their actions are everlasting and add to the legato between plot segments.\\n\\n\r\nI had no real problems with Hinamatsuri\u2019s art and animation style. I\u2019m hardly an art critic but I really liked the extreme close ups and detailed facial expressions with pencil shadings whenever something ridiculous happens. Some of the art was striking and demonstrated a careful attention to detail from the staff at studio Feel. Animation quality felt consistent throughout and only ever complimented moments of comedic value. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both great and are sung by the VA\u2019s of Anzu and Nitta respectively, which was a nice touch. The OST didn\u2019t seem particularly notable but the voice acting was excellent for a show with some pretty demanding VA moments. Moments like Hina stating nonchalantly \u201cI want to go to a girly club\u201d or pissed off Nitta sounding pissed off elevates the comedy to the uncontrollable laughing level. \\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri is a comedy with heart. It\u2019s one of those rare shows that can do many things well at the same time, leaving you with a package that makes you crave for more by the time the show ends. I\u2019m willing to sell my soul to the devil for a second season \u2013 manga readers tell me that it only gets funnier.\\n",

From there its downhill all the way till the end.\r\nThe enjoyment curve ramped up from the first episodes, some of the scenes in the 5,6,7th episodes are just mid-boggling in comedic value, like the student council election arc, Hitomi's friends + Matsutani arc.\r\nBut then the ending of 8th episode made no sense, why would he even have a party there, it did not go well with his character or what the series was leading upto till then. After that, the remaining episodes were useless and felt fake to to all the characterisation builtbefore that.\\n\r\nThe reporter episode was stupid and just random. Then the Anzu + Nitta episode was weird. The school trip and the reveal was absolutely mediocre and needless. The worst was that Hitomi episode, the pacing was completely rushed and disjointed and weirder than the other arcs like the horse race segment. I have not read the manga, Maybe the manga was better paced and had more content related to the end episodes, so maybe for those who read manga, this anime was better, maybe that is why it is having such high rating. Otherwise, I have no idea why is this rated(avg. rating) so high.\\n\r\nThis also was very similar to Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon.",

            "content": "Why should you watch Hinamatsuri?\r\nStory is Great (9). Hinamatsuri is one of the anime that I did not pay attention during the initial spring lineup yet placed it on my to-watch queue, but to my surprise it took the No.1 spot in my Best Spring Anime List of 2018 together with Mahou Shoujo Site. The reason why it is one of the best, boils down to its honesty and child-like innocence. Hinamatsuri in Japan is a kind of festival/celebration for the coming of age of girls, and this is hugely represented in the Anime with its young girl characters having their own quirky coming ofage stories. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it stand out from other slice of life anime is that it develops the characters in a natural way that you can almost see them appearing in real life. It perfectly mixes comedy with action and drama which is a difficult feat to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThere were moments while watching this anime that I ended up bawling my eyes so hard because of a side story with a supporting character, or segments that cracked me up so hard with the simplicity of its jokes. It amazes me that the story allows it's main characters to be out-shined by its supporting characters, but still keeps the story intact. Simply brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nArt is Good (7). Graphic wise, Hinamatsuri does not stun me with its animation approach. It is a standard looking anime when you first watch it which made it hard to pick out with similarly animated anime it was group with. However, the art is well made and clean that it does not distract me from enjoying each and every episode it releases so that is a great thing. \\n\\n\r\nSound is Great (9). The opening theme \"Distance\" by Rie Murakawa is definitely one of the best theme songs that I have heard in an anime. It sets the mood quite nice which is a great thing, and I never found myself skipping it unlike other opening themes. \\n\\n\r\n\"Sake to Ikura to 893 to Musume (\u9bad\u3068\u30a4\u30af\u30e9\u3068893\u3068\u5a18)\" by Yoshifumi Nitta (Yoshiki Nakajima) the ending song is the one song that makes me feel the yakuza vibe of the story. Although I felt that it doesn't mesh well with the whole anime package, it is still a good listen.\\n\\n\r\n\"Shashinchou (\u5199\u771f\u5e16)\" by Yoko Ishida, the ending song of Episode 6 was the trigger to me crying my heart out. The story Anzu, one of the supporting characters, is something unexpected in a story that sells itself as a comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Outstanding (10). I strongly believe that Hinamatsuri's characters are the strongest part of this anime. They are well written, beautifully characterized, fleshed out, and knows their roles in the story. From the bar tender Hitomi, the garbage collector Anzu to the main character Hina, even the lately introduced Mao, all of them stands out in their own charming way.\\n\\n\r\nEven the minor roles in the story like Hina's classmates or the families of Nitta and Anzu are incredibly well written. You could feel the amount of care they put in the characters of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt, that the characters are the best part of Hinamatsuri.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, even if you are not into the slice of life/comedy genre of anime, you should give Hinamatsuri a shot. I am 100% sure that you would not regret watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I would give Hinamatsuri 9 exquisite vases out of 10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri\r\n\"Change can only happen in small fractures\"\r\nThat quote is a universal guideline for anything in life, especially if you're dark blue haired indifferent 12 year old girl new to a metropolis experience...\r\nHere we have Hina, an explicitly mono toned little girl that enters Japan (well, more like forced) so that she is essentially \"someone elses problem\" The people who sent Hina to Japan were in basic terms sick of her shit, I guess mass destruction and abuse of telekinesis really doesn't sit well with people. Being randomly transported into a Yakuza members home that goes by the name of Nitta-san who is probably the nicestYakuza affliate ever. Little does he know when that red ball is taken out of Hina's pod there is no turning back and his life is changed forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Hina and Nitta had become nothing short of beautiful and infectious, infectious because with Hina's food driven and lazy attitude entwined with Nitta's careful and orderly quality of life makes this anime all the more enjoyable. She being a foreigner with no morals or decency what so ever with no other intention but to get what she wants whenever she wants, her demanding phase in this anime makes you want to know \"whats this girls problem\" I found myself asking that question in the starting episodes, Nittas struggle felt like my struggle because I had to empathise how I would deal with a barbaric youngin such as herself. With all the threats, the breaking of his stuff when he would refuse and the abuse of his credit card. You can't help but feel sorry for Nitta.\\n\\n\r\nAs time flows and more vases break Nitta gets used to Hina, he even tries to make agreements with her like asking her to not use her powers, Hina at that point is shocked because that was the moment she realised that Nitta is not like the other adults in her life, the ones that tried to use her. Nitta in an attempt to suppress the young and naive Hina brings their relationship to a whole new level. Quickly in the series it is known that if Hina does not utilize her powers that she has a mental breakdown consisting of being encased in blue lightning while her and everything around her starts shaking and levitating. As you could probably tell yes this chick has issues. \\n\\n\r\nNow with all this being done Hina at this point looks more human than ever, she is going to school (even though she hates it), she is making friends (even though she mistreats them unintentionally) and is she being normal for the most part. Hina starts to appreciate being Nitta a bit more than before and the development of how they have this father and son relationship makes you want more (probably not as much as me lol). In comes Anzu, someone from Hinas old world looking for Hina to dispose of her because getting rid of her wasn't enough lol. Anzu ends up losing to Hina in a game and afterwards Hina offers Anzu to hand out with her. This scene is precious because they're hanging out and stuff and it just shows how far Hina has come.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the show the comedic value stays afloat and never disappears. Anzu goes through the same transformation like Hina but Anzu was humbled by hitomi and homeless people she learns how to salvage and what its like to have nothing but still maintain what she has which is why she is my favourite character. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Meshii...(feed me) -_-\r\nStory: Hinamatsuri does not offer a plot but more introduces and hints the setting of girls with psychokinetic powers who transfer to Earth coming from some other dimension, planet, secret base...us anime-only viewers don't really know or find out.  The comedic aspects are timed very well (which gives an atmosphere similar to Gintama) and the comedy comes from the character interactions and reactions which makes the cast more genuine when you watch them.  There are a few over the top moments that will also having you laughing until you hurt.  The biggest strength in Hinamatsuri is combining and brillliantly transitioningboth hilarious, over-the-top comedy and sentimental moments about life, family, and one's future goals and dreams.  At one point in the episode, you are either laughing your guts out or feeling a character's struggle.  Whether it is displayed comically or seriously, the messages and social commentary are very real and relatable.  Whether that connects or not is up to the viewer because comedy is subjective and I myself am not normally the biggest fan of anime comedies.  So this one gets a pass for me.\\n\r\nMy main gripe is that the source material obviously holds more fulfilling details about the backgrounds of the characters and the final episode was not a satisfying finale.  It just ends.  It does not build up a 2nd season or anything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: When there is no story or plot in a series, it is up to the characters to hold the show as it goes along.  And they all do it well.  Hitomi is the blend of comedy and feels for she has the most epic faces when things don't go her way but her situations slightly imply how damaging her life is on anybody that experiences what she does.  It is not necessarily downplayed but it presents 2 different perspectives that one side could take her situation as hilarious that it is not happening to them or the other side can feel her pain for knowing what it is like to go through what she does (albeit very unrealistic...but it's a comedy so take it how you will).  Hina is mainly on screen for comedy purposes and most of her antics are funny and cute.  But she still gets a good amount of character development from being a selfish brat to (slightly) a citizen that can somewhat adapt to normal human life.  Just slightly.  Anzu is my personal favorite character for her dilemma was the realest and her growth in accepting all of the little things in life and not using her powers to benefit herself while hurting someone else makes her a very dynamic character.  The side characters also do a great job of assisting the main cast in bringing out their characters and truest feelings when the situations called for it so the cast succeeded in major proportions.\\n\r\nDespite my praises that the characters carried this comedy so well, Hina is in fact the least interesting of the 3 which does irk me a little considering she is the most important character and her name is in the title.  And do not get me started with Utako.  Not a bad character...she's just a really horrible person.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation, Sound: The art was bright and colorful which makes the viewers feel warm and the animation is very fluid especially during the small amount of action sequences.  The soundtrack was pretty fitting and the opening song was good enough for me to watch it without skipping every time I tuned in for the weekly episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode might not be the most gripping for some fans that can get impatient with trying something new but the comedy is where it strives for so that is the key to finding out if you will like this.  But the sentimental moments are what makes this series more special than when looked only on the surface.",

            "content": "WARNING, MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this before.  A loli with supernatural powers falls out of the sky and lands through the roof of the home of a member of the Yakuza, after which that Yakuza agent decides to take her in and become her father.  Shenanigans ensues.  Yeah, one positive trait that this series has going for it right off the bat is originality.  But just because something\u2019s original, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s good.  And is this one?  Yes, yes it is.  Hinamatsuri is a comedy series from Spring 2018 of Anime with asense of humor built around absurd situations and overly serious deadpan reactions.  It\u2019s not quite as funny as Dragon Pilot also of this season or even Konosuba, but it does come pretty damn close at times, and now I wanna talk about it.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s two main aspects of Hinamatsuri you need to pay attention to, the comedy, and the heartwarming character building moments, not unlike those two aforementioned anime.  The comedy portion is seriously top notch.  There\u2019s Hina herself, whose very existence is comedy.  There\u2019s the different, varying ways in which Nitta reacts to her mistakes.  Then there\u2019s the character Anzu, another superhuman with telekinetic powers like Hina, presumably from the same world that Hina is from.  One of the most enjoyable parts of the show is watching the friendship/rivalry that they have evolve.  While in episode 4 it does seem like Anzu has completely rejected Hina due to her being incredibly lazy and just a pain to deal with, I highly doubt that this will last.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s HItomi Mishima, a middle school student and classmate of Hina, who ends up being blackmailed to be a bartender even though she\u2019s just in middle school because she\u2019s so good at it, oddly enough.  However, the crux of the show is the relationship between Nitta and Hina, which is both hilarious and heartwarming at the same time.  At the time of this writing only 4 episodes have been released, but it seems like his arc in the show is slowly trying to become a better father.  Very slowly.  I mean, in episode 2 he ditches Hina to go get laid, and in episode 4 he literally disowns Hina for the duration of the episode after she breaks a bunch of priceless dishes by accident, so yeah, it\u2019s a work in progress.  Despite these two incidents it\u2019s important to point out that he isn\u2019t an unlikable character.  \\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s just not used to this kind of responsibility and has flaws just like all of us, which he\u2019s sure to develop out of eventually.  Aside form all of that, there\u2019s other plot details that I would like to have revealed, such as are there other girls like Hina and Anzu who have telekenetic powers, and what world are they from.  He\u2019ll, it\u2019d be really cool if Nitta got to visit that world at some point, although I highly doubt that will happen unless we get a season 2, possibly.  This is only the third show I\u2019ve watched so far from the spring, but I keep being impressed.  Hinamatsuri is truly a fantastic show so far, and I highly recommend it if you haven\u2019t seen it yet.",

Girls actually seem like girls and not made to cater to the audience. You won't really hate anyone and only get slightly annoyed by some moments, but just to the extent of rolling your eyes fondly. Nice character development, will actually get attached to some of them and root for many.\r\nGood point: Story is slice oflife so that's that.

            "content": "It's been a long time since a comedy, slice of life anime got such a high rating, and so I picked it up instantly. I entered because of the high rating and stayed because of pure joy.\r\nPros:\r\nI don't think I can exaggerate much, to be honest. I'm actually surprised at myself giving this show a 9, which is so rare for me. But just seeing the love that went into making this, I feel (relatively) satisfied with the rating.\r\nHinamatsuri starts off with the strangest beginning, and the strangeness of it all almost dissuaded me, to be honest. But something about the dialogue and directing mademe stay. Maybe it was how the characters never did things too wild; perhaps it was how facial expression carried just as much importance as the actual voice acting (such a treat).\\n\\n\r\nWhatever it was, I stayed, and I learned that the characters in Hinamatsuri kept defying the odds. Just when you felt yourself snap, something happened to reel you back in. Although it has quite a fantasy/sci fi start, the actual show has very little to do with that actual storyline and focuses more on the characters and their rather unorthodox situations (I mean how many shows have you seen about mellow mafia members? *coughpointsforalliterationpleasecough*)\\n\\n\r\nNo jokes are forced, reactions are believable, even the pure stupidity of some situations have that root of groundedness, where you can be like, \"I can't believe that happened, but sure, I suppose it could\". \\n\\n\r\nPacing was fast, no scenes were dragged out for too long, and the story actual flows - yes people, we get actual time passing, characters changing, progressing. They don't stay in their situations forever, as most shows tend to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life aspect hits you hard, from all angles, and the show ends up being that heart-warming, smile inducing show you need to get them feels after a rough afternoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe art needs some special mentioning. As I mentioned earlier, the art shone, especially through the facial expressions of the characters. Whenever 'fights' needed to be shown, it was solid, fluid and superbly done. The color palette was that mellow, almost pastel type which reminded me so much of Honey and clover it made my heart hurt. Truly a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nI honestly don't have many at all. If I'm being very critical, it would be with Hina herself, being based off of a stereotype. But honestly, she's the base of multiple hilarious jokes that simply would not be possible without Hina being Hina. Honestly, all it is is just me simply not liking her personality type in general, rather than this being a flaw of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nNeed some heart-warming, well-paced, laughs/smiles with grounded, fluid and constantly developing characters, all held together with great dialogue and directing?\\n\\n\r\nWatch this.",

            "content": "Hinamatsuri is an unconventional anime, to say the least. We're soon presented to Hina, an overpowered psychic girl with a distinct yet very predictable personality: she enjoys eating and sleeping and struggles to  perceive emotions, besides other social inabilities. Something that I missed about this anime is that we don't know anything about the main character until near the end... I know it's meant to be a \"nonsense comedy\", but this lack of information compromised my connection with the story and its characters. Hina's powers are treated as a mere detail, which makes you wonder wether it wouldn't be a lot better if theyactually didn't exist at all. Besides Hina, Anzu, the other overpowered girl who shares the same unknown past, also goes through the whole story without remembering you she's psychic (with very few unnecessary exceptions). This paranormal obscure background isn't explored at all and yet you don't miss it, witch made me think this anime could be a lot better if they didn't even mention any of these.\\n\r\nWell, the comedy is what this anime does better. The fast-paced scenes and dialogues really have laughing potential. Although much of the anime is unconnected random situations, you end up hooked at it. The characters are fine, they aren't very unique and as charismatic as I wish they were (Hitomi and Nitta were my favorites), specially secondary ones, but since it's basically a comedy show, this doesn't make a big difference. \\n\r\nPersonally, the most boring sessions of \"Hinamatsuri\" were the ones where they tried to make you feel emotional... which were most of Anzu's scenes. Watching her learning to live like a homeless, gaining the sense of community, friendship and family was just tedious. This sections were very superficial, unoriginal and felt poorly written... it's almost like a story you've already watched... this was the main letdown of this anime, specially because these scenes usually came after a sequence of high-level comedy.\\n\r\n\"Hinamatsuri\" had great potential, it has great comedy and it's well written for the most part, but I felt like some stuff could have been avoided and some alterations could have been made in order to make it a \"must recommend\" comedy anime.",

            "content": "\"Hinamatsuri\" was well produced. Especially with a concluding episode that reminds the audience of everything that has happened, \"Hinamatsuri\" was produced with carefully-placed details. The show, however, did not really have a story. It is one of those shows where you can watch a random episode and it will still make sense, so if you were looking for a show that has a plot, this is not for you. However, \"Hinamatsuri\" is extremely wholesome, and every episode comes with its own life lesson. From this show, you can see how much one child can change a few adults' lives, making room for a lot ofcharacter development. I recommend \"Hinamatsuri,\" especially if you are looking for any show to watch while you unwind.",

The characters are all somewhat opposites, so there interactions usually result in amusing dialog. Hina is very deadpan and lazy, Nitta is narcissistic with a soft side, and Anzu goes from hardheaded to incredibly sweet. Just honestly do yourself a favor and watch it!\r\nIf I had to pick one weak point, it's the story. The overall story is a little muddied and it can jump around a lot. I thought that we could use a little more backstory about the girls, and also that last episode of what'sgoing on.",

The only parts i enjoyed were the first minute of the first episode, and the last half of the last episode. All the story lines are pointless, and are unenjoyable to watch. Even for 12 episodes this feels like it drags on too long, and i just wanted it to finish, because i hated it. It was a chore to watch. I would never recommend this to anyone. I wasted so much time watchingthis, and feel really sad. Even if when a second season ever comes out, i will refuse to watch it because it was just really not enjoyable to watch. All hype about it is really overrated, as it is a pathetic anime, that gets too much credit for what it's worth. It was poorly done, and anyone who tells you this is good, is either lying to you, or has no taste in good comedy at all. If you want to watch something with really great humor, go watch Saiki Kuso, i give it a 10/10, as it is just an amazingly fun and enjoyable anime. The complete opposite of this trash, Hinamatsuri.",

            "content": "I have never really been a fan of comedy in anime. For the most part, it's slapstick and funny moments. Both of which, I'm not really a fan of. Of course, there have been animes that I have found funny. But compared to youtubers or western tv-shows, it's not close. \r\nMaybe it's unfair to compare anime with two \"different genres\", but that's just how it is.\r\nBut when I saw that Mother's basement made a video about Hinamatsuri and called it the funniest anime of the year, I was intrigued. \r\nSo after watching the fourth season of Bojack Horseman, which was probably the darkest season ofthe show, I wanted something more light-hearted and funny. \\n\r\nSo Hinamatsuri was a definite watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSomething I immediately recognized was how unusually funny it was. It wasn't the funniest show I had watched, far from it actually. But like I said, anime comedies don't usually give me more than a chuckle. \\n\r\nSo when this show had a pretty good amount of laughs and chuckles, I knew it was special.\\n\r\nMaybe it was the direction they went with the extremely emotional faces or the generally absurd humor. But it was definitely special.\\n\\n\r\nAnd similarly to another comedy anime, miss Kobayashi's dragon maid, I was surprised by the depth the show had. \\n\r\nAnd there was one particular character that helped me come to that conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnzu is introduced in the second episode of the show and is shown to be very loud and aggressive. We later learn that she is there to challenge Hina, the main character. She is basically a normal rival character. \\n\r\nbut after a few episodes, she meets a homeless man. He teaches her how to earn money and gives her a community to be with. \\n\r\nThis changes Anzu's character completely. Her new ethics make her much more of an interesting character and looks like a completely new character by the end. And the conclusion of her character arc was very satisfying.\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil too much, but trust me. She is definitely y favorite character in the show. \\n\r\nSadly, this was the only character that had this much of a depth. but it doesn't mean that every other character is bad. Quite the opposite actually. \\n\\n\r\nI could talk about the story and every other aspect a show has. but to me, the characters and the humor is what you should watch it for. Cause the rest is not as good. I didn't find the music to be great, but still enjoyable, the art is pretty good and the plot points that happen are interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it is another great comedy anime with a lot of heart, \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off this review by splitting it into 2 sections, the first section for those to read without any spoilers (A) and the second half is where we will discuss about the shows in more details (B).\r\nSection A (Spoiler Free)\r\nHinamatsuri has a wide range of characters but mainly follows a girl, Hina with super powers mysteriously appearing in a yakuza's house, Nitta. The anime shows the interactions between them and the large cast of side characters, and does not get much more than that. I'll tell you what to expect here so you will know if this is what you are looking for. \r\nTheshow IS really funny and it does fit to my sense of humor at least, even with good character development, but the story does not develop much, therefore making this show one of those shows you watch weekly just to let loose after a hard, long day. If you are looking for an anime to help you wind down, then this will guarantee to make you laugh. Do not expect much of story progression from this show. After finishing the anime, maybe come back and read the other half of the section and let me know what you thought of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSection B (Spoilers Included)\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri IS a good show and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's humorous, has a wide range of characters that gets decent character development and I found my new favourite character in Hitomi. I would give this a higher score, but like what I said in Section A, the lacking part is its story.\\n\\n\r\nNormally if all the anime is trying to do is just mindless fun and humor, where the main purpose of the show is just pure entertainment, then by all means this show did a great job. However, it does try to implement a progressive story with the introduction of Mao and Ikaruga. The part where and how these super power beings come from were also not explained. \\n\\n\r\nAt certain times, it felt like a casual slice of life series. Even though Hina did state early on that she needed to use her super powers so that she does not explode, in the middle few episodes, there were cases where Hina and Anzu did not use their super powers at all, taking away the special/ unique aspect of the show. Even Anzu's reasoning for not using her super power was not full-proof. At first it was because she didn't want to let Hina know that she was still on Earth, however down the road, we see that Hina did find out she was still there, and she still did not use her powers to make her homeless life less miserable. However this did make for a good character development so it was alright I guess.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe that we will see a season 2 where Mao will finally go to Japan to meet Hina and Anzu, but that took 3 freaking years (last episode)??? So I'm excited to see how their characters developed over the years, and whether the origins of the super power girls are explained in the following season. Overall I really enjoyed the series and hope that season 2 does solve the storyline problem without losing its touch of their comedy side (If it does get a second season).\\n\\n\r\nIn this lackluster life of ours where we only have time to watch a certain number of anime, this anime does get a PASS from me; An anime worthwhile of our time!",

I very enjoy this anime every second of the episodes because characters in this anime raised in different way. \r\nExample Hina being raised by Yoshifumi and Anzu raised by homeless... thats make curious how they grow and ended by watching every scene of this anime.\r\nThe plot of this anime is only show how the character grow and theres no complicate conflict in every episodes. Thats me you while watching this anime can be relaxed and not being overthingking how this anime solved every conflict.\r\nComedy in this anime is completely fresh and its really funny tome because it was an easy jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very relaxing for me who love slice of life anime. I hope there will be a second season.",

            "content": "I liked this show but it's not that good.\r\nBy far the best thing about this anime is that all of its characters are really likable and relatable. The relationships between characters are also great. Also, it's funny, sometimes, and it has some emotional moments.\r\nMy biggest problem with this show is that it's an episodic slice of life show while it presents itself as a shonen. I will go into this later. The idea that the girls have powers doesn't matter at all for most of the series, so I don't get why it's even part of it. Why is the secret organization that sent thegirls portrayed as this huge, powerful force yet it fails everything we see it try to do? Super weird. Also, the entire Mao (that island girl) arc has no significance for the whole season and has no payoff, it's practically worthless.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, the whole Mao thing is complete bullshit. As I've said, the show sort of presents itself as a shonen and that presentation starts with the first scene, which is a fighting scene. Why? probably as some sort of clickbait, because the show doesn't have any fighting other than this. In the last episode we even find out that that scene happens 3 years after the plot we see until then, and that it has and will never have any meaning in the context of the show itself. It could have been removed and it wouldn't make a difference. The first instance that comes to mind when thinking of unrelated first scenes for me is Mirai Nikki. In that, that scene is the entire point of the show! It also did occur first chronologically, as presented in the show, and not 3 years after the fact. In Hinamatsuri it serves as that Ali-A clip that rolls before the intro just to keep you watching. It means nothing. By the way, by using that scene again in the last episode they also hype you for season 2, which is again sort of clickbait because there probably won't be any fighting in that season.\\n\\n\r\nThis is basically a show about adult struggles portrayed by children. It shoves it down your throat in that episode with Hitomi. The only problem with this is that the children (other than Hitomi) don't know anything about the world, and that for some reason nobody bothers to explain basic concepts to them. Anzu's the biggest example of this. Everybody knows that she doesn't understand anything about the world yet they do nothing to explain it to her. In one episode they even explicitly pretend that the world is as she sees it. Literally the only thing they needed to do to solve her problem is to tell her. This is just irritating and hard to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show a 6/10. I did enjoy it but it has way too much bullshit. Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan is funnier.\ufeff",

I would recommend it to anyone, and do not regret watching at all. \r\nThe comedy is visionary, and the characters are absolutely endearing. The plot is much less nebulous than other slice-of-life competitors in the genre, with beautiful visuals to boot. \r\nThe gripes to follow are problems that can only occur in a high-quality anime. The show is so close to perfect, that its missteps are very obvious. \r\nThe only complaint would be that sometimes the show cannot decide between being a kid's show or an adult's show. Some episodeshave long sequences that beat the sentimental dead horse far longer than it maybe should.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of the characters is almost to the detriment of the experience, because as the viewer you want to see more progress than the show gives you. This problem plagues many a slice-of-life, but it's more acute the greater the characters.",

            "content": "Truth be told, this anime wasn't in my to-watch-list for Spring at first. It was only after people started praising it that I thought, hey it sounds good why not give it a try? And... no regrets. This anime is a little bit like Comic Girls it's extremely funny and it's surprisingly good no wonder it's getting such high ratings. And it's one of those rare sci-fi and supernatural animes that I've watched so... yea. \r\nStory: The story goes like this: A mysterious girl suddenly appears before a yakuza man and makes his life hell.... just kidding more like changes his life because before hewas just enjoying his luxurious life as a yakuza but now he's got to deal with taking care of her. And not incurring her wrath since she's got supernatural powers. A rocky start to their relationship slowly becomes more mellow as they start or at least try to understand each other better, with Nitta taking care of Hina and Hina being Hina. Doesnt give a damm about stuff. To be honest I quite like the story, not because it has exceptional development, but it displays and highlights the interactions between each character very well. Nitta trying to hit on Utako, Hitomi trying to care for Hina, and Anzu showing care and concern for her \"parents\" well more like she's adopted by them . The story also teaches us values with the case of how Anzu changed from a rough kid to one who cares for others and appreciates the value of money due to her homeless times. And of course, who can forget the feels moments with Anzu. Man that episode really made me cry. But in a happy way. \\n\r\nRating: 8.1/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is.... well.... ok but i dont like some aspects of the animation, like some of the facial expressions the characters make. Idk, maybe it's just me. \\n\r\nRating: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Great opening and ending. Decent osts, especially during the feels moments. Other than that, nothing special. \\n\r\nRating: 7.8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Decent character development for Hinamatsuri. All the characters slowly change for the better(well most of them at least) throughout the course of the anime, with Nitta eventually becoming more caring for others, Hina..... changing a little. At least she kinda cares for Nitta at the end. Anzu becoming more friendly and especially caring towards her foster parents and calculative when it comes to money. \\n\r\nRating: 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, an anime which made me LOL. And taught me some values, at least I hope. Does it need a season 2? Idk, because the ending was somewhat open. I mean, Mao still hasn't met with Anzu and Hina. Season 1 was good enough. Maybe a few ovas.... hmmm.... Anyways, an anime which I quite enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8.0/10",

READ THE REVIEW AND WATCH IT.\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nStory 8/10: Story, not anything special, about 3 girls from an alien land that have the power of telekinesis and are friends primarily focused around Hina and her caregiver, Nitta. However the interactions between them are extremely hilarious to an audience of all ages and with sad moments at times that really get you in the feels. \r\nArt 10/10: Absolute stunning. This anime, which is not even a fighting anime but a slice of life, manages to produce better fighting scenes than a lot of fighting animes -hopefully this puts it into perspective of how lovely the art is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: One of the few anime where i don't skip the OP, instead humming along to it! the sound within the anime is near perfect - it's hard to find faults in any scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Even the minor characters have their stories, there's not many questions unanswered, of how such and such a random character appeared here. The development of the characters, especially Anzu, is so beautiful, and a lesson can be learned from them to apply in real life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Stunning. Definitely most underrated anime this season, full of happy, funny, sad and enjoyable moments. Give it a try, the first episode will keep you hooked till the last.",
