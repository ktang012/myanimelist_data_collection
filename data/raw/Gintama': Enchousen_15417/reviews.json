            "content": "Despite Gintama': Enchousen being shorter than its previous seasons, it still brings the action and comedy part of the show, never leaving, but always staying one step ahead. By doing this, the emotional impact the show brings into the series in some of the small and major arcs is shown in great detail, this leaves the viewers speechless at how perfectly it's put together.\r\nComedy isn't that strong in series as of late, even in most of the series airing the comedy was either pretty bad or they started out great, but than ended up as failures from becoming great. Knowing when to be funny ina show is essential to making a series great. If you just half-ass your way it won't become funny anymore, instead it will just be a generic show trying too hard. From the Fall and Winter seasons numerous shows tried doing this and they just burnt out near the end. Some recovered themselves near the end, barely.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Gintama is able to keep its comedy approach, knowing when to do it at the right time and not forcing itself too much. This gives the show a strong appeal to the fans that look for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nWe can't just talk about the comedy of Gintama though, the action and emotional part of the show is able to perform so well that its surprising. It makes you think, \"How can a show be so funny, yet so great in so many vast amount of genres?\" It really is speechless to say, at least from my standing and maybe you'll be able to question this yourself sometime too.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Odd Jobs, also known as Yorozuya in its Romanized name, great hardships befall them. This ranges from running out of money due to the lack of jobs\u2014to putting themselves into greater danger more so than the Shinsengumi, also known as the \"Special Police Force.\" By going to such great acts of danger they're able to overcome and help the people they hold dear as friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about Gintama is its characters. Gintoki, Shinpach, Kagura, and don't forget about Sadaharu, their pet dog; If it can even be classified as a \"dog,\" have if not the best and unique characters in Anime. Despite Gintoki being the leader his personality takes a 180 turn from being serious, to trolling the viewers by picking his nose and always reading manga. Like Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura have pretty much the same type of personalities of Gin but show it in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nThe general theme of Gintama has no boundaries, right? Right. It's able to clash from fighting Aliens known as the Amanto that harm their beloved country to fighting corrupted Shoguns that only seek power. This also relates to its artwork by going into an Olden historical setting and even space.\\n\\n\r\nIn the soundtrack department, Audio Highs who's worked on all of the previous seasons and this one also shows how she/he is able to compose and arrange the music in the correct places throughout the series. While  Amoyamo who played the first opening song, \"Let's Go Out\" of Gintama Enchousen and SPYAIR who performed the second opening song, \"Sakura Mitsu Tsuki\" as well as many other songs from the previous seasons is able to show a calm but catchy beat in all of their songs. The ending song is rather catchy as well, performed by PAGE - \"Expect.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Gintama lives up to being a great classic to the viewers. A show that can bring comedy, emotion, action and an historical type setting all into one, while keeping strong to its general based theme is Gintama. Odd Jobs will never be forgotten, they shall return one day and when that day comes, prepare yourself.\\n",

It's not bad, in fact its great. Give it a try, and this dipshit afdal is just bitching out because his favorite anime wasn't number one\r\nFor me Gintama became number 1 for this reasons: Good Story, Originality, Character Personality, Funny, and Great Action.\r\nStory: 10\r\n- The story for gintama is always great.. And the twist that they did where they changed the main character as Sakata Kintoki was genius..  And I lovehow story arcs are only 4-5 episodes, so it's highly rewatchable\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n-Might not be as great as other anime out there.. but I can't complain either\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n-This season was so hilarious.. The way they changed the opening to \"Kintama\" was genius.. And the BGMs always sets the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\n-I think this is where Gintama shines most. There's not a dull character in this anime.. Everyone is so fun and unique in their own way. You will love them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n-There was never a dull moment in Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n-there's still 3 episodes out so I won't give it a 10.. but it was still epic.\\n",

            "content": "Okay this is my first time writing a review. So let's give this a shot.\r\nStory (10): Gintama does have a story, unlike most people who haven't thoroughly watched the show don't believe it has. The overall plot is about the three characters who work in an odd-jobs. Though the story is episodic at times, they will often be serious arcs that are compromised of a couple episodes. This is where the overall plot and character development most of the time happen (though sometimes episodic episodes have development to). In these you can see that Sorachi is developing towards a bigger picture. Though right now let'ssay the plot is about the main characters and their daily lives and the struggle the go through as things from the past and current will come and get in their way. Gintama is about life and life doesn't have a plot until you stop and look back on it.\\n\r\nRight now Enchousen is picking up were Gintama left off in the manga using some of the bigger arcs. It has some re-runs mixed inbetween which you can watch or skip.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.5): I find gintama's art to be very nice though maybe not the best. The anime art is defiantly better than the manga's lol. I admit I preferred the art the had in  Gintama' 2012. I sometime's find Enchousen's art to be a little more iffy then before (probably trying to match Sorachi's new way of drawing). None the less it's still nice. The animation is really amazing, Sunrise really knows what they are doing and get's creative with it. The fights will put you on the edge and the beautiful moments are just that.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): The new openings and endings are simply wonderful. You can also tell that sunrise is trying harder on background music and sound track. The voice acting is top notch like always and really get's you in the mood being set.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): This is one of the things Gintama excels at besides storytelling. The character are all really unique and individual. They break out of the norms for shoenen characters and are just like every day people. The woman are some of the most well done you can find in a series, very strong and independent and sorta unladylike (looking for female fanservice? doesn't happen often here). All the characters have they're own motives or reasoning, you can really feel there emotions. Unlike what somebody said before there is development and you can see that especially in the bigger arcs like the ones enchousen are showing. They are different from how they started. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): If you can't tell from all my previous ranting. Gintama is a really enjoyable shows. Even the re-runs being shown now are some of the funnies episodes. You will not find a moment in this show where you are not crying, laughing, or on the edge with excitement. I don't think there is a person that has watched more than 60-70 episodes who can't say they didn't enjoy it. Give it a try, it may start slow but you'll find yourself hooked in no time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "--Sorry for my English, I'm from a non-English speaking country--\nStory - Sorry, but Gintama has no story, there is no plot at all. It's been like this since the beginning, to say it can get away with that just because it has stand alone adventures is ridiculous, just look at Cowboy Bebop or Mushishi, these shows also have many stand alone adventures and yet they have a story, Gintama can get serious from time to time, but it doesn't have real character development and it has a 'story' that goes nowhere.\nArt - Average, as always. Art is getting better with each new season, but it'sstill pretty average, almost Bleach and Naruto standards, which means it can get pretty detailed and fluid animation in some episodes, but for most of the show it's average.\\n\\n\nSound - The music always seems to convey the right mood, openings and endings are fine.\\n\\n\nCharacter - Likeable characters, but 0 development. All they do is fool around. Some times it feels like I'm watching Family Guy or some stupid show like that, everyone is trying to be funny in their own way, that's about the only compliment I can give them.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment - Very enjoyable show, it has some very funny moments. If a review only depended on this aspect, then I would give Gintama a score of 8.\\n\\n\nStory - 1\\n\nArt - 6\\n\nSound - 7\\n\nCharacter - 6\\n\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\nOverall - 7",

Like for example, Naruto, Bleach or One piece which have almost the same plot, but I admit those three animes are good too. I'm just saying my opinion, so I think Gintama deserved to be number 1. It's almost an all in one anime. There are fights, romance, comedy and many more that you can't see in other animes. It's whole new different anime so if you haven't finished watching it yet. DON'T FRIGGIN' JUDGE. \r\nStory - Gintama is sucha random anime but it HAS a story. It's HAS an awesome story so shut up first and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Of course the sound is waaaaaaay more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This. THIS IS GINTAMA'S BEST. The characters, you won't see such characters in the other animes, all of them are unique and have different deep personalities. If you think they are just being random, no, they have their own awesome stories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I wouldn't say anything more~",

            "content": "Gintama':Enchousen was extremely great, I expected nothing less. \r\nStory:10\r\nFirst off we get the episode with Kintoki as they promised from the last episode of Gintama', it was mostly for the lols but it also focused on Gintoki's bond with his companions and friends, it showed how close they actually are to each other, especially to Kagura, Shinpachi, Otae, Tama and Sadaharu. The second arc of Gintama':Enchousen revealed a little more of Gin-san's past to us and gave Shigeshige shogun an important role to play in, and it shows that Kagura is still friends with the Shogun's sister, the princess that ran out of the castlein the early episodes. The third arc focused on the Shimura siblings' past&the dojo, they also show us how Shinpachi has grown stonger and that he's not just some character that only plays the straightman role, it also shows Tae's kind of lovable side too. We also get to see a different side of Gin-san and what kind of relationship the Shinsengumi and Yagyuu clan have with Sakata Gintoki.\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nEverything looks amazing in HD, Gintoki&Kagura picking their nose, Sadaharu's urine, Shinpachi's main body, Mayonnaise, epic Gintoki's battles, Shogun's pantsu and more. The animation and art in the openings& endings are very relaxing to watch.\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe openings are awesome, my favorite one has to be \"Sakura Mitsutsuki\", it really suits the arc that it's in and very pleasant to my ears, also very beautiful for both the art and the song. \"Let's go out\" also sounds great. The endings are beautiful, especially \"Expect\" which was very cute.\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nAlot of character development, most are from Sakata Gintoki, Shimura Shinpachi&Tae. Alot of Gintoki's past were revealed, Shinpachi grew up and Otae is actually able to talk nicely to Kondo Isao. (Spoiler:In the first arc, Tsukuyo, Sarutobi, Kyubei, Katsura and Hasegawa were able to remember Gintoki, even after they got hypnotized again, it didn't work, this shows how close they actually are to Gintoki, Otae was also the first person to remember Gintoki along with Kagura and Shinpachi, this shows that their bonds are very close to each other)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nWe got alot of actions from Gintoki and the gang, alot of feels from Gintoki and the gang, very good soundtrack and we also got to see Shogun play a very important role. It still keeps the comedy part of the show too.\\n\r\nOverall:10( I wanna do 100 cant we have 100 instead of 10?)\\n\r\nVery good story that links to other episodes, very nice animation&art, beautiful soundtracks, lots of character development, very enjoyable, Gintama DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. \\n\r\nP.S. Dont finish all the episodes too fast or else you wont find anything to fill the void after you finish Gintama as a whole.",

There are lot of people who don't really like this and i will say its personal, I like where it\u2019s going because it has potential this way too and i like that they are using it and I must also say that comedy part isn't lost its just got less. Third season consists of 12 episodes so it\u2019s more serious than comedic, it consists of twostories which focus on real life problems. First story can be interpreted in a lot of ways some people will say that it means that people can't be changed and you are unique, but i think it means that old is better than new. The reason i think so because second story said in third season says that new is better than old it is really weird two opposite things said in one season its style of Gintama.",

            "content": "Despite Gintama': Enchousen being shorter than its previous seasons, it still brings the action and comedy part of the show, never leaving, but always staying one step ahead. By doing this, the emotional impact the show brings into the series in some of the small and major arcs is shown in great detail, this leaves the viewers speechless at how perfectly it's put together.\r\nComedy isn't that strong in series as of late, even in most of the series airing the comedy was either pretty bad or they started out great, but than ended up as failures from becoming great. Knowing when to be funny ina show is essential to making a series great. If you just half-ass your way it won't become funny anymore, instead it will just be a generic show trying too hard. From the Fall and Winter seasons numerous shows tried doing this and they just burnt out near the end. Some recovered themselves near the end, barely.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Gintama is able to keep its comedy approach, knowing when to do it at the right time and not forcing itself too much. This gives the show a strong appeal to the fans that look for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nWe can't just talk about the comedy of Gintama though, the action and emotional part of the show is able to perform so well that its surprising. It makes you think, \"How can a show be so funny, yet so great in so many vast amount of genres?\" It really is speechless to say, at least from my standing and maybe you'll be able to question this yourself sometime too.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Odd Jobs, also known as Yorozuya in its Romanized name, great hardships befall them. This ranges from running out of money due to the lack of jobs\u2014to putting themselves into greater danger more so than the Shinsengumi, also known as the \"Special Police Force.\" By going to such great acts of danger they're able to overcome and help the people they hold dear as friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about Gintama is its characters. Gintoki, Shinpach, Kagura, and don't forget about Sadaharu, their pet dog; If it can even be classified as a \"dog,\" have if not the best and unique characters in Anime. Despite Gintoki being the leader his personality takes a 180 turn from being serious, to trolling the viewers by picking his nose and always reading manga. Like Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura have pretty much the same type of personalities of Gin but show it in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nThe general theme of Gintama has no boundaries, right? Right. It's able to clash from fighting Aliens known as the Amanto that harm their beloved country to fighting corrupted Shoguns that only seek power. This also relates to its artwork by going into an Olden historical setting and even space.\\n\\n\r\nIn the soundtrack department, Audio Highs who's worked on all of the previous seasons and this one also shows how she/he is able to compose and arrange the music in the correct places throughout the series. While  Amoyamo who played the first opening song, \"Let's Go Out\" of Gintama Enchousen and SPYAIR who performed the second opening song, \"Sakura Mitsu Tsuki\" as well as many other songs from the previous seasons is able to show a calm but catchy beat in all of their songs. The ending song is rather catchy as well, performed by PAGE - \"Expect.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Gintama lives up to being a great classic to the viewers. A show that can bring comedy, emotion, action and an historical type setting all into one, while keeping strong to its general based theme is Gintama. Odd Jobs will never be forgotten, they shall return one day and when that day comes, prepare yourself.\\n",

It's not bad, in fact its great. Give it a try, and this dipshit afdal is just bitching out because his favorite anime wasn't number one\r\nFor me Gintama became number 1 for this reasons: Good Story, Originality, Character Personality, Funny, and Great Action.\r\nStory: 10\r\n- The story for gintama is always great.. And the twist that they did where they changed the main character as Sakata Kintoki was genius..  And I lovehow story arcs are only 4-5 episodes, so it's highly rewatchable\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n-Might not be as great as other anime out there.. but I can't complain either\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n-This season was so hilarious.. The way they changed the opening to \"Kintama\" was genius.. And the BGMs always sets the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\n-I think this is where Gintama shines most. There's not a dull character in this anime.. Everyone is so fun and unique in their own way. You will love them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n-There was never a dull moment in Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n-there's still 3 episodes out so I won't give it a 10.. but it was still epic.\\n",

            "content": "Okay this is my first time writing a review. So let's give this a shot.\r\nStory (10): Gintama does have a story, unlike most people who haven't thoroughly watched the show don't believe it has. The overall plot is about the three characters who work in an odd-jobs. Though the story is episodic at times, they will often be serious arcs that are compromised of a couple episodes. This is where the overall plot and character development most of the time happen (though sometimes episodic episodes have development to). In these you can see that Sorachi is developing towards a bigger picture. Though right now let'ssay the plot is about the main characters and their daily lives and the struggle the go through as things from the past and current will come and get in their way. Gintama is about life and life doesn't have a plot until you stop and look back on it.\\n\r\nRight now Enchousen is picking up were Gintama left off in the manga using some of the bigger arcs. It has some re-runs mixed inbetween which you can watch or skip.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.5): I find gintama's art to be very nice though maybe not the best. The anime art is defiantly better than the manga's lol. I admit I preferred the art the had in  Gintama' 2012. I sometime's find Enchousen's art to be a little more iffy then before (probably trying to match Sorachi's new way of drawing). None the less it's still nice. The animation is really amazing, Sunrise really knows what they are doing and get's creative with it. The fights will put you on the edge and the beautiful moments are just that.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): The new openings and endings are simply wonderful. You can also tell that sunrise is trying harder on background music and sound track. The voice acting is top notch like always and really get's you in the mood being set.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): This is one of the things Gintama excels at besides storytelling. The character are all really unique and individual. They break out of the norms for shoenen characters and are just like every day people. The woman are some of the most well done you can find in a series, very strong and independent and sorta unladylike (looking for female fanservice? doesn't happen often here). All the characters have they're own motives or reasoning, you can really feel there emotions. Unlike what somebody said before there is development and you can see that especially in the bigger arcs like the ones enchousen are showing. They are different from how they started. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): If you can't tell from all my previous ranting. Gintama is a really enjoyable shows. Even the re-runs being shown now are some of the funnies episodes. You will not find a moment in this show where you are not crying, laughing, or on the edge with excitement. I don't think there is a person that has watched more than 60-70 episodes who can't say they didn't enjoy it. Give it a try, it may start slow but you'll find yourself hooked in no time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "--Sorry for my English, I'm from a non-English speaking country--\nStory - Sorry, but Gintama has no story, there is no plot at all. It's been like this since the beginning, to say it can get away with that just because it has stand alone adventures is ridiculous, just look at Cowboy Bebop or Mushishi, these shows also have many stand alone adventures and yet they have a story, Gintama can get serious from time to time, but it doesn't have real character development and it has a 'story' that goes nowhere.\nArt - Average, as always. Art is getting better with each new season, but it'sstill pretty average, almost Bleach and Naruto standards, which means it can get pretty detailed and fluid animation in some episodes, but for most of the show it's average.\\n\\n\nSound - The music always seems to convey the right mood, openings and endings are fine.\\n\\n\nCharacter - Likeable characters, but 0 development. All they do is fool around. Some times it feels like I'm watching Family Guy or some stupid show like that, everyone is trying to be funny in their own way, that's about the only compliment I can give them.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment - Very enjoyable show, it has some very funny moments. If a review only depended on this aspect, then I would give Gintama a score of 8.\\n\\n\nStory - 1\\n\nArt - 6\\n\nSound - 7\\n\nCharacter - 6\\n\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\nOverall - 7",

Like for example, Naruto, Bleach or One piece which have almost the same plot, but I admit those three animes are good too. I'm just saying my opinion, so I think Gintama deserved to be number 1. It's almost an all in one anime. There are fights, romance, comedy and many more that you can't see in other animes. It's whole new different anime so if you haven't finished watching it yet. DON'T FRIGGIN' JUDGE. \r\nStory - Gintama is sucha random anime but it HAS a story. It's HAS an awesome story so shut up first and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Of course the sound is waaaaaaay more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This. THIS IS GINTAMA'S BEST. The characters, you won't see such characters in the other animes, all of them are unique and have different deep personalities. If you think they are just being random, no, they have their own awesome stories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I wouldn't say anything more~",

            "content": "Gintama':Enchousen was extremely great, I expected nothing less. \r\nStory:10\r\nFirst off we get the episode with Kintoki as they promised from the last episode of Gintama', it was mostly for the lols but it also focused on Gintoki's bond with his companions and friends, it showed how close they actually are to each other, especially to Kagura, Shinpachi, Otae, Tama and Sadaharu. The second arc of Gintama':Enchousen revealed a little more of Gin-san's past to us and gave Shigeshige shogun an important role to play in, and it shows that Kagura is still friends with the Shogun's sister, the princess that ran out of the castlein the early episodes. The third arc focused on the Shimura siblings' past&the dojo, they also show us how Shinpachi has grown stonger and that he's not just some character that only plays the straightman role, it also shows Tae's kind of lovable side too. We also get to see a different side of Gin-san and what kind of relationship the Shinsengumi and Yagyuu clan have with Sakata Gintoki.\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nEverything looks amazing in HD, Gintoki&Kagura picking their nose, Sadaharu's urine, Shinpachi's main body, Mayonnaise, epic Gintoki's battles, Shogun's pantsu and more. The animation and art in the openings& endings are very relaxing to watch.\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe openings are awesome, my favorite one has to be \"Sakura Mitsutsuki\", it really suits the arc that it's in and very pleasant to my ears, also very beautiful for both the art and the song. \"Let's go out\" also sounds great. The endings are beautiful, especially \"Expect\" which was very cute.\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nAlot of character development, most are from Sakata Gintoki, Shimura Shinpachi&Tae. Alot of Gintoki's past were revealed, Shinpachi grew up and Otae is actually able to talk nicely to Kondo Isao. (Spoiler:In the first arc, Tsukuyo, Sarutobi, Kyubei, Katsura and Hasegawa were able to remember Gintoki, even after they got hypnotized again, it didn't work, this shows how close they actually are to Gintoki, Otae was also the first person to remember Gintoki along with Kagura and Shinpachi, this shows that their bonds are very close to each other)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nWe got alot of actions from Gintoki and the gang, alot of feels from Gintoki and the gang, very good soundtrack and we also got to see Shogun play a very important role. It still keeps the comedy part of the show too.\\n\r\nOverall:10( I wanna do 100 cant we have 100 instead of 10?)\\n\r\nVery good story that links to other episodes, very nice animation&art, beautiful soundtracks, lots of character development, very enjoyable, Gintama DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. \\n\r\nP.S. Dont finish all the episodes too fast or else you wont find anything to fill the void after you finish Gintama as a whole.",

There are lot of people who don't really like this and i will say its personal, I like where it\u2019s going because it has potential this way too and i like that they are using it and I must also say that comedy part isn't lost its just got less. Third season consists of 12 episodes so it\u2019s more serious than comedic, it consists of twostories which focus on real life problems. First story can be interpreted in a lot of ways some people will say that it means that people can't be changed and you are unique, but i think it means that old is better than new. The reason i think so because second story said in third season says that new is better than old it is really weird two opposite things said in one season its style of Gintama.",
