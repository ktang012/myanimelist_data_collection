            "content": "May it be said that this horror of an adapted anime has forever ruined my picture of DMMD.  Anyone who gives this anime a decent score is just going easy on it.  This anime is not a ten, not a seven or even the lowest score to ever be conceived of on MAL, a six.  No, this is far worse.\r\nWhat I was hoping for was, alas, too much.  I feel sorry for previous fans of the series, as this does no justice to the original VN.  Honestly, I think you should never remove the \"L\" from \"BL\", as the originalhad some plot points revolving around the romance between characters.  I understand what the producers were trying to do here, which was acquire a new demographic. What a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nIn doing this, along with the short amount of episodes, they stripped the characters of any real feeling.  You couldn't get attached to them because they didn't get a chance.  Noiz, for example, was reduced to a background prop after his arc ended and Clear's began.  There was no development because it wasn't long enough. ( Aside from Aoba using Scrap on them. ) The only character I really even liked was Clear.  Every time an arc was finished Aoba stuffed that character into Glitter like he was building his own harem or something.  I didn't like this at all, although I can understand why they did this.  ( Basically so every character could achieve their \"happy ends\". )\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was mediocre at best.  It seemed very rushed, especially towards the beginning.  Near the end it was somewhat decent, but I've definitely seen better.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I'm pretty satisfied with it.  It sets the mood fairly well in most parts.  Probably the anime's only redeeming quality.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, plot!  Pretty much the same as the VN, which, mind you I found mildly boring too.  This isn't really the anime's fault, but yeah, it's especially boring in the beginning.  There were some plot holes, some of which the anime was at fault for due to not enough episodes.  There were some pretty original ideas here and there, but without the romance there's really nothing all that amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime sucks.  I didn't enjoy it by any means.  It was aimed  at the wrong demographic, was rushed, had a low budget and not enough episodes to flush it all out.  I think this anime would've been a lot better with more of a budget and more episodes.  I recommend the VN if you're interested in it, but not the anime unless you're really bored. (or are a hardcore fan of the VN.)\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: I'm not a professional at all. If you have a criticism of this review please tell me, it would really help! :)",

Or the second...Or third...Or...Well you get the point (Amnesia fans understand the struggle). \r\nEach time I clicked 'next episode', I felt as if someone rammed something into my brain and started picking on it : \"Oh look..You've seen this character before. Haven't you? Ohhhh he seemed suspicious! I knew it! I knew it!\". Inessence the author did an amazing job at trowing javelins at my imagination through plot twists. You'll never know what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nIn reference to the art...Well hella. The detail of the landscape is quite similar to Durarara or Cross Ange (basically a 'society in the future' landscape). However, it has it's own 'high' to it. When you watch, notice that most of the city is animated as if behind a block of ice. It's blurry, shiny and magnificent. But the blurriness foreshadows the instability of perfection created by humans in Dramatical Murder. And the characters...Well they're all completely (and I mean totally) to die for. Each of the (significant or insignificant) characters have incredibly beautiful eyes that pierce straight through your anime/manga-loving heart. But...That's not all that captivated me when it came down to their looks. All of them were unique in a million different ways. You need to see it to understand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Characters...Yes...Well...I need you to promise me something ok? Have tissues near (Not just for tears if you know what I mean). The moment I laid my eyes on Aoba and Ren, I needed more. Aoba is the main character, and let me tell you... Everyone wants, loves and adores Aoba (For whatever reason). However...His personality pivots between Kaneki-ken (and his struggle to remain human) and Mikado Ryuugamine (who fights to stay a simple human despite his curiosity). He is beyond special and so is his Grandma and his dog, and all his friends ( :D ). \\n\\n\r\nBut I don't want to be too specific, or i'll spoil everything for you. \\n\\n\r\nIn general the characters were all quite well developed (Even supporting characters had a unique personality that made them stand out). Each radiated a different side of humanity. They all had their fears, goals, grudges and dreams that eventually lead them to Aoba. I bet you'll find yourself in at lest one of them. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know If I motivated you to watch DM, but please consider it. It's a work of art. You will remember the names of the characters even if it's a 12 episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nCheers --",

            "content": "DRAMAtical Murder is an anime adapted from a BL visual novel originally created by the company Nitro+ who also made things like Steins;Gate and Chaos Head. Similarly to those and other stories done by Nitro+, it has a very sci-fi and futuristic feeling to it. And despite the original material involving gay rape sex scenes (though I haven't played the original game so I can't compare them more than this), this is tuned down to a PG-13 rating which never delves farther in the shounen-ai element than a simple kiss and gay sexual innuendos galore.\r\nDMMd begins with Seragaki Aoba, a man of around 20 yearsold. The story is told from his perspective as he meets different people, both ones he already knew and strangers. He begins to discover something big going on in his city involving gangs, a digital game called \"Rhyme,\" and some of the people around him. Aoba, of course, is also strongly involved in this growing plot whether he knows it or not at first. The initial setup is basically your typical VN setup where you follow the protagonist as you meet the other important and not so important characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems I had with DMMd is just how poorly timed its twists and reveals are. Aoba knows almost nothing that is going on about the main story at first or much that happened prior to Episode 1. Unfortunately, it takes almost half of the 12 episodes for the show to actually give you any idea what is going to happen. And that first half is incredibly boring since all it does is introduce you to some characters who really aren't all that likable. When they do finally reveal the real intent of the plot, it is very predictable and generic. This show is chock full of generic tropes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they could not be less interesting if they tried. Clear is the only character I ever cared about in the slightest (he's a great singer imo) but even still the show developed him and everyone else very poorly. Everything from Aoba's character design (his huge sweatshirt is just disgusting to look at for 12 episodes) to the typical personalities of all the other main characters just made for an extremely boring and annoying cast. Aoba is your typical main lead who doesn't want to hurt anyone and is just lead through the story by everyone else. Koujaku is his best friend who sticks with him through thick and thin despite not really mattering at all in the story. Clear is the mysterious, strange one who also ends up a little unimportant in the story. Noiz is a hacker who's quiet and arrogant. And Mink is really only important towards the end with almost no personality or development to his character. The villains are one dimensional as are most of the small amount of side characters making for one of the worst character casts I've seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is noticeably cheap. The budget seems to be low from the start, you just kind of have to laugh at how rushed episode 3 was, and aside from some nice climactic scenes in the last couple episodes, the entire show just looks terrible. Aside from Aoba's design the other main characters do have pretty good and unique designs. The one aspect of DMMd that wasn't terrible was the soundtrack. Though it didn't stand out at all early on, the later episodes towards the climax of the show really added some great rock tracks that really improved some scenes. Still, this was only apparent towards the end and for much of the show, there is a noticeable lack of any background music. While this can work in some shows, with its futuristic setting DMMd felt very empty because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show just has almost nothing to offer. A bad character cast, animation that is so terrible you can see the individual frames used in most running sequences, a decent soundtrack that needed its better tracks to be used more often, and a generic and silly story full of terrible gay sexual innuendos. One of the worst shows I've seen in a while, I certainly don't recommend this show.",

            "content": "\"DRAMAtical Murder\" was a train wreck of an anime, sullying the video game's name.\r\nWhen I first heard that \"DRAMAtical Murder\" was becoming an anime, I was so excited, I couldn't stop thinking about it. What I was met with, however, was a show consisting of average animation, bland plot lines, and no romance whatsoever. \r\nVoicing Aoba is Kisaichi, Atsushi, known for his role of Aizawa, Yuuichi (Kanon). He is not very popular in the anime world, but his voice is pretty nice. He did a wonderful job of voicing Aoba regularly, and then digging deep to bring out Aoba's \"dark\" side. Most of the voiceswere too deep for my tastes, but they all sounded so good. \\n\\n\r\nTo be specific, the thing I hated most about the anime was the actual animation. When I expected something to rival the video game, I received awkward expressions, still panels, and just all around derps. The animation got better as the anime started to close, but it was still disappointing. Another sad fact was the no romance! This anime turned out to be like another \"Togainu no Chi.\" All the romance was taken out. However, the anime did redeem itself at the end, but that alone cannot make up for the mistakes it had in all the episodes up to eleven. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend playing the gmae instead of watching the anime, even though it has its good point. This anime is either a hit or miss; love or hate. Some players of the game will love it, while others will shake their head in dismay, just questioning why Nitro+ ever let this happen.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nThe story is good, in a sense that it has potential. However, the anime never really elaborated on the story. I'm not sure whether they did this on purpose because of the preexisting fan base, or not. In any case, some elaboration would have been nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 3\\n\r\nAgain I say the animation was very badly done. The game's art was very good, and it was quite a disappointment that it dropped down to such a level.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 8\\n\r\nAt first I didn't like the music, but as I continued watching, the techno grew on me. I still feel that the opening song needs to be a little faster, but that's just me being nit-picky. All in all, the music fit very well, and the soundtracks played were nice and soothing. I especially enjoyed Clear's Jellyfish Song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nI got to meet a lot of different characters and learn about their back stories, but I felt like something was missing. There are still a lot of plot holes in all the characters, but overall each one was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nI actually started losing interest about halfway through. It became a chore to watch, but I couldn't stop because I had already watched over five episodes, and needed to write a review. Some moments were really nice for me, but those were few and far in between. I do have to say that the last episode was the best out of all the others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.8\\n\r\nThis anime had a lot of potential and showed promise, but studio NAZ didn't really do anything with it. Instead, it's left to sit on its heels. But as I said, this anime is either a hit or a miss, so while I didn't enjoy it very much, others may love it.",

            "content": "Some Spoilers Ensue:\r\nBefore I begin let me just say that the low scores are for the anime only. For those of you who don't know, this show was derived from an explicit yaoi dating simulator. The visual novel featured 12 different endings. There was usually a good, and at least one bad for every character. There was also a specific ending for Virus and Trip as well. The true end to the game was meant to be the true end to the anime. If you haven't played the game and don't mind gorgeous and explicit yaoi boy sex, I recommend you forget about what youwatched, and invest the 30 or so hours into Dramatical Murder...then invest another 10 or so into Reconnect to get the full background of the characters lives. I will just say that I absolutely love this game. Nitro+Chiral are yaoi game masters and I have to at least give the anime writers credit for trying to fit this entire game into a 12 episode arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Honestly the story is very complicated. It starts with Aoba working in a shop, then meeting up with the boyfriend squad, then going after Toue who is trying to take over the world. It is very elaborate and also extremely engaging. The problem with the show is they tried to fit 30+ hours of story into 12 episodes. This caused the story to lose its magic and become somewhat of a mess. I understand the writers were trying to give each character's arc an episode, but some required much more for people who haven't played the game to come to love these characters. It was dissapointing. In my opinion, most of the people who wanted to watch this show in the first place were probably yaoi fans, so taking that aspect out all together made me really feel like I was jipped. I understand the anime is on TV so we won't get any hentai (sadly), but I was at least hoping for maybe a less linear storyline so I could see all of my favorite moments from the game acted out and not just thrown together. I wanted to see the bad endings as well but that's just me (And just BTW, taking out the bad ends means there were absolutely NO dramatical murders in the show...lol)...Also bad form with Virus and Trip only being in the show for like 2 minutes lol\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: ........I'm sorry, but it is made fun of a lot because it is really bad. The dialogue is terrible as well, but the animation doesn't even hold a candle to the game. I feel really bad talking so much shit, but I just feel like this show could have done so much more. The only characters who looked even remotely okay were Clear and Ren. The Rhyme worlds were okay and Oval Tower and Glitter were okay but the guard dogs were so laughable...I just don't understand the need to change miniscule things like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: To be fair, some of the dialougue in the game was laughable as well, that was a lot of the fun of playing it, but here, it's like they were trying to put things in there to mess with us gamers...(I.E. I'm going inside you, Aoba dropping to the ground in front of Ryuuhou, etc...) Maybe it was supposed to be funny, but I just found it annoying lol. I was also disappointed in the opening and ending themes. I WISH they would have used the themes from the game! Most were gorgeous. The voice acting was well done, mostly because these voice actors are very good, but like I said, the dialogue was laughable so the feeling you did get became muddled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I adore these characters. All are different and unique including Sei, Toue, and Virus and Trip. The problem, again, is that each were only given one episode for you to get to know them. It makes for 2 dimensional characters when they should be 3 dimentional. Each character's arc you should fall in love with them along with Aoba. You should fall in love with Aoba as well...also I thought it was funny how they portrayed Mink. He's one of the most extreme individuals in the game, and they made him into a puppy in the show. Again, bad form.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm sorry to the people that like the show. I just know how much better it could have been and it makes me sad it was nowhere near that caliber. I highly recommend the game (and any game by NC) but this show sadly missed the mark this time.\\n\\n\r\n3/10. Watched Subbed.",

            "content": "As a fan of the original DRAMAtical Murder games, I had some high hopes for the anime adaptation of them. The trailer looked nice, the characters were all there, and even though there wouldn't be any of the fanservice and sex that made the games what they were, everyone was rejoicing at the announcement of this anime. And then all of our hopes were crushed after the first few episodes. Our beloved DRAMAtical Murder was turned into a trainwreck.\r\nSTORY: 6\r\nI won't really go into the actual story since there's a synopsis already written, but basically the protagonist and his \"friends\" have to beat the badguy who, as usual, is some rich old man who owns a giant corporation. This has been done many times but DRAMAtical Murder actually tried to make it seem interesting and action-packed. Despite the game doing this without any big flaws, the anime made it feel extremely rushed. So, by the time they actually got to the antagonist, it wasn't memorable or even remotely exciting.\\n\\n\r\nART: 4\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is atrocious. In fact, it was so bad in one particular episode that they actually remade the ENTIRE episode with better animation. What little action scenes they had looked sloppy and they felt like nothing was really happening. The only art that was considered good were the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 3\\n\r\nThe opening sounds terrible and so does the ending. The music in the episodes was so forgettable that I legitimately forgot that this anime HAD music in it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5\\n\r\nIf you've ever played one of the DMMD games, you know and love every character in them. You got to know practically everything about them and you felt like you grew up with them. Hell, you even saw them naked at one point. The anime does the complete opposite. You never feel a connection with a character and you certainly don't see them develop.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nTo be honest, I only watched every episode because I was a fan of the games and already knew what would happen. While there were some parts that I enjoyed because they happened in the games and I was happy to see them (poorly) animated, overall I couldn't really enjoy this anime in it's entirety very much.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4\\n\r\nI tried so hard to like this anime, I really did. There was hardly any character development and the art made it difficult to even watch. If you want to get into DRAMAtical Murder, I really would not recommend watching the anime first. Play the games, and if you want to see how vastly superior the games are to it's anime adaptation, then go ahead.\\n",

            "content": "Forgive me for the bad English, i am spanish.\r\nDramatical murder, is a visual novel that contains a lot of yaoi and explicit scenes.\r\nI played all the visual novel, with all the routes and bad and good endings and i simply love it. I am one of the fandom of Dmmd and when i saw the announcement of the anime i was happy and also scared. Why? Because i have seen what they did to Togainu no chi. But i was expecting that nitro+chiral realized about the quality of their last anime and they would fixed it, i was wrong... VERY WRONG.\r\nStory: (3)\r\nI have one question,if you had a visual novel that is a hentai, and it's very famous because of his scenes +18, would you remove all the hentai to make a simply anime of romance? I would not. Dramatical murder is a HARD YAOI, you can't remove all the yaoi stuff and make it an only shonen ai anime... \\n\r\nI know that the history in the visual novel is good and very entertaining, but in the anime they destroy the story mixing all the routes, it seems like Aoba is a slut who have five hot boys at home in love with him and they don't even realize that the others are also in love with Aoba. \\n\r\nArt: (2)\\n\r\nWhy? Why dmmd that is characterized by having one of the most beautiful art in the yaoi visual novels had to finish like this?\\n\r\nPoor animation, with a horrible attempt to reach the art of the visual novel. Also, it contains errors that makes you want to facepalm, like the young Aoba with brown hair. Really, was that necessary?\\n\r\nSound: (4)\\n\r\nI didn't really care about the sound, but it was decent.\\n\r\nCharacters: (5)\\n\r\nThe characters were mediocre because we can't see a lot of them in the anime, but their stories are very sad, beautiful and they are totally worth it to read in the visual novel. But in the anime, the stories of every character are showed in a very short time and i didn't enjoyed it like in the novel.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (2)\\n\r\nI almost dropped the anime at the episode 3, but i continued it because i wanted to see what they were doing with one of my favorites visual novel. I watched all the anime bored and in the same time very angry. \\n\r\nOverall: (3)\\n\r\nDon't misunderstand me, i really love dramatical murder, i am one his enormous fandom, but, that's why i am so severe with the anime. I was expecting something that i could remember for years and i would like to re watch and re watch again like the novel, but it totally disappointed me.\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review.",

            "content": "DRAMAtical murder is a masterpiece.\r\nDespite the fact that this anime is based on a BL game, it was completely  normal, without BL scenes, and i'm glad about it.\r\nAs a 12-episode anime, i expected that it would not have a completed plot, that it would not give importance to the characters and it would just be in hurry. But no, everything was in a perfect quantity and quality.\r\nTo be more exact:\r\nPLOT:10 \r\nThe plot is interesting and enought to fill these 12 episodes of perfection.\r\nCHARACTERS:10  \r\nThe best part of the anime. All of the characters have something special, as special as their past. Each ofthem has a personality which makes you love them, and they are showing you how strong the bonds of friendship can be. All of the characters have a special bond with Aoba and that makes the anime one of the best. Each character has an episode dedicated to him, so that the viewers can develop their opinion about them, understand their importance for the story and make at least one of them their favourite, the one who makes the difference.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:10\\n\r\nThe sound is perfect. During the 'Rhyme', during the fights, even during the silent moments, and of course the little details. \\n\r\nI think the best part of sound is the 'Jellifish song', the song Clear likes to sing. It's a unique melody, full of feelings, a detail but at the same time a jewel in the anime, all sung by an amazing voice (I really want to congratulate the producers for this song)\\n\\n\r\nART:10\\n\r\nThe delight i took from art can't be explained with simple words. Everything is planned with a unique way, especially the characters. They are all so beautiful, Aoba, Clear, Koujaku, Ren, Rei and even Noiz, despite the fact that he is full of piercings, i think that he is one of the most handsome men in the anime. Being able to make all the characters so handsome and cute is such a great accomplishment for an anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, DRAMAtical murder is an anime with amazing characters, all important with their own way, helpfull and kind. Their personality, combined with the art makes them to stand up, the plot linked them and made this anime one of my top 5.\\n\r\nI find it disturbing that the players of the game say bad things about this anime, only because it has not BL in it. \\n\r\nSo, I recommed it to the ones who don't like the game, and of course anyone else who likes cute and emotional characters and an interesting plot.",

            "content": "Firstly, this is a pretty short anime- only 12 episodes. It only took me one day to finish it, but to be honest, I don't know what I just watched;;\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story itself isn't that bad. Aoba's special ability was quite original (correct me if I'm wrong please- this is just based on the anime I've watched). However, the story was quite big. Although the idea was decent, I felt like 12 episodes wasn't enough to go into enough detail.\r\nEven after I finished watching it, it just felt like a storm passed super quickly- too much to process in only 12 episodes.\r\nOH! and I reallyliked the futuristic setting with the super advanced technology. That was really interested. I wish I had an allmate.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAHAAHAHA you have to admit.... the characters were pretty good looking. I guess they were a bit bland with no special or unique feature; but, at least they were nicely drawn~ I also really liked how Aoba's grandma was drawn! She kind of reminded me of a toned down version of Dola from Laputa!!\\n\r\nThe background was nicely drawn too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nThe sound actually put me off after the first episode. The OP felt quite out of place, and even after 12 episodes, I still don't like it. But I guess that's just my personal opinion. The background music and sound effects didn't really support the plot. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good- it was just decent enough to bear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThey were gooooood looking~ Despite only being 12 episodes long, there was a fair amount of character development. This is probably because each episode seemed to be focused around Aoba getting to know the characters (you'll find out what this means when you watch the anime).\\n\r\nMost of the characters weren't well developed enough for me to get emotionally attached. But, they all had likeable personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe anime was decent. The story started out slow, but progressed faster towards the end. I don't know how to word this... it was enjoyable but not? The ideas were fresh and interesting. But, if I had a whole queue of anime to watch, this one would be my lowest priority.\\n\r\nI guess I only finished it because it was 12 episodes and seemed like a quick anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThere are probably people who like it and people who don't. If you're into hot guys, technology, and a tiny bit of supernatural(?) then try watching it :) BUT! don't just walk away after the first episode. Like I said, the story starts of slow.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I just found out that it's based off a BL visual novel. I wish they had more romance in the anime :( There was no romance whatsoever... kind of disappointing;;",

            "content": "This is my first review ever, so be warned I'm new to this stuff\r\nAs a person who has played the Visual Novel and is a fan of it, when I heard DRAMAtical Murder (DMMD) was getting an anime adaptation I was quite excited. Well I'm just gonna get straight to the review\r\nStory: \r\nI am a huge sucker for mystery/game anime and DMMD definitely caught my interest. I've also never quite seen a concept as interesting has this in a while. Though by the end of the show, anime-only watchers are pretty much guaranteed to be confused and would have to go to the source materialto answer unresolved issues. An 8 is really pushing my bias but it'll do.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nOh NAZ, how you messed up the beauty of the game. Although NAZ did stay close to the original designs of characters they felt very sloppy. Close up shots were fine, but zoom out to show a group of people and everything looks like they got some kindergartner to trace over the original art. Animation however, was pretty much horrendous. NAZ can barely pull off decent animation with one show, but they decided to jump the train and animation DMMD and Re:_Hamatora, which was a huge mistake. Before they attempt this they need bigger budgets and more effort. One compliment I will give to the animation is the use of CGI in the show. It generally fits in and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, which is quite the feat in anime. Mediocre at best, with a 5.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is one of the better aspects of the show. A variety of electronic/techno tracks done by GoatBed, who if you did not know made the original music for the VN, along with few orchestral pieces really fit the show. Although I can't recall many of them they set the moods for their respective scenes and didn't feel out of place. The opening was ok, and requires a specific taste to enjoy, and the endings overall were pretty nice, especially during the episodic part of the show. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n12 episodes is not enough to develop the large cast this show has, and hindered the show a lot. While some characters got nice development such as Aoba, Ren, and Clear, most of the cast was left behind and never really changed. I'm not saying that only the 3 previously mentioned are the only ones who developed, but those three got the amount they needed. This is honestly where my bias comes in the most because despite the fact the characters were pretty much horrible, I still liked them. None of them (with the exception of Mink) were annoying or disliked by me but they didn't really go out of their way to develop the cast. 24 episodes would've brought this score up for sure. A fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBias. The one reason I liked this show as much as I do. The show was pretty much a train wreck, but for a VN reader I enjoyed it much more than I should had. I was waiting for some of my favorite scene from the VN to be animated and squealed when they finally showed up. Probably wouldn't rewatch, but sure did enjoy it all the way through. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDRAMAtical Murder is not an anime for anyone, and will mostly appeal to those who have gone through the VN. However I suggest you give DMMD a try if:\\n\r\n-You like a nice mystery\\n\r\n-You don't mind bad animation\\n\r\n-You like Free!, mostly because of all the yaoi undertones in both shows.\\n\r\nI would suggest you stay away from this anime if:\\n\r\n-You like having well developed characters\\n\r\n-You mind being confused the entire way through\\n\r\n-You must require good animation\\n\r\n-Bishies are not your thing.\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10 from a critical standpoint but if my enjoyment were to be factored in the score would go up to a 7/10, but I still give it a 9/10 on my personal list, just because I enjoyed it that much.",

            "content": "Let's get logged into a futuristic cyber world where gangs and mind controllers control the universe along with the \"Blue Fox\" : \"Aoba Seragaki\" and his friends as he saves his homeland(island) from an incoming cyber attack. \r\nStory: Frankly this type of a futuristic story is very hard to combine no doubt that the mangaka and the producers succeeded on that. You see this blue haired cute dude in a futuristic pair of boots, on the first impression he looks strong and a lone wolf but not essentially. He works in a Junk Shop to fair for his grandma and himself. Little did he knowthat some of the gangs in the area is being threatened by a combo called \"Morphine\" which progresses the story from there. The story is so confusing at first- it took me about 4 episodes to accumulate what's going on but in the end you get used to it. There's that RPG feeling in there, you have those fancy shops and colours, robotic familiars and etc which brings out many nostalgic feelings i had from  PC game called \"Remember me\". This one has some awesome plot twists which usually lefts you curious at the end of the episode. Most people left the audience since it was Yaoi i expect? However don't confuse friendships with men as Shounen Ai nor Yaoi- men too get emotional and need men to men hugs LOL (just kidding i dunno really hehe)\\n\\n\r\nArt:It is superb- i just loved Aoba's suit and shoes and his hair style. The pink headphones merges well with it. All characters are drawn perfectly to suit their personalties or martial art or cyber obsession. Although i noticed that some stereotypical character's were altered no doubt to give more \"fanservice\" however i wouldn't conclude that disappointing. The artistic flare in here was creative just like in \"Karneval\" but even more than compared to it. All the needed creative elements to fabricate a cyber story is in here. The battle art looked common but still interesting. I liked very much how the scenery had been drawn it's so calm and serene. I liked the Outro to the next episode very much- those multitude of voices playing and text screening at the same time shows how the mind can function when it's distracted. \\n\\n\r\nSound:Music was done by Hayashi Yuki who created superb emotional piano pieces and other tracks to suit the mood of certain events in this anime.(He also did Diabolik Lovers) The Seiyus did extremely well on this although at some point you feel that all voices are same except for Aoba and Sei. The Openings and Endings suits the story and the atmosphere completely more than it should have which makes it appetizing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:I liked that Aoba's character. It was such a normal every day character which you \"Want\" to see everyday and that he has an ulterior personality which is totally unpredictable. His peers are unique with unusual talents and tragedian pasts- without giving out spoilers it's hard to describe the intensity as Aoba somehow gets involved with them, personally inside their own tainted emotional states. Since this is futuristic no doubt that you find robots- the special sensual thing i noticed in the main chara is that he never makes anybody lonely, never discriminates anybody just because they don't have relative human bodies. Characters like Koujaku should be appreciated since those personalties represents or give out true friendship which in most cases our whole world lacks. This unique clash of personalties clashing together creates an ultimate story to put it simply.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm going to give this an 8, As I did very much enjoy it. You don't find that many enjoyable anime these days with all the stuff going on is relatively superb like the story, usually at some point the story goes good but the music or the art sucks- and that looses a point. This show would have been more famous if it had a twenty four or more episodes. The awesomeness oozes from the 8 or 9th episode. Most of them left me in uncontrollable tears. The first few episodes gives out Aoba's life- it's so calm and well \"normal\"  it gives out that change than other anime- instead of anything out of the place happening i enjoyed the easy paces episodes so much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Aoba's compassion is so majestic that you think kindness at least \"exists\" in the anime world. The whole setting is philosophical- Ren- means restraint whilst Noise\" and Clear\" are totally opposites. \"Rhyme\" is also somewhat involved here. \"Morphine\" is a drug which implicit painlessness. Combine them together and you get them as as sources of distraction and elements of calming the mind(you'll understand how mind is important after you've watched this) Anyway this one of those anime which you want to cuddle with on a Saturday night sipping a mug of coffee(however on my case i drank medicine while watching this- Still added the required taste. There's a Visual Novel of this- i guess it's worth playing depending that the anime is good and was abled to satisfy the audience. Since There was a controversy that it was \"Yaoi\" didn't see 75% of Yaoi in the anime- there were let's-make-it-yaoi BUT stay-neutral elements in here, I don't know about the Visual Novel- so play it to know that!",

            "content": "So, my overall thought (after playing the game and watching countless of letplays and reviews on Youtube) was that this Anime had so much potential and the producers took a crap on that chance.\r\nI'm a very big fan of Yaoi and Yuri in general, but after watching the first few episodes I kind of lost interest in the Anime. But, after months of procrastinating I finally finished it and I must say; It was kind of mediocre.\r\nI give this Anime: A six.\r\nBecause of the lack of good animation, the mediocre work put into it and some of the art in the anime looks really strange.Compared to the game, I actually liked the art in the game. Oh and... Let's not forget the lack of: ROMANCE!\\n\\n\r\nBut, the characters and music was really good. Took a bit of time to get out of my \"what-the-hell-are-you\" moment, when I first saw the characters. But after I played the game and watched all of those letplays of it: DRAMAtical Murder is now my favorite yaoi game.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime unfortunately is a whole other story. I loved the characters, voiceacting and the music wasn't bad either, since I enjoy techno and dubstep. But the overall work put into the Anime's animation and plotline, is a complete joke.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score for this Anime, is a six.",

I stopped watching the anime mid-way because I didn't want my love of the games to be soiled by an anime adaption that basically gave an episode per character and stripped them down of most of their characteristics. The animation was sometimes laughably bad, but hey what do you expect. I've mainly given up on BL game anime adaptions (Togainu no Chi, and now this), since I feel like they never have the budget they really deserve to actually make it good. If you're new to DMMD and like the generalgist of it, I'd highly recommend you play the games (though beware they are quite graphic, especially compared to this anime). I think the only reason I gave this series a \"decent\" rating was that I actually knew what was going on since I played the first game before watching the series. Otherwise i'd be so clueless.",

            "content": "I had low expectations of DRAMAtical Murder going into it. I was expecting it was going to be average, maybe even above that. Well, it didn't even do that much. I'm going to do my best to be fair in this review, but this anime is VERY rough around the edges. Let me try to explain.\r\nThe story of DRAMAtical has some serious problems. To begin with, the story has no rising action, or climax to speak of. At no point was I excited or blown away by where the story was going, or what it was trying to do. There are a lot of characterswhose main purpose is to deliver plot. DRAMAtical Murder does a lot of \"Tell, don't show.\" There were moments of potential, but never go any further beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of DRAMAtical Murder is probably its strongest point. The art style isn't bad to look at. It does lack its own flair and style, but as a viewer, it certainly wasn't ugly. Animation wise though, this anime is very lacking. The action scenes are poorly directed, making it hard to tell what exactly is going on. The show also relies on CGI in heavy action scenes. They try to hide the CGI with characters moving fast with a lot of flashy explosions, which again makes it hard to follow. In terms of actual animation, there isn't a lot in the actual show. There is a lot of scenes with characters being completely still and just moving their mouths. There were also a few scenes where the characters were running, but looked very strange and inhuman. Overall, the art style is fine at best, with animation leaving much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall sound direction of the show is alright. The music works for this kind of show, but nothing memorable. It just simply does it job. \\n\r\nWhen discussing the sub and dub of this anime, the choice is easy. I watched about half in sub and half in dub. If you are going to watch this, don't even try the dub. Don't. The dubs voice acting is mediocre at best, but the big issue is the writing. Some scenes seriousness or tension is completely destroyed by the clown show that the writing of the dub delivers. Watch the sub, as it is better in every way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime... oh boy. Most are flat, uninteresting, which surprises me to be honest as most of them get DECENT development. Everyone in the main group gets one episode dedicated to them. These episodes were appreciated in making our main cast more human. The problem though is the way the anime handles actually handling these scenes. Basically, our main character mind-fu**s them and helps them with the power of friendship. OH, and the \"friendship\" in this anime is often forced at times. Most of the main cast has no chemistry, and often feels very fake and rushed. The main character literally gets beat and assaulted a number of times by one of his \"friends\" and he just takes it. SORRY, WHAT? And then later on they become homies and go on missions together. I don't understand how this group of pretty men formed this \"Yaoi Force.\" \\n\r\nWe havn't even gotten to the villains yet. Well, surprise surprise, they also are awful. The main bad guy is your average I'M EVIL BECAUSE I WANT POWER AND MONEY. Other villains include uninteresting henchmen, or enemy gangs whose soul purpose is to move the plot forward while not bringing anything new or interesting to the table. Needless to say, the characters of DRAMAtical Murder need significant changes. \\n\\n\r\nSo as you can probably tell, I didn't like this anime. I actually fell asleep during an episode I was so uninterested and bored. This is only the second anime to do that, the first being DragonBall GT. I actually kinda liked that more to be honest.\\n\r\nAnyway, getting back on topic, I don't recommend anyone watches this anime. There are plenty of BETTER shows out there that deserve your time. \\n\r\nThis concludes my review of DRAMAtical Murder. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! If you have any positive or negative feedback regarding the writing of this review, please feel free to send me a message. Id appreciate it.",

            "content": "I remember when I heard they were going to make an adaptation on DRAMAtical Murder, me and the entire BL fanbase+other people were buzzing with the news and it easily became the most anticipated anime of summer 2014.\r\nHonestly, I was disappointed. Not that I was expecting anything.\r\nThe story [6]\r\nit was good. Seeing how I played the game, I saw where they were headed with the show but everything felt rushed, while the beginning was a bit of a drag (the game's beginning was also a bit slow). A whole ending with each characters was sandwiched between each episode. It would have flowed better if theywere given more room between each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters [5]\\n\r\nThey didnt give us enough time to really get to know the characters better. With one episode to meet them, have them appear popping up in places, and one episode for their back story; there wasnt enough screen time for each character to fully soak in with the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation [3]\\n\r\nWere lacking in some places. The parts where it required many different frames (ex: running/fight scenes/etc.) were half arsed through. Animation was not flowy, art wasnt consistent and overall rushed.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/sound/voices/etc [7]\\n\r\nI respect the producer's choice of another song by goatbed giving the anime the same feeling as the game but I didnt really like it. Slight disappointment with behind-the-gas-mask- voice but that was based off personal preference and bless the producers for keeping the voices the same as the game.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment[7] \\n\r\n It was so bad it was good\\n\\n\r\nI tried not to compare it to the game that much (I loved the game) If I could, I would've marked it a 6.5. Adaptation wasnt as bad as what I expected (*cough* togainu no chi *cough*) it does the game no justice but it was fun. I suggest if you really are interested, play the game.",

            "content": "An easy review of DRAMAtical Murder-- SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment!\r\nOVERALL--\r\nDRAMAtical Murder is adapted from a visual novel. As is the case with many VN to anime adaptions, the anime rushes as it tries to incorporate information from all of the various VN routes. With only 12 episodes, DRAMAtical Murder struggles in its development of both characters and the overall world. This leads to a slightly lackluster ending, with characters you really wish you could have known better. Still, I found it fairly enjoyable overall and would say it's worth watching since it's a quick 12 episodes. It's not amazing, but it's not as terribleas some people suggest.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY--\\n\r\nDRAMAtical Murder presents viewers with what could have been a very interesting story; unfortunately, it fails to fully take shape in only 12 episodes. It takes about 8 episodes before you actually begin to grasp the main conflict, and just when that conflict should begin to expand, the show is winding towards a quick conclusion. The story in itself is strong, but the anime fails to portray that in the time it is given. The ending left me asking, \"That was all there was to it?\" as I had hoped for greater depth and development. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS--\\n\r\nAll of the characters have great designs with lots of detail and personality. I found each of them fun to watch and listen to. They also had very diverse personalities that seemed promising. Sadly, the little character development that happens in the show occurs so quickly that it doesn't really feel meaningful. These characters are ones you WANT to care about, but the show doesn't really give you the time to form strong attachments to them. \\n\\n\r\nPROS--\\n\r\n+ Interesting character designs (with lots of good looking boys!)\\n\r\n+ Compelling story idea\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack is fitting of the futuristic setting\\n\r\n+ Enjoyable voice actors\\n\r\n+ Bright, colorful animation (but pretty low-budget)\\n\\n\r\nCONS--\\n\r\n- Story is underdeveloped and could have benefitted from 24 episodes rather than 12 \\n\r\n- Climax is rushed and ending conflict is pretty vanilla\\n\r\n- No good explanation of the setting/world of the story\\n\r\n- No meaningful character development\\n\r\n- Took the L outta BL (the VN is BL)",

It went by a little too fast for something like the plot of DMMD to be mushed altogether in 13 episodes. The characters were displayed alright, but they had more in them than presented. It felt lacking for characters like Koujaku and Mink. It felt like they favored Clear and Noiz the most to present.\r\nBeing someone who also has played the game, it was just nice to see my favourite otome game animated. I made fun of the animemore than enjoyed it for the way I enjoy other anime. I still liked DRAMAtical Murder as an anime but would recommend anyone interested in watching this to play the game before or even after watching the anime for a better understanding. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I liked it mainly for the fact its based off my favourite game. The studio could have done so much better in animating such a popular Visual novel. There was definitely disappointment, but I don't hate it.",

This anime is not a ten, not a seven or even the lowest score to ever be conceived of on MAL, a six.  No, this is far worse.\r\nWhat I was hoping for was, alas, too much.  I feel sorry for previous fans of the series, as this does no justice to the original VN.  Honestly, I think you should never remove the \"L\" from \"BL\", as the originalhad some plot points revolving around the romance between characters.  I understand what the producers were trying to do here, which was acquire a new demographic. What a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nIn doing this, along with the short amount of episodes, they stripped the characters of any real feeling.  You couldn't get attached to them because they didn't get a chance.  Noiz, for example, was reduced to a background prop after his arc ended and Clear's began.  There was no development because it wasn't long enough. ( Aside from Aoba using Scrap on them. ) The only character I really even liked was Clear.  Every time an arc was finished Aoba stuffed that character into Glitter like he was building his own harem or something.  I didn't like this at all, although I can understand why they did this.  ( Basically so every character could achieve their \"happy ends\". )\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was mediocre at best.  It seemed very rushed, especially towards the beginning.  Near the end it was somewhat decent, but I've definitely seen better.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I'm pretty satisfied with it.  It sets the mood fairly well in most parts.  Probably the anime's only redeeming quality.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, plot!  Pretty much the same as the VN, which, mind you I found mildly boring too.  This isn't really the anime's fault, but yeah, it's especially boring in the beginning.  There were some plot holes, some of which the anime was at fault for due to not enough episodes.  There were some pretty original ideas here and there, but without the romance there's really nothing all that amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime sucks.  I didn't enjoy it by any means.  It was aimed  at the wrong demographic, was rushed, had a low budget and not enough episodes to flush it all out.  I think this anime would've been a lot better with more of a budget and more episodes.  I recommend the VN if you're interested in it, but not the anime unless you're really bored. (or are a hardcore fan of the VN.)\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: I'm not a professional at all. If you have a criticism of this review please tell me, it would really help! :)",

            "content": "Why are you all hating? \r\nThe plot may be difficult to follow, but when it all finally clicks into place you end up sitting there like \"HOW COULD I HAVE MISSED THIS?\" Don't give up on Dramatical Murder just because you don't understand what is going on in the first episode. Or the second...Or third...Or...Well you get the point (Amnesia fans understand the struggle). \r\nEach time I clicked 'next episode', I felt as if someone rammed something into my brain and started picking on it : \"Oh look..You've seen this character before. Haven't you? Ohhhh he seemed suspicious! I knew it! I knew it!\". Inessence the author did an amazing job at trowing javelins at my imagination through plot twists. You'll never know what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nIn reference to the art...Well hella. The detail of the landscape is quite similar to Durarara or Cross Ange (basically a 'society in the future' landscape). However, it has it's own 'high' to it. When you watch, notice that most of the city is animated as if behind a block of ice. It's blurry, shiny and magnificent. But the blurriness foreshadows the instability of perfection created by humans in Dramatical Murder. And the characters...Well they're all completely (and I mean totally) to die for. Each of the (significant or insignificant) characters have incredibly beautiful eyes that pierce straight through your anime/manga-loving heart. But...That's not all that captivated me when it came down to their looks. All of them were unique in a million different ways. You need to see it to understand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Characters...Yes...Well...I need you to promise me something ok? Have tissues near (Not just for tears if you know what I mean). The moment I laid my eyes on Aoba and Ren, I needed more. Aoba is the main character, and let me tell you... Everyone wants, loves and adores Aoba (For whatever reason). However...His personality pivots between Kaneki-ken (and his struggle to remain human) and Mikado Ryuugamine (who fights to stay a simple human despite his curiosity). He is beyond special and so is his Grandma and his dog, and all his friends ( :D ). \\n\\n\r\nBut I don't want to be too specific, or i'll spoil everything for you. \\n\\n\r\nIn general the characters were all quite well developed (Even supporting characters had a unique personality that made them stand out). Each radiated a different side of humanity. They all had their fears, goals, grudges and dreams that eventually lead them to Aoba. I bet you'll find yourself in at lest one of them. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know If I motivated you to watch DM, but please consider it. It's a work of art. You will remember the names of the characters even if it's a 12 episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nCheers --",

            "content": "DRAMAtical Murder is an anime adapted from a BL visual novel originally created by the company Nitro+ who also made things like Steins;Gate and Chaos Head. Similarly to those and other stories done by Nitro+, it has a very sci-fi and futuristic feeling to it. And despite the original material involving gay rape sex scenes (though I haven't played the original game so I can't compare them more than this), this is tuned down to a PG-13 rating which never delves farther in the shounen-ai element than a simple kiss and gay sexual innuendos galore.\r\nDMMd begins with Seragaki Aoba, a man of around 20 yearsold. The story is told from his perspective as he meets different people, both ones he already knew and strangers. He begins to discover something big going on in his city involving gangs, a digital game called \"Rhyme,\" and some of the people around him. Aoba, of course, is also strongly involved in this growing plot whether he knows it or not at first. The initial setup is basically your typical VN setup where you follow the protagonist as you meet the other important and not so important characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems I had with DMMd is just how poorly timed its twists and reveals are. Aoba knows almost nothing that is going on about the main story at first or much that happened prior to Episode 1. Unfortunately, it takes almost half of the 12 episodes for the show to actually give you any idea what is going to happen. And that first half is incredibly boring since all it does is introduce you to some characters who really aren't all that likable. When they do finally reveal the real intent of the plot, it is very predictable and generic. This show is chock full of generic tropes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they could not be less interesting if they tried. Clear is the only character I ever cared about in the slightest (he's a great singer imo) but even still the show developed him and everyone else very poorly. Everything from Aoba's character design (his huge sweatshirt is just disgusting to look at for 12 episodes) to the typical personalities of all the other main characters just made for an extremely boring and annoying cast. Aoba is your typical main lead who doesn't want to hurt anyone and is just lead through the story by everyone else. Koujaku is his best friend who sticks with him through thick and thin despite not really mattering at all in the story. Clear is the mysterious, strange one who also ends up a little unimportant in the story. Noiz is a hacker who's quiet and arrogant. And Mink is really only important towards the end with almost no personality or development to his character. The villains are one dimensional as are most of the small amount of side characters making for one of the worst character casts I've seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is noticeably cheap. The budget seems to be low from the start, you just kind of have to laugh at how rushed episode 3 was, and aside from some nice climactic scenes in the last couple episodes, the entire show just looks terrible. Aside from Aoba's design the other main characters do have pretty good and unique designs. The one aspect of DMMd that wasn't terrible was the soundtrack. Though it didn't stand out at all early on, the later episodes towards the climax of the show really added some great rock tracks that really improved some scenes. Still, this was only apparent towards the end and for much of the show, there is a noticeable lack of any background music. While this can work in some shows, with its futuristic setting DMMd felt very empty because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show just has almost nothing to offer. A bad character cast, animation that is so terrible you can see the individual frames used in most running sequences, a decent soundtrack that needed its better tracks to be used more often, and a generic and silly story full of terrible gay sexual innuendos. One of the worst shows I've seen in a while, I certainly don't recommend this show.",

            "content": "\"DRAMAtical Murder\" was a train wreck of an anime, sullying the video game's name.\r\nWhen I first heard that \"DRAMAtical Murder\" was becoming an anime, I was so excited, I couldn't stop thinking about it. What I was met with, however, was a show consisting of average animation, bland plot lines, and no romance whatsoever. \r\nVoicing Aoba is Kisaichi, Atsushi, known for his role of Aizawa, Yuuichi (Kanon). He is not very popular in the anime world, but his voice is pretty nice. He did a wonderful job of voicing Aoba regularly, and then digging deep to bring out Aoba's \"dark\" side. Most of the voiceswere too deep for my tastes, but they all sounded so good. \\n\\n\r\nTo be specific, the thing I hated most about the anime was the actual animation. When I expected something to rival the video game, I received awkward expressions, still panels, and just all around derps. The animation got better as the anime started to close, but it was still disappointing. Another sad fact was the no romance! This anime turned out to be like another \"Togainu no Chi.\" All the romance was taken out. However, the anime did redeem itself at the end, but that alone cannot make up for the mistakes it had in all the episodes up to eleven. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend playing the gmae instead of watching the anime, even though it has its good point. This anime is either a hit or miss; love or hate. Some players of the game will love it, while others will shake their head in dismay, just questioning why Nitro+ ever let this happen.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nThe story is good, in a sense that it has potential. However, the anime never really elaborated on the story. I'm not sure whether they did this on purpose because of the preexisting fan base, or not. In any case, some elaboration would have been nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 3\\n\r\nAgain I say the animation was very badly done. The game's art was very good, and it was quite a disappointment that it dropped down to such a level.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 8\\n\r\nAt first I didn't like the music, but as I continued watching, the techno grew on me. I still feel that the opening song needs to be a little faster, but that's just me being nit-picky. All in all, the music fit very well, and the soundtracks played were nice and soothing. I especially enjoyed Clear's Jellyfish Song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nI got to meet a lot of different characters and learn about their back stories, but I felt like something was missing. There are still a lot of plot holes in all the characters, but overall each one was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nI actually started losing interest about halfway through. It became a chore to watch, but I couldn't stop because I had already watched over five episodes, and needed to write a review. Some moments were really nice for me, but those were few and far in between. I do have to say that the last episode was the best out of all the others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.8\\n\r\nThis anime had a lot of potential and showed promise, but studio NAZ didn't really do anything with it. Instead, it's left to sit on its heels. But as I said, this anime is either a hit or a miss, so while I didn't enjoy it very much, others may love it.",

            "content": "Some Spoilers Ensue:\r\nBefore I begin let me just say that the low scores are for the anime only. For those of you who don't know, this show was derived from an explicit yaoi dating simulator. The visual novel featured 12 different endings. There was usually a good, and at least one bad for every character. There was also a specific ending for Virus and Trip as well. The true end to the game was meant to be the true end to the anime. If you haven't played the game and don't mind gorgeous and explicit yaoi boy sex, I recommend you forget about what youwatched, and invest the 30 or so hours into Dramatical Murder...then invest another 10 or so into Reconnect to get the full background of the characters lives. I will just say that I absolutely love this game. Nitro+Chiral are yaoi game masters and I have to at least give the anime writers credit for trying to fit this entire game into a 12 episode arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Honestly the story is very complicated. It starts with Aoba working in a shop, then meeting up with the boyfriend squad, then going after Toue who is trying to take over the world. It is very elaborate and also extremely engaging. The problem with the show is they tried to fit 30+ hours of story into 12 episodes. This caused the story to lose its magic and become somewhat of a mess. I understand the writers were trying to give each character's arc an episode, but some required much more for people who haven't played the game to come to love these characters. It was dissapointing. In my opinion, most of the people who wanted to watch this show in the first place were probably yaoi fans, so taking that aspect out all together made me really feel like I was jipped. I understand the anime is on TV so we won't get any hentai (sadly), but I was at least hoping for maybe a less linear storyline so I could see all of my favorite moments from the game acted out and not just thrown together. I wanted to see the bad endings as well but that's just me (And just BTW, taking out the bad ends means there were absolutely NO dramatical murders in the show...lol)...Also bad form with Virus and Trip only being in the show for like 2 minutes lol\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: ........I'm sorry, but it is made fun of a lot because it is really bad. The dialogue is terrible as well, but the animation doesn't even hold a candle to the game. I feel really bad talking so much shit, but I just feel like this show could have done so much more. The only characters who looked even remotely okay were Clear and Ren. The Rhyme worlds were okay and Oval Tower and Glitter were okay but the guard dogs were so laughable...I just don't understand the need to change miniscule things like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: To be fair, some of the dialougue in the game was laughable as well, that was a lot of the fun of playing it, but here, it's like they were trying to put things in there to mess with us gamers...(I.E. I'm going inside you, Aoba dropping to the ground in front of Ryuuhou, etc...) Maybe it was supposed to be funny, but I just found it annoying lol. I was also disappointed in the opening and ending themes. I WISH they would have used the themes from the game! Most were gorgeous. The voice acting was well done, mostly because these voice actors are very good, but like I said, the dialogue was laughable so the feeling you did get became muddled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I adore these characters. All are different and unique including Sei, Toue, and Virus and Trip. The problem, again, is that each were only given one episode for you to get to know them. It makes for 2 dimensional characters when they should be 3 dimentional. Each character's arc you should fall in love with them along with Aoba. You should fall in love with Aoba as well...also I thought it was funny how they portrayed Mink. He's one of the most extreme individuals in the game, and they made him into a puppy in the show. Again, bad form.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm sorry to the people that like the show. I just know how much better it could have been and it makes me sad it was nowhere near that caliber. I highly recommend the game (and any game by NC) but this show sadly missed the mark this time.\\n\\n\r\n3/10. Watched Subbed.",

            "content": "As a fan of the original DRAMAtical Murder games, I had some high hopes for the anime adaptation of them. The trailer looked nice, the characters were all there, and even though there wouldn't be any of the fanservice and sex that made the games what they were, everyone was rejoicing at the announcement of this anime. And then all of our hopes were crushed after the first few episodes. Our beloved DRAMAtical Murder was turned into a trainwreck.\r\nSTORY: 6\r\nI won't really go into the actual story since there's a synopsis already written, but basically the protagonist and his \"friends\" have to beat the badguy who, as usual, is some rich old man who owns a giant corporation. This has been done many times but DRAMAtical Murder actually tried to make it seem interesting and action-packed. Despite the game doing this without any big flaws, the anime made it feel extremely rushed. So, by the time they actually got to the antagonist, it wasn't memorable or even remotely exciting.\\n\\n\r\nART: 4\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is atrocious. In fact, it was so bad in one particular episode that they actually remade the ENTIRE episode with better animation. What little action scenes they had looked sloppy and they felt like nothing was really happening. The only art that was considered good were the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 3\\n\r\nThe opening sounds terrible and so does the ending. The music in the episodes was so forgettable that I legitimately forgot that this anime HAD music in it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5\\n\r\nIf you've ever played one of the DMMD games, you know and love every character in them. You got to know practically everything about them and you felt like you grew up with them. Hell, you even saw them naked at one point. The anime does the complete opposite. You never feel a connection with a character and you certainly don't see them develop.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nTo be honest, I only watched every episode because I was a fan of the games and already knew what would happen. While there were some parts that I enjoyed because they happened in the games and I was happy to see them (poorly) animated, overall I couldn't really enjoy this anime in it's entirety very much.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4\\n\r\nI tried so hard to like this anime, I really did. There was hardly any character development and the art made it difficult to even watch. If you want to get into DRAMAtical Murder, I really would not recommend watching the anime first. Play the games, and if you want to see how vastly superior the games are to it's anime adaptation, then go ahead.\\n",

I am one of the fandom of Dmmd and when i saw the announcement of the anime i was happy and also scared. Why? Because i have seen what they did to Togainu no chi. But i was expecting that nitro+chiral realized about the quality of their last anime and they would fixed it, i was wrong... VERY WRONG.\r\nStory: (3)\r\nI have one question,if you had a visual novel that is a hentai, and it's very famous because of his scenes +18, would you remove all the hentai to make a simply anime of romance? I would not. Dramatical murder is a HARD YAOI, you can't remove all the yaoi stuff and make it an only shonen ai anime... \\n\r\nI know that the history in the visual novel is good and very entertaining, but in the anime they destroy the story mixing all the routes, it seems like Aoba is a slut who have five hot boys at home in love with him and they don't even realize that the others are also in love with Aoba. \\n\r\nArt: (2)\\n\r\nWhy? Why dmmd that is characterized by having one of the most beautiful art in the yaoi visual novels had to finish like this?\\n\r\nPoor animation, with a horrible attempt to reach the art of the visual novel. Also, it contains errors that makes you want to facepalm, like the young Aoba with brown hair. Really, was that necessary?\\n\r\nSound: (4)\\n\r\nI didn't really care about the sound, but it was decent.\\n\r\nCharacters: (5)\\n\r\nThe characters were mediocre because we can't see a lot of them in the anime, but their stories are very sad, beautiful and they are totally worth it to read in the visual novel. But in the anime, the stories of every character are showed in a very short time and i didn't enjoyed it like in the novel.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (2)\\n\r\nI almost dropped the anime at the episode 3, but i continued it because i wanted to see what they were doing with one of my favorites visual novel. I watched all the anime bored and in the same time very angry. \\n\r\nOverall: (3)\\n\r\nDon't misunderstand me, i really love dramatical murder, i am one his enormous fandom, but, that's why i am so severe with the anime. I was expecting something that i could remember for years and i would like to re watch and re watch again like the novel, but it totally disappointed me.\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review.",

            "content": "DRAMAtical murder is a masterpiece.\r\nDespite the fact that this anime is based on a BL game, it was completely  normal, without BL scenes, and i'm glad about it.\r\nAs a 12-episode anime, i expected that it would not have a completed plot, that it would not give importance to the characters and it would just be in hurry. But no, everything was in a perfect quantity and quality.\r\nTo be more exact:\r\nPLOT:10 \r\nThe plot is interesting and enought to fill these 12 episodes of perfection.\r\nCHARACTERS:10  \r\nThe best part of the anime. All of the characters have something special, as special as their past. Each ofthem has a personality which makes you love them, and they are showing you how strong the bonds of friendship can be. All of the characters have a special bond with Aoba and that makes the anime one of the best. Each character has an episode dedicated to him, so that the viewers can develop their opinion about them, understand their importance for the story and make at least one of them their favourite, the one who makes the difference.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:10\\n\r\nThe sound is perfect. During the 'Rhyme', during the fights, even during the silent moments, and of course the little details. \\n\r\nI think the best part of sound is the 'Jellifish song', the song Clear likes to sing. It's a unique melody, full of feelings, a detail but at the same time a jewel in the anime, all sung by an amazing voice (I really want to congratulate the producers for this song)\\n\\n\r\nART:10\\n\r\nThe delight i took from art can't be explained with simple words. Everything is planned with a unique way, especially the characters. They are all so beautiful, Aoba, Clear, Koujaku, Ren, Rei and even Noiz, despite the fact that he is full of piercings, i think that he is one of the most handsome men in the anime. Being able to make all the characters so handsome and cute is such a great accomplishment for an anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, DRAMAtical murder is an anime with amazing characters, all important with their own way, helpfull and kind. Their personality, combined with the art makes them to stand up, the plot linked them and made this anime one of my top 5.\\n\r\nI find it disturbing that the players of the game say bad things about this anime, only because it has not BL in it. \\n\r\nSo, I recommed it to the ones who don't like the game, and of course anyone else who likes cute and emotional characters and an interesting plot.",

Great story line, excellent character development throughout the series, and an interesting bunch of personalities all around. \r\nThe only thing disappointing is I believe this anime would of been better with 25 episodes instead. \r\nI feel that things were slightly rushed since originally this was a game before the anime and manga adaptation. \r\nThe game is a lot darker, touchy-feely, and longer than the anime, but I can appreciate that since it's suppose to appeal to a wider audience than just BL/or Yaoi fan-girl.\r\nOverall,amazing anime totally worth watching!",

            "content": "Firstly, this is a pretty short anime- only 12 episodes. It only took me one day to finish it, but to be honest, I don't know what I just watched;;\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story itself isn't that bad. Aoba's special ability was quite original (correct me if I'm wrong please- this is just based on the anime I've watched). However, the story was quite big. Although the idea was decent, I felt like 12 episodes wasn't enough to go into enough detail.\r\nEven after I finished watching it, it just felt like a storm passed super quickly- too much to process in only 12 episodes.\r\nOH! and I reallyliked the futuristic setting with the super advanced technology. That was really interested. I wish I had an allmate.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAHAAHAHA you have to admit.... the characters were pretty good looking. I guess they were a bit bland with no special or unique feature; but, at least they were nicely drawn~ I also really liked how Aoba's grandma was drawn! She kind of reminded me of a toned down version of Dola from Laputa!!\\n\r\nThe background was nicely drawn too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nThe sound actually put me off after the first episode. The OP felt quite out of place, and even after 12 episodes, I still don't like it. But I guess that's just my personal opinion. The background music and sound effects didn't really support the plot. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good- it was just decent enough to bear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThey were gooooood looking~ Despite only being 12 episodes long, there was a fair amount of character development. This is probably because each episode seemed to be focused around Aoba getting to know the characters (you'll find out what this means when you watch the anime).\\n\r\nMost of the characters weren't well developed enough for me to get emotionally attached. But, they all had likeable personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe anime was decent. The story started out slow, but progressed faster towards the end. I don't know how to word this... it was enjoyable but not? The ideas were fresh and interesting. But, if I had a whole queue of anime to watch, this one would be my lowest priority.\\n\r\nI guess I only finished it because it was 12 episodes and seemed like a quick anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThere are probably people who like it and people who don't. If you're into hot guys, technology, and a tiny bit of supernatural(?) then try watching it :) BUT! don't just walk away after the first episode. Like I said, the story starts of slow.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I just found out that it's based off a BL visual novel. I wish they had more romance in the anime :( There was no romance whatsoever... kind of disappointing;;",

            "content": "This is my first review ever, so be warned I'm new to this stuff\r\nAs a person who has played the Visual Novel and is a fan of it, when I heard DRAMAtical Murder (DMMD) was getting an anime adaptation I was quite excited. Well I'm just gonna get straight to the review\r\nStory: \r\nI am a huge sucker for mystery/game anime and DMMD definitely caught my interest. I've also never quite seen a concept as interesting has this in a while. Though by the end of the show, anime-only watchers are pretty much guaranteed to be confused and would have to go to the source materialto answer unresolved issues. An 8 is really pushing my bias but it'll do.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nOh NAZ, how you messed up the beauty of the game. Although NAZ did stay close to the original designs of characters they felt very sloppy. Close up shots were fine, but zoom out to show a group of people and everything looks like they got some kindergartner to trace over the original art. Animation however, was pretty much horrendous. NAZ can barely pull off decent animation with one show, but they decided to jump the train and animation DMMD and Re:_Hamatora, which was a huge mistake. Before they attempt this they need bigger budgets and more effort. One compliment I will give to the animation is the use of CGI in the show. It generally fits in and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, which is quite the feat in anime. Mediocre at best, with a 5.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is one of the better aspects of the show. A variety of electronic/techno tracks done by GoatBed, who if you did not know made the original music for the VN, along with few orchestral pieces really fit the show. Although I can't recall many of them they set the moods for their respective scenes and didn't feel out of place. The opening was ok, and requires a specific taste to enjoy, and the endings overall were pretty nice, especially during the episodic part of the show. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n12 episodes is not enough to develop the large cast this show has, and hindered the show a lot. While some characters got nice development such as Aoba, Ren, and Clear, most of the cast was left behind and never really changed. I'm not saying that only the 3 previously mentioned are the only ones who developed, but those three got the amount they needed. This is honestly where my bias comes in the most because despite the fact the characters were pretty much horrible, I still liked them. None of them (with the exception of Mink) were annoying or disliked by me but they didn't really go out of their way to develop the cast. 24 episodes would've brought this score up for sure. A fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBias. The one reason I liked this show as much as I do. The show was pretty much a train wreck, but for a VN reader I enjoyed it much more than I should had. I was waiting for some of my favorite scene from the VN to be animated and squealed when they finally showed up. Probably wouldn't rewatch, but sure did enjoy it all the way through. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDRAMAtical Murder is not an anime for anyone, and will mostly appeal to those who have gone through the VN. However I suggest you give DMMD a try if:\\n\r\n-You like a nice mystery\\n\r\n-You don't mind bad animation\\n\r\n-You like Free!, mostly because of all the yaoi undertones in both shows.\\n\r\nI would suggest you stay away from this anime if:\\n\r\n-You like having well developed characters\\n\r\n-You mind being confused the entire way through\\n\r\n-You must require good animation\\n\r\n-Bishies are not your thing.\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10 from a critical standpoint but if my enjoyment were to be factored in the score would go up to a 7/10, but I still give it a 9/10 on my personal list, just because I enjoyed it that much.",

            "content": "Let's get logged into a futuristic cyber world where gangs and mind controllers control the universe along with the \"Blue Fox\" : \"Aoba Seragaki\" and his friends as he saves his homeland(island) from an incoming cyber attack. \r\nStory: Frankly this type of a futuristic story is very hard to combine no doubt that the mangaka and the producers succeeded on that. You see this blue haired cute dude in a futuristic pair of boots, on the first impression he looks strong and a lone wolf but not essentially. He works in a Junk Shop to fair for his grandma and himself. Little did he knowthat some of the gangs in the area is being threatened by a combo called \"Morphine\" which progresses the story from there. The story is so confusing at first- it took me about 4 episodes to accumulate what's going on but in the end you get used to it. There's that RPG feeling in there, you have those fancy shops and colours, robotic familiars and etc which brings out many nostalgic feelings i had from  PC game called \"Remember me\". This one has some awesome plot twists which usually lefts you curious at the end of the episode. Most people left the audience since it was Yaoi i expect? However don't confuse friendships with men as Shounen Ai nor Yaoi- men too get emotional and need men to men hugs LOL (just kidding i dunno really hehe)\\n\\n\r\nArt:It is superb- i just loved Aoba's suit and shoes and his hair style. The pink headphones merges well with it. All characters are drawn perfectly to suit their personalties or martial art or cyber obsession. Although i noticed that some stereotypical character's were altered no doubt to give more \"fanservice\" however i wouldn't conclude that disappointing. The artistic flare in here was creative just like in \"Karneval\" but even more than compared to it. All the needed creative elements to fabricate a cyber story is in here. The battle art looked common but still interesting. I liked very much how the scenery had been drawn it's so calm and serene. I liked the Outro to the next episode very much- those multitude of voices playing and text screening at the same time shows how the mind can function when it's distracted. \\n\\n\r\nSound:Music was done by Hayashi Yuki who created superb emotional piano pieces and other tracks to suit the mood of certain events in this anime.(He also did Diabolik Lovers) The Seiyus did extremely well on this although at some point you feel that all voices are same except for Aoba and Sei. The Openings and Endings suits the story and the atmosphere completely more than it should have which makes it appetizing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:I liked that Aoba's character. It was such a normal every day character which you \"Want\" to see everyday and that he has an ulterior personality which is totally unpredictable. His peers are unique with unusual talents and tragedian pasts- without giving out spoilers it's hard to describe the intensity as Aoba somehow gets involved with them, personally inside their own tainted emotional states. Since this is futuristic no doubt that you find robots- the special sensual thing i noticed in the main chara is that he never makes anybody lonely, never discriminates anybody just because they don't have relative human bodies. Characters like Koujaku should be appreciated since those personalties represents or give out true friendship which in most cases our whole world lacks. This unique clash of personalties clashing together creates an ultimate story to put it simply.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm going to give this an 8, As I did very much enjoy it. You don't find that many enjoyable anime these days with all the stuff going on is relatively superb like the story, usually at some point the story goes good but the music or the art sucks- and that looses a point. This show would have been more famous if it had a twenty four or more episodes. The awesomeness oozes from the 8 or 9th episode. Most of them left me in uncontrollable tears. The first few episodes gives out Aoba's life- it's so calm and well \"normal\"  it gives out that change than other anime- instead of anything out of the place happening i enjoyed the easy paces episodes so much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Aoba's compassion is so majestic that you think kindness at least \"exists\" in the anime world. The whole setting is philosophical- Ren- means restraint whilst Noise\" and Clear\" are totally opposites. \"Rhyme\" is also somewhat involved here. \"Morphine\" is a drug which implicit painlessness. Combine them together and you get them as as sources of distraction and elements of calming the mind(you'll understand how mind is important after you've watched this) Anyway this one of those anime which you want to cuddle with on a Saturday night sipping a mug of coffee(however on my case i drank medicine while watching this- Still added the required taste. There's a Visual Novel of this- i guess it's worth playing depending that the anime is good and was abled to satisfy the audience. Since There was a controversy that it was \"Yaoi\" didn't see 75% of Yaoi in the anime- there were let's-make-it-yaoi BUT stay-neutral elements in here, I don't know about the Visual Novel- so play it to know that!",

But, after months of procrastinating I finally finished it and I must say; It was kind of mediocre.\r\nI give this Anime: A six.\r\nBecause of the lack of good animation, the mediocre work put into it and some of the art in the anime looks really strange.Compared to the game, I actually liked the art in the game. Oh and... Let's not forget the lack of: ROMANCE!\\n\\n\r\nBut, the characters and music was really good. Took a bit of time to get out of my \"what-the-hell-are-you\" moment, when I first saw the characters. But after I played the game and watched all of those letplays of it: DRAMAtical Murder is now my favorite yaoi game.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime unfortunately is a whole other story. I loved the characters, voiceacting and the music wasn't bad either, since I enjoy techno and dubstep. But the overall work put into the Anime's animation and plotline, is a complete joke.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score for this Anime, is a six.",

The animation was sometimes laughably bad, but hey what do you expect. I've mainly given up on BL game anime adaptions (Togainu no Chi, and now this), since I feel like they never have the budget they really deserve to actually make it good. If you're new to DMMD and like the generalgist of it, I'd highly recommend you play the games (though beware they are quite graphic, especially compared to this anime). I think the only reason I gave this series a \"decent\" rating was that I actually knew what was going on since I played the first game before watching the series. Otherwise i'd be so clueless.",

            "content": "I had low expectations of DRAMAtical Murder going into it. I was expecting it was going to be average, maybe even above that. Well, it didn't even do that much. I'm going to do my best to be fair in this review, but this anime is VERY rough around the edges. Let me try to explain.\r\nThe story of DRAMAtical has some serious problems. To begin with, the story has no rising action, or climax to speak of. At no point was I excited or blown away by where the story was going, or what it was trying to do. There are a lot of characterswhose main purpose is to deliver plot. DRAMAtical Murder does a lot of \"Tell, don't show.\" There were moments of potential, but never go any further beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of DRAMAtical Murder is probably its strongest point. The art style isn't bad to look at. It does lack its own flair and style, but as a viewer, it certainly wasn't ugly. Animation wise though, this anime is very lacking. The action scenes are poorly directed, making it hard to tell what exactly is going on. The show also relies on CGI in heavy action scenes. They try to hide the CGI with characters moving fast with a lot of flashy explosions, which again makes it hard to follow. In terms of actual animation, there isn't a lot in the actual show. There is a lot of scenes with characters being completely still and just moving their mouths. There were also a few scenes where the characters were running, but looked very strange and inhuman. Overall, the art style is fine at best, with animation leaving much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall sound direction of the show is alright. The music works for this kind of show, but nothing memorable. It just simply does it job. \\n\r\nWhen discussing the sub and dub of this anime, the choice is easy. I watched about half in sub and half in dub. If you are going to watch this, don't even try the dub. Don't. The dubs voice acting is mediocre at best, but the big issue is the writing. Some scenes seriousness or tension is completely destroyed by the clown show that the writing of the dub delivers. Watch the sub, as it is better in every way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime... oh boy. Most are flat, uninteresting, which surprises me to be honest as most of them get DECENT development. Everyone in the main group gets one episode dedicated to them. These episodes were appreciated in making our main cast more human. The problem though is the way the anime handles actually handling these scenes. Basically, our main character mind-fu**s them and helps them with the power of friendship. OH, and the \"friendship\" in this anime is often forced at times. Most of the main cast has no chemistry, and often feels very fake and rushed. The main character literally gets beat and assaulted a number of times by one of his \"friends\" and he just takes it. SORRY, WHAT? And then later on they become homies and go on missions together. I don't understand how this group of pretty men formed this \"Yaoi Force.\" \\n\r\nWe havn't even gotten to the villains yet. Well, surprise surprise, they also are awful. The main bad guy is your average I'M EVIL BECAUSE I WANT POWER AND MONEY. Other villains include uninteresting henchmen, or enemy gangs whose soul purpose is to move the plot forward while not bringing anything new or interesting to the table. Needless to say, the characters of DRAMAtical Murder need significant changes. \\n\\n\r\nSo as you can probably tell, I didn't like this anime. I actually fell asleep during an episode I was so uninterested and bored. This is only the second anime to do that, the first being DragonBall GT. I actually kinda liked that more to be honest.\\n\r\nAnyway, getting back on topic, I don't recommend anyone watches this anime. There are plenty of BETTER shows out there that deserve your time. \\n\r\nThis concludes my review of DRAMAtical Murder. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! If you have any positive or negative feedback regarding the writing of this review, please feel free to send me a message. Id appreciate it.",

            "content": "I remember when I heard they were going to make an adaptation on DRAMAtical Murder, me and the entire BL fanbase+other people were buzzing with the news and it easily became the most anticipated anime of summer 2014.\r\nHonestly, I was disappointed. Not that I was expecting anything.\r\nThe story [6]\r\nit was good. Seeing how I played the game, I saw where they were headed with the show but everything felt rushed, while the beginning was a bit of a drag (the game's beginning was also a bit slow). A whole ending with each characters was sandwiched between each episode. It would have flowed better if theywere given more room between each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters [5]\\n\r\nThey didnt give us enough time to really get to know the characters better. With one episode to meet them, have them appear popping up in places, and one episode for their back story; there wasnt enough screen time for each character to fully soak in with the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation [3]\\n\r\nWere lacking in some places. The parts where it required many different frames (ex: running/fight scenes/etc.) were half arsed through. Animation was not flowy, art wasnt consistent and overall rushed.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/sound/voices/etc [7]\\n\r\nI respect the producer's choice of another song by goatbed giving the anime the same feeling as the game but I didnt really like it. Slight disappointment with behind-the-gas-mask- voice but that was based off personal preference and bless the producers for keeping the voices the same as the game.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment[7] \\n\r\n It was so bad it was good\\n\\n\r\nI tried not to compare it to the game that much (I loved the game) If I could, I would've marked it a 6.5. Adaptation wasnt as bad as what I expected (*cough* togainu no chi *cough*) it does the game no justice but it was fun. I suggest if you really are interested, play the game.",

            "content": "An easy review of DRAMAtical Murder-- SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment!\r\nOVERALL--\r\nDRAMAtical Murder is adapted from a visual novel. As is the case with many VN to anime adaptions, the anime rushes as it tries to incorporate information from all of the various VN routes. With only 12 episodes, DRAMAtical Murder struggles in its development of both characters and the overall world. This leads to a slightly lackluster ending, with characters you really wish you could have known better. Still, I found it fairly enjoyable overall and would say it's worth watching since it's a quick 12 episodes. It's not amazing, but it's not as terribleas some people suggest.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY--\\n\r\nDRAMAtical Murder presents viewers with what could have been a very interesting story; unfortunately, it fails to fully take shape in only 12 episodes. It takes about 8 episodes before you actually begin to grasp the main conflict, and just when that conflict should begin to expand, the show is winding towards a quick conclusion. The story in itself is strong, but the anime fails to portray that in the time it is given. The ending left me asking, \"That was all there was to it?\" as I had hoped for greater depth and development. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS--\\n\r\nAll of the characters have great designs with lots of detail and personality. I found each of them fun to watch and listen to. They also had very diverse personalities that seemed promising. Sadly, the little character development that happens in the show occurs so quickly that it doesn't really feel meaningful. These characters are ones you WANT to care about, but the show doesn't really give you the time to form strong attachments to them. \\n\\n\r\nPROS--\\n\r\n+ Interesting character designs (with lots of good looking boys!)\\n\r\n+ Compelling story idea\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack is fitting of the futuristic setting\\n\r\n+ Enjoyable voice actors\\n\r\n+ Bright, colorful animation (but pretty low-budget)\\n\\n\r\nCONS--\\n\r\n- Story is underdeveloped and could have benefitted from 24 episodes rather than 12 \\n\r\n- Climax is rushed and ending conflict is pretty vanilla\\n\r\n- No good explanation of the setting/world of the story\\n\r\n- No meaningful character development\\n\r\n- Took the L outta BL (the VN is BL)",

It went by a little too fast for something like the plot of DMMD to be mushed altogether in 13 episodes. The characters were displayed alright, but they had more in them than presented. It felt lacking for characters like Koujaku and Mink. It felt like they favored Clear and Noiz the most to present.\r\nBeing someone who also has played the game, it was just nice to see my favourite otome game animated. I made fun of the animemore than enjoyed it for the way I enjoy other anime. I still liked DRAMAtical Murder as an anime but would recommend anyone interested in watching this to play the game before or even after watching the anime for a better understanding. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I liked it mainly for the fact its based off my favourite game. The studio could have done so much better in animating such a popular Visual novel. There was definitely disappointment, but I don't hate it.",

            "content": "On the one hand, I disliked this anime....and on the other, I liked it sort of. The main issue with this anime is the plot/storyline. Early on, it seemed to be going somewhere interesting and then it sort of veered off and tried to have a lot of twists and turns that winded up not making much sense or were way too transparent. When it finally decides to get back to the main plot, it feels a bit....weak. The idea is good but for an anime of only 12 episodes, you need to utilize all the episodes you have and not try to rush thingsin a few episodes. The final battle leaves a lot to be desired...in fact it is rather anticlimactic and there were, imo, far better battles early on in the season. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this anime does excel, for the most part anyway, is the characters. All 5 of the main characters are incredibly interesting. Aoba, is the lead, and he isn't my favorite but he is compassionate and compelling enough where you want to root for him.\\n\\n\r\nMink to me is the character who is sort of one dimensional in his time on the screen. Even with a backstory and development, Mink left more to be desired but at the same time he has the most defined and structured personality of all 5 mains.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter 3 are my favorites and precisely why I loved this anime, despite the poor storyline.\\n\\n\r\nClear is the standout because he is so eccentric and just...a freak. From his initial intro and his overall look, this dude just leaves an impression on you and I loved Clear so much. Especially with his backstory...Clear is my boo.\\n\\n\r\nKoujaku was someone I was a bit eh with at first but as the season went on, I grew to love him. His loyalty and dedication to Aoba is what compelled me to care but his backstory cut my deep and I was ready to jump into my screen and hug him. Such a big teddy bear hidden underneath such angst and aggression.\\n\\n\r\nBut Noiz...Noiz is my favorite and the best. He is not one of many words but his actions and mannerisms are precisely what make Noiz so interesting. As you learn more about him, you get to see why he is the way he is. I loved every scene with him and out of the 5, Noiz is definitely the most defined and multifaceted character with Koujaku and Clear as a close 2nd.\\n\\n\r\n(Ren is also a standout as well even if he is not my favorite).\\n\\n\r\nReally watch this anime for the characters. Ignore the plot...half the time it doesn't make sense and the other half it feels rushed. I would watch again just for the characters and I wish for a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a hint of boy's love/shounen-ai romance...It was established early on literally in one scene(a kiss) and then never mentioned again. Which was disappointing really.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are more subtle boy's love moments between the characters as well throughout the season. But this could have been way better had they just let them go for it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I rated it highly in spite of its story and it wasn't a bad watch....just not a something i'd easily say was one of my favorites.",

The anime was a letdown, and it didn't pay tribute to the original story. That's obvious. But it upsets me because VN's aren't as popular or accessible as anime, and there are so many people who will miss outon the genius of the series because of that. But to anybody with even an inckling of interest in the series, PLEASE, I implore you to check out the games. Even if it's just watching a let's play, I guarantee that it's so much better than what the anime showed it to be.\\n\\n\r\nI love DRAMAtical Murder. I have for a very long time, and I'm sure that I will continue to for years to come. A disappointing anime adaptation won't change that. Although the series may have ended, I'm holding out a little hope that we may have some new games or even a new anime adaptation in the future. This series deserves it.",

            "content": "In terms of a standalone anime, the show certainly leaves a lot to be desired, but in terms of adapting a visual novel and trying to cram in one million storylines into twelve episodes, it was surprisingly successful.  Not entirely successful, mind, but certainly successful enough to make you raise your eyebrows a little.\r\nI'm not gonna lie, I enjoyed this show.  I am not familiar with the games, but I found myself following the plot and worldbuilding reasonably well.  I thought a lot more could have been done with the (surprisingly very cool) sci-fi setting, but the anime seems to have avoidedexpansion in favor of following the games as closely as possible.  This might not have been the greatest artistic choice considering the game is meant to be replayed with multiple storylines building on one another, therefore rendering it almost impossible to squish everything into a single linear plot, but hey, I'm not the producer.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average, the story cohesive but by the skin of its teeth, the music forgettable.  However, what sold me on this show was the characters.  I liked them!  I even liked their ridiculous outfits!  They don't fit entirely neatly into preset character tropes, or at the very least they burst forth from those tropes in a gaudy and original fashion.  I found the relationships between Aoba and the other gents compelling, and the show did a good job of showcasing all the available \"options\" although never quite getting particularly romantic with any of them.  It's weird that the smuttiness of the games was toned down to this downright celibate level, but in terms of treating all shippers as equal under the eyes of Anime Adaptation, the show succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing escalates to a frantic fever pitch as you can just about see the writers desperately trying to tie up one million loose ends in the last ten minutes, but I walked away more or less satisfied.  I think it works as a more PG-13 entry onto these fun characters and this world... albeit why that seemed like a necessary addition to a smut game is one of the world's great mysteries.",

The game is very NSFW -Not Safe For Work- for it has R18+ content. The anime itself, is very Shounen-Ai like so there aren't any R18+ scenes. Also, romance isn't the genre of this anime, there may be hints of it, but it isn't. When i say DRAMAtical MURder is a BL, I mean it as in the game, the characters are $!&#*^# Aoba's ass. \r\nThe anime is very hard to understand in the beginning, but it doesn't mean it's bad. Most anime based fromdating sims aren't clear, only because they want you to buy the full game to understand the plot and for the NSFW content. \\n\\n\r\nStory | 07\\n\r\n     I found it interesting that certain areas of the city has game zones where people fought each other. Because I am a Yaoi fan, I started to immediately ship NOIZ x CLEAR instead of shipping the main character with anyone xD hehe ^^ The story wasn't badly written, there were just gap holes in certain episodes and was left off with a cliff hanger. This was solely for the purpose that you buy the game instead.\\n\\n\r\nArt | 09\\n\r\n     I really liked how the characters looked like, with the exception of Aoba, he was eh not my type :C Everything is simplistic and nothing is extremely detailed. This anime focuses more on the action rather than the visuals, for once again, visuals are found better in the game. \\n\\n\r\nSound | 06\\n\r\n     The sound was not the best nor blandly played. It was alright for such a short anime; though it could've been better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter | 08\\n\r\n     My favorite characters are Noiz, Clear, and Virus. I couldn't come to like Aoba, Aoba is very uke [not going to explain this term], he's submissive and relies on his friends a lot. There really isn't any character development in the anime nor any romantic developments, just hints. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment | 09\\n\r\n     I did enjoy the anime very much and am planning to get the game someday ~ As aforementioned, the anime itself isn't bad, it was just created that way to market the game. So all these bad reviews are bleh. Either BL is your cup of tea or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, just give this anime a try. There's really nothing you're losing to watching this ofc if you're not into BL.",

One scene Aoba would be in his room, and the next he was downstairs having an argument with Noiz and Clear--like where did they come from? How did they get into your house? WHere is your GRANDMOTHER?  This was what happened to me throughout majority of the series, I was asking an unholy ammount of questions that just were never answered at all.\\n\\n\r\nI would say the sound was the best aspect of the show, and i'm only giving that to the opening (God damn I love the opening soundtrack) as for the rest of it, it's pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I highly recomend NOT watching UNLESS you have played the games.",

I haven\u2019t played the game but I\u2019ve seen some other people play it and it looked pretty \u2018\u2019promising\u2019\u2019.\r\nI\u2019ve seen some scenes from the game and I was pretty dissapointed when they didn\u2019t appear in the anime. Of course some scenes might\u2019ve been 18+ but they could\u2019ve at least added some \u2018action\u2019 (if you know what I mean) into the anime.\r\nThe anime compared to the game is seriously NOTHING.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story wasn\u2019t that bad but was sometimes a bit confusing forme (probably because I skipped certain parts and missed out on a few things) and maybe a bit too much for only 12 episodes. I wasn\u2019t expecting an anime with 30/40 episodes but I think that if they would\u2019ve made the anime 20/25 episodes long that then the story might\u2019ve been more clear and easier to follow. Because right now I\u2019m still trying to figure out what I just watched and what actually happened. (luckily I\u2019ve seen a few parts from the game so that helped me understand a bit better)\\n\r\nLet\u2019s compare the game to the anime: the game has more happenings and the story becomes clear troughout the game unlike in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI really liked the futuristic touch and all of the advanced technologies in both the game and the anime.\\n\r\nI aslo liked how the characters were made. It\u2019s an original style (my opinion. I haven\u2019t seen any animes in the same style as DMMd) but after watching some people play the game I saw that the style between the game and the anime was completely different. (again, my opinion) \\n\r\nBut: sometimes the movements of the characters (mainly with Ren) their expressions and their build are slightly weird and/or anatomicaly incorrect.\\n\r\nLastly, I think that the scenery (background, buildings, ...) looked pretty good and also with a slight futuristic touch to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI think the seijuu\u2019s did a good job. The voices fit the characters perfectly. They sound exactly the same as in the game and exactly how I\u2019d expect.\\n\r\nNot much to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nLet\u2019s all be honest for once and say that the characters are pretty hot. \\n\r\nEven though the anime was quite short we all get to know who the different characters were, what they did, how they acted, etc. but not all characters got described evenly/enough. The anime mainly focuses around Aoba getting to know all of the characters but he mainly hangs out with Clear, Koujaku, Mink, Ren and Noiz. It feels like the other characters are left behind.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching it but at the same time I did not. It feels as if I got my hopes up for nothing. \\n\r\nIt was a good anime but I think that I\u2019ll have had more fun playing the game than watching the anime. Why? Because hardly anything happens in the anime. I was hoping for some guy x guy action but the only thing that happened was Noiz kissing Aoba once. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nYou like boy x boy? Yaoi? Or just shounen-ai?\\n\r\nYou might think that the anime will be the same as the game but guess what? It isn\u2019t.\\n\r\nThe game has lots of boy x boy scenes and content. Wich, surprisingly, the anime doesn\u2019t. The only moment something actually happens between Aoba and another character is when Noiz kisses him. That\u2019s it.\\n\r\nLuckily the art and character design were good because else I don\u2019t know if this anime would\u2019ve get the points I gave it now.",

There wasn't enough explanation on plenty of things, and not enough screen time to explain them, so I didn't even understand some plot points until they were relevant enough to be explained. Even the end wasn't explained enough, and there wasn't enough closure to leave me satisfied.\r\n What drew me to the show in the first place was the color and character design. I knew nothing about the show except for the character variety, they were all very unique, whichhelped pull me in to watch it. I haven't read the VN, but after seeing plenty of positive reviews that it had more content and it wasn't as rushed, I'm definitely considering taking time to read it. How color was used pulled me in and I enjoyed the contrast of vibrant vs muted colors. \\n\\n\r\nI was supremely disappointed by the soundtrack. While there were good musical moments, like the Jellyfish Song and plenty of the OST's, the OP was not one of them. The animation was sloppy and the music was one of the worst OP songs I've come by. Even within the first couple measures, there was an incredibly awkward change in the music. The music has no direction and I couldn't understand it's musical stake. The OP's purpose is to excite you and get you ready to watch the show, yet, I found myself stuck to the subtitles and not sure if the translations were fake or not since the lyrics were so ridiculous and/or cryptic.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED wasn't much better. Yes, it did change with the other characters becoming relevant to Aoba in episodes 6-9, I believe? But I enjoyed those much better. Those songs had much more vocality and direction, as opposed to the ED that played most of the time. The character ED's had a very simple, yet noticeable art style. It tried to get the tech vibe, but failed to make a song that even sounded remotely pleasant. And again with the ridiculous lyrics, they don't make any sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show and there are some minor and some major things that distracted me, yet they didn't detract from it being enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThis review was a little quick, so if you're confused by any of my reasoning or really anything, shoot me a message.",

            "content": "(I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road)\r\nThis whole anime was undoubtedly rushed. In the first episode, all the main characters were introduced and the viewer was thrown into a story that was not explained. I found myself asking \"WTH am I even watching, what's the whole point of this anime\"? \r\nStory line- There was none. I felt that there were multiple plots in the story that just didn't make sense. It was like they were making it up as the story went along withno clear direction. They assume that the viewer should already know the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was highly modern with bright colors everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nSound- I felt that the voice actors did a poor job on bringing the characters to life. It sounded like they were reading a script. The conversations just did not flow well in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- OMG these characters were so bland it's not even funny. There were no emotional connections between viewer or character. Certain episodes try to give some depth to characters but it was a failed attempt. It's just sad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- On a lighter note... I felt that there were some comedic parts of the anime which I liked. Nonetheless everything else fell flat. I just wanted it to be over. I felt that none of the genres connected together.... For example there were some shounen ai (boy love) parts in the anime that left me thoroughly confused. They basically through a whole bunch of stuff together which is just sad.",

What started with a lot of potential, ended up falling flat towards the 6th or 7th episode. I had high hopes since there seemed to be a good set of laws/rules that the characters abided by - I'm a stickler for this. More or less, the characters kept their form, but the story did not. \r\nAs far as the art goes - it was beautiful. Very well done, great looking characters, better looking scenery & overall a fun, light design that was fitting for the theme.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked was the opening song, which, again, fit the theme really well. Sound is a major pillar in this anime, so I'm sure the producers put a lot of energy into this. \\n\\n\r\nI really, really liked the characters. They were very \"believable\" & had their own personalities - everyone had a backstory that meshed in with their personas really well. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said... I did not enjoy this anime. Sure, it was pretty - but at a certain point you're just disappointed with what you end up with.",

When I saw the gameplay, (since i can't find where to download it.) and found out that they were going to make a anime after it, I couldn't wait for the smut and action to happen. So when I first saw the first epiosde, I though, \"Well, this is the first episode, I guess they need to take it slower.\" However, as I watched more and more episode, I realized they weren't going to put in the smut. Well, they kinda ruined the the actualgame for me. And when I found out that they only made an OVA to make it up, I kinda screamed. I really wanted to see the actual plot from the game animated and they do what I expected, I'm pretty disappoint, but I enjoyed it overall, I still wish they followed the actual plot though.",

            "content": "The first part of this review is spoiler free!\r\nI will say right up front that before you watch this anime, you should definitely read the BL visual novel first. Of course this complaint has existed as long as books have been made into movies or tv shows, and even manga into anime; it\u2019s simply impossible to recreate the exact kind of impact that an original format has.\r\nI think my favorite parts of the anime are the animation and the music... especially because they\u2019re the parts that most closely resemble the original. The world in which Dramatical Murder takes place is incredibly vibrant and fantastic, soit\u2019s great to see it coming to life. Even then, so much of it feels lackluster and rushed that it leaves me just wanting to reread the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nThey tried really hard to cram in as much as they could, compressing the story into tiny chunks which made the progression feel unnatural. It\u2019s not like most adaptations where time was taken to make sure the plot was paced correctly; it was more like they tried to fill an episode with entirely too much at once.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough you can watch Dramatical Murder on it\u2019s own and kind of understand what\u2019s going on, it really is in your best interest to enjoy the original (and even it\u2019s sequel, re:connect) before watching the anime. That being said, if you don\u2019t like yaoi but for whatever reason like incredibly strong sexual tension and a very misplaced plot, skip the novel and only watch the anime. Still, you will probably be really confused the whole time because the plot is speeded along.\\n\\n\r\nA prime example of this confusion comes from my boyfriend who knows nothing about Dramatical Murder. He watched part of an episode with me without any context, and any time two characters shared a moment on screen he made comments like \u201cWhy does it feel like they really want to bone?\u201d or \u201cWhy is he looking at that guy like he\u2019s a love interest?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, if you like a unique story and interesting characters but you don\u2019t want to commit to a long anime, it might be worth a try if you have nothing else to watch. It all comes down to the same thing though\u2026 just read the BL visual novel instead.\\n\\n\r\n!!! LIGHT SPOILERS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE OR HAVE NOT READ THE NOVEL !!!\\n\\n\r\nFor the spoilers part of the review, there isn\u2019t a whole lot to say. They seemed like they really wanted to show every route and that was pretty cool. Their intentions seemed honest, and that\u2019s okay\u2026 it was the execution that was problematic.\\n\\n\r\nEven if a little more time was taken to expand the plot, it would have been way better. I did like how the last episode still took the time to wrap up everyone\u2019s story, but that was the most fluid part of the anime to me. I really didn\u2019t like the intro\u2026 it just sounded weird. I was almost hoping they\u2019d just remake the intro from the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nIt was awesome that they animated scenes and poses straight from the visual novel. In the last episode when the camera lingered on the mirror while Aoba was helping Clear move into his place, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing! It felt like the studio was saying \u201cYeah, we know it was supposed to be a total bone-fest. We don\u2019t care! Neener!\u201d",
