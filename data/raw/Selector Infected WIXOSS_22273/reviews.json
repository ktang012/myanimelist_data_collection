            "content": "Wishes.\r\nIf you were in a competition in where you won, your wish would be granted, would you compete?  Knowing that there are other people who may have a more important or dire wish?  Is your wish more important than others?  Is it less important?\r\nDo you even have a wish?\r\nBefore going into this review, you will need to know what a Selector is.  In this series, there is a popular card game called WIXOSS.  Among the players, there are Selectors, people who are able to communicate with their LRIG, or the avatar of their deck.  The point of this partnership is for the LRIG to help the Selector become an Eternal Girl and have their dream, their desire or their wish fulfilled.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nWishes and desire and the dark undertone that comes with those two are used quite a lot in story telling.  This story is fairly predictable when it comes to the concept of despair and wishes.  Though, if you haven't expirenced much with this common story device, you will be in for a treat, as most people who see the dark side and consequences of wishes tend to enjoy the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOut story follows Ruuko, a standard character when it comes to these types of wish stories.  She is a character is couldn't be separated from the crowd prior to being a Selector.  By becoming a Selector and playing WIXOSS, she makes friends, she makes foes and she learns more about herself.  \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, do you need to know the rules of WIXOSS before watching?  \\n\r\nNOPE.  Not at all.  The anime's main focus when it comes to card battles are the emotion of the Selectors and the ending result, who wins or who loses.  The only concept you need to understand is that a deck is made to power up their LRIG.\\n\\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that this story isn't to surprising to those who have gone through stories related to the dark undertone of wishes.  It's very predictable and isn't too unique compared to other stories with a similar premise.  If you have not gone through a story that involved wishes and darkness, you will be in for a treat as WIXOSS is a great introduction to these types of stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nArt outside of battles is quite bland, with a lot of use of pale colors and grey.  All the backgrounds, all the foregrounds, use this type of bland coloring.  Is this bad?  Not entirely, as it gives a feel of emptiness, which does help deliver the dark undertone this anime has.  Was it required?  I feel like this coloring was a bit over done.  \\n\\n\r\nArt inside of battles were beautiful colors that faded into a never-ending darkness.  I could be a literature teacher about this and pull meaning out of nothingness, but I rather not.  I still enjoyed the art of the battles.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was great during battles, standard outside of them.  Hand to hand combat and the magical attacks that happened during battle all looked beautiful.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were pretty standard, though the designs for LRIGs were amazing.  Loved how they would look when they would power up.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhat an amazing OP, killy killy JOKER is one of my more favorite OPs of this season and one of my favorites of all time.  With an amazing chorus, it is hard not to get your head in the rhythm of the song, which is very similar to our main character, Ruuko.  She does the same thing during battles, and gets caught up in the hype of them.  The ED, realize -Yume no Matsu Basho-, is another beautiful piece that compliments the OP really well.\\n\\n\r\nOST?\\n\r\nWell.. again, outside of the battles, the soundtrack wasn't all too impressive.  It may have added to the feeling of emptiness, but again, it wasn't all that needed.  Songs used during the battles were all great!  Songs included DnB and dubstep, that all helped give the battles intensity without the songs being too absurd.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs I have said before, Ruuko is a very clean slate character, you will see her character develop as she meets other Selectors, as she wins battles, as she begins thinking of the questions I asked you at the beginning of this review.  She is quite the enjoyable character to watch.\\n\\n\r\nA great point in this anime is the relationship between our Selectors: Yuzuki, Akira, Hitoe and Iona.  Some are friends, some are foes, all have a wish they want granted.  These include some intense moments when we have our more important side characters battling each other knowing that their wishes are on the line.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this are the super side characters.... the nameless ones.  They are all terrible people with a terrible attitude and personality.  These are mainly nameless classmates whose only goal in the series is to cause tension and drama.  Sure it was enjoyable to see our main characters go through it, but the way they did it felt super forced.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nKeep in mind, I was coming into this series expecting it to be about cute girls and card games.  Boy was I surprised!  I was looking forward to some dark anime series during the spring season, Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Black Bullet and Akuma no Riddle.  WIXOSS blew all those series out of the water and another surprise series did the same thing this season.  I never expected this series to get dark.  \\n\\n\r\nI love love love how they handle card battles.  The no information needed to watch this show is amazing and I feel they handled that expertly!\\n\\n\r\nSuspense and intensity.\\n\r\nThe amount of suspense, the suspense in decision making, the suspense is revealing information, the suspense of wanting to know more, all of these add intensity to the series that keeps the viewer interested and wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWith a great ending that is an excellent follow up to a season two, the plot twists, the cute girls.  This was a surprise series that was an amazing to watch show. \\n\\n\r\nSome food for thought... what is girl backwards?",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS**\r\nNot many people know what to make of the Selector WIXOSS series. \u201cEh\u2026 it was okay I guess?\u201d seems to be the reaction of most people, and I think that can be largely attributed to the fact that it\u2019s so radically different from anything else in its genre; we\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. Anime fans simply aren\u2019t sure how to feel about a show centered around a card game that never even explains the rules of its own card game. While most anime in the card genre are about making every conceivable reward obtainable by means of saidchildren\u2019s card game (i.e. Yu-Gi-Oh), WIXOSS is about precisely the opposite: The ramifications of said card game. This show isn\u2019t about the glory and fame brought to those who win the game, it\u2019s about the pain and sorrow that the game brings to those who play it. WIXOSS takes the Gurren Lagaan-esque \u201cDo the impossible!\u201d attitude that you\u2019d normally see in this type of show and flips it entirely on its head, and that\u2019s what I love about it. Presenting the most overlooked anime of 2014: The Selector WIXOSS series\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: WIXOSS is a card game that's popular with teenagers; teenage girls especially. However, the seemingly innocent card game has a secret. There exist cards called \u201cLRIGs\u201d; cards that have actual people with wills of their own trapped inside them. Only \u201cspecial\u201d girls called Selectors can hear the voices of the LRIGs, allowing them to do battle in a dimension that other humans cannot access. It's said that whomever triumphs in these battles will have their greatest wish granted. Our story follows Ruko Kominato, the latest girl to find an LRIG. She names her card \u201cTama\u201d, and without any further explanation, is thrown into her new life as a Selector.\\n\\n\r\nIn case I haven\u2019t already made it obvious, WIXOSS is NOT an average entry into the card game genre. In fact, it can justifiably be called a deconstruction of its genre. It has a considerable amount of depth to it and discussing its themes without spoilers could be tricky, but I\u2019ll give it a shot. WIXOSS questions the very basis of achieving all of your wildest dreams by means of a higher power; it essentially examines the very basis of reaching all of your goals without directly facing the challenges that come along with those goals. Nearly every girl in the WIXOSS universe has a wish; a wish that they are convinced is impossible for them to realize without the limitless power of being a Selector. However, as is heavily foreshadowed, the deal isn\u2019t as sweet as it\u2019s made out to be. As the girl\u2019s grow more and more miserable, they realize that this means of obtaining their desires goes against the very nature of accomplishment. Some of them discover that they didn\u2019t want what they thought they wanted, some of them discover that what they wanted was within their reach the entire time, and others discover that they are happy with what already have after all. They don\u2019t find happiness and contentment because someone came along and waved magic wand; they find it through their own thought processes and experiences. This is just one of many of the masterfully executed themes in the WIXOSS series, all of which are evenly paced for the most part, expertly foreshadowed, and beautifully executed. WIXOSS not only manages to have deep and meaningful themes, but it manages to be entertaining at the same time. There are some seriously exciting and heart-throbbing moments that will \u201cWow\u201d you. That is no easy task, and it\u2019s perhaps the main reason I consider this show to be so underrated. All in all, this anime had a spectacular story despite the fact that it could have elaborated on certain plot points a bit more and given a bit more closure towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, are just as well written as the plot. While Ru, our protagonist, may be a bit bland, the rest of the cast is fleshed out, packed with personality, and legitimately complex. This is an extremely impressive feat given the sheer number of major characters that WIXOSS attempts to work with. From the humans to the LRIGs, nearly every single character is given proper motivations and a distinguishable personality. I\u2019ve never seen a show that\u2019s been able to do this with such a large cast and have it actually work until I watched WIXOSS. You WILL find at least one to grow attached too and you WILL become emotionally invested in the show as a result. The best part of this cast is that there are no clearly defined lines between good characters and evil characters (well, except for one character\u2026). Even the most seemingly cruel Selectors/LRIGs are sympathizable and have logical motives that back their actions up. My personal favorite character was Tama. Not only was she inhumanly adorable, she actually managed to have a complex personality and her actions carried massive thematic weight. I was literally cheering at my computer screen for Tama to prevail in times of peril. She is without a doubt an incredibly likable character. However, like I said, there are many more great characters to choose from.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll briefly touch on the fantastic soundtrack and the masterful use of animation before closing out: Starting with the OST, it never fails to get the job done. Its unique blend of new-age and orchestral tracks never fail to set the appropriate tone. Whether it be enhancing a saddening scene or pumping up an exciting scene, WIXOSS\u2019s OST covers the entire emotional spectrum. Add on the two incredible OPs and you have yourself an awesome soundtrack. However, the real highlight of this anime\u2019s presentation lies in the genius animation. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a confirmed sighting of VISUAL STORYTELLING! I know, shocking for a modern anime, but it\u2019s true. WIXOSS blew me away with some seriously genius symbolism, with the contrasts between light and dark being a central theme. Not only does WIXOSS accomplish the difficult task of conveying meaning without words, it can also be breathtakingly beautiful at times. Some of the imagination and planning put into a couple of these settings is absolutely remarkable. This is seriously some noteworthy animation, even if it isn\u2019t getting any attention.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Selector WIXOSS series is criminally underrated. Why seemingly nobody else can see how masterfully this show executed its main themes and ideas is beyond me, but I\u2019ll tell you one thing: this anime is a must-watch for psychological fans.  WIXOSS may not be perfect, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat, it will make you think, and it will dazzle you with its presentation. Honestly, what more do you want? Go watch it!",

            "content": "A card game about granting wishes. That\u2019s what Selector Infected WIXOSS is anyways. And judging by the cover, there isn\u2019t anything that seems too peculiar. That is until when the game actually begins. It\u2019s not a normal card game especially when there\u2019s a strange little girl who wants to battle and grant wishes for its owner. So now, it\u2019s a game about fighting to grant wishes through battles. This however turns into a nightmare for the girls learns what\u2019s at stake \u2013 an abominable and endless mind struggle against all odds.\r\nShort for the term (Wish-Cross), the game itself consists of card games and battles. Itmight seem strange to see girls getting taking interest in a game that would be in a guy\u2019s territory but nonetheless, the major of the shows\u2019 cast are female characters. One particular character named Ruuko sticks out as an anti-social yet friendly girl living together with her grandma in a seemingly normal family. It\u2019s fate that one day tied her to enter the world of WIXOSS, after discovering a magical girl that she nicknamed \u201cTama\u201d. And if you get tired of hearing the word \u2018battle\u2019 now, then brace yourself for what the show has to offer soon. Or rather already, the beginning unveils its darker image such as Ruuko\u2019s malevolent dreams. In that dream, it\u2019s clear to know what the show is trying to do \u2013 to pull out a dark show with a game with kids. But looking it from a different angle, the show also has a purpose. The games aren\u2019t just played for bragging rights but for granting wishes. It\u2019s from these wishes where the show emerges and mutates itself into a twisted journey, one that shatters the boundaries of the card game image. But is it worth it? In some ways, but also not mind shattering as it sounds.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious to see what director Takuya Sato is trying to do here. Similar to how Steins;Gate was directed, the show moves slow with the first few episodes introducing the premise and main characters. In fact, we find out the main characters are known as \u201cSelectors\u201d, who battles to fulfill their wish. What we don\u2019t know is what the true purpose of these wishes are and what\u2019s at stake until later. To say the least, a journey into this show requires patience. Even for a one cour-split (the second half to debut later), it requires explanation. And by that, the show pulls out its classy mechanics by showing rather than telling. Here\u2019s where a technical problem comes in. While the game matches looks flashy and aberrant, they lack interest values when it comes to gameplay. Hardly anything is actually explained by the card battles itself. Whether it\u2019s the battle moves, strategies, or rules, the series focuses much more on its psychological psyche. In other words, the show\u2019s aim is to let the audience know more about the characters rather than the game itself. When you see a battle, more times or not, it\u2019s more likely you will be paying more attention to the characters rather than the game itself. Although that works out somewhat, the mechanics and focus on the game is lost with incoherent explanations, ones that can be easily forgotten simply because it lacks interest.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the interest should come to the main characters right? Well, not exactly if we take a closer look. The fighters known as the LRIG(girl spelt backwards) are mostly mindless and serves little purpose than doing battle for their Selectors. Of course, none of them receive any character development or emphasis besides their highlight reels during gameplay. But for the characters, they aren\u2019t far better when it comes to characterization. We already have the shy girl with Ruuko and really, there\u2019s nothing distinctive about her. On the other hand though, there\u2019s Ruuko\u2019s friend Yuzuki who has the social personality, looks, and empowerment to make friends easily. But what you don\u2019t know is her secret, or rather her wish that can be viewed as \u2018forbidden\u2019. And because the show has its psychological shenanigans, the story actually focuses on her progress with some rather disturbing results. It doesn\u2019t stop there though as we also meet the two-faced girl, Akira Aoi with a sadistic ambition. In the same line of work is also Iona, a girl with a lust for battle but unlike Akira, she is usually calm and confident in her skills. On the other hand, there\u2019s Hitoe Uemura, a girl who just wants to make friends. Together, they make up the main composition of the series\u2019 cast, or rather Selectors. But what\u2019s to like about them? Almost nothing. There\u2019s almost nothing relatable we can find about them besides perhaps Ruuko. It\u2019s almost also impossible to like any of the characters as they are not role models. Whether these are Ruuko\u2019s anti-social behavior, Yuzuki\u2019s repugnant wish, or Akira\u2019s sadism, none of them really can be called role models. As the show progresses, we also witness their progress, not character wise but by the effects that the game has on them. And trust me, it\u2019s not pretty.\\n\\n\r\nAnother niche about the show involves the collectible game itself. Besides the LRIG, none of the other cards are memorable or has any purpose. They are easily forgettable and when used during gameplay is hardly understandable. Ironically enough, the show attracts more female players than guys despite the dark nature. But most importantly is the concept of the game and its consequences. For behind the scenes, the consequences are disastrous for the losers. The show desperately tries to appeal to these consequences in order to draw out the reality of it. As gimmicky as it can be, the show does appeal to its darker image when certain Selectors\u2019 minds are broken psychologically from the inside out. It can be easily relatable to shows like Madoka when girls are offered choices to play out their decisions. Otherwise, the show deals with other basis of human nature and themes including jealousy, identity, regret, social alienation, and forbidden laws of attraction. Needless to say, the show is a deconstruction of magical card game. The game itself serves as a deciding factor to settle out issues because character drama seems to be the cookie cutter.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff plays the role of crafting this show\u2019s artistic image. There\u2019s an oddball here when it pertains to cute girls playing the roles of Selectors in such a dark and twisted game. The LRIG has some interesting card designs with magical girl themes. Unfortunately, the game mechanics, even when crafted visually wise is underwhelming. The battle themselves are also mediocre and can even feel exasperating because most of the time, the characters doesn\u2019t even seem to enjoy playing the game. Action speaks louder than words is usually what people would say. But here in this show, it\u2019s what the character expressions that vividly paints their lack of interest and even fear what would happen should they lose. Also, who can forget about those insanely portrayed face expressions that Akira brings to the show that goes completely against what she really is, a fashion model?\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is perhaps one of the stronger factors for this show. In order for it to work, it needed to engineer the phases between emotional, climatic, and thought provoking scenarios. Surprisingly, it does work most of the time. The eerie-like soundtrack conveys the darker side of the show effectively when utilized. And to further accompany this is the character voices that clearly reflects their despair and hopelessness in certain episodes. In particular, Hitoe\u2019s voice is very credible when it comes to her shy nature and despair. The OP & ED songs also has influence when it comes to show that the show is not a happy game about kids playing cards to kill time.\\n\\n\r\nDark and edgy, I suppose there are more words to describe what this show really is. But for a show based off a card game, it hardly even touches on its mechanics. Throughout the series, it\u2019s not surprising when you find yourself how exactly the game is played besides the most general rules. Take this more as a type of dark drama that is supposed to be character driven with Madoka-esque vibes. Of course, there\u2019s no Kyuubey but rather LRIG, those cute girls with a taste for battle. I wouldn\u2019t say the show is an abomination to card game ethnics. There\u2019s memorable moments, some battles that can be almost fun to watch, and an appealing soundtrack. Rather, it\u2019s a deconstruction for what is has offered \u2013 a labyrinth of character drama and journey on the line of mind games.",

            "content": "This season was not really full of surprises. Just as always some light novel adaptions here and manga adaptions there. What I really missed when overlooking the chart of currently airing anime was something fresh which sounded interesting. Of course being a show about a card game, Selector Infected Wixoss did not catch my attention at first at all. Only when I realized that this season isn't close to being good and I even started watching a sports anime about ping pong I thought to myself \"Hey, why not check out this anime with the cute girls playing cards?\". \r\nI can tell you beforehand, missingout on this show is not what you should!\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot focuses around our shy and modest girl Ruuko, mostly adressed as \"Ru-Chan\" and her classmates Yuzuki who get into the new title-giving card game Wixoss. But as one could think this game is not a normal card game as it nominates certain girls to become a so called Selector. These girls receive special cards called LRIGs which are inhabitated by moving and seemingly living fantasy-like girls and young women. These LRIGs can talk and have the possibility to grant the Selector to become an Eternal Girl and have their deepest wish fulfilled - if they win a certain number of games. If you lose three times though you lose your chance ot ever become an Eternal Girl. \\n\\n\r\nOf course these facts have every Selector curious on whom to trust and whom to battle. Do they want to take others wishes in order to have their own fulfilled? This aspect is treated very well by the show and isn't downplayed in a comedic way at all. The show is dead serious about what it presents and portrays the girls struggles with themselves and others very well. \\n\\n\r\nThose characters may come off as a little generic and some similarities with Madoka Magica are inevitable to recognize and to acknowledge but this doesn't make the interpersonal interactions less tense. They actually seem more relatable and easier to understand. Later on the focus on the psychological aspects come to light more and more as the show reveals its more darker side one might not have expected at first but which I kind of predicted after the immense praise this show received as it aired.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of audio-visual design Selector Infected Wixoss left a huge impression on me. The character designs are not the most original but they look different from each other for the most part instead of suffering from the common same-face-syndrome which seems to be an ongoing thing in the modern anime industry. The backgrounds also have a certain touch and the downtown setting creates a certain atmosphere which I personally enjoy a lot. Selector Infected Wixoss trumps especially with its soundtrack. \\n\r\nCreating an almost unique and eerie feeling even when sometimes just consisting of simple tunes. For a card game show the atmosphere is amazingly intense and something I did not expect when going into the show. A special shouout also deserve the voice actresses which delivered a more than solid performance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Selector Infected Wixoss was a good start to what could become a great franchise. As of now it left lots of questions unanswered which I expect to change with the arrival of the second season called \"Selector Spread Wixoss\" coming this fall. The first season though opened a door to countless possibilites to go for. I hope the creators realize the potential which slumbers in this show and come off which a proper conclusion in the end which won't just be a reset ending for example. The characters have developed very well this far and I am excited for what is yet to come.",

            "content": "I was lead into watching this show by the guidance of a certain anime veteran you may or may not have heard of with expectations that were neither high nor low. But at no point in time did I ever think Selector Infected would be bad and even after its completion I still feel the same way.  In terms of technicality, Wixoss easily outdoes many of its anime brothers and sisters, but what it has in mechanics it seriously lacks in entertainment and arguably, in originality. \r\nStarting with the artwork, SIW mirrors Madoka Magica to a tee; the opening theme, battle aesthetics and eventhe choice in font bears heavy resemblance to that of PMMM. It literally gives me the feeling of re-watching Madoka Magica and since said anime isn't even five years old (at the time of writing this review) it\u2019s a very bizarre choice in style. Does that make it a bad choice? Not really, but it certainly doesn't help refute the accusation of unoriginality particularly since most people negatively judging SIW are doing so based on face value over mechanics. \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of mechanics, SIW is indeed a card game anime but unlike most other shows of the genre, it doesn't explain how the game works. The only given details are that if a wixoss player loses three matches then she is no longer eligible for becoming an \u201cEternal girl\u201d. Yet even this rule isn't set in stone, as it\u2019s later revealed that after losing three games, a girl may still have the opportunity of being chosen as a selector. In theory, you could lose an infinite amount of times, but since there\u2019s no set number of wins needed to become an eternal girl, you could be stuck winning just as often.  \\n\\n\r\nSome argue that SIW neglected gameplay details as means of keeping the focus on the off-court drama. However, I honestly believe the decision to disregard the rules of Wixoss only works for the detriment of its entertainment factor. To put it simply, SIW lacks the tension to keep you invested \u2013 a problem that could have easily been avoided by including at least a few details of the game play.  It\u2019s hard to feel like there\u2019s much at stake when the parameters of winning or losing are barely defined, and since most opponents (with the exception of a few specific characters) aren't given much of a back story, they start to feel like nameless punching bags for the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nSo what all is good about Selector Infected? SIW does have good technical value in its use of foreshadowing and plot twists. It also makes smart use of some pretty stupid anime clich\u00e9s such as, the power of fucking friendship and sibling romance in a way that\u2019s unexpected as well as entertaining. Unfortunately, there just isn\u2019t much else going on here to make it memorable. SIW is pretty much the antithesis to other animes of its time; it outsmarts most of them, but it doesn't outshine any of them. But as previously stated, I don\u2019t think Selector Infected is a bad show and more than likely all of the unexplained mysteries of the first season could possibly make for a more captivating season two, which I will definitely be watching.   \\n",

            "content": "So recently I decided to watch the anime 'Selector Infected WIXOSS', from the outside it looks like a simple anime about girls playing a card game, however the actual anime is surprisingly a whole lot deeper and darker.\r\nThe animes setting revolves around the card game WIXOSS, the card game itself is pretty wierd and not exactly easy to understand, however surprisingly the animes center focus isn't about the card game, its about the characters playing the game and about there wishes. Now the story has it where there are people who are selected 'selectors' who are able to go through battles in this card gameto achieve there wish. These selectors find that they have a card that is essentially alive and is able to talk to them. Only selectors can see or hear them, these selectors battle each other in what seems to be a alternate dimensional world just for these battles, and basically battle each other with there LRIG, which is the card that seems to be alive. The story focuses on one specific character Ruko Kominato who is the latest girl to find an LRIG card. She names her card Tama, and without any further explanation is thrown into her life as a Selector.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does go into a darker path, with twists and tragedies happening to beloved characters which can only make you go 'Daaaaaamn', the story and setting I find are quite unique in this anime and make it quite enjoyable just to see how it alls plays out.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the series are done quiet well also, as they all seem to have a complicated life that are all connected with there wishes, which you cannot help but feel sympathy for.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime isn't as unique, however it is on par with other animes being produced recently, with some exceptions like in the card battles where the art style turns into something that can only be described as pretty.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound had no problems with the sound effects and voice acting being superb, the intro song chosen for the anime \"killy killy JOKER\" by Kanon Wakeshima, was a great choice for the anime, being one that I would personally not ever skip, it gives a true felling of what is to come from the anime, aw well as being catchy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there were some negatives, being that the card games rules aren't exactly clear to the viewers, and really there wasn't a great majority of different battles to be seen, also I feel like the story may have been a bit rushed, and could have been a bit better with a few more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, the series did end in a way that made me just want more, thankfully there will be a second season 'Infected Spread WIXOSS' which I honestly cannot wait for in order to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was quiet surprisingly enjoyable, and I would recommend everyone to give it a try, even if you're not a fan of animes based on card games, the show is done in a way that anyone can enjoy it.",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS (SIW) is the newest of a number of anime which many people claim \"Only exists because of Madoka Magica.\" Personally I don't agree with that, but just a heads up in case you get part way into this review and just write the show off because of the few similarities like many people seem to do with these kinds of shows. Yes it is a dark show with a sort of magical-girl-esque style that centers around a group of high school girls, but that's about all the similarities you'll find save a couple towards the end that only seem like they'll besimilar to PMMM. But with that out of the way, onto the real review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKominato Ruuko is the protagonist who lives with her grandmother. She has no friends and only sees her older brother when he occasionally visits. Her grandmother, wanting to help her make friends, buys her a starter pack of WIXOSS cards, a game which is very popular especially with girls. One of the cards is special and displays a moving girl who only Ruuko can notice and hear. The girl's name is Tama. She's a LRIG that only comes in certain packs and obtaining a LRIG makes Ruuko a Selector. She can fight against other Selectors in order to be granted one wish. However, if she loses 3 battles against other Selectors, she'll lose the ability for that wish to ever be granted. Because she's a Selector, she soon meets another girl named Yuzuki who is also a Selector. The rules of WIXOSS are never explained very well to the viewer, but basically the players just level up their LRIG and use a few other cards to attack their opponents with their LRIG. The actual battle logistics are pretty unimportant, and it's just the battle's outcome that really matters. As the story goes along, Ruuko faces difficulties with keeping friends, fighting off enemies, and deciding what wish she should make. And her problems are only a small portion of the psychological issues faced throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI love psychological anime, so I couldn't help but go into SIW with high hopes that I figured would not be completely met. Still (and I know I rated the show at a 5, but that's average for my rating scale and really not that bad) it turned out pretty good. This is the kind of show that, like most psychological shows, builds up tension between the characters early on by hiding parts of the story from both the viewer and the characters. With that tension comes a bit of a slow start as the elements are showed in pieces, and there are many questions this show will have you asking at first. What are the girls' wishes? What are LRIGS? What purpose is there in having this Selector/LRIG battle system anyway? Honestly, the last one still isn't totally answered, but that's why there's a season 2 scheduled in the fall. Eventually, around the last third of this season, the show picks up pace and gets intense once everything begins to fall apart for the characters both due to the situations they are in and due to psychological issues. The ending of this season is excellent and will leave you dying to know more (which means you may want to put off watching this season until the second season starts if you don't like cliffhangers).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all interesting and have different personalities and wishes. None really stood out as being anything special or unique in comparison to other anime unfortunately. Yuzuki, Ruuko's first friend, has a forbidden love that she keeps a secret. Hitoe is shy and has never been any good at making friends. Akira is a pompous idol who can't stand anyone being better than her. I found Akira annoying and was glad she wasn't as relevant to the story as the other characters. Iona is calm and calculating while hiding her real intentions. And Ruuko just goes along with it at first because she made some friends, though she soon comes to the dilemma of not knowing whether to stay as a Selector or to stop battling to protect herself and everyone else. There is plenty of drama built up over the fact that it is simple to lose your wish and right as a Selector but very difficult to grant it. There's more to granting your wish than just winning 3 times, and this creates a huge problem for the characters who feel guilty for causing other players to lose their wish.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is well done for the most part. The cute and simple character designs create a stark contrast between them and the dark world around them. The animation overall and especially for the characters improves greatly towards the end as it seems J.C. Staff saved a good portion of their animation budget for the later episodes. The soundtrack is pretty typical of a darker show and sets the eerie atmosphere well but never really goes above and beyond simply doing its job.\\n\\n\r\nWhile SIW couldn't quite live up to the hopeful expectations I had before watching this show, the end certainly did get close despite the cliffhanger. The gradual incline in information being revealed slowly began to show how much more complex the Selector system is than it was originally displayed to be. I cannot wait for the next season which will hopefully be even better than the first and I recommend this to anyone looking for a psychological anime to watch.",

            "content": "In depth review #4 - Selector Infected WIXOSS\r\nBefore getting into this review, I just want to get the elephants out the room first. Selector Infected WIXOSS is really similar to Madoka Magica. The dark themes and the situation these girls where in is just too similar not to mention. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing though since I enjoyed watching both of these anime. I just felt like I was watching something I already seen before. Despite this, I still wouldn\u2019t say Selector Infected WIXOSS is a Madoka Magica clone. This series does a lot of unique and ambitious things right on its own likeactually making a card game anime watchable so don't worry. Its also worth mentioning that there are a couple of incest themes in this anime that some viewers might not be comfortable with but i honestly think they handled it maturely. The show goes in depth about how someone might feel in this situation rather than.....well you know.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS follows the story behind a girl named Ruuko Kominato, and her friends as they play WIXOSS, a popular trading card game among young girls. At first glance, this is just a harmless game until Ruuko gets a pack of cards from her brother. When she opens it, she finds a card that has a personality of it own called an LRIG. The people who are able to see these cards are called selectors. Selectors have a chance to make any wish they want come true by battling other selectors. This seems like an amazing opportunity until these girls find out the dark truth behind this game. Like i said above, the setup for this show is very similar to another show I've watched but the plot is definitely interesting. You won't find another card game anime as fun to watch as this one. Its interesting and enjoyable but not unique. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime was good, but nothing really stood out during the scenes inside buildings and in the city. The characters animation was also good but nothing special. Just standard animation throughout. However, the battle scenes went to an entirely different level of animation. To say it simply, it was stunning and it's where the animation shined in this show. The LRIGs trapped in the cards turned into nicely detailed avatars. Even the atmosphere changed drastically to correspond to the people battling each other. The color pallet had a wide range of vivid colors to corresponding to each characters deck color. And i cant forget about the attacks. The magic used by the LRIGs looked amazing and made me yearn to see more of the LRIGs move sets.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nSimilar to the animation, the sound really popped out at you during the battle sequences. During these scenes, the music really punched you in the face from how epic they where. They used several catchy Tech based songs with orchestrated rhythms in it as well as DnB and Dubstep. Any show that has Dubstep in it i was most likely fall in love with.The music that played during the transition and in the opening/ending themes were also good. I especially like the ending song.  During the casual scenes however, i can't remember an songs off of the top of my head i liked. This probably happened since there wasn't many playing or they weren't that memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nAll of the main characters in this show made me feel differently about them corresponding to their situation. The way the behaved and how there personalities developed over the course of the show made me think about how i would act if i were in their shoes. This was extremely relevant in Ruuko, Yuzuki and Hitoe's case. I don't want to spoil anything but i genuinely felt bad about how things were turning out for these innocent girls half way through the series. As for Akira, she was a bitch, but liked her at the same time. She is like the character you don't like but enjoy seeing them mess with someone else.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 (Great)\\n\r\nI went into this anime not knowing anything about it. All i knew about that anime was that a lot of people weren't expecting it to be as good as it was, and i can see why. This anime was completely overlooked by the more popular anime this session but i enjoyed it about the same and ever more than those anime. It was a unique spin on the trading card game genre that i just have to applaud for since most of them aren't that good, Cough..Yugioh Zexal..Cough. It was interesting and made me remember how good deconstruction show actually are.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.6/10 (Good) - Worth the Watch",

            "content": "When I read the synopsis for the series I thought \"Wow, this is kind of cute - it's about girls who want to make their dreams come true~\" ahahaha... no. \r\nPlot: 8 \r\nGiven the amount of episodes the anime has, it did a pretty good job of pacing the story. It was a bit slow in the beginning, but that only allows the latter episodes to create a greater impact when the plot takes an unexpected turn. They did a great job building it up, nothing seemed too rushed and it really flowed. The increase of tension and chaos is also well reflected in thepacing as the series progresses. \\n\r\nOverall, this season did a pretty good  job on introducing WIXOSS and the mysteries surrounding it. Although there as some things that are still left unanswered, I think it's fair to leave it at that since they are giving it a second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 8 \\n\r\nThere was a lot of intricate details that I enjoyed, like the details of the backgrounds, or the decorations in the girl's bedrooms to reflect their personality. Speaking of personalization, the way they make each battlefield unique is also something worth complimenting. The fight scenes were well animated: fast paced with flashy moves. Another thing is that they didn't use a lot of still pictures in the anime~ so when main characters are being featured, there is background movement to make everything more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound: 8\\n\r\nReally enjoyed the opening. It's fast tempo seemed to deliver the struggle and intensity of battling, and the closing had a more soothing effect, which is always a good contrast. The background music was also suitable where it was used, but I really liked how they used background noise such as cars, and people talking to keep the realism going. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 \\n\r\nThe character designs were enjoyable since I don't really mind people recycling the generic images (ex. cutesy girls turning out with the worst personalities). The characters are pretty well developed anyways since we are given insight on their past and how they changed through the series, even the cards were distinct from one another. The only thing to complain about is the random little girl that was like a filler character. I had no idea what her role was... \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series was quite enjoyable and really had me hooked. Every element of the anime was quite well done, and each episode unravels a bit of information that only leads to more questions. Therefore, please give it a try~ and you just might get Infected by WIXOSS.",

            "content": "WIXOSS - a card game capable of bringing either hope or despair. Or maybe just straight up despair. \r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS is definitely a genre all in its own. Getting into this show, I was expecting it to be some sort of Yu-Gi-Oh thing, but it was far different from my expectations. The show actually has a lot of parallels with Madoka Magica (the recommendations tab will tell you the same thing) more than anything else. Normal girls who are chosen to posses mysterious powers or abilities must compete against each other in order to get their wishes granted, without knowing what they're really gettingin to. \\n\\n\r\nTurns out, Selector Infected WIXOSS is less about the card game, and more about the experience of the players - how the game is effecting their everyday lives, the emotional and psychological consequences, and their interactions both in battle, and in the real world. In fact, the real rules of the game aren't even explained, which is both valuable, but also a weakness. With too much information about the game, there wouldn't be enough development in the characters in a short twelve episodes, but at the same time, having the rules of the game explained would keep the viewer more engaged, and added the element of strategy. However, I think for the most part they made up for in with excellent effects and art that kept the battles interesting. People who are considering watching this should be aware that this show is more about the story, dialogue, and mystery rather than the game itself. \\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't keep it from having a unique and powerful concept. The viewer follows the players as they put themselves on the line for the sake of their wishes being granted. We follow them as they go deeper into labyrinth of this mysterious game and the darkness that comes along with it. Will a strong sense of justice get lost in a sea of greed? Will inner strength and willpower beat the odds of defeat? \\n\\n\r\nEven with a few story holes, Selector Infected WIXOSS delivered more than I thought it would. With great art, a enticing concept with many, many layers, this leaves quite an impact with a great cliffhanger for the second season. A decent show with some solid entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nBiggest strength: character development and concept\\n\r\nBiggest weakness: rules of the game are unexplained which leaves a few story holes\\n\\n\r\nBe aware that this show is less about the game and more about the experience of the players. Very similar to Madoka Magica. Still pretty good.",

            "content": "*May contain a few spoilers and sarcasm*\r\nFrom the very first episode I knew SIW had the potential to become a very good anime, so I kept saying \"Please don't disappoint me\" until the last episode. Fortunately, it helped.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis strange combination between Mahou shoujo madoka magica and Yu-gi-oh! was a really good one but could have been better. The plot is focused on Ruuko, a standard teenage girl with no friends, who lives with her grandma and brother. One day her brother introduces her to WIXOSS, a card game where you have to battle other selectors and LRIGs to become an Eternal Girl and haveyour wish granted. Sounds familiar? Kind of. The story is not about the game itself but the effect it has on people's lives. Just like Madoka Magica, the anime becomes very dark and sad because once you've become an Eternal girl, your wish will be granted but your LRIG will be the one living the dream and you, as a selector, become a LRIG. That's when Ruuko realizes the game is a lie and tries to save her friends, her LRIG and the whole universe.\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the anime had a lot of potenial, but at some point everything became ordinary because I could tell what would happen next. Aaaand then I watched the last episode. I was sincerely thinking that SIW would DEFINATELY end just like Madoka magica, but it didn't. The ending was unexpected, in a good way and left me wanting to watch season 2 right now!\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe art is rather mediocre. Yes, the characters are ok, but the battlefields and some scenes in the last episodes where everything is covered in white (if you watched you know what i'm talking about) really need some improvement. The sound is fine, I like both opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI really need to say that the characters are the problem here. They don't have anything special and lack development, especially Ruuko, the main character. Despite participating in the game, she didn't have a wish until the last episode. She was participating because... well I can't even tell. She is always afraid of something, insecure, naive and to simplify this: not suited for the game. On the other hand, we have Yuzuki, one of Ruuko's friends who's in love with her brother, Kazuki. Yuzuki is my favourite character because she knew what she was fighting for, she didn't care what people would think about her and she just like this she made her wish come true. More or less.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nYou have a chance to make your wish come true. Participate in the game. But if you lose that wish will NEVER come true. What would you do? This ideea is brilliant and so addictive. I guess that's why I couldn't stop loving this anime despite its flaws. I enjoyed watching the series and I'm truly happy that there's gonna be a sequel (Selector Spread WIXOSS), because this season left me with lots of unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhy 9? Well, a 10 couldn't have been anyway because I had to focus on the story and not to mind some annoying characters. I recommend this to everyone because among Gokukoku no Brinhyldr, No game no life, Akuma no riddle and Black Bullet, SIW is one of the best anime of spring 2014.",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS is what I assume is the end result of Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh! being thrown into a blender with chunks of Madoka Magica, and swirled up to create a relatively fresh and exciting take on the card anime genre. I started watching it because I saw that it was directed by Takuya Satou, one of the directors for the anime Steins;Gate, which was amazing. Coming in with high hopes, I must say that I was not disappointed.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story of Selector Infected is one that will constantly keep you guessing. The show had me consistently thinking about what just happened, and why ithappened, which is a good thing, in my opinion. A show that has its viewers on their toes is a show worth watching, and Selector Infected does a very good job of doing just that. I will say, though, that the story doesn't really kick off until around episode 3 or 4, which is something I'm not a huge fan of. Once you get passed the beginning, though, you'll find yourself thoroughly enjoying this wonderful ride of a show. If you enjoy watching shows with many plot twists, surprises, and depressing scenarios, as I do, you will most certainly find this show to be to your liking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really don't have very much to say about the art. It looks pretty, with characters being well drawn (except for their noses, I can't stand their noses for whatever reason), and the environments are colored in a rather gray, toned down way that helps emphasize the dark and mysterious atmosphere the story takes place in. While I found this to be a plus, others may find the lack of bright and vibrant colors to be a turn off, as a similar show, Madoka Magica, managed to have many colorful areas and still retain its dark atmosphere. However, I'm sure that you will enjoy the show regardless of whether or not the art is to your liking.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this show is very good. Tracks go very well with the scenes they are played in, and always manage to get me in the mood for whatever I'm seeing, whether it be happy, sad, or excited. The opening and ending themes are very well done, particularly the opening, which is one of my favorites among the other spring 2014 season openings. Character voices are also very good, with the voice actresses managing to convey the emotions the characters are feeling quite well, particularly Ai Kayano, who played a perfect Hitoe that had me feeling for her the most out of anyone. All in all, the show did a very good job in the sound category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Selector Infected are very well written. Characters introduced receive a fairly large amount of development, with each one having different motivations for battling as Selectors in this world. As a result, viewers may have a hard time picking a side, as the show presents the characters in ways that make you feel for all of them. This character style is one that I believe to be one of the best around because of how important each character becomes to the show, and is something a congratulate this show on doing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really like Selector Infected WIXOSS. For me, it reminded me a lot of Madoka Magica in terms of story elements and the dark and depressing atmosphere, which really enhanced the experience for me. Every twist it took made the story that much more intense, and before I knew it, I was eagerly awaiting Thursday of each week for the next episode. Needless to say, I really enjoyed watching this show, and can't wait for the next season this fall.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS- A deconstruction of the ever popular card game anime genre?\r\nNot really\u2026But does it even matter?\r\nPutting the Madoka Magica comparisons aside, WIXOSS is a show that tries to smother the viewer with an array of emotions, as well as unfortunate plot points, bringing up in me that \u201cone\u2026more\u2026episode\u2026\u201d feeling. Yes. WIXOSS has many aspects which make it an enjoyable work that can/will leave one questioning the moral standards of the issues presented. On with it, I suppose.\r\nWithout rewriting the synopsis above, we know that the characters in the show play a card game called WIXOSS, however some girls become \u201cselectors,\u201d and are throwninto some special circumstances. That is all I shall say regarding the story- this show is definitely best viewed if one knows little to nothing about it, as the twists and surprises will be that much sweeter. However, I can comment that the quality of the story is very good in this show. This can perhaps lead to an explanation of my opening- the card game aspect seems to exist for the sole purpose of being a vehicle for the story. There is nothing wrong with this, as it does the job nicely. The story provokes the viewer into thinking about the show, from character motivations to the consequences of decisions. While it may throw around classic tropes, or be slightly hard to understand- the story of WIXOSS is well done, and this is largely due to the array of characters in the show.\\n\r\nWhat WIXOSS does well with its characters, besides using them well in conjunction with the story, is the emotions they seems to create in the viewer. It is very easy to feel some sort of emotion to each character- you may despise one, feel pity for one, care for one, etc. This vital interaction between the viewer and the characters are very important in the psychological genre, as the connections you form with them only heighten the drama and suspense of the issues they come across. With their array of personality, as well as the emotional attachment with the viewer, the characters in WIXOSS become an integral part of the story. Unfortunately, some characters receive little screen time, and some are easily forgettable. However, this issue will be discussed shortly. \\n\r\nThe characters and story both are portrayed very well by the visual and artistic direction here. What I particularly enjoyed was the differences in the world when a normal situation was occurring, as opposed to a dark, negative situation in the story. The art truly did reflect the state of the characters. Technically speaking, everything was up to standard- art and animation were mostly consistent, although I wouldn\u2019t say they were stellar. The same can be said for the musical score, attributed to Iuchi Maiko, of \u201cA Certain Magical Index\u201d fame. Some tracks certainly stand out more than others, however I must commend the high energy tunes used during the battle sequences. They certainly provide a high note in a score which is fairly normal otherwise.\\n\r\nSo\u2026I\u2019d if you reached the end of this review, I\u2019d like to leave you with this- you should probably watch this show. While I don\u2019t feel this classifies as a true deconstruction, (Because the card game aspect is really only used as a vehicle for the character\u2019s motivations and the story, it is not truly explored) this show was highly enjoyable for me. If you make it through the first season, the second, Selector Spread WIXOSS, is slightly different in approach and style, especially regarding the characters. However, I will not say too much regarding that- the WIXOSS series is enjoyed the most when one knows nothing about it. So go forth. \\n\r\nHave fun.",

            "content": "This has got to me among the most pathetic anime in existence, and I say this because Selector Spread Wixoss tries to be suspenseful, dramatic and edgy; but at the end of the day it ends up being dreadful, pathetic and honestly atrocious from beginning to end.\r\nThe story starts simple: A girl meets a magical creature that promises her a wish, but what she never realizes is that the price for her wish would cost with agony and despair\u2026 or at least that is what the show wants to be.  Instead, the show relies too much with victimizing their main protagonists, to the pointthat it feels almost forced. The narrative of the events they go through felt rather stupid (i.e. Akira stopping three teenagers from getting away from her), and the drama is as flat as a pancake (i.e. Tomoe\u2019s sad story of not having any friends). And because of such, some of the plot-twist and plot-points are very unoriginal. In fact, this show used to make me angry for trying to rip-off a better show that came out a few years before this one\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than getting upset by how this show is an obvious knock-off of Madoka Magica, I dislike how they tried so hard to make care for the characters in WIXOSS. I mean sure, the girls were going through some crazy stuff, but I found it extremely hard to root for characters that are selfish, generic or down right boring. Ruuko was as bland as grits, Tama is completely dumb, Iona is a boring villain, Akira is a c*nt, and the rest of the characters are forgettable. But the uninteresting characters is not the only reason why I disliked the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to their awful to almost-non-existent personalities, the girls ask for some of the most retarded wishes that they could easily achieve without magic. Moreover, the wishes for some of the main characters are both gross and selfish, like wishing your sibling to fall in love with you. Now, I know they are young, but who would ask for some silly wishes? Come on\u2026 And asides to all of the character\u2019s wishes, the lesbian undertones (or should I say overtones) were highly used for the sake of fanservice (specially Iona\u2019s dialogue), and it completely derailed the mood of the show. (i.e. \u201cLet me do it with you Ruuko\u2026\u201d)\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing I can think of the show is the art style it had (the calm colors, the paintbrush textures and dark color schemes), but that is not saying much. In fact, sometimes the art would look rather tacky (Specially when they would try to put too much shadows in a bright day). And the soundtracks for the show really didn\u2019t fit with Wixoss, specially the electronic/dubstep tracks.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting nothing from the show, if anything, I was hoping it could blow the expectations I had - just a simple card game show for kids. Sadly, it made me feel just nauseous after watching the whole season, specially that last episode. The show tried too hard to be edgy and it wants us to care for characters that are bland/selfish, leading to an abomination of a show. I warn everyone to to stay away from Selector Spread Wixoss! \\n\\n\\n\r\n*Extra Notes*\\n\\n\r\n-Why does it always have to be the girls who get to have magical powers? Come on people, I demand gender equality! \\n\\n\r\n-Ruuko\u2019s granma is the only somewhat cool character in this show! (Probably because she is the one who is not stupid)\\n\\n\r\n-If I had a dollar for every time they say the word \u201cBATTORU!!\u201d\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-Most of the LRIG\u2019s costumes look either bland and boring, or completely slutty\u2026 UGH.",

This trading card game was known as Wixoss, she soon discovers that she was a selector, and that a selector is a female player who can see special LRIG cards having minds of there own, that will play with otherselectors and must defeat a certain number of them (number of wins will vary person to person) to become an \u201cEternal Girl\u201d whose most desired wish will be granted to reality. If a selector loses three times, she loses the right to be a selector, and becomes a normal human. Let the battle royale of  Human Trauma begin. \\n\\n\r\nI can put more detail into that, but it would be spoiler territory, so take this weaker explanation of the Synopsis as a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nFor a mystery thriller, Wixoss holds that quite damn well, it starts of decently, and gradually builds up to an intense climax while it gives characters enough screen time and motivations for us to at least some-what care that these people are going through some very rough times. It deals its themes with a surprisingly great deal of maturity for something that looks moe. It discusses moralic themes about the characters actions and motivations. If for an example, this character is very strong always winning the hardest battles, but ends up having no wishes, then it becomes a morality issue stating that if battles are the best pieces of life enjoyment then should'nt you call quits for the suffering of other selectors? Or is the action of incest wrong in every way, therefore the character questions the value of there wish while still trying to feel like a normal being. Concepts of human psycholgy being explored in a mature manner makes us take this show seriously, and leaves an impact by the characters actions and with a (mostly) intense and gripping story that always keeps viewers fascinated, then its obviously a damn good show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I would ever try my best to round of the cast, they seem to lack depth, back story and development is fine (50% of the time) but my biggest gripe I could really think of is that I really desired the characters to become more complex, deep and understanding. In a way they feel a bit too simple for the shows darker themes and intense build up as an actual thriller. It would really make a better show if the characters are even more complex and organic. I always start lowering my expectations if any show starts using archetypes.\\n\\n\r\n However, the story is better than I thought it would be, it really gives You the feeling of this show being this intense thriller having loads of mysteries surrounding itself as the show progresses on climax you get some level of impact as mysteries reveal themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI would also love to give kudos on the animation (not something that I do very often)  by J.C Staff, there work on giving the backgrounds this line and wash feel makes it stand out a bit more, and this very slight artiness feel kind makes me like the show more. However, the battles with the LRIG have a bit too much CG on the back round which makes me a tad more nit picky. Speaking of nit picks, they don't really explain the strategies on what the girls are doing, like power up! And then kill this character, and it it kind of looks stupid sometimes... Though I do forgive that mistake because the show is incredibly well driven through via narrative, that, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Music wise, nothing special except for an above average opening and great ending.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nThe second season is likely to very bad, but because this show is a bit more on the underrated side, then maybe Just Maybe we could have a decent sequel. 80% chance that this show is going to flop, since Autumn is right around the corner... Will it be good? I won't be surprised if neither happens.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6.5/10 For characters lacking real depth, but have good themes which the show handles maturely. (unfortunately not all characters are like that)\\n\r\n7.5/10 Some parts of the story are a little corny which prevents it from an 8 but overall, damn good thriller.\\n\r\n7.5/10 The animation is line and wash and gives this older show-like feel. Extra Kudos to J.C Staff.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE 7.5/10",

            "content": "This a newly edited review of this anime, 3rd time in a row, (upon the mods insistence), Bueno let's get down to business:\r\nWhat we have was a card game themed anime with a shoujo element in it where them girls were involved in some strange card game where the stakes are high and the price for losing or winning are huge. At this point one would wonder as to why them girls choose, most especially the MCs, would still play it, even though they may not get exactly what they wish for. Besides, the true title of the series is \"Wish- Across\". Now I admirethe author's creativity when it comes to giving this series' title \"Selector Infected: WiXOSS\", which basically means that the selector who happens to be a LIRG holder gets infected with the price of playing the game and it just so happens that it a girls only club. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime, well... really doesn't dig in to me, in fact I really don't like the way Ruko's school uniform design is. Though I think, it is only Iona who is the bomb in this series. Also, I hate the way them LIRGs were illustrated, especially Iona's LIRG were it looks more like a mummy than anything else. I like the opening theme \"Killy Killy Joker, \" but much the closing \\n\\n\r\nNow among the characters, Ruko really pisses me off, she basically is this naive girl who can't seem to make up her mind so much that I would really like to give her a karate chop on her head, Tama her LIRG was pretty much a retard..... a very dangerous retard that is, Yuzuki with her intense brocon was too cliche her LIRG Hanayo is a bitch, too bad Yuzuki's onichan was too stupid to even notice the personality changes, Hitoe was pretty much oblivious that she can have friends without even getting into that WIXOSS thing. About Iona and Akira, well they were pretty much the characters I hate the most.  \\n\\n\r\nNow how enjoyable is this? Well, I guess this anime is \"FAIR\" enough to be enjoyed, because it wasn't much a card theme anime, but rather it was more of a melodramatic anime where the consequences of bad choices destroy lives. However, the conclusion will be in season 2, how will it be, is yet to be shown. \\n\\n\r\nSo, here are my ratings:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory- Very Good 8.\\n\r\nI gave it such score because of the authors creativeness in using terminologies like LRIG, where if one is stupid it is actually spelled \"Girl\" in reverse and the sub title \"\"WIXOSS\" which is a Jap shorten term for \"Wish Across.\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- Poor 3.\\n\r\nI don't like the school uniforms that them MCs wore and I certainly don't like the way them LIRGs were illustrated..\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- Good 7.\\n\r\nIt's for the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Poor 3.\\n\r\nAs said before, the characters are annoying, then again, they're entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Fair 6.\\n\r\nIt was entertaining, but such enjoyment can only be enjoyed when season 2 comes around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Fair 6.\\n\r\nI'd say that it's \"Fair\" enough.....for now or until season 2 comes around.",

            "content": "Selected infected the anime that takes the fun card game genre, then breaks it down and gives it a fun outer appearance with dark insides.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is the best part of this anime as it takes a popular genre in this it is card games and deconstructs it while giving it a dark theme similar to Madoka Magica. The story is primarily about the main character Ruuko being chosen to become Selector in the card game WIXOSS, to which the story focuses on her darker inner self enjoying the battles for fun rather than wanting to become a eternal girl which creates a darksetting that is enjoyable and interesting. But the story is slow at the start and is hard to get into until you reach episode 4 or 5 which can cause you to drop the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art in the anime is nothing special and is comparable to K-On as they have the same style, but the card battles are good and nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound okay it is neither awesome nor crap; it fits the show well especially the opening and ending that have a dark and depressing feeling to them but I didn't really find them nice to listen to and were skipped every time after the first ep and were not worth downloading.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters of WIXOSS have varying personalities that include nice and sweet to depressing to downright insane which seems unbelievable to there cute appearances in both the Selectors and LRIGs. There were no archetypes in this anime like Tsundere or anything like that as they felt quite original to me which also brings up the character development some go through a lot character development like Ruuko and Yuzugi which refreshes the show more while some don't like Akira and Kazuki who rarely appear despite being listed as Main.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed it but it was a slow start.\\n",

I know this sounds awful and maybe there\u2019s a red dot aimed at my head at this point, but bear with me.\r\nThere\u2019s little to be gained in an anime about card games and stuff, they\u2019re usually for kids and merchandising and what not, and that\u2019s exactly what you could except of Selector WIXXOS (if you know nothing beforehand), but the moment you realize you\u2019re watching an intense pathetic (pathos related) drama about young girls striving for seemingly impossible desires on very private standards, you realize that their suffering is so relatable\u2026 maybenot in contents but in intensity.\\n\\n\r\nSo they play this card game because it has some magic power capable of giving the winning player the realization of a desired wish, this comes with some rules and limitations not worthy of description because they only work for the sake of the argument of the series, just say that those limitations work perfectly for a twist or two. In this context the five main characters see themselves in a mixture of situations where their wishes get mixed up and tangled with their lives as they struggle to make sense of it all in a variety of ways, form social norms to morals and self realization\u2026 with a little bit of craziness. The key element is the paradoxical nature of the girls wishes, that in more than one sense, clash with either their lives or with the world in general, and leaving a nice space for interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing in Selector WIXXOS but the intensity of suffering, even if the motives may seem unrelatable or mundane, the whole premise of the series works with one purpose, and that is giving the human drama an intensity that is not necessarily there, but it\u2019s certainly needed. In other words, we love to see them girls suffer, because we do too suffer from the mundane and the sometimes socially inadequate propositions of our desires, we like them to suffer for us, we like them to build this church of suffering because we need a place where everything seems worthy of being the object of our dramas\u2026 even if they seem not to be dramas at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Selector WIXXOS is a solid constant trough its entirety, always pushing the drama to a, sometimes polemic minded, interesting extent, it has strong characters, enough plot mysteries, and the awe so loved human pathos we expect from a series this kind. \\n\\n\r\nSo I loved that the girls suffered, for their suffering was not an empty message for me at all\u2026 cool, eh?\\n",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS was really good. It was basically the JC Staff version of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica but don't think that it was a complete ripoff just because that's the way I put it. Really, it shares a lot of aspects (Selectors are all girls just like Magical Girls are all girls of course, they can get wishes granted, can become tainted by their wish, must keep fighting). WIXOSS however is a card game where the girls don't usually lose their lives however some girls suffer fates worse than death. For example one girl's wish was to have friends but when her wish becametainted, not only did she lose the friends she made already but she was also never able to make friends ever again and was put in excruciating pain if anyone being friendly touched her. In WIXOSS, girls who get cards with LRIGs are the Selectors and LRIGs grant wishes but do not tell the full details as to how wishes get granted and we'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful. Ruko is a sweet young girl who's shy and cute and likes having fun but clearly has something weird going on with her past because she was given up by her parents and forced to live with her grandmother. Her friend Yuzuki is strong willed, her friend Hitoe is shy but very nice and you just wanna root for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was great. The opening theme \"killy killy Joker\" will be stuck in my head for a long time and will go down as one of my favorites. The ending theme had a dark inflection with descending tones. The music of the show was pretty normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was just great. It wasn't brightly colored which went along with the subliminal dark theme of the show. The fighting between the LRIGs was very fluent and cool.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show you'll see things like bullying, incest, heartbreak, near mental breakdowns. It's all good stuff. The only problem I'd say is that it's not emotional enough. It didn't pull the heart strings nearly as much as I'd hoped like Madoka did.\\n\\n\r\nI DO recommend the show though. \\n\\n\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS: 8.5",

A few girls that obtain a special card with a so-called LRIG, are called Selectors. Selectors can play with other Selectors in a special battlefield that they can only see. Yes, cute girls playing cards. Or that's what I thought...\r\nAfter a few episodes, I was hooked. I liked the fact that I was confused, I was puzzled, I was thinking. I was thinking why there was a vague explanation of the whole game. And just when I thought Iunderstood it, another twist happened. I also like the pace of the development of the characters. It's neither slow nor rushed, perfect for 12 episodes. There is also this taboo part of the story that for the first time, I actually liked because they portrayed it very clean, not forced, and not in a disgusting way. In the end I was wanting for more. One thing I was particularly annoyed about were the characters' voices, maybe because there were at least 2 characters that sounded alike.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime because it teaches a lesson that you'll only realized at the end.",

            "content": "Wishes.\r\nIf you were in a competition in where you won, your wish would be granted, would you compete?  Knowing that there are other people who may have a more important or dire wish?  Is your wish more important than others?  Is it less important?\r\nDo you even have a wish?\r\nBefore going into this review, you will need to know what a Selector is.  In this series, there is a popular card game called WIXOSS.  Among the players, there are Selectors, people who are able to communicate with their LRIG, or the avatar of their deck.  The point of this partnership is for the LRIG to help the Selector become an Eternal Girl and have their dream, their desire or their wish fulfilled.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nWishes and desire and the dark undertone that comes with those two are used quite a lot in story telling.  This story is fairly predictable when it comes to the concept of despair and wishes.  Though, if you haven't expirenced much with this common story device, you will be in for a treat, as most people who see the dark side and consequences of wishes tend to enjoy the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOut story follows Ruuko, a standard character when it comes to these types of wish stories.  She is a character is couldn't be separated from the crowd prior to being a Selector.  By becoming a Selector and playing WIXOSS, she makes friends, she makes foes and she learns more about herself.  \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, do you need to know the rules of WIXOSS before watching?  \\n\r\nNOPE.  Not at all.  The anime's main focus when it comes to card battles are the emotion of the Selectors and the ending result, who wins or who loses.  The only concept you need to understand is that a deck is made to power up their LRIG.\\n\\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that this story isn't to surprising to those who have gone through stories related to the dark undertone of wishes.  It's very predictable and isn't too unique compared to other stories with a similar premise.  If you have not gone through a story that involved wishes and darkness, you will be in for a treat as WIXOSS is a great introduction to these types of stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nArt outside of battles is quite bland, with a lot of use of pale colors and grey.  All the backgrounds, all the foregrounds, use this type of bland coloring.  Is this bad?  Not entirely, as it gives a feel of emptiness, which does help deliver the dark undertone this anime has.  Was it required?  I feel like this coloring was a bit over done.  \\n\\n\r\nArt inside of battles were beautiful colors that faded into a never-ending darkness.  I could be a literature teacher about this and pull meaning out of nothingness, but I rather not.  I still enjoyed the art of the battles.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was great during battles, standard outside of them.  Hand to hand combat and the magical attacks that happened during battle all looked beautiful.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were pretty standard, though the designs for LRIGs were amazing.  Loved how they would look when they would power up.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhat an amazing OP, killy killy JOKER is one of my more favorite OPs of this season and one of my favorites of all time.  With an amazing chorus, it is hard not to get your head in the rhythm of the song, which is very similar to our main character, Ruuko.  She does the same thing during battles, and gets caught up in the hype of them.  The ED, realize -Yume no Matsu Basho-, is another beautiful piece that compliments the OP really well.\\n\\n\r\nOST?\\n\r\nWell.. again, outside of the battles, the soundtrack wasn't all too impressive.  It may have added to the feeling of emptiness, but again, it wasn't all that needed.  Songs used during the battles were all great!  Songs included DnB and dubstep, that all helped give the battles intensity without the songs being too absurd.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs I have said before, Ruuko is a very clean slate character, you will see her character develop as she meets other Selectors, as she wins battles, as she begins thinking of the questions I asked you at the beginning of this review.  She is quite the enjoyable character to watch.\\n\\n\r\nA great point in this anime is the relationship between our Selectors: Yuzuki, Akira, Hitoe and Iona.  Some are friends, some are foes, all have a wish they want granted.  These include some intense moments when we have our more important side characters battling each other knowing that their wishes are on the line.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this are the super side characters.... the nameless ones.  They are all terrible people with a terrible attitude and personality.  These are mainly nameless classmates whose only goal in the series is to cause tension and drama.  Sure it was enjoyable to see our main characters go through it, but the way they did it felt super forced.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nKeep in mind, I was coming into this series expecting it to be about cute girls and card games.  Boy was I surprised!  I was looking forward to some dark anime series during the spring season, Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Black Bullet and Akuma no Riddle.  WIXOSS blew all those series out of the water and another surprise series did the same thing this season.  I never expected this series to get dark.  \\n\\n\r\nI love love love how they handle card battles.  The no information needed to watch this show is amazing and I feel they handled that expertly!\\n\\n\r\nSuspense and intensity.\\n\r\nThe amount of suspense, the suspense in decision making, the suspense is revealing information, the suspense of wanting to know more, all of these add intensity to the series that keeps the viewer interested and wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWith a great ending that is an excellent follow up to a season two, the plot twists, the cute girls.  This was a surprise series that was an amazing to watch show. \\n\\n\r\nSome food for thought... what is girl backwards?",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS**\r\nNot many people know what to make of the Selector WIXOSS series. \u201cEh\u2026 it was okay I guess?\u201d seems to be the reaction of most people, and I think that can be largely attributed to the fact that it\u2019s so radically different from anything else in its genre; we\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. Anime fans simply aren\u2019t sure how to feel about a show centered around a card game that never even explains the rules of its own card game. While most anime in the card genre are about making every conceivable reward obtainable by means of saidchildren\u2019s card game (i.e. Yu-Gi-Oh), WIXOSS is about precisely the opposite: The ramifications of said card game. This show isn\u2019t about the glory and fame brought to those who win the game, it\u2019s about the pain and sorrow that the game brings to those who play it. WIXOSS takes the Gurren Lagaan-esque \u201cDo the impossible!\u201d attitude that you\u2019d normally see in this type of show and flips it entirely on its head, and that\u2019s what I love about it. Presenting the most overlooked anime of 2014: The Selector WIXOSS series\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: WIXOSS is a card game that's popular with teenagers; teenage girls especially. However, the seemingly innocent card game has a secret. There exist cards called \u201cLRIGs\u201d; cards that have actual people with wills of their own trapped inside them. Only \u201cspecial\u201d girls called Selectors can hear the voices of the LRIGs, allowing them to do battle in a dimension that other humans cannot access. It's said that whomever triumphs in these battles will have their greatest wish granted. Our story follows Ruko Kominato, the latest girl to find an LRIG. She names her card \u201cTama\u201d, and without any further explanation, is thrown into her new life as a Selector.\\n\\n\r\nIn case I haven\u2019t already made it obvious, WIXOSS is NOT an average entry into the card game genre. In fact, it can justifiably be called a deconstruction of its genre. It has a considerable amount of depth to it and discussing its themes without spoilers could be tricky, but I\u2019ll give it a shot. WIXOSS questions the very basis of achieving all of your wildest dreams by means of a higher power; it essentially examines the very basis of reaching all of your goals without directly facing the challenges that come along with those goals. Nearly every girl in the WIXOSS universe has a wish; a wish that they are convinced is impossible for them to realize without the limitless power of being a Selector. However, as is heavily foreshadowed, the deal isn\u2019t as sweet as it\u2019s made out to be. As the girl\u2019s grow more and more miserable, they realize that this means of obtaining their desires goes against the very nature of accomplishment. Some of them discover that they didn\u2019t want what they thought they wanted, some of them discover that what they wanted was within their reach the entire time, and others discover that they are happy with what already have after all. They don\u2019t find happiness and contentment because someone came along and waved magic wand; they find it through their own thought processes and experiences. This is just one of many of the masterfully executed themes in the WIXOSS series, all of which are evenly paced for the most part, expertly foreshadowed, and beautifully executed. WIXOSS not only manages to have deep and meaningful themes, but it manages to be entertaining at the same time. There are some seriously exciting and heart-throbbing moments that will \u201cWow\u201d you. That is no easy task, and it\u2019s perhaps the main reason I consider this show to be so underrated. All in all, this anime had a spectacular story despite the fact that it could have elaborated on certain plot points a bit more and given a bit more closure towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, are just as well written as the plot. While Ru, our protagonist, may be a bit bland, the rest of the cast is fleshed out, packed with personality, and legitimately complex. This is an extremely impressive feat given the sheer number of major characters that WIXOSS attempts to work with. From the humans to the LRIGs, nearly every single character is given proper motivations and a distinguishable personality. I\u2019ve never seen a show that\u2019s been able to do this with such a large cast and have it actually work until I watched WIXOSS. You WILL find at least one to grow attached too and you WILL become emotionally invested in the show as a result. The best part of this cast is that there are no clearly defined lines between good characters and evil characters (well, except for one character\u2026). Even the most seemingly cruel Selectors/LRIGs are sympathizable and have logical motives that back their actions up. My personal favorite character was Tama. Not only was she inhumanly adorable, she actually managed to have a complex personality and her actions carried massive thematic weight. I was literally cheering at my computer screen for Tama to prevail in times of peril. She is without a doubt an incredibly likable character. However, like I said, there are many more great characters to choose from.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll briefly touch on the fantastic soundtrack and the masterful use of animation before closing out: Starting with the OST, it never fails to get the job done. Its unique blend of new-age and orchestral tracks never fail to set the appropriate tone. Whether it be enhancing a saddening scene or pumping up an exciting scene, WIXOSS\u2019s OST covers the entire emotional spectrum. Add on the two incredible OPs and you have yourself an awesome soundtrack. However, the real highlight of this anime\u2019s presentation lies in the genius animation. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a confirmed sighting of VISUAL STORYTELLING! I know, shocking for a modern anime, but it\u2019s true. WIXOSS blew me away with some seriously genius symbolism, with the contrasts between light and dark being a central theme. Not only does WIXOSS accomplish the difficult task of conveying meaning without words, it can also be breathtakingly beautiful at times. Some of the imagination and planning put into a couple of these settings is absolutely remarkable. This is seriously some noteworthy animation, even if it isn\u2019t getting any attention.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Selector WIXOSS series is criminally underrated. Why seemingly nobody else can see how masterfully this show executed its main themes and ideas is beyond me, but I\u2019ll tell you one thing: this anime is a must-watch for psychological fans.  WIXOSS may not be perfect, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat, it will make you think, and it will dazzle you with its presentation. Honestly, what more do you want? Go watch it!",

            "content": "A card game about granting wishes. That\u2019s what Selector Infected WIXOSS is anyways. And judging by the cover, there isn\u2019t anything that seems too peculiar. That is until when the game actually begins. It\u2019s not a normal card game especially when there\u2019s a strange little girl who wants to battle and grant wishes for its owner. So now, it\u2019s a game about fighting to grant wishes through battles. This however turns into a nightmare for the girls learns what\u2019s at stake \u2013 an abominable and endless mind struggle against all odds.\r\nShort for the term (Wish-Cross), the game itself consists of card games and battles. Itmight seem strange to see girls getting taking interest in a game that would be in a guy\u2019s territory but nonetheless, the major of the shows\u2019 cast are female characters. One particular character named Ruuko sticks out as an anti-social yet friendly girl living together with her grandma in a seemingly normal family. It\u2019s fate that one day tied her to enter the world of WIXOSS, after discovering a magical girl that she nicknamed \u201cTama\u201d. And if you get tired of hearing the word \u2018battle\u2019 now, then brace yourself for what the show has to offer soon. Or rather already, the beginning unveils its darker image such as Ruuko\u2019s malevolent dreams. In that dream, it\u2019s clear to know what the show is trying to do \u2013 to pull out a dark show with a game with kids. But looking it from a different angle, the show also has a purpose. The games aren\u2019t just played for bragging rights but for granting wishes. It\u2019s from these wishes where the show emerges and mutates itself into a twisted journey, one that shatters the boundaries of the card game image. But is it worth it? In some ways, but also not mind shattering as it sounds.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious to see what director Takuya Sato is trying to do here. Similar to how Steins;Gate was directed, the show moves slow with the first few episodes introducing the premise and main characters. In fact, we find out the main characters are known as \u201cSelectors\u201d, who battles to fulfill their wish. What we don\u2019t know is what the true purpose of these wishes are and what\u2019s at stake until later. To say the least, a journey into this show requires patience. Even for a one cour-split (the second half to debut later), it requires explanation. And by that, the show pulls out its classy mechanics by showing rather than telling. Here\u2019s where a technical problem comes in. While the game matches looks flashy and aberrant, they lack interest values when it comes to gameplay. Hardly anything is actually explained by the card battles itself. Whether it\u2019s the battle moves, strategies, or rules, the series focuses much more on its psychological psyche. In other words, the show\u2019s aim is to let the audience know more about the characters rather than the game itself. When you see a battle, more times or not, it\u2019s more likely you will be paying more attention to the characters rather than the game itself. Although that works out somewhat, the mechanics and focus on the game is lost with incoherent explanations, ones that can be easily forgotten simply because it lacks interest.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the interest should come to the main characters right? Well, not exactly if we take a closer look. The fighters known as the LRIG(girl spelt backwards) are mostly mindless and serves little purpose than doing battle for their Selectors. Of course, none of them receive any character development or emphasis besides their highlight reels during gameplay. But for the characters, they aren\u2019t far better when it comes to characterization. We already have the shy girl with Ruuko and really, there\u2019s nothing distinctive about her. On the other hand though, there\u2019s Ruuko\u2019s friend Yuzuki who has the social personality, looks, and empowerment to make friends easily. But what you don\u2019t know is her secret, or rather her wish that can be viewed as \u2018forbidden\u2019. And because the show has its psychological shenanigans, the story actually focuses on her progress with some rather disturbing results. It doesn\u2019t stop there though as we also meet the two-faced girl, Akira Aoi with a sadistic ambition. In the same line of work is also Iona, a girl with a lust for battle but unlike Akira, she is usually calm and confident in her skills. On the other hand, there\u2019s Hitoe Uemura, a girl who just wants to make friends. Together, they make up the main composition of the series\u2019 cast, or rather Selectors. But what\u2019s to like about them? Almost nothing. There\u2019s almost nothing relatable we can find about them besides perhaps Ruuko. It\u2019s almost also impossible to like any of the characters as they are not role models. Whether these are Ruuko\u2019s anti-social behavior, Yuzuki\u2019s repugnant wish, or Akira\u2019s sadism, none of them really can be called role models. As the show progresses, we also witness their progress, not character wise but by the effects that the game has on them. And trust me, it\u2019s not pretty.\\n\\n\r\nAnother niche about the show involves the collectible game itself. Besides the LRIG, none of the other cards are memorable or has any purpose. They are easily forgettable and when used during gameplay is hardly understandable. Ironically enough, the show attracts more female players than guys despite the dark nature. But most importantly is the concept of the game and its consequences. For behind the scenes, the consequences are disastrous for the losers. The show desperately tries to appeal to these consequences in order to draw out the reality of it. As gimmicky as it can be, the show does appeal to its darker image when certain Selectors\u2019 minds are broken psychologically from the inside out. It can be easily relatable to shows like Madoka when girls are offered choices to play out their decisions. Otherwise, the show deals with other basis of human nature and themes including jealousy, identity, regret, social alienation, and forbidden laws of attraction. Needless to say, the show is a deconstruction of magical card game. The game itself serves as a deciding factor to settle out issues because character drama seems to be the cookie cutter.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff plays the role of crafting this show\u2019s artistic image. There\u2019s an oddball here when it pertains to cute girls playing the roles of Selectors in such a dark and twisted game. The LRIG has some interesting card designs with magical girl themes. Unfortunately, the game mechanics, even when crafted visually wise is underwhelming. The battle themselves are also mediocre and can even feel exasperating because most of the time, the characters doesn\u2019t even seem to enjoy playing the game. Action speaks louder than words is usually what people would say. But here in this show, it\u2019s what the character expressions that vividly paints their lack of interest and even fear what would happen should they lose. Also, who can forget about those insanely portrayed face expressions that Akira brings to the show that goes completely against what she really is, a fashion model?\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is perhaps one of the stronger factors for this show. In order for it to work, it needed to engineer the phases between emotional, climatic, and thought provoking scenarios. Surprisingly, it does work most of the time. The eerie-like soundtrack conveys the darker side of the show effectively when utilized. And to further accompany this is the character voices that clearly reflects their despair and hopelessness in certain episodes. In particular, Hitoe\u2019s voice is very credible when it comes to her shy nature and despair. The OP & ED songs also has influence when it comes to show that the show is not a happy game about kids playing cards to kill time.\\n\\n\r\nDark and edgy, I suppose there are more words to describe what this show really is. But for a show based off a card game, it hardly even touches on its mechanics. Throughout the series, it\u2019s not surprising when you find yourself how exactly the game is played besides the most general rules. Take this more as a type of dark drama that is supposed to be character driven with Madoka-esque vibes. Of course, there\u2019s no Kyuubey but rather LRIG, those cute girls with a taste for battle. I wouldn\u2019t say the show is an abomination to card game ethnics. There\u2019s memorable moments, some battles that can be almost fun to watch, and an appealing soundtrack. Rather, it\u2019s a deconstruction for what is has offered \u2013 a labyrinth of character drama and journey on the line of mind games.",

            "content": "This season was not really full of surprises. Just as always some light novel adaptions here and manga adaptions there. What I really missed when overlooking the chart of currently airing anime was something fresh which sounded interesting. Of course being a show about a card game, Selector Infected Wixoss did not catch my attention at first at all. Only when I realized that this season isn't close to being good and I even started watching a sports anime about ping pong I thought to myself \"Hey, why not check out this anime with the cute girls playing cards?\". \r\nI can tell you beforehand, missingout on this show is not what you should!\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot focuses around our shy and modest girl Ruuko, mostly adressed as \"Ru-Chan\" and her classmates Yuzuki who get into the new title-giving card game Wixoss. But as one could think this game is not a normal card game as it nominates certain girls to become a so called Selector. These girls receive special cards called LRIGs which are inhabitated by moving and seemingly living fantasy-like girls and young women. These LRIGs can talk and have the possibility to grant the Selector to become an Eternal Girl and have their deepest wish fulfilled - if they win a certain number of games. If you lose three times though you lose your chance ot ever become an Eternal Girl. \\n\\n\r\nOf course these facts have every Selector curious on whom to trust and whom to battle. Do they want to take others wishes in order to have their own fulfilled? This aspect is treated very well by the show and isn't downplayed in a comedic way at all. The show is dead serious about what it presents and portrays the girls struggles with themselves and others very well. \\n\\n\r\nThose characters may come off as a little generic and some similarities with Madoka Magica are inevitable to recognize and to acknowledge but this doesn't make the interpersonal interactions less tense. They actually seem more relatable and easier to understand. Later on the focus on the psychological aspects come to light more and more as the show reveals its more darker side one might not have expected at first but which I kind of predicted after the immense praise this show received as it aired.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of audio-visual design Selector Infected Wixoss left a huge impression on me. The character designs are not the most original but they look different from each other for the most part instead of suffering from the common same-face-syndrome which seems to be an ongoing thing in the modern anime industry. The backgrounds also have a certain touch and the downtown setting creates a certain atmosphere which I personally enjoy a lot. Selector Infected Wixoss trumps especially with its soundtrack. \\n\r\nCreating an almost unique and eerie feeling even when sometimes just consisting of simple tunes. For a card game show the atmosphere is amazingly intense and something I did not expect when going into the show. A special shouout also deserve the voice actresses which delivered a more than solid performance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Selector Infected Wixoss was a good start to what could become a great franchise. As of now it left lots of questions unanswered which I expect to change with the arrival of the second season called \"Selector Spread Wixoss\" coming this fall. The first season though opened a door to countless possibilites to go for. I hope the creators realize the potential which slumbers in this show and come off which a proper conclusion in the end which won't just be a reset ending for example. The characters have developed very well this far and I am excited for what is yet to come.",

            "content": "I was lead into watching this show by the guidance of a certain anime veteran you may or may not have heard of with expectations that were neither high nor low. But at no point in time did I ever think Selector Infected would be bad and even after its completion I still feel the same way.  In terms of technicality, Wixoss easily outdoes many of its anime brothers and sisters, but what it has in mechanics it seriously lacks in entertainment and arguably, in originality. \r\nStarting with the artwork, SIW mirrors Madoka Magica to a tee; the opening theme, battle aesthetics and eventhe choice in font bears heavy resemblance to that of PMMM. It literally gives me the feeling of re-watching Madoka Magica and since said anime isn't even five years old (at the time of writing this review) it\u2019s a very bizarre choice in style. Does that make it a bad choice? Not really, but it certainly doesn't help refute the accusation of unoriginality particularly since most people negatively judging SIW are doing so based on face value over mechanics. \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of mechanics, SIW is indeed a card game anime but unlike most other shows of the genre, it doesn't explain how the game works. The only given details are that if a wixoss player loses three matches then she is no longer eligible for becoming an \u201cEternal girl\u201d. Yet even this rule isn't set in stone, as it\u2019s later revealed that after losing three games, a girl may still have the opportunity of being chosen as a selector. In theory, you could lose an infinite amount of times, but since there\u2019s no set number of wins needed to become an eternal girl, you could be stuck winning just as often.  \\n\\n\r\nSome argue that SIW neglected gameplay details as means of keeping the focus on the off-court drama. However, I honestly believe the decision to disregard the rules of Wixoss only works for the detriment of its entertainment factor. To put it simply, SIW lacks the tension to keep you invested \u2013 a problem that could have easily been avoided by including at least a few details of the game play.  It\u2019s hard to feel like there\u2019s much at stake when the parameters of winning or losing are barely defined, and since most opponents (with the exception of a few specific characters) aren't given much of a back story, they start to feel like nameless punching bags for the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nSo what all is good about Selector Infected? SIW does have good technical value in its use of foreshadowing and plot twists. It also makes smart use of some pretty stupid anime clich\u00e9s such as, the power of fucking friendship and sibling romance in a way that\u2019s unexpected as well as entertaining. Unfortunately, there just isn\u2019t much else going on here to make it memorable. SIW is pretty much the antithesis to other animes of its time; it outsmarts most of them, but it doesn't outshine any of them. But as previously stated, I don\u2019t think Selector Infected is a bad show and more than likely all of the unexplained mysteries of the first season could possibly make for a more captivating season two, which I will definitely be watching.   \\n",

            "content": "So recently I decided to watch the anime 'Selector Infected WIXOSS', from the outside it looks like a simple anime about girls playing a card game, however the actual anime is surprisingly a whole lot deeper and darker.\r\nThe animes setting revolves around the card game WIXOSS, the card game itself is pretty wierd and not exactly easy to understand, however surprisingly the animes center focus isn't about the card game, its about the characters playing the game and about there wishes. Now the story has it where there are people who are selected 'selectors' who are able to go through battles in this card gameto achieve there wish. These selectors find that they have a card that is essentially alive and is able to talk to them. Only selectors can see or hear them, these selectors battle each other in what seems to be a alternate dimensional world just for these battles, and basically battle each other with there LRIG, which is the card that seems to be alive. The story focuses on one specific character Ruko Kominato who is the latest girl to find an LRIG card. She names her card Tama, and without any further explanation is thrown into her life as a Selector.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does go into a darker path, with twists and tragedies happening to beloved characters which can only make you go 'Daaaaaamn', the story and setting I find are quite unique in this anime and make it quite enjoyable just to see how it alls plays out.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the series are done quiet well also, as they all seem to have a complicated life that are all connected with there wishes, which you cannot help but feel sympathy for.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime isn't as unique, however it is on par with other animes being produced recently, with some exceptions like in the card battles where the art style turns into something that can only be described as pretty.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound had no problems with the sound effects and voice acting being superb, the intro song chosen for the anime \"killy killy JOKER\" by Kanon Wakeshima, was a great choice for the anime, being one that I would personally not ever skip, it gives a true felling of what is to come from the anime, aw well as being catchy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there were some negatives, being that the card games rules aren't exactly clear to the viewers, and really there wasn't a great majority of different battles to be seen, also I feel like the story may have been a bit rushed, and could have been a bit better with a few more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, the series did end in a way that made me just want more, thankfully there will be a second season 'Infected Spread WIXOSS' which I honestly cannot wait for in order to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was quiet surprisingly enjoyable, and I would recommend everyone to give it a try, even if you're not a fan of animes based on card games, the show is done in a way that anyone can enjoy it.",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS (SIW) is the newest of a number of anime which many people claim \"Only exists because of Madoka Magica.\" Personally I don't agree with that, but just a heads up in case you get part way into this review and just write the show off because of the few similarities like many people seem to do with these kinds of shows. Yes it is a dark show with a sort of magical-girl-esque style that centers around a group of high school girls, but that's about all the similarities you'll find save a couple towards the end that only seem like they'll besimilar to PMMM. But with that out of the way, onto the real review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKominato Ruuko is the protagonist who lives with her grandmother. She has no friends and only sees her older brother when he occasionally visits. Her grandmother, wanting to help her make friends, buys her a starter pack of WIXOSS cards, a game which is very popular especially with girls. One of the cards is special and displays a moving girl who only Ruuko can notice and hear. The girl's name is Tama. She's a LRIG that only comes in certain packs and obtaining a LRIG makes Ruuko a Selector. She can fight against other Selectors in order to be granted one wish. However, if she loses 3 battles against other Selectors, she'll lose the ability for that wish to ever be granted. Because she's a Selector, she soon meets another girl named Yuzuki who is also a Selector. The rules of WIXOSS are never explained very well to the viewer, but basically the players just level up their LRIG and use a few other cards to attack their opponents with their LRIG. The actual battle logistics are pretty unimportant, and it's just the battle's outcome that really matters. As the story goes along, Ruuko faces difficulties with keeping friends, fighting off enemies, and deciding what wish she should make. And her problems are only a small portion of the psychological issues faced throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI love psychological anime, so I couldn't help but go into SIW with high hopes that I figured would not be completely met. Still (and I know I rated the show at a 5, but that's average for my rating scale and really not that bad) it turned out pretty good. This is the kind of show that, like most psychological shows, builds up tension between the characters early on by hiding parts of the story from both the viewer and the characters. With that tension comes a bit of a slow start as the elements are showed in pieces, and there are many questions this show will have you asking at first. What are the girls' wishes? What are LRIGS? What purpose is there in having this Selector/LRIG battle system anyway? Honestly, the last one still isn't totally answered, but that's why there's a season 2 scheduled in the fall. Eventually, around the last third of this season, the show picks up pace and gets intense once everything begins to fall apart for the characters both due to the situations they are in and due to psychological issues. The ending of this season is excellent and will leave you dying to know more (which means you may want to put off watching this season until the second season starts if you don't like cliffhangers).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all interesting and have different personalities and wishes. None really stood out as being anything special or unique in comparison to other anime unfortunately. Yuzuki, Ruuko's first friend, has a forbidden love that she keeps a secret. Hitoe is shy and has never been any good at making friends. Akira is a pompous idol who can't stand anyone being better than her. I found Akira annoying and was glad she wasn't as relevant to the story as the other characters. Iona is calm and calculating while hiding her real intentions. And Ruuko just goes along with it at first because she made some friends, though she soon comes to the dilemma of not knowing whether to stay as a Selector or to stop battling to protect herself and everyone else. There is plenty of drama built up over the fact that it is simple to lose your wish and right as a Selector but very difficult to grant it. There's more to granting your wish than just winning 3 times, and this creates a huge problem for the characters who feel guilty for causing other players to lose their wish.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is well done for the most part. The cute and simple character designs create a stark contrast between them and the dark world around them. The animation overall and especially for the characters improves greatly towards the end as it seems J.C. Staff saved a good portion of their animation budget for the later episodes. The soundtrack is pretty typical of a darker show and sets the eerie atmosphere well but never really goes above and beyond simply doing its job.\\n\\n\r\nWhile SIW couldn't quite live up to the hopeful expectations I had before watching this show, the end certainly did get close despite the cliffhanger. The gradual incline in information being revealed slowly began to show how much more complex the Selector system is than it was originally displayed to be. I cannot wait for the next season which will hopefully be even better than the first and I recommend this to anyone looking for a psychological anime to watch.",

            "content": "In depth review #4 - Selector Infected WIXOSS\r\nBefore getting into this review, I just want to get the elephants out the room first. Selector Infected WIXOSS is really similar to Madoka Magica. The dark themes and the situation these girls where in is just too similar not to mention. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing though since I enjoyed watching both of these anime. I just felt like I was watching something I already seen before. Despite this, I still wouldn\u2019t say Selector Infected WIXOSS is a Madoka Magica clone. This series does a lot of unique and ambitious things right on its own likeactually making a card game anime watchable so don't worry. Its also worth mentioning that there are a couple of incest themes in this anime that some viewers might not be comfortable with but i honestly think they handled it maturely. The show goes in depth about how someone might feel in this situation rather than.....well you know.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS follows the story behind a girl named Ruuko Kominato, and her friends as they play WIXOSS, a popular trading card game among young girls. At first glance, this is just a harmless game until Ruuko gets a pack of cards from her brother. When she opens it, she finds a card that has a personality of it own called an LRIG. The people who are able to see these cards are called selectors. Selectors have a chance to make any wish they want come true by battling other selectors. This seems like an amazing opportunity until these girls find out the dark truth behind this game. Like i said above, the setup for this show is very similar to another show I've watched but the plot is definitely interesting. You won't find another card game anime as fun to watch as this one. Its interesting and enjoyable but not unique. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime was good, but nothing really stood out during the scenes inside buildings and in the city. The characters animation was also good but nothing special. Just standard animation throughout. However, the battle scenes went to an entirely different level of animation. To say it simply, it was stunning and it's where the animation shined in this show. The LRIGs trapped in the cards turned into nicely detailed avatars. Even the atmosphere changed drastically to correspond to the people battling each other. The color pallet had a wide range of vivid colors to corresponding to each characters deck color. And i cant forget about the attacks. The magic used by the LRIGs looked amazing and made me yearn to see more of the LRIGs move sets.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nSimilar to the animation, the sound really popped out at you during the battle sequences. During these scenes, the music really punched you in the face from how epic they where. They used several catchy Tech based songs with orchestrated rhythms in it as well as DnB and Dubstep. Any show that has Dubstep in it i was most likely fall in love with.The music that played during the transition and in the opening/ending themes were also good. I especially like the ending song.  During the casual scenes however, i can't remember an songs off of the top of my head i liked. This probably happened since there wasn't many playing or they weren't that memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nAll of the main characters in this show made me feel differently about them corresponding to their situation. The way the behaved and how there personalities developed over the course of the show made me think about how i would act if i were in their shoes. This was extremely relevant in Ruuko, Yuzuki and Hitoe's case. I don't want to spoil anything but i genuinely felt bad about how things were turning out for these innocent girls half way through the series. As for Akira, she was a bitch, but liked her at the same time. She is like the character you don't like but enjoy seeing them mess with someone else.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 (Great)\\n\r\nI went into this anime not knowing anything about it. All i knew about that anime was that a lot of people weren't expecting it to be as good as it was, and i can see why. This anime was completely overlooked by the more popular anime this session but i enjoyed it about the same and ever more than those anime. It was a unique spin on the trading card game genre that i just have to applaud for since most of them aren't that good, Cough..Yugioh Zexal..Cough. It was interesting and made me remember how good deconstruction show actually are.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.6/10 (Good) - Worth the Watch",

            "content": "When I read the synopsis for the series I thought \"Wow, this is kind of cute - it's about girls who want to make their dreams come true~\" ahahaha... no. \r\nPlot: 8 \r\nGiven the amount of episodes the anime has, it did a pretty good job of pacing the story. It was a bit slow in the beginning, but that only allows the latter episodes to create a greater impact when the plot takes an unexpected turn. They did a great job building it up, nothing seemed too rushed and it really flowed. The increase of tension and chaos is also well reflected in thepacing as the series progresses. \\n\r\nOverall, this season did a pretty good  job on introducing WIXOSS and the mysteries surrounding it. Although there as some things that are still left unanswered, I think it's fair to leave it at that since they are giving it a second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 8 \\n\r\nThere was a lot of intricate details that I enjoyed, like the details of the backgrounds, or the decorations in the girl's bedrooms to reflect their personality. Speaking of personalization, the way they make each battlefield unique is also something worth complimenting. The fight scenes were well animated: fast paced with flashy moves. Another thing is that they didn't use a lot of still pictures in the anime~ so when main characters are being featured, there is background movement to make everything more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound: 8\\n\r\nReally enjoyed the opening. It's fast tempo seemed to deliver the struggle and intensity of battling, and the closing had a more soothing effect, which is always a good contrast. The background music was also suitable where it was used, but I really liked how they used background noise such as cars, and people talking to keep the realism going. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 \\n\r\nThe character designs were enjoyable since I don't really mind people recycling the generic images (ex. cutesy girls turning out with the worst personalities). The characters are pretty well developed anyways since we are given insight on their past and how they changed through the series, even the cards were distinct from one another. The only thing to complain about is the random little girl that was like a filler character. I had no idea what her role was... \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series was quite enjoyable and really had me hooked. Every element of the anime was quite well done, and each episode unravels a bit of information that only leads to more questions. Therefore, please give it a try~ and you just might get Infected by WIXOSS.",

            "content": "WIXOSS - a card game capable of bringing either hope or despair. Or maybe just straight up despair. \r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS is definitely a genre all in its own. Getting into this show, I was expecting it to be some sort of Yu-Gi-Oh thing, but it was far different from my expectations. The show actually has a lot of parallels with Madoka Magica (the recommendations tab will tell you the same thing) more than anything else. Normal girls who are chosen to posses mysterious powers or abilities must compete against each other in order to get their wishes granted, without knowing what they're really gettingin to. \\n\\n\r\nTurns out, Selector Infected WIXOSS is less about the card game, and more about the experience of the players - how the game is effecting their everyday lives, the emotional and psychological consequences, and their interactions both in battle, and in the real world. In fact, the real rules of the game aren't even explained, which is both valuable, but also a weakness. With too much information about the game, there wouldn't be enough development in the characters in a short twelve episodes, but at the same time, having the rules of the game explained would keep the viewer more engaged, and added the element of strategy. However, I think for the most part they made up for in with excellent effects and art that kept the battles interesting. People who are considering watching this should be aware that this show is more about the story, dialogue, and mystery rather than the game itself. \\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't keep it from having a unique and powerful concept. The viewer follows the players as they put themselves on the line for the sake of their wishes being granted. We follow them as they go deeper into labyrinth of this mysterious game and the darkness that comes along with it. Will a strong sense of justice get lost in a sea of greed? Will inner strength and willpower beat the odds of defeat? \\n\\n\r\nEven with a few story holes, Selector Infected WIXOSS delivered more than I thought it would. With great art, a enticing concept with many, many layers, this leaves quite an impact with a great cliffhanger for the second season. A decent show with some solid entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nBiggest strength: character development and concept\\n\r\nBiggest weakness: rules of the game are unexplained which leaves a few story holes\\n\\n\r\nBe aware that this show is less about the game and more about the experience of the players. Very similar to Madoka Magica. Still pretty good.",

            "content": "*May contain a few spoilers and sarcasm*\r\nFrom the very first episode I knew SIW had the potential to become a very good anime, so I kept saying \"Please don't disappoint me\" until the last episode. Fortunately, it helped.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis strange combination between Mahou shoujo madoka magica and Yu-gi-oh! was a really good one but could have been better. The plot is focused on Ruuko, a standard teenage girl with no friends, who lives with her grandma and brother. One day her brother introduces her to WIXOSS, a card game where you have to battle other selectors and LRIGs to become an Eternal Girl and haveyour wish granted. Sounds familiar? Kind of. The story is not about the game itself but the effect it has on people's lives. Just like Madoka Magica, the anime becomes very dark and sad because once you've become an Eternal girl, your wish will be granted but your LRIG will be the one living the dream and you, as a selector, become a LRIG. That's when Ruuko realizes the game is a lie and tries to save her friends, her LRIG and the whole universe.\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the anime had a lot of potenial, but at some point everything became ordinary because I could tell what would happen next. Aaaand then I watched the last episode. I was sincerely thinking that SIW would DEFINATELY end just like Madoka magica, but it didn't. The ending was unexpected, in a good way and left me wanting to watch season 2 right now!\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe art is rather mediocre. Yes, the characters are ok, but the battlefields and some scenes in the last episodes where everything is covered in white (if you watched you know what i'm talking about) really need some improvement. The sound is fine, I like both opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI really need to say that the characters are the problem here. They don't have anything special and lack development, especially Ruuko, the main character. Despite participating in the game, she didn't have a wish until the last episode. She was participating because... well I can't even tell. She is always afraid of something, insecure, naive and to simplify this: not suited for the game. On the other hand, we have Yuzuki, one of Ruuko's friends who's in love with her brother, Kazuki. Yuzuki is my favourite character because she knew what she was fighting for, she didn't care what people would think about her and she just like this she made her wish come true. More or less.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nYou have a chance to make your wish come true. Participate in the game. But if you lose that wish will NEVER come true. What would you do? This ideea is brilliant and so addictive. I guess that's why I couldn't stop loving this anime despite its flaws. I enjoyed watching the series and I'm truly happy that there's gonna be a sequel (Selector Spread WIXOSS), because this season left me with lots of unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhy 9? Well, a 10 couldn't have been anyway because I had to focus on the story and not to mind some annoying characters. I recommend this to everyone because among Gokukoku no Brinhyldr, No game no life, Akuma no riddle and Black Bullet, SIW is one of the best anime of spring 2014.",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS is what I assume is the end result of Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh! being thrown into a blender with chunks of Madoka Magica, and swirled up to create a relatively fresh and exciting take on the card anime genre. I started watching it because I saw that it was directed by Takuya Satou, one of the directors for the anime Steins;Gate, which was amazing. Coming in with high hopes, I must say that I was not disappointed.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story of Selector Infected is one that will constantly keep you guessing. The show had me consistently thinking about what just happened, and why ithappened, which is a good thing, in my opinion. A show that has its viewers on their toes is a show worth watching, and Selector Infected does a very good job of doing just that. I will say, though, that the story doesn't really kick off until around episode 3 or 4, which is something I'm not a huge fan of. Once you get passed the beginning, though, you'll find yourself thoroughly enjoying this wonderful ride of a show. If you enjoy watching shows with many plot twists, surprises, and depressing scenarios, as I do, you will most certainly find this show to be to your liking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really don't have very much to say about the art. It looks pretty, with characters being well drawn (except for their noses, I can't stand their noses for whatever reason), and the environments are colored in a rather gray, toned down way that helps emphasize the dark and mysterious atmosphere the story takes place in. While I found this to be a plus, others may find the lack of bright and vibrant colors to be a turn off, as a similar show, Madoka Magica, managed to have many colorful areas and still retain its dark atmosphere. However, I'm sure that you will enjoy the show regardless of whether or not the art is to your liking.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this show is very good. Tracks go very well with the scenes they are played in, and always manage to get me in the mood for whatever I'm seeing, whether it be happy, sad, or excited. The opening and ending themes are very well done, particularly the opening, which is one of my favorites among the other spring 2014 season openings. Character voices are also very good, with the voice actresses managing to convey the emotions the characters are feeling quite well, particularly Ai Kayano, who played a perfect Hitoe that had me feeling for her the most out of anyone. All in all, the show did a very good job in the sound category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Selector Infected are very well written. Characters introduced receive a fairly large amount of development, with each one having different motivations for battling as Selectors in this world. As a result, viewers may have a hard time picking a side, as the show presents the characters in ways that make you feel for all of them. This character style is one that I believe to be one of the best around because of how important each character becomes to the show, and is something a congratulate this show on doing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really like Selector Infected WIXOSS. For me, it reminded me a lot of Madoka Magica in terms of story elements and the dark and depressing atmosphere, which really enhanced the experience for me. Every twist it took made the story that much more intense, and before I knew it, I was eagerly awaiting Thursday of each week for the next episode. Needless to say, I really enjoyed watching this show, and can't wait for the next season this fall.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS- A deconstruction of the ever popular card game anime genre?\r\nNot really\u2026But does it even matter?\r\nPutting the Madoka Magica comparisons aside, WIXOSS is a show that tries to smother the viewer with an array of emotions, as well as unfortunate plot points, bringing up in me that \u201cone\u2026more\u2026episode\u2026\u201d feeling. Yes. WIXOSS has many aspects which make it an enjoyable work that can/will leave one questioning the moral standards of the issues presented. On with it, I suppose.\r\nWithout rewriting the synopsis above, we know that the characters in the show play a card game called WIXOSS, however some girls become \u201cselectors,\u201d and are throwninto some special circumstances. That is all I shall say regarding the story- this show is definitely best viewed if one knows little to nothing about it, as the twists and surprises will be that much sweeter. However, I can comment that the quality of the story is very good in this show. This can perhaps lead to an explanation of my opening- the card game aspect seems to exist for the sole purpose of being a vehicle for the story. There is nothing wrong with this, as it does the job nicely. The story provokes the viewer into thinking about the show, from character motivations to the consequences of decisions. While it may throw around classic tropes, or be slightly hard to understand- the story of WIXOSS is well done, and this is largely due to the array of characters in the show.\\n\r\nWhat WIXOSS does well with its characters, besides using them well in conjunction with the story, is the emotions they seems to create in the viewer. It is very easy to feel some sort of emotion to each character- you may despise one, feel pity for one, care for one, etc. This vital interaction between the viewer and the characters are very important in the psychological genre, as the connections you form with them only heighten the drama and suspense of the issues they come across. With their array of personality, as well as the emotional attachment with the viewer, the characters in WIXOSS become an integral part of the story. Unfortunately, some characters receive little screen time, and some are easily forgettable. However, this issue will be discussed shortly. \\n\r\nThe characters and story both are portrayed very well by the visual and artistic direction here. What I particularly enjoyed was the differences in the world when a normal situation was occurring, as opposed to a dark, negative situation in the story. The art truly did reflect the state of the characters. Technically speaking, everything was up to standard- art and animation were mostly consistent, although I wouldn\u2019t say they were stellar. The same can be said for the musical score, attributed to Iuchi Maiko, of \u201cA Certain Magical Index\u201d fame. Some tracks certainly stand out more than others, however I must commend the high energy tunes used during the battle sequences. They certainly provide a high note in a score which is fairly normal otherwise.\\n\r\nSo\u2026I\u2019d if you reached the end of this review, I\u2019d like to leave you with this- you should probably watch this show. While I don\u2019t feel this classifies as a true deconstruction, (Because the card game aspect is really only used as a vehicle for the character\u2019s motivations and the story, it is not truly explored) this show was highly enjoyable for me. If you make it through the first season, the second, Selector Spread WIXOSS, is slightly different in approach and style, especially regarding the characters. However, I will not say too much regarding that- the WIXOSS series is enjoyed the most when one knows nothing about it. So go forth. \\n\r\nHave fun.",

            "content": "This has got to me among the most pathetic anime in existence, and I say this because Selector Spread Wixoss tries to be suspenseful, dramatic and edgy; but at the end of the day it ends up being dreadful, pathetic and honestly atrocious from beginning to end.\r\nThe story starts simple: A girl meets a magical creature that promises her a wish, but what she never realizes is that the price for her wish would cost with agony and despair\u2026 or at least that is what the show wants to be.  Instead, the show relies too much with victimizing their main protagonists, to the pointthat it feels almost forced. The narrative of the events they go through felt rather stupid (i.e. Akira stopping three teenagers from getting away from her), and the drama is as flat as a pancake (i.e. Tomoe\u2019s sad story of not having any friends). And because of such, some of the plot-twist and plot-points are very unoriginal. In fact, this show used to make me angry for trying to rip-off a better show that came out a few years before this one\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than getting upset by how this show is an obvious knock-off of Madoka Magica, I dislike how they tried so hard to make care for the characters in WIXOSS. I mean sure, the girls were going through some crazy stuff, but I found it extremely hard to root for characters that are selfish, generic or down right boring. Ruuko was as bland as grits, Tama is completely dumb, Iona is a boring villain, Akira is a c*nt, and the rest of the characters are forgettable. But the uninteresting characters is not the only reason why I disliked the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to their awful to almost-non-existent personalities, the girls ask for some of the most retarded wishes that they could easily achieve without magic. Moreover, the wishes for some of the main characters are both gross and selfish, like wishing your sibling to fall in love with you. Now, I know they are young, but who would ask for some silly wishes? Come on\u2026 And asides to all of the character\u2019s wishes, the lesbian undertones (or should I say overtones) were highly used for the sake of fanservice (specially Iona\u2019s dialogue), and it completely derailed the mood of the show. (i.e. \u201cLet me do it with you Ruuko\u2026\u201d)\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing I can think of the show is the art style it had (the calm colors, the paintbrush textures and dark color schemes), but that is not saying much. In fact, sometimes the art would look rather tacky (Specially when they would try to put too much shadows in a bright day). And the soundtracks for the show really didn\u2019t fit with Wixoss, specially the electronic/dubstep tracks.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting nothing from the show, if anything, I was hoping it could blow the expectations I had - just a simple card game show for kids. Sadly, it made me feel just nauseous after watching the whole season, specially that last episode. The show tried too hard to be edgy and it wants us to care for characters that are bland/selfish, leading to an abomination of a show. I warn everyone to to stay away from Selector Spread Wixoss! \\n\\n\\n\r\n*Extra Notes*\\n\\n\r\n-Why does it always have to be the girls who get to have magical powers? Come on people, I demand gender equality! \\n\\n\r\n-Ruuko\u2019s granma is the only somewhat cool character in this show! (Probably because she is the one who is not stupid)\\n\\n\r\n-If I had a dollar for every time they say the word \u201cBATTORU!!\u201d\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-Most of the LRIG\u2019s costumes look either bland and boring, or completely slutty\u2026 UGH.",

This trading card game was known as Wixoss, she soon discovers that she was a selector, and that a selector is a female player who can see special LRIG cards having minds of there own, that will play with otherselectors and must defeat a certain number of them (number of wins will vary person to person) to become an \u201cEternal Girl\u201d whose most desired wish will be granted to reality. If a selector loses three times, she loses the right to be a selector, and becomes a normal human. Let the battle royale of  Human Trauma begin. \\n\\n\r\nI can put more detail into that, but it would be spoiler territory, so take this weaker explanation of the Synopsis as a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nFor a mystery thriller, Wixoss holds that quite damn well, it starts of decently, and gradually builds up to an intense climax while it gives characters enough screen time and motivations for us to at least some-what care that these people are going through some very rough times. It deals its themes with a surprisingly great deal of maturity for something that looks moe. It discusses moralic themes about the characters actions and motivations. If for an example, this character is very strong always winning the hardest battles, but ends up having no wishes, then it becomes a morality issue stating that if battles are the best pieces of life enjoyment then should'nt you call quits for the suffering of other selectors? Or is the action of incest wrong in every way, therefore the character questions the value of there wish while still trying to feel like a normal being. Concepts of human psycholgy being explored in a mature manner makes us take this show seriously, and leaves an impact by the characters actions and with a (mostly) intense and gripping story that always keeps viewers fascinated, then its obviously a damn good show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I would ever try my best to round of the cast, they seem to lack depth, back story and development is fine (50% of the time) but my biggest gripe I could really think of is that I really desired the characters to become more complex, deep and understanding. In a way they feel a bit too simple for the shows darker themes and intense build up as an actual thriller. It would really make a better show if the characters are even more complex and organic. I always start lowering my expectations if any show starts using archetypes.\\n\\n\r\n However, the story is better than I thought it would be, it really gives You the feeling of this show being this intense thriller having loads of mysteries surrounding itself as the show progresses on climax you get some level of impact as mysteries reveal themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI would also love to give kudos on the animation (not something that I do very often)  by J.C Staff, there work on giving the backgrounds this line and wash feel makes it stand out a bit more, and this very slight artiness feel kind makes me like the show more. However, the battles with the LRIG have a bit too much CG on the back round which makes me a tad more nit picky. Speaking of nit picks, they don't really explain the strategies on what the girls are doing, like power up! And then kill this character, and it it kind of looks stupid sometimes... Though I do forgive that mistake because the show is incredibly well driven through via narrative, that, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Music wise, nothing special except for an above average opening and great ending.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nThe second season is likely to very bad, but because this show is a bit more on the underrated side, then maybe Just Maybe we could have a decent sequel. 80% chance that this show is going to flop, since Autumn is right around the corner... Will it be good? I won't be surprised if neither happens.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6.5/10 For characters lacking real depth, but have good themes which the show handles maturely. (unfortunately not all characters are like that)\\n\r\n7.5/10 Some parts of the story are a little corny which prevents it from an 8 but overall, damn good thriller.\\n\r\n7.5/10 The animation is line and wash and gives this older show-like feel. Extra Kudos to J.C Staff.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE 7.5/10",

            "content": "This a newly edited review of this anime, 3rd time in a row, (upon the mods insistence), Bueno let's get down to business:\r\nWhat we have was a card game themed anime with a shoujo element in it where them girls were involved in some strange card game where the stakes are high and the price for losing or winning are huge. At this point one would wonder as to why them girls choose, most especially the MCs, would still play it, even though they may not get exactly what they wish for. Besides, the true title of the series is \"Wish- Across\". Now I admirethe author's creativity when it comes to giving this series' title \"Selector Infected: WiXOSS\", which basically means that the selector who happens to be a LIRG holder gets infected with the price of playing the game and it just so happens that it a girls only club. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime, well... really doesn't dig in to me, in fact I really don't like the way Ruko's school uniform design is. Though I think, it is only Iona who is the bomb in this series. Also, I hate the way them LIRGs were illustrated, especially Iona's LIRG were it looks more like a mummy than anything else. I like the opening theme \"Killy Killy Joker, \" but much the closing \\n\\n\r\nNow among the characters, Ruko really pisses me off, she basically is this naive girl who can't seem to make up her mind so much that I would really like to give her a karate chop on her head, Tama her LIRG was pretty much a retard..... a very dangerous retard that is, Yuzuki with her intense brocon was too cliche her LIRG Hanayo is a bitch, too bad Yuzuki's onichan was too stupid to even notice the personality changes, Hitoe was pretty much oblivious that she can have friends without even getting into that WIXOSS thing. About Iona and Akira, well they were pretty much the characters I hate the most.  \\n\\n\r\nNow how enjoyable is this? Well, I guess this anime is \"FAIR\" enough to be enjoyed, because it wasn't much a card theme anime, but rather it was more of a melodramatic anime where the consequences of bad choices destroy lives. However, the conclusion will be in season 2, how will it be, is yet to be shown. \\n\\n\r\nSo, here are my ratings:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory- Very Good 8.\\n\r\nI gave it such score because of the authors creativeness in using terminologies like LRIG, where if one is stupid it is actually spelled \"Girl\" in reverse and the sub title \"\"WIXOSS\" which is a Jap shorten term for \"Wish Across.\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- Poor 3.\\n\r\nI don't like the school uniforms that them MCs wore and I certainly don't like the way them LIRGs were illustrated..\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- Good 7.\\n\r\nIt's for the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Poor 3.\\n\r\nAs said before, the characters are annoying, then again, they're entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Fair 6.\\n\r\nIt was entertaining, but such enjoyment can only be enjoyed when season 2 comes around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Fair 6.\\n\r\nI'd say that it's \"Fair\" enough.....for now or until season 2 comes around.",

            "content": "Selected infected the anime that takes the fun card game genre, then breaks it down and gives it a fun outer appearance with dark insides.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is the best part of this anime as it takes a popular genre in this it is card games and deconstructs it while giving it a dark theme similar to Madoka Magica. The story is primarily about the main character Ruuko being chosen to become Selector in the card game WIXOSS, to which the story focuses on her darker inner self enjoying the battles for fun rather than wanting to become a eternal girl which creates a darksetting that is enjoyable and interesting. But the story is slow at the start and is hard to get into until you reach episode 4 or 5 which can cause you to drop the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art in the anime is nothing special and is comparable to K-On as they have the same style, but the card battles are good and nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound okay it is neither awesome nor crap; it fits the show well especially the opening and ending that have a dark and depressing feeling to them but I didn't really find them nice to listen to and were skipped every time after the first ep and were not worth downloading.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters of WIXOSS have varying personalities that include nice and sweet to depressing to downright insane which seems unbelievable to there cute appearances in both the Selectors and LRIGs. There were no archetypes in this anime like Tsundere or anything like that as they felt quite original to me which also brings up the character development some go through a lot character development like Ruuko and Yuzugi which refreshes the show more while some don't like Akira and Kazuki who rarely appear despite being listed as Main.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed it but it was a slow start.\\n",

I know this sounds awful and maybe there\u2019s a red dot aimed at my head at this point, but bear with me.\r\nThere\u2019s little to be gained in an anime about card games and stuff, they\u2019re usually for kids and merchandising and what not, and that\u2019s exactly what you could except of Selector WIXXOS (if you know nothing beforehand), but the moment you realize you\u2019re watching an intense pathetic (pathos related) drama about young girls striving for seemingly impossible desires on very private standards, you realize that their suffering is so relatable\u2026 maybenot in contents but in intensity.\\n\\n\r\nSo they play this card game because it has some magic power capable of giving the winning player the realization of a desired wish, this comes with some rules and limitations not worthy of description because they only work for the sake of the argument of the series, just say that those limitations work perfectly for a twist or two. In this context the five main characters see themselves in a mixture of situations where their wishes get mixed up and tangled with their lives as they struggle to make sense of it all in a variety of ways, form social norms to morals and self realization\u2026 with a little bit of craziness. The key element is the paradoxical nature of the girls wishes, that in more than one sense, clash with either their lives or with the world in general, and leaving a nice space for interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing in Selector WIXXOS but the intensity of suffering, even if the motives may seem unrelatable or mundane, the whole premise of the series works with one purpose, and that is giving the human drama an intensity that is not necessarily there, but it\u2019s certainly needed. In other words, we love to see them girls suffer, because we do too suffer from the mundane and the sometimes socially inadequate propositions of our desires, we like them to suffer for us, we like them to build this church of suffering because we need a place where everything seems worthy of being the object of our dramas\u2026 even if they seem not to be dramas at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Selector WIXXOS is a solid constant trough its entirety, always pushing the drama to a, sometimes polemic minded, interesting extent, it has strong characters, enough plot mysteries, and the awe so loved human pathos we expect from a series this kind. \\n\\n\r\nSo I loved that the girls suffered, for their suffering was not an empty message for me at all\u2026 cool, eh?\\n",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS was really good. It was basically the JC Staff version of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica but don't think that it was a complete ripoff just because that's the way I put it. Really, it shares a lot of aspects (Selectors are all girls just like Magical Girls are all girls of course, they can get wishes granted, can become tainted by their wish, must keep fighting). WIXOSS however is a card game where the girls don't usually lose their lives however some girls suffer fates worse than death. For example one girl's wish was to have friends but when her wish becametainted, not only did she lose the friends she made already but she was also never able to make friends ever again and was put in excruciating pain if anyone being friendly touched her. In WIXOSS, girls who get cards with LRIGs are the Selectors and LRIGs grant wishes but do not tell the full details as to how wishes get granted and we'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful. Ruko is a sweet young girl who's shy and cute and likes having fun but clearly has something weird going on with her past because she was given up by her parents and forced to live with her grandmother. Her friend Yuzuki is strong willed, her friend Hitoe is shy but very nice and you just wanna root for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was great. The opening theme \"killy killy Joker\" will be stuck in my head for a long time and will go down as one of my favorites. The ending theme had a dark inflection with descending tones. The music of the show was pretty normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was just great. It wasn't brightly colored which went along with the subliminal dark theme of the show. The fighting between the LRIGs was very fluent and cool.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show you'll see things like bullying, incest, heartbreak, near mental breakdowns. It's all good stuff. The only problem I'd say is that it's not emotional enough. It didn't pull the heart strings nearly as much as I'd hoped like Madoka did.\\n\\n\r\nI DO recommend the show though. \\n\\n\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS: 8.5",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS gives the impression of being like another fantasy, girly-girly game anime. WIXOSS is a card game played by teenage girls and boys alike. A few girls that obtain a special card with a so-called LRIG, are called Selectors. Selectors can play with other Selectors in a special battlefield that they can only see. Yes, cute girls playing cards. Or that's what I thought...\r\nAfter a few episodes, I was hooked. I liked the fact that I was confused, I was puzzled, I was thinking. I was thinking why there was a vague explanation of the whole game. And just when I thought Iunderstood it, another twist happened. I also like the pace of the development of the characters. It's neither slow nor rushed, perfect for 12 episodes. There is also this taboo part of the story that for the first time, I actually liked because they portrayed it very clean, not forced, and not in a disgusting way. In the end I was wanting for more. One thing I was particularly annoyed about were the characters' voices, maybe because there were at least 2 characters that sounded alike.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime because it teaches a lesson that you'll only realized at the end.",

            "content": "Up until now, we have the deconstruction of mecha anime (Neon Genesis Evangelion), oh and lets add the deconstruction of magical girls anime (Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica) so lets talk about the deconstruction of card game anime (maybe, not that serious as the two animes above), Selector Infected WIXOSS.\r\nSo, SIW's premise is about Ruko Kominato, your typical loner girl that have no friends. And one day, while having dinner, her older brother gave her a box of cards called the currently famous WIXOSS card game played by girls and boys. By her surprise, one of her cards talked! And here, we will know the untoldstory of the mysterious card game and the Selectors.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there goes the saying \"Story may be deceiving\". If you really thought that it would turn out to be your type of Yu-Gi-Oh anime, then you are wrong. This is a split-cour anime so just go with the flow. Story wise, Mari Okada who is known for Anohana and Nagi no Asukara creates this series together with the Director of Steins;Gate (I don't remember the name, so sorry) in this studio, J.C. Staff so be aware again with this two.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing in this series is that the fact that you get this Madoka vibes because of the twists and some of the characters and maybe that's true but I really don't want to compare this two, I really like Psychological genres and BOOM!\\n\\n\r\nThe art, itself was not so awesome but pretty mediocre to my eyes. There are parts that dark scenes are pretty dark and white scenes are pretty white so I can't see it that well. The action scenes is a lackster in this series, the card games also just lasted for a minute or some seconds. And lastly, the series not explained that well the rules of playing WIXOSS but maybe, thats because they more focused on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the outstanding thing here is the sounds though it was not that noticeable. I really enjoyed the BGM when there is a battle and some dramatic thing. The Opening theme got me really and have an LSS on it, the Ending theme is really good too. Really can't say anything about it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the characters. This is a con to the series because the main character, herself was not really relatable and not developed that much. There are some characters that I found developed and they are Yuzuki and Hitoe. Now that I think it, Yuzuki is not likable in the first half due to the fact that she lover her twin brother, romantically. And Hitoe just wants friends but really don't have confidence. But now, they really stands by their way that really make me happy about them. Iona and Akira was not really likeable and pretty mysterious and never developed. And the cards, well, mixed emotions. I like them but at the sometimes, I disliked them.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I had a heck of a ride from Selector Infected WIXOSS. There are some elements that I didn't liked about this series but still, a blast and the plot twists from it is enough for me to give this show a high score. Some may agree and some may not agree but if you like dark animes, try this one. I surely hope that the second season would not disappoint. You have my respect, Ms.(or Mrs) Okada.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show has just ended, and it\u2019s turned out to be much better that its title. Moreover, it\u2019s one the best animes this season. Yeah, it\u2019s about girls playing a card-fighting game. Seriously it is.\r\nIt may seem strange based on the synopsis, but the plot itself keeps you on your toes. Sure thing, it often lacks some crucial parts, however, as the story resolves, you get more questions you truly wish to be answered. The weirder it feels when in the end you get no answers AT ALL. Like, they are realizing the sequel this autumn. Well, has there been a sequel \u2013 the storywould get a plus. Nothing as for now.\\n\r\nThe characters, sorry to say, are kinda one-sided. Everyone has their prescribed role, and they act it out without any stray. Some just do exist while almost not adding anything up to the course of events \u2013 yet, again, the trailer promised us lots of changes. Well, it\u2019s the second item you can\u2019t put a good mark on based on these 12 episodes solely. The characters have a way to grow up, but now they have a minus.\\n\r\nThe world itself is good, and the better it gets as the truth behind the scenes unfolds. I liked the mechanics behind the normal people interrupting the battles. The very card game, to my mind, is rather boring, yet it\u2019s well-watered down with \u201cpew-pew\u201d on the battlefield. The dimension \u201con the other side of a card\u201d is very intriguing and unexplained, and< I nedd to say, it actually counts as a good one. After adding everything up, it\u2019s a plus.\\n\r\nThe world itself is good, but is slightly illogical. You know, this ain\u2019t no math to forbid things and then violate them saying \u201cah, sorry to say, they can do it in the calculus thing\u201d. Some aspects are made in a naively-innocent manner at start to cause a bigger shock on the viewer later on, but that self-proclaimed ignoring the very basics of logic by the creators can\u2019t make you happy. However, hopefully, this problem will get a descent solution in the sequel (too many hopes for this autumn, don\u2019t you think?). In the current state, it\u2019s betwixt and between.\\n\r\nBut excuse me; there is a thing I should praise over and over in this series \u2013 the technical part. The opening and the ending bring up only the most pleasant emotions, without making me feel like turning the volume off or closing my eyes. The girls are drawn in line with the K-ON! Standard, which is actually not bad. But the thing I liked most is the background music in the last episode, it has all the rights to hog into my everyday playlist. The impression could be worsen by the acting part, but that\u2019s not happening \u2013 everything is on par. Without a doubt, it\u2019s a plus.\\n\r\nAt the outlet, we have one really enjoyable anime, which has its own charm and style, despite the main idea\u2019s triviality and platitude. It\u2019s of that stuff which makes itself by its way of showing off some nice picture and storytelling (the first half), then suddenly starting surprising you (the second half). That\u2019s why you can ignore some flaws of it.\\n\r\n6/10, it was a pleasure to meet you. \\n",

The rating is solely for first season alone. \r\nIn more than a decade I have seen many card game base titles that focuses mostly in promoting the product than making an actual plot or real characters to care about and sadly mostly those titles target demographics arelittle boys that are meant to be mind control for them to beg for their parents money or ask them to buy this cards. One anime did that tactic very well and that is Yu Gi Oh Duel Monster for perfectly appealing its target audience to buy the cards for childish logic it\u2019s cool and awesome. But is that a basis of a good card game show? Does card game show need to sale big to be credited as a good title? For me, it\u2019s not good if you are watching the show not because of its character and actual story, then you are just watching as T.V commercial than an actual show. And let\u2019s be honest we just watch Yu Gi Oh to see what\u2019s card Yugi will use and you will find that card and buy it and eventually use it to feel like you are that character. This is prime example of good marketing strategy not a good story presentation.  I won\u2019t expand this further since this is not the anime I will focus reviewing on.\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time focus on my main review on \u201cSelector Infected Wixoss\u201d. How is Yu Gi Oh short preview relevant to this Selector review? Simply because Selector Wixoss is the very first serious card game anime title that has ever been release. Yu Gi Oh also made the card game genre look serious but in a mature perspective it\u2019s ridiculous. Saving the world with a bunch of card is a child fantasy that adults or mature minds like me won\u2019t buy as a serious story. Selector in the other hand is very different. The anime focuses on the internal conflict of its character that blends very well in the story progression.   The card game Wixoss is only a decoration and a plot device to create a trigger for the story to move forward breaking the boundaries of expectation on most people who have already encounter the card game formula stories.You don\u2019t even need to know the rules of the game to understand the main story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you asked me personally Selector Wixoss caught me off guard. I thought it was just a card game show that\u2019s promotes the game but I was wrong. After watching the initial episode and reach the middle I concur that this anime is indeed special. I never expected J.C stuff to be serious in making an actual story about this franchise and it earns my highest respect. Take account J.C staff made tons of forgettable adaptations so I rarely expect them to make any special anime especially it\u2019s a card game base adaptation so there is no source material that the show can base its Plot and actual characters. This is now a matter of talent and good directing.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Entire Overview I segregated the Elements of the series in 4 categories, Plot, Characters, Music and Art. This element will affect my overall score of the show. My enjoyment is a personal rate so even if I liked in the bottom of my heart, it won\u2019t affect my actual score and so my score is base on the actual quality and substance the anime have.\\n\\n\r\n(Plot 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Wixoss as I stated in my introduction is original. It doesn\u2019t have any source material to base from unlike adaptation of mangas, video games, visual novels and light novels the studio and the creator have the right to follow the original story to be adapted or not follow the source and create a different story which make it an original. But Selector is a special case since it source material don\u2019t have any actual story in it because it\u2019s just a card game. They can use the existing cards to create the avatars but the core characters and main story is something that is very hard to establish. Good directing and talent is needed to create a successful original story. I will inform you guys as an extra knowledge, not all anime originals ends up to be good story usually anime originals have the biggest chances to fail since unlike adaptations that have plot source on it, source materials plot have more time to be created than anime originals. An author or video game developer have a huge amount of time to construct a story and characters and will just worries the additional continuation that will be added eventually when the author would like to extend the story more and the preparation can be planned from start to end without any deadlines. But when an anime original project starts a short amount of time will be given to plan the story from start to end with the deadlines pressuring the production. This is why I am very impress on how Selector Wixoss turn out.\\n\\n\r\nGoing deeper in the topic, let\u2019s tackle more about the actual plot of selector. The story revolves around Kominato, Ruko an introvert girl which has no friends and lives with her grandmother and big brother. One day her grandmother gave her a deck of cards to help her earn friends by playing with the other girls and befriends them. Wixoss was once a popular game for boys but as the passing of time it became very popular to the girls, But unexpectedly a girl suddenly awakens from the inside of the cards her grandmother gave her and immediately the card started to talk, this card are called LRIG\u2019s\u201d, and this started Ruko\u2019s path as a special player called a \u201cSelector\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nIn the long run ruko met other girls that have similar LRIGS that revealed that the simple card game that is primary purpose is to make wishes come true have darker truths. The simple and innocent card game became something darker and psychological. It\u2019s not a simple card game to fight for your wishes anymore but a battle that determines your ideals and desperation to counter fate. In a few episodes the psychological parts of the anime greatly immerse with the plot and as the more details have been uncovered about the card battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe stake got higher in a considerate way that will keep you intrigued in the outcome of the conflict. Selector Wixoss are one of those rare types of stories you won\u2019t get very much in every season in modern anime. The story is the first is left incomplete and a cliff-hanger is expected but the enjoyment of the quality of the plot just sums up the enjoyment and make it worth waiting for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAll the main cast of the series are likable for the reason even there is a cute girl pandering on their looks but it didn\u2019t dominate their actual personality as a normal teenage girls undergoing puberty and social conflicts with society. I don\u2019t see them as 1 or 2 dimensional archetypes that stay like what they are from the first and last episode. The characters are not dynamic but just alright to add the tension of the show. There is nothing much to explain about them to prevent further. (I won\u2019t break down the characters yet since there is an S2 that cop with the whole character development and fleshing out).\\n\\n\r\nMusic (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Opening )\\n\\n\r\nKilly Killy Killy Joker by  is clearly an awesome opening for Wixoss because it represents the excitement and thrills the show has to offer.  And I see it as a fine job in making viewers hooks on the events of the show. I really love classical music and this opening is the best for bringing out classic music with modern pop style. Every time I hear it in my earphones it really reminded me the excitement wixoss has provided me with.\\n\\n\r\nBackground Music(BGM)\\n\\n\r\nBGM is properly executed. At times of serious battle we get this funky retro music that spices up the battles and at times the BGM shift to a more serious tone when the psychological mentally is taking place. The BGM is not that unique to any card fights and psychological theme anime but when it is done right I can denied to rate it very good.\\n\\n\r\n(Ending)\\n\r\n\u201cRealize\u201d by Yume no Matsu Basho is something that is extraordinary for an ending in nature. Unlike the opening and BGM, the ending didn\u2019t give me the excitement or tension instead it intrigued me to understand the mystery of the setting. The song \u201crealize\u201d is giving some kind of message on the mystery aspect. But in reality some are just design background of the city no need to over think here. \\n\\n\r\nThe last image of the ending video shows a central building and a little girl it has a meaning but I won\u2019t spoil you guys to know the message beforehand. The message is easy to depict as you just need to go on with the series so chill with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt style (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe cute girl pandering I mentioned before is something that seems out of place in this type of genres. The girls here are pretty cute and moeish in visuals but it didn\u2019t damage the show overall because the grayish dark colors of the background gave the thrilling psychological atmosphere. And in default the girls are not acting cute. So my conclusion the girls are not what they seem to be. \\n\\n\r\nAnother commentary I can give is on the battlefields where the actual card game battle took place. The area is just Ok even its visual is very similar to other magical girl theme series which uses grayish and metallic gears as background to depict tension.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the movement of the characters here are not \u201cExaggerated\u201d. You won\u2019t see any physic defying movements here, only in the actual battlefields where LRIG\u2019s are fighting each other. Does this make the show boring? It made the show even mature and serious. This is why I like it so much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nLet this score be my personal enjoyment of the show. I really love a properly executed story with plain but extremely relatable characters. The characters are not cool but they surely are respectable girls. The studio didn\u2019t make an obnoxious fan service out of their panties or a yuri to add some flavor.\\n\\n\r\nSubtle emotion shift is properly made because it doesn\u2019t shift tone from serious to normal very fast which most anime do for comic relief. And lastly this is the very first serious card game theme I ever known of that is suitable for mature audience. It\u2019s fresh during the time it is made which made me appreciate it more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nI think J.C Staff should be making more of this kind of titles. I don\u2019t mind the \u201cMOE\u201d art style as long as the story and characters are properly executed to the point even the people who dislike this type of anime themes will appreciate it. \\n\\n\r\nSelector proves that a good show doesn\u2019t need a lot of fan service to keep the audience watching. A good script writing and directing is the key to hook the audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(Personal Opinion)\\n\\n\r\nMy idea is a minority outside the Japanese target audience so my opinion is not the majority of what the japenese audience like. I like fan service too but not too much but the thing that hook me from anime are decent shows with incredible story and respectable characters. If the fan service is too overblown to the point the only thing I can remember are bloodshed, the boobs or the underwear the female\u2019s are wearing this mean I only see the anime for guilty pleasure not its actual content. Take this as an advice. I am not against in people liking fan service oriented shows but as I grow mature I see decent shows more worth remembering than any other. \\n\\n\r\nI wish we get more shows like Selector Wixoss coming up every season. Decent and respectable characters are the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u2018I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking!\u2019\r\nThis line taken from a brief flashback of main character Ruko sums up my thoughts on Selector WIXOSS\u2019 writer, Mari Okada. At the surface, she\u2019s made a show about granting wishes through a children\u2019s card game, and if I had to summarize the theme, it\u2019s about reaching your goals through your own power. That said, if you were going to watch this show for tense, tactical, turn-based card play, look somewhere else. You\u2019ll find none of that here.\r\nNo wait, the story does have a lot of tension thanks to its music track. While there aren\u2019t many pieces, the music that\u2019sthere is distinct, ranging from loud and bombastic battle themes, to slower, incomprehensible messes of static that would be disturbing even without the story to accentuate it. It also has a solid grasp on the art of silence. From time to time, even the more ambient tracks are absent entirely and the show lets the story speak for itself; the scene in the second season\u2014which I\u2019ll call Spread\u2014where Ruko, Yuzuki, and Hitoe are having a heart to heart in a restaurant is especially powerful for it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t always use its soundtrack to the best of its ability at some really crucial moments. While it\u2019s fine in the battle scenes and the build-up leading up to them, some of the moments after the fact don\u2019t work as the music is overplayed. Of course, this overplaying wouldn\u2019t be noticeable if the suspension of disbelief were kept, but this is where the show starts to fall apart. And really, there\u2019s deeper problems at work than mistimed music.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems\u2014at least with the first season, which I\u2019ll call Infected\u2014is Tama. She\u2019s childlike, speaks in the third-person, suffixes nearly all of her dialog with \u2018BATTLE!\u2019, then turns around in her mood and priorities in one episode. While there is some attempt to show her changing, it\u2019s already halfway through Infected. With a character like this who\u2019s going to be lacking inner thoughts, showing the change gradually is crucial. While I would give her a pass because shocking events can change someone, it would really be a disservice to the characters who are handled correctly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd despite my initial doubts, main lead Ruko is surprisingly one of those characters. At first, there\u2019s really nothing to her and the story can meander because of it. But, this is intentional, as the way Infected picks up steam reflects the way Ruko slowly finds her purpose. And this happens twice. While her newer reason for playing WIXOSS\u2014the titular card game\u2014is typical \u2018save the world\u2019 fare, her first reason touches on something rather disturbing, that might have actually explained why she is the way she is at the start of Infected. Sadly, the story doesn\u2019t elaborate on this. Still, \u2018missed opportunity\u2019 isn\u2019t the same as \u2018bad.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nBut for Yuzuki, \u2018missed opportunity\u2019 is the same as \u2018bad.\u2019 See, she romantically loves her younger twin brother Kazuki. But, she\u2019s afraid of what the stigma surrounding incest would do, if she were straightforward with her feelings. Thus she partakes in WIXOSS to make her love come true. Yuzuki herself, forbidden love angst aside, is personable, clearing the air with her friends when she needs to, and plays the voice of reason especially in the later parts of Infected and most of Spread. Even then, the story remembers she\u2019s still a teenage girl, bringing in harmless banter with Ruko and Hitoe from time to time. Yuzuki is nothing if not believable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Hitoe, she plays WIXOSS because she wishes for friends, but before her battles can really get going, she hits it off anyway with Ruko and Yuzuki. Unfortunately, she develops almost as fast as Tama, going from meek to strong (relatively) without much in-between; her angsting before her rapid rise in resolve doesn\u2019t count. Shaky development aside, though, it\u2019s that moment where she becomes stronger that really marks the birth of her fire-forged friendship in Infected, with Ruko and Yuzuki, that burns well into Spread. And it needs to, considering what the three friends learn about WIXOSS.\\n\\n\r\nWIXOSS itself is a card game, but there are special cards called LRIGs\u2014Tama being one of them\u2014that can talk with girls. These girls are called Selectors, and they fight each other to become the Eternal Girl. The Eternal Girl gets her wish. However, if a Selector loses three times, she loses her right to the wish. But, there\u2019s more to the Selector battles than meets the eye, and I\u2019m not talking about the ill-defined game mechanics; the battles themselves aren\u2019t meant to be taken literally. They\u2019re simply vehicles to move the story.\\n\\n\r\nBecause more than a dark interpretation of the card game genre, Selector WIXOSS is a deconstruction of the power of wishes themselves. If you reached your goal without the normal work needed to get there, would you truly have achieved it? Can you set your mind free to do what you believe to be impossible? Through careful story development, the show asks these questions not with words but through its characters\u2019 actions. It makes most of them\u2014at least the main characters\u2014compelling enough to warrant the musing, rather than their personalities bending to drive a question home.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the main characters, while Ruko, Yuzuki, and Hitoe aren\u2019t spectacular individually, together their fire-forged friendship creates a bond that I can only describe as authentic. They\u2019ll banter about pointless things like ice cream, they\u2019ll support each other through and through as Hitoe will attest, but they\u2019re also willing to reign each other in when one of them gets ahead of themselves, as Ruko and Yuzuki learn. The later parts of Infected and most of Spread spend its time around this trio, and the story is all the better for it.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to the side characters, who are anywhere from well-written like Fumio to completely stupid like Akira. Now, Akira is a great villain in Infected because she reflects pettiness and shallowness so well, it\u2019s when Spread tries to make her character deeper that it ends up sinking her. There\u2019s also the hyperactive Chiyori, whose quieter side needed to show up more to make her development believable. Introduced late in Infected is Mayu, whose development in Spread is last-minute despite her importance and screentime. And then Ulith, who replaces Iona as one of the forces to fear during Spread.\\n\\n\r\nIona herself is a single-minded side character in Infected, but develops as she joins the main cast during Spread. Her purpose in battling can be summed up as self-satisfaction, but she slowly finds another reason to fight. As she spends time with Ruko and her friends, her mentality is steadily less selfish, her person more approachable, and her strength even greater (literally and figuratively). And she defrosts at nothing but a believable pace, going from temptress to motivator to redeemed over the course of Spread. If Tama is a major reason Infected is held back, then Iona is a major reason Spread is that much better. She\u2019s by far Selector WIXOSS\u2019 best character.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Iona also introduces a new conflict of sorts for Ruko. While Tama during Infected reflects how strong Ruko can be when things are going her way, Iona during Spread mirrors how Ruko learns to cope when things are not in her favor. It\u2019s a much needed dimension to a character who was otherwise too strong to consistently create tension around. Another problem is how the story struggles for shock value subtlety. At times the foreshadowing toward certain events is barely noticeable until after the fact (the opening scene in Infected), and at others it\u2019s literally a character saying nothing will go wrong (and then something does).\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I mean when I say I don\u2019t know what the series\u2019 writer, Mari Okada, is thinking. The drastic quality differences between the characters make it obvious when Okada puts a lot of care into the work, and when she\u2019s merely moving the story. Some parts of Spread are hard to care for as they focus heavily on Ruko and Tama\u2019s friendship, and the latter lacks development. The foreshadowing itself is also too obvious at many points. Now, a sense of inevitability can work, but the overall cast would have to be at least solid to make the obvious event a truly dreadful experience. But solid the cast is not.\\n\\n\r\nNot helping matters are the visuals. Not just how drab the coloring is despite the colorful LRIG designs, but from the visual direction itself. While I\u2019m not expecting the most stunning choreography during turn-based battles, I do expect to see some creativity with the effects. Unfortunately, for all the cards the Selectors have, most of them amount to beams and barriers only distinguished by color. And no, the visuals themselves don\u2019t have to be drab to match the story\u2019s mood; look at how vibrant Death Note and Texhnolyze are despite the limited color palette.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my rather negative tone, though, the visuals aren\u2019t bad. They\u2019re just severely lacking. And if nothing else, the new character design for Tama during Spread at one point, combined with Misaki Kuno\u2019s voice work, serves to make for a legitimately terrifying character. And speaking of voicework, special mention also goes to Ayane Sakura (Yuzuki) and Asami Seto (Iona), as they display a lot of range within the voice of the same character. Chinatsu Akasaki also really shines as Akira, seamlessly shifting voices to very disturbing effect.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s just a shame Selector WIXOSS isn\u2019t as seamless as Akasaki\u2019s voice work. Heading into this show I expected character exploration and a dark atmosphere. What I didn\u2019t expect were dropped story threads and undeveloped or rushed characters, leaving the story\u2019s mood to feel forced at points. It certainly made for a unique experience, but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. Still, it mostly plays its cards correctly despite the mess caused by the shuffle, and that\u2019s all I can ever wish for.",

            "content": "Selector Infected Wixoss or Selector as I'll refer to it from now on, drew me in almost solely on it's name, it sounded so bizarre to me at the time that I almost had to watch it, that and being a fan of games like Magic the Gathering and the Pokemon TCG when I was younger I figured maybe I would enjoy it . The first thing I have to mention is that they give youlittle if not absolutely no explanation as to how the card game (Wixoss) is actually played, which you might think is a bit strange for an anime centered around agame, and rightly so. It seems they decided to skip Wixoss' mechanics all together in exchange for a more character driven and more emotional plot, where the story centers highly around what happens after battles and the consequences of having them, instead of the battles themselves. The animation is very well done, the backgrounds are especially beautiful, and the characters all look great. I do have one caveat with the animation though, the noses always seem to be weirdly animated from the front, this is true with almost every character, the noses seem to always be drawn in a different shape or angle, which is confusing to me because the rest of the faces always look perfect. The characters are really what drive the plot of Selector, and having them battle for their wish with the battles not actually being focused on the mechanics allows for there to be some character development for almost everyone, even if only a little for the supporting characters. By the end I found myself sympathizing strongly with many of the characters and their wishes, and I feel like that's important to mention. The big issue that Selector has is that by the end the story has become quite convoluted and we're left with many loose ends and unanswered questions, essentially it's a huge anti-climactic and unfulfilling cliffhanger. By the time I'm writing this review there is already a sequel planned for Selector this fall season, but I don't and never will feel that ending a season in a cliffhanger is a good idea, it makes the viewer feel like they're being lead on in hopes of something better next season, leaving them unhappy with it as an overall experience. Selector was a show that I actually enjoyed watching the whole way through, I enjoyed it  because of the card game theme, and because it reminded me heavily of Madoka Magica. Despite my personal enjoyment Selector does have some glaring flaws that I can't ignore, and for that I've chosen to give Selector Infected Wixoss a 6/10, slightly above average.",

            "content": "As a big fan of the Madoka series, I was looking for an anime series that is somewhat or almost similar to Madoka Magica. Welp, I found it and it feels very similar to Madoka Magica. This is also not a happy card game show. How similar could it get? Like I said, very similar and I won't consider it a Madoka rip-off because it does its own things that differentiate it from Madoka.  I won't compare the 2 shows anymore. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nWIXOSS is a card game that's popular with teenagers. Supposedly there exist \"LRIG Cards\", femalecharacter cards with wills of their own. Special girls can hear the voices of the LRIG's, and those who possess them are called Selectors. These Selectors have card battles in a dimension that other humans cannot access. Ruko Kominato is the latest girl to find an LRIG card. The name of her LRIG card is Tama, and without any further explanation is thrown into her life as a Selector. \\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the story? Is it good? Of course, it is. Ruko received an LRIG card, which is read GIRL backwards by the way, from her brother. Soon thereafter, it is revealed that she been chosen as a selector and she can become an eternal girl which grants any wish that she desires. You become an eternal girl if you win a certain amount of battles. How many exactly? What happens if you lose 3 battles? What exactly happens if you become an eternal girl? Watch the show and you'll find out that it's not as straightforward as you might think. *Hint.. Either way, you're f*cked up*. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's pacing is......let's just say, it's unbearable...for a 13 episode series. The first few episodes is slow. The plot seemed like it didn't move anywhere and it didn't even explain how the card games actually work. By the time I was on the 11th episode, there were a lot of unanswered questions and at this point, I didn't really get what was the point of the slow pacing at the start. Then you find out that the story will continue in the 2nd season. Clever move, J.C Staff. The plot holes alone could have made me hate this show but because they were going to continue the story in the second season and how dark the anime gets after the first few episodes, I'll give them a pass. \\n\\n\r\nWhat exactly makes the show good? It's the dark mystery surrounding the Selectors and the LRIG's. It's not all about the card game. It also explores the character's feelings towards this \"evil\" card game. That's right, the show is mostly character driven story. More will be explained on my \"Characters\" category. There's also that goddamn incest. Why do most animes these days include incest? What's so special about incest? It's disgusting. However, at least it shows that most characters don't accept it. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe animation looks good to me but there are issues. The environment looks bland. It's like they've been coloured in by a 4th grader. You know when you colour something and you see those white spots around? That's what it looks like. The character designs, however, looks great. If you have seen a J.C Staff anime before then the character design is almost the same. The battle scenes are pretty smooth but they don't really last long. As long as they're smooth, I'm ok with short battle scenes.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, in my opinion, is awesome. The background themes that plays during the action scenes are....let's say, they are well orchestrated. \\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"killy killy JOKER\" by Kanon Wakeshima and \"realize -Yume no Matsu Basho\" by Cyua. The OP theme song is one of the best OP I've ever heard and it will be put into my favourite OP list. On the other hand, the ED theme song sounds horrible. I listened to it for about 30 seconds then I just decided to end the video. Mostly because of the singer's voice. I just couldn't handle it.  \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA. In my opinion, they all sound great. I did have some few issues with Ru's VA because she sounds monotonic sometimes but she still did a great job with Ru's character. This is also FUNimation's Dub so it shouldn't be a surprise that their English VA sounds great. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (9/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nJust like Madoka, this show has a strong characters. In other words, it focuses more on the characters than the actual plot itself. You have the 5 main characters which is Ruuko, Yuzuki, Hitoe, Iona and Akira. Out of the 5 characters, I only like Ruuko, Yuzuki, and Hitoe. I don't even know Iona's main purpose? She keeps babbling non-sense about Ruuko like she knows her or something. I'm going to assume that it's going to be answered on the second season. \\n\\n\r\nAkira is just a spoiled ass b*tch. I have nothing to talk about her. You know what, I have time. Let's talk about her. She's a spoiled ass b*tch who has a nice personality and nice look on the outside but acts like some rich-ass girl when she reveals her true personality. She got what she deserved when her wish got corrupted.  3 of the remaining main characters are pretty good. Rukko is a new girl on the city who doesn't like making friends because she thinks it's unnecessary. A completely likable character if you ask me. Yuzuki is a girl with a goddamn mental illness. I lied, she doesn't have any illnesses but her love for her brother who happens to be her TWIN is just disgusting. Her wish is to make her brother fall in love with her. What the hell Yuzuki? Potential wasted. Hitoe is a shy girl and she also just moved in to the city. Rukko is also new to the city so this worked on her advantage and got a new friend...which is her wish by the way. Too bad her wish got corrupted and this is where the show reveals its true nature. You know what's funny though, the way they solve their conflicts feels similar to Madoka Magica. Ruuko is a Selector who doesn't have a wish. Later on, she figures out a wish to \"save\" (not) everyone and et cetera, et cetera. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also some of the side characters which are surprisingly good. For example, Ruko's grandma supports her in time of her needs. Awesome grandmother if I say so myself. There's also the whole conflict between Ruko and her mother. I guess that explains why Ruko loves her grandma so much and hates her mother with a passion. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the LRIG. A talking girl inside a card which only Selectors can see and hear. Sadly, the show doesn't focus much on the LRIG and they're not that developed either. Again, the LRIG is similar to Madoka Magica. Since I put a spoiler tag on this category, I'm free to spoil the reality of LRIG and who they really are. In short, they are former Selectors. My, My...that feels so familiar. *cough Witches are former magical girls cough*. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nIf you stopped comparing the 2 goddamn shows then you'll like this show. You'll probably love it too. That's what I did and I enjoyed the show.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.4/10)\\n\r\n\"Selector Infected WIXOSS\" is, overall, a good anime to watch. I don't really know why some people hated it but I don't. I'm actually quite surprised that I even liked this anime. Aside from the fact that it feels similar to Madoka Magica, I hate the \"card\" genre because it's f*cking stupid. This is also why I hate Yugio with a passion. Thank god the show is more focused on the characters. This is not an anime for everyone. As a fan of both fast and slow pacing anime, I was able to handle the excruciating slow pacing of the first few episodes. It's also a dark anime show so just give it a try. One last thing, if you look at the show on its own and prevent yourself from comparing the anime to Madoka then it's a pretty good show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Story\\n\r\n+Well-Done Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Story is more dark\\n\r\n+Card-Battles are smooth and great to watch\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-One of the plot points is incest\\n\r\n-Slow pacing at the start\\n",

            "content": "STORY\r\n   Selector Infected WIXOSS, is a dark show, and I knew that as soon as I saw the first episode. While the show covered things up with its somewhat up beat disguise; the foreshadowing of the major tone shift could be seen. This isn't really a bad thing as it doesn't really ruin anything in my opinion, because when the shift happens you can still feel the impact of it. \r\n   It turns from a cute card game show to a show dealing with a number of themes. Themes such as incest, family relationships, loneliness, hate, and of course friendship. Whilethese themes are explored well in my opinion, especially incest. Though my main problem with the execution is that to make these themes work, the writer had to sacrifice logical things a normal person would do. For example, why would these girls do anything to just please Akira. I know she's a popular, but they take it waaaay too far. I mean these people are acting like serial killers here.\\n\r\n   Plus I felt like the anime took up too many themes for a 12 episode anime. I mean it does a really good job giving focus to each theme, but in the end they didn't really go as far as I would have liked as a result.\\n\r\n   While I do think the execution is a bit shaky, what we got was still pretty good. The pacing is just right. It wasn't too fast that I couldn't absorb the info, but it wasn't too slow either. The story the show told was engaging, and while I could guess what was going to happen a few times, I wasn't 100% right most of the time. As for the conflict, it's an internal conflict is mostly about the choices out main character, Ruko was going to do about these games she was thrown into into. While it felt a bit more like a conflict out of a magical girl anime, it was handled with a psychological edge to it. Plus the awesome directing also helped greatly.  \\n\r\n   Overall, really engaging, despite the lack of logic for certain segments. I could overlook those moments, because they weren't related too much to Ruko's conflict.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n   If I could describe how I felt about this cast in one phrase, it would be above average. I like most of the characters, and the only one I truly didn't like were the ones without explored motives. Characters like Akira. I can somewhat see a broken character in her, but the picture failed to fully developed because she motives weren't explored. Like why does she hate Inona so much? Cuz she's more pretty? Cuz she's more successful? Maybe, cuz she has some kind of past relationship with Inona? I don't know, and I could maybe only find out the the next season. Though, in this season, while I found Akira amusing in the beginning; she slowly started to be annoying. \\n\r\n   As for our main characters, they were likable, and I was invested in their conflicts, and I could sympathize with them. The one that I liked the most however, is Ruko. Her uncertainty through the journey is typical, but I liked how it was done. I related to it, to a very stretched extent. She doesn't know what to do, but there was one thing she knew. She loved battles, and it's this conflict against her desire that made me like her as a character. \\n\r\n   Though, I was disappointed in how we don't really get know know any LIGS characters, besides Tama. I mean they served their purpose and that was it. Hanayo seemed rather interesting, as we don't really know if she's happy in the position she is in.\\n\r\n   Overall, the cast has its up and downs, but in the end shines with its main cast.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\n   Animated my J.C. Staff, this is very surprising. As, from what I have seen from them, they don't make anything too stand out, in terms of animation. (Not to say they're bad, cause there're not.) WIXCROSS, has very good animation. The fights look really good, and while I do think the card game aspect limits the direction, they are exciting enough to watch. Though, what really stood out to me is the tone. The colors of the characters; bright and colorful, contrasts the dark tone the backgrounds give off. Which is fitting, for WIXCROSS. Although, the character designs are very forgettable, and their noses bothered me. I mean the noses looked fine from the side shot; up front it looked like a hole, rather than a nose. Overall very exceptional, and is a stand out for J.C. Staff in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\n   The music is... okay.... I mean nothing really stands out. Besides the dub step that show up in battles. Which is fitting, but forgettable. Even though the music itself was forgettable, the way it was used was nice. Sometimes during scenes, the music would just stop, letting the silence to either sink in, or to break tension. Though, right after, the music resumes, bring you back into the action. This helped made many scenes very memorable. Though, what I have to note is the opening. Sung by Kanon Wakeshima, it's super nice to listen to. Although, I like the second season's opening a lot better, this song was nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n   Though this show has flaws that I couldn't ignore; I enjoyed Selector Infected WIXCROSS. So, much that I wished I could give a better score. Though it's not perfect, and it's not for everyone. I mean if you can't take incest, or can't overlook the problems described, then the show isn't going to be for you. Though, there is one last problem, no, nitpick I have. I felt like story could have just ended at the final episode, though I realize that would leave too many questions. The story could have just ended there, and I personally would have been fine. Because the characters were tied up enough, and I was satisfied. Although, that's not saying I think the second season is going to be bad. In fact, I hope for the second season to fix some of these flaws present in this season. So, let's hope for the best.\\n",

            "content": "I wanted to wait until I've seen the second season, Selector Spread WIXOSS, to write this as it seems clear to me it is a direct continuation without much of a pause between the two shows, but I decided I'd have to take a break, not being able to handle anymore of the series for the foreseeable future. This isn't because I don't enjoy the universe, in fact quite the opposite (more on this later), I just needed a break and didn't want to forget too much about the specifics before writing this. \r\nUltimately, Sector Infected is a decent show held down by a myriadof pointless baggage. I originally watched the first episode of it in Spring 2014 when it was first airing. I set it aside, intending to come back when I had a season that I was watching less. Due to a long break from anime, that wasn't until now. WIXOSS, at first glace, appears to be a show about cute girls playing card games. What wasn't to love about it? I quickly found out: a lot. \\n\\n\r\nExamining and explaining the story without spoiling it is difficult, but I'll try my best. Overall, I enjoyed the concept and the path that the plot took. But like I said before, I feel like it is weighed down for absolutely no reason. In terms of what I enjoyed, while the plot was predictable it was still entertaining. I found myself almost excited to see what happens next, eagerly moving on to the next episode. With all of WIXOSS' flaws, the story was still intriguing enough to make me want to keep watching, which should of course be its first goal.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall concept is intertwined with one prevailing theme: the greed of almost every single character, the exclusions at times being the MC and her close friends. While this could be interesting, especially when you factor in the goal of the WIXOSS card game and why it is that girls are going forward with being Selectors, it essentially just becomes a boring plot device rather than saying anything compelling. The show offers no insight on human greed and offers no answers to it, merely using it to propel the story along. Why are all the characters acting like terrible human beings? Because they want to get something out of it, giving them a reason to be in the situation they're in (not a great answer IMO). In my opinion, a theme in an narrative work should do more than just, well, exist. There's nothing that made it stand out or make me think about the series more. Perhaps the second series utilises this better, but for now its simply uninspiring and frankly quite boring. \\n\\n\r\nLike a lot of contemporary anime, WIXOSS consistently attempts to mind fuck the viewer with its twists and turns. The problem though is that these twists are easily predictable and often seem pointless. Of the numerous times that the show tries to drop a bomb on audience, I was surprised a whooping 0 times. All these twists do is detract from any development and attempt to hide the show's lack of depth behind them. It's as if the creators somehow think that they can substitute character development with something sp00ky happening to one of them, even when that character almost fails to even react, accepting whatever happened as fact and failing to grow. The writers' attempts to be edgy has gutted the show's potential and left it with little to keep it standing. \\n\\n\r\nThe show looks like 70% of all other contemporary anime, failing to stand out. The battle animations look decent at times, but it shows little flair and again wastes the potential it has. You would think that would be one of the highlights, but the battle scenes are rather lazy at times and nothing to write home about. There was just not enough complexity or depth to make it impressive. While the different LRIG's designs could be cool, they were often boring and uninspired, the opposite of what shows that try to sell a card game should be doing. The real world character designs were meh as well, none of them really standing out. They look like what you'd expect out of any generic high school anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound design is probably the category I had the most difficulty defining, not really making a strong impression on me in any way. Maybe I just wasn't paying attention, but there wasn't much to say about it one way or another. The voice acting was what I expected out of a girls playing card game show, while the soundtrack was forgettable. Truthfully, this aspect of the show played little into my overall rating of it. But I suppose that best sums up WIXOSS mediocrity, there simply wasn't much there.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character, excluding the MC for the most part, is so one dimensional that it hurts to think about. Every character is motivated by one simple goal and lacks any sort of humanity, touching on the aforementioned theme of the show, having it substituted by unyielding greed. These goals completely dehumanise 80% of the cast and make it difficult to empathise or even like any of them. This isn't just the case for main characters who are playing the WIXOSS game, literally every single character except for the one male high schooler is willing to step on anyone to get what they want, even if what they want is a ridiculous cause to tread on someone's humanity. Sure, everyone knows that high schoolers can be unforgiving, but at times it just becomes ridiculous and hard to watch. While attempting to show the dark side of humanity and its greed, all WIXOSS has shown me is how lazy they were with fleshing out their cast. It wouldn't have been too difficult to demonstrate some kind of internal struggle, expanding on the theme of greed and contrasting it with characters who are willing to sacrifice personal gain for the greater good, but we simply never see anything of the sort. Instead all we get is a very basic thematic structure that rigidly defines almost every character and how they interact with each other, making it even more predictable and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC does sees some development, but its superficial at best. She changes very little, and when she does it was hard to even make a comparison with her from before the change as it didn't do much. Most of this development also happens in the blink of an eye, stemming from her finding friends and becoming less lonely. The show lacked any sort of change and development over time, the most being the weird motivation of really wanting to be in battles but going nowhere with it. The show is constantly alluding to there being more to her without ever actually demonstrating it, devaluing her to being driven by one of the most boring character traits that could be imaginable in a show like this. Bloodlust, or however you'd describe her constant need to fight, can be an interesting aspect of a character, but not when they lack any depth or personality outside of it. The only other trait that the MC possesses is the desire to keep her grandmother happy, which is also pretty lame. While some of the MC's close friends do sort of kind of change through the show, these changes are simply predictable and follow the logical path for that character and what their singular goal is. These changes also don't really qualify as growth, more as lateral changes in how they react to the events in the world around them. Not much is done with the characters of WIXOSS, leaving them to be husks with little development and giving me no reason to care about them. \\n\\n\r\nWith all these flaws, I still however find WIXOSS somewhat enjoyable. It's not a super fun show to watch, but the potential for the devices to be used effectively remains, making me come back for more. The show may be lackluster in many departments, but there is still enough mediocrity left standing to keep you reasonably entertained. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, WIXOSS is a show with a lot of problems but just enough answers to make it watchable. The story is underwhelming at times but still holds together somewhat, with the art and characters trying to do the same. If I was on a deserted island and could only bring one show to watch, WIXOSS would not be anywhere near my first choice. BUT it still brings enough to the table to warrant watching it, assuming you don't have much else to do with your time. While it doesn't have much to say, it can still be enjoyable to a reasonable extent.",

            "content": "Wixoss was one of the only spring shows that I watched all the way through - although having said that, I don't think it quite reached the heights that it had set itself. The anime was released as a tie-in to the card game from which it draws its name, so the creators must have been banking on a surge of popularity on both fronts - which had quite a profound effect on the content of the anime.\r\nFirst of all, one of the pivotal aspects of WIXOSS is the characters. It's clear that the intention of the writers was to have the viewer focus moreon how the game of WIXOSS affects the characters and less on the game itself. To this extent the anime succeeds, as most of the characters, while somewhat clich\u00e9d, are fairly fleshed out with clear motivations and goals. Yuzuki's character in particular is the root of an interesting subversion of the popular incest trope, wherein it is portrayed in a substantially more negative light than in other animes. However, it is possible here to draw parallels to another popular anime, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika. This is particularly noticeable with Ruuko and Yuzuki's characters, who mirror Madoka and Sayaka's characters respectively. Ruuko and Madoka both, for example, start out as seemingly normal high school girls with no particular aim while apparently possessing a surprising amount of latent strength, eventually being driven to destroy the very game that they are trapped in. To this extent, it seems the writers tried to play off of Madoka's popularity while being unable to substantially differentiate their own story. That being said, this isn't necessarily a problem since the characters are still reasonably well written.\\n\r\nThe audio design is another area in which I feel the anime succeeds. The majority of the soundtrack itself is fairly melancholy and mellow, which fits the overall tone of the show quite well and I adore the slightly detuned honky-tonk piano that\u2019s very prominent throughout. I can\u2019t say much about the OP and the ED because if I\u2019m perfectly honest I can\u2019t remember them very well, which I guess is a bad thing. I\u2019m sure they were perfectly fine, though. The use of eerie whispers and laughter, most noticeably in the next episode previews, is superb \u2013 although sometimes the most effective use of sound is when there is none at all, which lends emphasis to certain pieces of dialogue, making them all the more pointed.\\n\r\nThe art direction is also very nice. While the animation is fairly standard, the backgrounds are drawn very well. The prominent use of watercolours and the sparseness of fine details lend the backgrounds a sort of fantastical, childlike feel, which in a sense reinforces the fantastical, childlike foundations of the selector\u2019s aims.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t step around my biggest issue any longer - the plot. The majority of my issues come from the biggest plot device, the game of WIXOSS itself. As many others have said before me, the anime does not adequately explain the rules of the game, and every battle seems to operate in a different manner to the last. This, in fairness, could be explained away by the assumption on the part of the production team that most viewers would have knowledge of how the real-life card game works, or would at least be interested enough to go and buy a WIXOSS set and find out for themselves. Even then, though, the card games shown in the anime largely don't seem to have much underlying logic to them. For example, an early fight has an instance where one of the combatants wheels off a number of devastating attacks apparently all within the same turn. Later, the fight between two other characters involves the two firing off attacks as quickly as possible with no apparent order. This incident in itself is incongruous to the apparent skill required to play the game because there doesn\u2019t appear to be any sort of strategy behind either of the character\u2019s moves. The bigger issue of this, however, is that there are various plot points that are muddled and lost because the mechanics behind them are not explained, like the exact win conditions of the game or what the exact punishment for failure is (we see this happen twice, and the end result varies wildly both times.)\\n\r\nArguably though the bigger problem is that, apart from their wishes, there is no real reason for the characters to be fighting each other. There is no looming threat or malevolent force that is pushing every single selector to find and battle other selectors - we are given no explanation to the purpose the LRIGs and selectors hold, which ultimately detracts from my enjoyment of the anime because central conflict appears to be completely pointless. Even in lieu of the fact that there will be a second season airing soon, the fact that the meaning behind the conflict hasn\u2019t been established is confusing at best. Even more confusing is that throughout the anime none of the characters were shown as wanting an explanation \u2013 which, considering they\u2019re fighting one another for normally impossible rewards, would surely be one of the first questions they\u2019d want answering.\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that Wixoss is an anime which would have benefited hugely from trying harder to do its own thing. The foundation for a classic is there \u2013 but I can\u2019t help but feel that what we actually got is merely a retread of what other animes before it have executed much better. Of course, this entire review could be rendered completely unnecessary with the advent of the second series, but for now it feels as though it tries to take from the giants without fully understanding why they became giants in the first place and ultimately ending up more forgettable because of it.\\n",

So WIXOSS was something I was going into with very little knowledge but, I heard it was a dark edgy show and I am into those types of shows. The story was great and it was all original so I don't have many complaints there. The Animation for the card fights were great but, in the real world it lacked a little but, not enough to really take any enjoyment out of the show. The music was AMAZING and its something I listen to daily. The only complaint I have about this show was one character Ifound to be a \"useless\" character I will not say there name but, if they were to remove that certain character nothing really would have changed. Overall I enjoyed this show and it almost made me cry at times, making me feel so sorry for the characters. I am pumped for the next season and I hope this helped you guys!",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS gives several twists on the classic \u201cCard Game\u201d anime. The card game itself is not explained in detail, but the basics are fairly obvious as more battles occur. However, the anime is not focused on the actual card game, but more on the lives of the Selectors that are in possession of the LRIG cards.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You want a dark fantasy version of the card game genre. If you are not a fan of card games but enjoy the psychological genre, check out Selector Infected WIXOSS. If you enjoyed Madoka Magica, you willlike Selector Infected WIXOSS. It is basically the same plot, but with a card game instead of magical girls\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You want a light-hearted anime that will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside after each episode.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Do not be fooled. Even though the Selectors are younger girls, this is an anime with some mature themes.",

( i won't tell what kind , cause that would be a spoiler ) overall the characters , evenif they look generic ,  i loved the design to bits, especially the main character. she seemed like she was a dere type , but there is something different to her. which i have yet to see ( i only finished season 1 while writing this review )\\n\r\nthe anime is really enjoyable to watch , the opening was very very nice. the music during the battles fit perfectly. the voice acting is good as always , i almost never have complaints about that. i'll give you a warning though , if you can't deal with stress , don't watch this cause there are some people in this anime that will piss you off and make you smash their faces. ( which doesn't really happen in the anime except for that one....oops not gonna spoil that! :D \\n\\n\r\nI most certainly recommend this anime to people who normally don't like the genre , this will give you a entire new way to look at the genre. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves my 9/10",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHave you ever played a trading-card game like the one in Selector Infected WIXOSS?\r\nI used to play the Pokemon TCG, and by \u201cplay\u201d I mean I liked collecting the cards and putting them in binders. I did not understand the rules (and I never took the time to learn them), so I simply collected. Dark Charizard, Ancient Mew (the one from the first movie), and the various Gym cards were my calling.\r\nI also played Yu-Gi-Oh, but, again, \u201cplayed\u201d is just another word for \u201cwhining to our parents to buy my brother and me cards forcollecting.\u201d I remember during one Christmas (and I kid you not that this is a true story) when my brother got an extra, random pack of cards from my parents that they had bought on a whim. Inside was a card called the \u201cThousand Eyes Restrict,\u201d the rarest card in existence at that time. I was so upset (and immature) that I started crying. I ran downstairs to wail in torment \u2013 not the proudest moment of my life.\\n\\n\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS is certainly about ultra-rare cards that make one cry. But the crying comes about for an entirely different reason.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nWIXOSS is not just the title of the series but also the name of the trading-card game within the anime. Meaning, one would think there is some importance to the cards and the game itself. And, to a certain extent, one would not be wrong. General rules are provided, the settings are established, and the outcomes are influenced.\\n\\n\r\nYet the mood is awry; something feels off. Strangely, full games are hardly shown, and, in some instances, certain duels are never shown at all. It quickly becomes apparent that WIXOSS, the card game, is just the backdrop. What truly matters is the in-between details. Two of the girls conversing in a library. The feelings one character has for another. An expression of emotion during the games themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThat awry feeling turns to reality when WIXOSS reveals the cruelty that lay hidden behind the cuteness after its first plot twist. And the twist is cruel: it is about as opposite as one can get from a fairy-tale adventure. But the show does not stop its cruelty there. Instead, WIXOSS unveils another plot twist later on \u2013 a \u201creversal of fortune,\u201d so to speak. Taking both twists together turns the narrative into a horrible, vile, and cruel offering.\\n\\n\r\nDo not misunderstand; this cruelness is wonderful. It is wonderful because, despite the twists being slightly predictable, tainting an idea that is almost always painted as angelic invites the audience to view said idea from a different perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThis new perception challenges the audience to consider what drives people: friendship, love, and jealousy just to name a few. Yet WIXOSS does not stop there. It also challenges the audience to consider what one would be willing to do to make their dreams come true. Maybe it is having the courage to talk with strangers. Maybe it is admitting one\u2019s actual feelings. Maybe it is selfishly trampling over others.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the cruelest part of WIXOSS, though, is how these motivations and this willingness mean nothing. Characters that try and fail are punished, and characters that try and succeed are punished, too. It does not matter who is involved; misfortune befalls everybody. The notion that thinking and doing nothing is the best option \u2013 especially considering Ruuko\u2019s disposition \u2013 is an enticing one. Not just because the narrative makes this notion clear but also because that lifestyle is the only way to never get hurt.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this hurtful sentiment stronger than with the ending. The conclusion to the first season is harsh. It is frustrating. But it is necessary. Yes, the conclusion aligns with the overall mood of the anime, but, more than simply fitting the mood, the conclusion drives home the cruelty. Someone may have the purest of intentions imaginable, but this mindset does not exempt him or her from tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nTragically, WIXOSS is not without its faults. Hitoe essentially getting cured is contrived to the point of unfairness, ruining the effect the choices and rules that the anime itself established. Also, in episode four, Ruuko getting chased around the school (where a random student insults the teacher when she says, \u201cShut it! Scrub-face!\u201d) is a bit too silly.\\n\\n\r\nStill, WIXOSS executes a lot within its first season, setting up the continuation nicely enough.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more obvious artistic choices that WIXOSS makes is the lighting. More specifically, low lighting, cloudy days, and an emphasis on the evening and the night keeps everything dreary in a natural manner. The color choices do this, too. Lots of grays, blacks, and browns subconsciously keep the mood dreary, matching the anime\u2019s own tone.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a subtler artistic choice that is even stronger than the lighting or the coloring. Many of the locations visited are very constrained. Alleyways, warehouses, and apartments are nicely detailed and somewhat rough in appearance. Better yet, they are claustrophobic in feeling. This is purposefully and expertly done: It is not until the WIXOSS battles where the claustrophobia is dropped since the playing field opens up entirely. The purpose is to show that the characters, and by extension the audience, do not feel at ease unless WIXOSS is being played.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is a peculiarity of the art. Throughout WIXOSS, the show places emphasis on the tram system. This includes showing the fast-moving tram from the outside, the characters riding the tram on the inside, and the entrance and exit to the underground where the tram is located.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does WIXOSS do this? Trams symbolize moving forward from one spot to another. But the interesting (and relevant) part is that the movement is not controlled by the rider; the movement is controlled by an outside source. And thus the purpose for highlighting trams is revealed: Ruuko and the others play WIXOSS, believing that they are moving towards their dreams on their own, when in reality their moves are controlled by a force larger than themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation and the character designs, both are fine for what is provided. The animation does not do anything too fancy except for during the WIXOSS battles, but, even then, the fights are not that intricate since it mostly comes down to lots of explosions.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice in that they are not overt in their details. Ruuko\u2019s side ponytail adds cuteness so the audience feels sympathy for her. Hitoe\u2019s glasses, drab clothing, and tidy hair reflect her mature disposition. And Yuzuki\u2019s hoodie gives her a metaphorical way to hide from the looks of disgust that people throw at her.\\n\\n\r\nThe only glaring issue with the character designs are their noses. They are often malformed in appearance, giving the characters some strange looks. But given everything else the art offers, this is a minute grievance.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSymbolism is almost always wonderful to include. WIXOSS realizes this, so the anime includes it with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the (main) characters has a specific color that their WIXOSS decks revolve around. Ruuko\u2019s is white, symbolizing purity \u2013 in this case, \u201cpurity\u201d means \u201cnot having a wish of her own.\u201d Yuzuki\u2019s is red, symbolizing love, passion, and anger. These are emotions she goes through throughout the season. Hitoe\u2019s is green, symbolizing friendliness and peace; a perfect color for the friend-finding and calm girl. Akira\u2019s is blue, symbolizing her cold, icy behavior. And Iona\u2019s is black, symbolizing her wicked ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe symbolism is nice because it adds depth to the characters without explicitly stating anything \u2013 showing rather than telling. But there is more to the cast besides symbolism. In regards to the narrative, the anime has a character representative of each side of the conflict. Hitoe is the character that plays the game, discovers she no longer has to, and then loses, falling into disrepair to show how horrible losing actually is. Yuzuki is the character that wins, demonstrating what \u201cwinning\u201d actually entails. Akira is the character that constantly wins but never has her final condition met. Iona is more or less the main antagonist of the season. And Ruuko is the character who the audience uses to observe all of the different sides at once. In other words, WIXOSS is exhaustive in the possibilities that its story can generate.\\n\\n\r\nOn symbolic and narrative levels, WIXOSS performs well. The anime, however, starts to falter slightly when characters are looked at individually. Some of the weaker members of the cast are Iona and Akira. Iona does not have enough screen time to really be considered a worthwhile antagonist let alone the final boss of the season. Akira has troubles of her own, and she even gets to a pretty low point in her life. Yet the anime mistakenly does not conclude her conflict. Presumably it will be taken care of in the sequel, but leaving her character and her actions up in the air only hurts her character development.\\n\\n\r\nHitoe is not a subpar character, but Hitoe is not a strong character, either. She starts off in a dire spot herself. Having moved to a new place and unable to socialize with others, she finds herself alone. Or, more contextually, she has no friends to call her own. So she plays WIXOSS. In time, Ruuko and Yuzuki befriend her, so she no longer needs the game. But when Iona forces her third loss, the audience sees what becomes of someone in her predicament.\\n\\n\r\nShe undergoes massive trauma, but she does not undergo development. She continually seeks companionship, even when she is in her broken state. She just does not know it then. At the minimum, she pushes herself, trying to figure out what it is she is missing and fighting in the tournament to get what she wants. And, to be fair, her main purpose is to demonstrate the dark side of losing at WIXOSS which she did without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nYuzuki continues to show the darkness of WIXOSS, and she is also the strongest character. Her love is one that is unrequited but also taboo. She understands this, but she continues to fight anyway. She fights and she loses. She fights and she wins. And all the while, she is ridiculed and reminded of the love she has that should not be.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, she does not let it get to her, and, when she finally succeeds, she ultimately fails. Her wish was granted, but not in the way she hoped. Her outcome demands thought on perseverance versus getting what one wants unfairly \u2013 could she have gotten the love she sought through normal means, or was crushing others dreams the only solution?\\n\\n\r\nHer aftermath finally has her thinking about people other than herself, especially Hanayo. She comes to understand Hanayo\u2019s situation, she decides to help her old friend Hitoe, and she believes in Ruuko. While she still has to contend with where she is at, her character arc over the course of the season did everything it needed to and more.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves the last two important characters: Tama and Ruuko. Tama is mostly used for comic relief. Her perky personality and unending need to battle is designed to be a light amidst all of the surrounding darkness. She is also an anomaly. She obviously has a special role in the plot that has yet to be revealed. So, for now, her character is right where she needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Ruuko, she is likewise an anomaly. She is the main protagonist, but she is quite bland. She is technically the strongest WIXOSS player, but she plays for fun. She is the cutest character, but she is the scariest among all of them.\\n\\n\r\nThis last detail may seem strange, but it is true. And it is the most important one about her. The other characters find her lack of desire troubling and terrifying because where they are motivated by their separate sins \u2013 greed, lust, and pride \u2013 Ruuko is motivated by nothing. She is pure. (Said purity calling back to her white, \u201cpure\u201d deck.) Ruuko herself knows it is weird \u2013 she often recollects scenes from her past where her mother, like the other characters, was unable to understand her.\\n\\n\r\nShe is the only character without a want. At least, that is what she believes. What she truly vies for is fighting and battling and winning. But she rejects her twisted, sinful self; she does not, cannot see herself as thinking so cruelly.\\n\\n\r\nInstead she finds a different want, one that is as selfless a gesture as possible. Yet her desire backfires. Not of her own volition (Tama takes the blame for that), but she fails nonetheless. Meaning, when she does nothing she is ostracized, and when she does everything she loses.\\n\\n\r\nRuuko, therefore, represents the idea that frivolity and purity are traits that a person cannot have. People have reasons that push them forward (calling back to the trams), and people have sins that they constantly carry (calling back to the other characters). And as Ruuko and the rest of the cast shows, it is these reasons and these sins that define who they (i.e., people) are.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track begins as melancholic as possible but quickly diverts into a more hopeful composition. Admittedly, this contrasting tone is strange, considering the dark contents of WIXOSS. But it works in making the audience feel as if everything will be all right, so when everything really turns sour it hurts that much more. The vocalist\u2019s ability to carry notes, softly sing, and belt out quick lyrics \u2013 the best sections are where the singer moves fast through the track \u2013 turn the song into a welcome addition for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track seems like it will go down the melancholy route, too, but it as well decides to come off as hopeful instead. Already having the hopefulness in the OP makes the appearance of hope in the ED somewhat useless. Combined with the lack of any standout parts for the vocalist and the beat itself being a bit too boring, the ED is a fine track but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the original soundtrack, the tunes are heavily geared towards constructing an atmosphere that maintains that awry feeling. Haunting, music-box tracks that are unsettling to hear. Carried and rough ambient effects that grate the mind. And high-pitched piano keys backed by a high-pitched choir create creepiness by the crateful. While it is not necessarily an OST that is listened to outside of the anime, the OST manages to play its part well.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting performances are generally above average. Misaki Kuno as Tama gives the battle-hungry LRIG a crazily contrasting cute voice. Chinatsu Akasaki as Akira had to demonstrate a wide range of emotions \u2013 happiness, anger, and sadness among others. And Ayane Sakura as Yuzuki deserves a mention for all of the crying and the screaming she had to go through. Also, a shout-out to the producers for the episode previews: Combining the voices to make everything feel more hectic and ominous almost always upped the overall suspense.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt had been a long time since I had watched a non-airing anime \u2013 approximately one year to be a bit more precise. And it had been even longer since I sat down and watched an anime in its entirety in one sitting. This anime got me to reset my timer and to make me sit down for about four hours straight.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was nice to see \u2013 albeit some pretty weird romance but romance nonetheless. Tama was hilarious in how gung-ho she was about battling and beating all of the \u201cscaries.\u201d Knowing that Akira got her just desserts was wonderful. All of the plot twists were sickening but interesting. And the ending made me want to immediately go into the next season.\\n\\n\r\nBut one of my favorite parts \u2013 if I am permitted to be demented for a second \u2013 was Hitoe\u2019s original outcome. I consider everyone I meet my friend, so when Hitoe was pushed towards her unfair fate I became audibly upset. I recall using expletives when using the phrase \u201cmessed up\u201d to describe her situation. Forced to be alone for the rest of one\u2019s days? It was honestly one of the cruelest, scariest, and harshest moments I have seen from anime.\\n\\n\r\nI was actually a bit mad that I had to write about this one first before moving on to the next season because I just had to know what was coming next. Thankfully, having written this fully, I now get to do just that.\\n\\n\r\nSelector Infected WIXOSS is not a show for the faint of heart. The story is cruel, the characters are sinful, and the music is haunting. The visuals make one feel claustrophobic and the events themselves make one aware of how messed up life can get. This anime has made sure that those trading-cards in the binders will stay there indefinitely.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, small plot contrivances aside, the cruelty, themes, and ending form a solid narrative and a strong foundation for the continuation\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, various artistic choices follow the tone and the purpose of the show, with about average actual animation and okay character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while Iona, Akira, and to some extent Hitoe could have been handled better, the symbolism, the exhaustive sides, and Yuzuki\u2019s strong character arc, as well as Ruuko\u2019s representation of reasoning and sin, are executed well\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, nice atmospheric OST, and above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, gripping the whole way through\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "The WIXOSS series is often compared with the likes of Madoka Magica - the cycle of pain and suffering persists between girls with hopes and dreams through a system of wish fulfillment, emotional risk, and brutally punishing consequences from losing battles. However, it is not my intention to weigh the two despite their similarities (I also forgot many details of Madoka Magica as it has been years since my viewing). This is a review completely dedicated to WIXOSS.\r\nThis is not a spoiler: I must give credit where it is due. For the majority of this show, it was solid  - tension, character development, andstory appeared to be carefully crafted. Easily 7/10 overall, or even 8/10 overall if I felt generous. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending was rather abrupt and unfortunate. I will discuss it towards the end of the review (without disclosing any plot details, trust me), as it is a crucial reason to the lower rating. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nI did not watch this show with any knowledge of its resemblance to Madoka Magica; I was only curious as to how a card game anime \"works\". I am pleased to say that while the aspect of a card game is absolutely insignificant in this anime, it surprised me instead with an incredible turn of events episode five onwards, leading from one thing to another, and remained suspenseful and emotionally pressing at every occasion. A lot of \"Oh my God, that just happened.\" moments. Needless to say, it was difficult to put down - for pure entertainment, the story delivers.\\n\\n\r\nThe twists and turns, while happening in relatively quick succession one after another, did not develop the feeling that they were superficial and superfluous - like tossed in out of generating some shock value. They were all essential in revealing the underlying implications and consequences of battling Selectors. The deeper into the show, the more treacherous the game becomes, and the more questions are raised. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I do not want to draw any comparisons in a review, but this contrasts with the direction of something like Black Rock Shooter, in which actions on the battlefield dictate the behavior of girls \"in reality\". In WIXOSS, the tension builds outside of combat, and the occasional battles serve more as a reflection and consequence of the events that transpire in person instead. Just different emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Ruuko, is a wishy-washy girl with the essence of a cheap loaf of white bread. Unfortunately, WIXOSS was not immune to having a very \"average\" starring character - the sort who is somewhat unmotivated and simultaneously somewhat talented. At the very least, her friendly and benign personality is amplified enough to justify her saintly position in this show.\\n\\n\r\nFor \"an ominous game filled with lies and deceit\" (sorry, MAL Rewrite, but the ambiguity lead me to believe there were going to be Liar Game circumstances), the characters are lacking in this department. They remain predictable, even if the plot dynamics were not. This is not necessarily a flaw; we can call it \"missed opportunities\" or \"wasted potential\" instead.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a degree of character development, considerably with Kazuki and Akira (both which exhibit strength in their resolve), but everyone else are - for the most part - relatively stagnant.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing with this sort of story is that it relies on the circumstances of its characters to deliver any emotional impact. This means that the characters are inherently pitiful, in dire straits, and/or desperate - their value has shifted entirely onto the situation they have been placed in.\\n\\n\r\nThe audience feels inclined to pity or sympathize with these characters because of their circumstances, not because these characters are interesting or unique outside of these sad moments. But...that is the nature of such a story. The point is - Yuzuki (incest aside - anyone who has seen enough anime is not going to be shocked) and Hitoe and Akira (debatable) are not especially memorable or even likable. They are just sad.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 6/10, 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is fair. Art style is not particularly of note. Kind of cute. Colorful, but not saturated or colorful in an \"artistic\" context. The animation is clean and consistent, and while the battles are not particularly flashy or fluid, the setting is adequate. I was a little surprised to see that there was not so much emphasis on the LRIGs (essentially \"avatars\" in battle). Their designs were pretty unique, however. Most of the anime takes place outside the battlefield anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI must say that I liked the opening song a lot. I already, by coincidence, listened to it because...well. Kanon Wakeshima. However, opening and ending songs have no weight on the overall sound. I suppose I just wanted to make that note, since I rarely take notice of them.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the voice acting is without any outstanding faults or flaws that I can observe. I also want to point out that Akira's voice when her character shifts from sickeningly sweet and sour mocking to psychotic barking is really funny (and frightening.)\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is interesting. There are some electronic and dubbywubby noises that are usually employed during battle scenes, which I think is appropriate. However, the more somber pieces that play during scenes of rumination and plot revealings have greater impact; I remember these more than I do the dubbywubbing. The out-of-tune piano in \"Missing Parts\" and the echoing vocals in \"LRIG\" (which also employ the out-of-tune piano) truly sustain the kind of atmosphere fitting the emotional weight this anime can carry. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n*Obligatory disclaimer that I generally enjoy shows more than I enjoy criticizing them.*\\n\\n\r\nWatched all twelve episodes in one sitting, and I already explained myself with the above comments. I know I liked it a lot. I know I was ready to see the second season if this show met my anticipatory expectations through all twelve episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it almost did. Almost. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so why the hell is this sitting at an overall rating of 4/10? 8/10 for Story, 6/10 for Character, 9/10 for Enjoyment, and it has decent art and sound. None of this appears to add up.\\n\\n\r\nWell, quite frankly, the entire show was squandered in the last five minutes. An overall lower rating is not the \"average\" of the various categories; rather, it reflects my judgement of the show as a whole. Yes: The. Entire. Show. Was. Completely. Ruined. By. The. Last. Five. Minutes.\\n\\n\r\nA show deserves an overall lower score if it ends on a cheap and distasteful note, even with a rich and fantastic running up until the very end. ESPECIALLY with an anticipated second season.\\n\\n\r\nThat is like an announcement along the lines of, \"Folks, this is where things start getting bad.\" Or perhaps, \"Folks, there is no good faith that you all will stick around, so let us pull something in the last five minutes so that you will all be shocked enough to fervently pursue the second season.\"\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I had no idea how I was supposed to receive this kind of situation. When an anime solidly builds the tension and story to a climax, only to have it deflate like a whoopee cushion, should I ignore it and pretend \"that totally did not happen?\"\\n\\n\r\nBecause it totally happened. \\n\\n\r\nI really want to recommend this show. I really, really, really do. However, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this show with the same shining enthusiasm from the first ten or so episodes after finishing it. I suppose I can only hope that such an ending will not be as appalling or insulting to others as it was to me.",

            "content": "As a psychologist in training, I am an absolute sucker for psychological anime. I decided to binge-watch Selector Infector WIXOSS on a fine Saturday night and here is what I think.\r\n\u203b Strength \u203b\r\n- Unpredictability. You don't know what is going to happen next. The plot and character development is going to keep you on your toes and these cliffhangers are going to make you want to keep watching. \r\n- Individuality. I can feel that each character is acting to their own ideals, morals and beliefs. The character doesn't seem flat but rather like a everyday living being, trying to deal with their own problems intheir ways. Especially how they find out about WIXOSS, it's understandable that some will lash out, some will be manipulative while others will do whatever it takes to win.\\n\r\n- Cute girls. Dark things. Yes it's one of those animes. Just cute anime girls with beautiful character design but little did you know that a dark fate awaits for them. I am a sucker for these.\\n\r\n- Transitions. There were little fillers in my opinion as I thought that most of the scenes flow rather well and progressed moderately. It wasn't too slow or too boring.\\n\r\n- Relatable. The characters are definitely a strength. They aren't perfect. They are filled with flaws and struggles. Just like all of us. We try to solve and deal with them in our own ways. The way the anime give us an insight on what they are thinking makes it even more realistic, hence takes it up a notch on a psychological level.\\n\r\n- Feels. When an anime makes you feel something towards the character or event, it means that anime triggered an emotional response in you. In other words, it has left an impact and that is definitely a plus for me.\\n\\n\r\n\u203b Weakness \u203b\\n\r\n- Rushed. There were many scenes where I felt the friendship was rushed, plotline was delievered too quickly. It wasn't developed as well as it could be possibly with time constraints. The battle scenes are great examples of this.\\n\r\n- Confused. I'm sure there are a few of you that got confused on how the concept of WIXOSS worked at some point. Sure most of them are answered later on in the episodes but some still remained unanswered. When you leave a viewer confused without any resolve, it's going to turn part of them off.\\n\r\n- Lack of explanation. For me, I would have been interested in learning how WIXOSS worked, function and played like a card game. Especially with the Grow, levels and cards. I felt like that portion could have been expanded and it would have made the battles more intriguing. I felt like I was watching a sport I could not understand.\\n\r\n- Inconsistent. There were parts that the story was quite inconsistent, especially with the wish and forgetting everything. This did not applied to everyone. If it happens to X and Y. It should also happen to Z.\\n\r\n- Nose. Okay, I don't know why but the character had weird looking noses that I can't help but stare a few times. It didn't work for me.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba FINAL THOUGHTS \u25c0\\n\r\nWas it a great anime? Probably not. \\n\r\nWas it worth watching? Sure. If you feeling a bit dark. \\n\r\nWould I recommend it to friends? Unless they watch Madoka first and they liked it.\\n\\n\r\nGreat concepts and story development, shout out to the characters, but lack of explanation and rushed plots made it difficult for me to empathize fully as a viewer.",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS is a show which both exceeded my expectations and disguised itself as a 'cute girls playing a card game' type anime. For the most part I thought this outshined most of the other anime airing this season.\r\nStory - 9/10.\r\nThe story revolves around the shy and unassuming Ruuko (or Ru-chan), her associates (particularly Yuzuki), and the card game WIXOSS. The first interesting idea that is presented to us is the idea of the 'Eternal Girl'. Let me explain; certain cards which can only be heard by certain girls (known as 'LRIGs' and 'Selectors' respectively) allow the user to battle other Selectors in orderfor the LRIG to fulfill their wish and the Selector to become an Eternal Girl. Sounds relatively generic so far - girls battling to fulfill their wish -  however the show throws so many darker twists into the story (I won't expand on this point, as I think spoilers would ruin the experience of this show) which surprised and intrigued me.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the way the show handled the reactions of the girls to their new situation, it wasn't shoved under unnecessary fanservice or comedy which made it hit home a lot harder, and it made me feel a lot more for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10.\\n\r\nThe art of this show is well-executed. I enjoyed the different battle environments, and the general setting of the anime added a certain something to the atmosphere and later even added to the story. The backgrounds were always nice to look at, too. Character design was decent - nothing hugely original and intuitive here, but one plus is that each character actually looks like a different person - none of them looked like a carbon copy of another with a different style or colour of hair stuck on top. I also enjoyed the fact that each character wasn't defined by the colour of their hair - they all had relatively neutral hair colours, so you weren't left thinking of them as \"the one with the pink hair\" or \"the one with the green hair\". But I digress. The only small issue I had with the art was the nose, the shadow of the nose seemed to be outlined rather than the actual nose which gave the characters an unusual look.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10.\\n\r\nOne of the first anime I've really 100% been engaged with listening to the sound in. They are engaging and fitting to their scenes, and they really set up a very intense environment when it is needed and a lighter environment when it is needed. The OP is also worth mentioning - killy killy JOKER - it is catchy and I found it intensely addictive. Also great as a standalone track.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good - each girl's emotion was portrayed in a very believable manner, it didn't sound forced, contrived, or flat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10.\\n\r\nRu-chan was probably one of the most intriguing characters here, although she has been compared to Madoka (she's not sure of her wish and whether or not she wants to participate as she doesn't really have a strong wish) I thought her development was unique. She struggles internally with feelings of doubt as to whether she wants to battle and take away other girls' dreams, and the thrill of battle, which is portrayed very well in her interactions. Yuzuki is worth a mention here - although incest is a BIG thing in anime (she is infatuated with her twin brother), which may make her seem a little generic, I enjoyed the way she developed, and how strong her wish actually was (which in turn made Ru-chan a little more reluctant to battle, as she could see how fervent her friends' wish was).\\n\r\nWhat really made the characters, for me at least, was their interactions with each other. Also worth mentioning is their development, which for a 12-episode series, was handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10.\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series, and hope the second season lives up to the high standards set by Selector Infected WIXOSS. It was an emotional rollercoaster when it hit its stride, and it left you wondering and rooting for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10.",

            "content": "Major distinction that must be made for the sake of rational thought:\r\n\"WIXOSS is a copy of/very similar to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magicka.\" No, it's not. It's like saying Windows is a copy of Macintosh.\r\nYes, WIXOSS does share have some obvious similarities in plot structure to Madoka, but it's really NOT COMPARABLE. I could go on and on about this, but I'll keep it simple. WIXOSS has a more intricate plot, more characters, more character development, is more relatable, and most importantly, has distinct themes that are human driven (and less plot driven). Madoka has otherworldly creatures driving its plot forward. Despite what initially appears tobe a similar system, WIXOSS contains the conflict of human nature and themes along those lines as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed this series, especially because of how well executed it was. The story flows well and the mood is meticulously constructed in every scene. The soundtrack meshes perfectly, and the voice acting is amazing. There are a great variety of interesting characters, and great characterization and growth. By the end, everything appears to be coming together, but they are only beginning to take root; there is significant further development in the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7\\n\r\nThe plot isn't terribly original, though there is a surprising amount of foreshadowing and hidden meaning that becomes relevant later.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't particularly special, but the landscapes were beautifully drawn; especially the battlegrounds, which were fantastically surreal with vivid movement; as were the battles themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in WIXOSS is one of the best I've seen (or heard) and really draws you in. The voice acting is impeccable; both perfectly suit the mood, atmosphere, and tension in each scene. OP and ED were nothing special (to me).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters types aren't incredibly unique, but they are very well characterized, very human and realistic, and for some, had powerful personalities.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning battles:\\n\r\nI think it's probably pretty obvious, but the fact that \"WIXOSS\" is a card game doesn't mean it has meaningful rules or strategy (not that something like Yugioh has such either). Battles are about as strategic as any typical anime battle; wild particle effects are flying around, people are getting hurt, and someone's going to gain the upper hand, for one reason or another.\\n\\n\r\nRant:\\n\r\nPeople keep putting spoilers in their reviews. \"This is how xyz in this anime works, and this is this main character's situation, etc etc.\" It's not your place to summarize the events of an anime, regardless of (and especially if) how obvious they are and how soon they are introduced; if people wanted this, they'd go read a summary, NOT a review. YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE EVENTS THAT TRANSPIRE IN AN ANIME TO REVIEW IT. Most of all, most spoilers given tend to be completely irrelevant to their review.\\n\r\nAll a review needs is your opinion on the specific criteria you use to judge a show\u2019s worth, and maybe a bit of reasoning or background information.\\n",

However, I still love the movie.\r\nSelector Infected Wixoss's plot is about as strong. Unfortunately, it's not an action comedy musical, it's a story-driven show and as such, having a weak story is basically a death sentence for it. I'm not going to spoil it, butthe problem is that they go for too many twists. It's like if you explain to the audience that falling down a bottomless pit will kill you, but then a character falls down one and only gets a scraped elbow. It kind of devalues any danger presented in the show.\\n\\n\r\nApart from trying to surprise the audience too much and accidentally murdering the story, the series is nicely put together. The first few episodes in particular show off lots of intricately detailed scenery and the characters presented throughout are likable if a little flat. Animation is sporadic with bursts of insanity and then stretches of recaps so I'm undecided on that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not the worst show in the world but anyone with the slightest writing experience would immediately reject that story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you care, only 2/3 of the title is explained.",

            "content": "A young girl starts to make friends through a magical card game. Sounds like a fun little anime for boys and girls of all ages, right?\r\nAha. Ahahaha. Selector Infected WIXOSS...this show is something else.\r\nSTORY (8/10):\r\nIf my above statement didn't make it obvious enough, WIXOSS' plot goes a lot deeper than that. The first few episodes are fluff, purposely misleading fluff about the protagonist making friends and learning about her new card game. This is to lure you into a sense of false security. From there, the show goes kinda batshit - and it's wonderful. \r\nThere is one pretty obvious plot hole that was never explained,though. You'll know it when you see it.\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks great in 720p, with beautifully-crafted backgrounds and battle scenes. I only wish there were more battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nBoth the English and the Japanese tracks have above-average voice performances. Jamie Marchi did a great job as the villain(?) Akira in the FUNimation dub. \\n\\n\r\nNeither the opening or the ending impressed me, though they were catchy. Could take or leave them.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nOne complaint I read about WIXOSS is that we meet a lot of characters, but don't get much time to explore all of them. I disagree: I feel like WIXOSS did exceptionally well with the amount of characters it had with only twelve episodes. I cared for all three of the Selector girls (the ones we're supposed to be rooting for, anyways) we saw regularly and their ongoing plots, which is more than I can say about a lot of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some questions were still left open, I have a feeling that's what the second season is for.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nWasn't immediately hooked, but was never bored.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this series really isn't for everyone. It has a slow pickup before getting to the juicy stuff, and it may simply be too dark for some tastes. However, if you enjoy the occasional dark tale and a slow build only makes you more excited, this is definitely a show for you.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCONTENT ADVISORY: Some occasional moderate profanity, fantasy violence, and mature themes. Best for ages 13 and up.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I purposely created an account just to drop a review and rating because I believe this anime is really underrated.\r\nThe cover art (and possibly synopsis at a certain site) lead me to believe that this was a shallow anime about card games and cute girl sexual fanservice for males, and therefore I did not even try this anime when it was released until recently when I accidentally bumped into it. \r\nA definitely must-watch anime if one is into good unique stories and realistic characters! :D\r\nStory 10/10: \r\nAn amazing masterpiece I would say! Events and contents were definitely fresh and unique. Each individual character feels real.WIXOSS is more of a character-driven story but it is also supported by a really intriguing and well-thought-of setting. Having the story driven by characters makes it much more interesting because the characters have choices and their choices affect the story. Not many things are forced upon the characters.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely NOT a copy of Madoka. Anyone saying that clearly does not know what they are talking about. There are similarities but definitely not a copy. The similarities are \"What is your wish?\" and stuff/wishes not going as predicted upon being selected as a participant in the WIXOSS game. The entire wish system, battle system and the rules are much more complicated compared to Madoka. Whether or not bad or good stuff happens, or whether a wish will or will not be granted and how it is granted, highly depends on certain situation/condition and is it not as straightforward as Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this story unique is that not all characters go through the same route and not all the outcomes are the same. There are harder choices to be made and more realistic and gritty events in WIXOSS compared to Madoka. It's not all about characters suffering because of \"story\". And definitely not just bad things happening just because it is a \"dark story\". This story touches quite a bit on what it means to be human, learning about one's desire, understanding oneself, humans' interactions and relationships with each other and how each individual character views the world. \\n\\n\r\nGood things do happen in the anime, which delivers a much more powerful punch when things are somewhere in between and bad...This show is somewhat like roller coaster ride. A much easier explanation would be, WIXOSS's story graph is more chaotic but Madoka's is more linear. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that Madoka is bad. It is definitely a masterpiece of its own BUT it is not fair to say that this anime, WIXOSS is a copy of Madoka. It's like saying Gundam and Macross are the same because \"mecha\" or Death Note and Code Geass are the same because \"plotting\". Just because this anime has \"wishes granting disaster\" as part of their theme,  and just because all the main cast are females, it does NOT make this a copy of Madoka. FRIENDLY REMINDER, most shounen anime have a mostly/fully male cast, wanting to be strong and mamoru(protect) others, yet we don't see people emphasizing that they are copying each other.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a pretty intriguing, interesting, brain grinding, fun anime to watch. :)\\n\r\nBonus points for a few touching scenes in this anime <3.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing about the story is that perhaps the storytelling/directing could be improved-upon. It might just be me but with the contents they have in the story, somehow I got a feeling it could be done better. It started of freshly interesting then there was a slight dip in the anime quality around the mid part, but it quickly picked up its pace and soared its way into awesomeness. :D \\n\\n\r\nAwesomeness aside, some did point out that they can't relate to the characters and I totally agree with it. I do root for the characters, but I can't seem to really get into the character and be enthusiastic about cosplaying them. After giving it some thought, I figured that it might be due to not having enough screen time for characters' monologue or for the character to tell their story from their point of view. The story of the characters are usually are being told by either another character or by the story showing what happens. This part could definitely be refined more.\\n\\n\r\nOne annoying thing (thankfully just a bit) about this anime is that it has a bit of suggestive sexual fan service. Suggestive words carefully picked to make it sound as if the characters want to have sex with each other or that they are turned on, random blushing and gasping while what they are actually doing is just the card battle and so on. But as-mentioned, thankfully the total of those scenes for the whole season is probably just around 5-7 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nA character driven anime, and it certainly does not disappoint! Good characters means that you could swap the gender of the characters and it would not affect the story, and WIXOSS is one of the very few who managed to pull it off! Hats off to Okada Mari. <3 \\n\\n\r\nDespite not being able to relate on a personal level, I could definitely relate as a human being. I really enjoyed how all the main characters are portrayed like real humans. No/not much stereotyping in this anime which is a huge bonus point. :D  They are not perfect, some are mean, some are selfish but it is portrayed in an understandable manner. \\n\\n\r\nIt's always nice to see characters doubting their flaws and coming to terms and/or understanding their failings whether they decide to fix them or not. But the main point is that the show shows it as a failing and that decisions comes with consequences, may they be good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe design of the characters are kind of plain. Definitely could have put in more effort in the designs, especially for the LRIG/characters in the cards. Environment and effects are standardly nice. Nothing much out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/sound 5/10\\n\r\nI was rather disappointed by the OST for this anime. There is nothing special, and it doesn't stand out. It doesn't even sound particularly nice. The opening was somewhat nice, but the ending was okay. Music and OSTs are very important terms of having people remember the anime. They should have definitely put in more effort in the OSTs.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching it? \\n\r\nYes! :D\\n\\n\r\nReviewed by: kyu-erien\\n\r\nI cosplay, draw and sing. :D\\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/kyuerien",

            "content": "I'll miss the days when I first became an avid anime viewer, that wondrous feeling as I discovered the unique styles of storytelling each series introduced me for the first time. Instead of nitpicking about formula and cliches, the world was my oyster and I had so many kinds of stories to choose from. But the more I watched, the more narrow my area of interest became. When you're exposed to enough shows, you'll eventually find a group of favorites that very effectively catered to your taste and enjoyment, fond anime and movies that you hold very close to your heart. Some people have thegood fortune of not being as picky and simply enjoy good stories, but for me, I've developed a distinct enough taste that good stories aren't always enough - I hold a deep desire to find shows that could entertain me the way my favorite shows once did. Nostalgia would have me watch shows that try to be like my favorite shows, even if they're not necessarily better than my favorite shows. In this case, Selector Infected WIXOSS trying to imitate my all time favorite anime, Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\n\"Trying\" is the definitive word. This anime is a mess.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nThe story starts out like a magical girl anime. Ordinary high school girl gets special powers, makes new friends with other magical girls, and confronts a bully 'dark magical girl' - just replace the 'magical girl' part with \"card game battlers\". The series spends its first-half on melodramatic moping about wishes and desires, some of which I could relate to while others just felt heavy-handed and dragged on for too long; the second-half focused on building up a looming dark twist that Madoka fans could see from miles away, and yet that twist was also dragged on, with the writers using the screentime for all its worth to postpone the revelation until the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the really big problem with the story. I could always feel like the writers were holding back on us, not fully developing the characters or story properly just so they could hold it off till season 2. That's not how you tell a story, nor is it how you hold the audience's attention so that they might even be interested in watching season 2 at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, there's a decent enough story here about friendship in (card game) competition, and how you should have conviction and sincerity in fulfilling your wishes without resorting to cheap and easy tactics. Much like the classic tales about genies granting you easy fortunes, working hard for them is much more satisfying. This lesson is particularly enforced when Hitoe Uemura, a shy and secluded girl whose wish is to make friends manages to do that on her own anyway in the process of battling with others, all without magic. But neither of these two themes take precedence because the show was too busy focusing on the aforementioned moping (about unfulfilled dreams) and building up the 'mysterious' nature of the card game. \"Mysterious\" is used loosely, of course.\\n\\n\r\nAnd seriously, all that 'dark twist' about wishes becoming curses? It's worn out its welcome since Madoka popularized it back in 2011.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nFor a show about the wishes and friendships of cute anime girls, these characters aren't as terrible as they could have been. The writers put in bare minimum effort at making the characters interesting at all, but they fulfill whatever archetypes the story needed them to. We have your obligatory ditzy but innocent main girl who's selfless and lacks any wishes (Madoka Kaname), a loner outcast with unrequited love (Sayaka Miki), a cold and emotionless veteran jerkass  (Homura Akemi), an outright aggressive and villainous jerkass without subtlety (Kyoko Sakura)... oh wait, I forgot I'm not reviewing Madoka. Or am I? ::)\\n\\n\r\nYou know, at some point, I could have related with these girls' woes and troubles. I mean, making friends is hard, and having someone you love not feeling the same is worse (especially if it's your twin brother). But there is a fine line between tragic and just plain sappiness. When your drama is formulaic, predictable, and having nothing new to say about relationships or anything else for that matter, then it becomes a practice in repetitive whining. By episode 9 or 10, I was bored. Run-of-the-mill cliches don't even begin to describe the kind of relationship turnabouts these characters have in the show. You have school bullies, (t)wincest troubles, idol celebrity angst, and let's not forget the oldest motivation in battling shows: a crave for battling others (from Pokemon to Dragon Ball; take your pick). Then again, real life is all about predictable cliches, so maybe 'slice-of-life' writing like this isn't catered towards my taste - but I'm willing to bet my last dollar that it's just bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nNot only are the card battle sequences too short to showcase any cool special effects, the dark and distorted imagery feels like a poor man's version of Madoka's art style. It lacks uniqueness and creativity, being your average CGI-fest found in typical anime productions nowadays. Blend and boring, I wish J.C. Staff would have at least tried to create a more unique style to set the story universe apart from other similar shows, but that's probably asking too much from a show trying to garner profits for the trading card game.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nForgettable. I don't recall any cool sound effects during the card battles, and the score and soundtrack are made up of generic music. The opening theme and especially the ending theme are the only music remotely worth mentioning, and even they don't stand apart from more emotional anime songs out there. They reflect the show's themes decently, but when the themes were that poorly set up in the first place, that's not saying much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nIn case you couldn't tell, this was quite the chore to watch. It's not the most terrible thing I've seen. I like some of the subversion they try to do with Madoka tropes, like how the foil warned the ditzy main girl about the consequences of becoming a self-sacrificing martyr, or the way these wish-granting cards can't fulfill unrealistic dreams a normal girl couldn't have done herself in real life (again, reinforcing the idea that you should work hard on your dreams without underhanded techniques). That said, it still felt like a waste of time, watching something this unfulfilling (pun intended). Doesn't help that the last episode wrapped up so poorly either, giving me an unsatisfactory ending only to ask me to come back next season.\\n\\n\r\nNo thank you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nWatch Madoka instead. It's got a hauntingly beautiful art style that reflects the tragic tone of the story, characters driven by compelling and larger than life ideals that make them interesting, and last but not least, an amazing and heart-wrenching soundtrack by the legendary Yuki Kajiura. Oh god, that tear-jerking music, so good.\\n\\n\r\nForget about this show like the way Hitoe got her mind wiped about her relations with the card game. It will only do you a world of good.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this anime after seeing a review that said it was \"Magical Girls Meets Yu-Gi-Oh!\" They turned out to be absolutely right.\r\nThe most important thing I love about this anime is that there are lots of girls involved in the anime's card game WIXOSS. The one gripe I always had about Yu-Gi-Oh! was that there weren't that many girls playing Duel Monsters as skillfully as the main character of that series. To have all the key players in this anime AND the cards they fight with be girls was awesome!\r\nBesides this, I liked the \"magical girl  meets  Yu-Gi-Oh!\" concept becauseit took two of my favorite anime things and put them together to make a cool  dark magical girl anime with plot twists and animation reminiscent of Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the most notable thing in the anime besides the storyline is the animation. The animation is at its best when the characters are in a card battle. Most of the time, it made the battlefield look like a garish version of The Shadow Realm from Yu-Gi-Oh!. It amps up the tension and makes you itching to know who is going to win and what will happen to the loser.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest aspect of the anime is the characters. The \"what will happen to the loser?\" question and the wishes of each character are the most defining things about each character. Other than these things, each female \"Selector\" can pretty much by pegged by a \"Dere\" stereotype. While the wishes and the consequences of losing makes the viewer sympathetic toward certain characters, it doesn't add too much depth to them either.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are many loose ends by the end of the anime, I personally excuse them because there is a second season called Selector Spread WIXOSS. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this anime and plan to watch season 2 as soon as possible. Give this a try if you like magical girl stuff or Yu-Gi-Oh!\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first came to watch this series, at the episode, at the first minute, I already knew it was going to be something amazing.  It didn\u2019t disappoint me in that aspect,  I wouldn\u2019t say it turned out better than what I expected it to be but it did reach the already high quality I requested from it which is already a great accomplishment which is why I consider this anime to be one of the best I watched in 2014 so far, however I cannot hide that there are some minor setbacks that prevents it from getting a higher praise.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe storystarts our protagonist Kominato Ruuko, a rather shy high school girl that finds herself chosen as a Selector, a girl that was the ability to get any of her wishes granted if she managed to be successful at playing the popular card game WIXOSS, and meets the mysterious girl imprisoned in one of her cards named Tama. I won\u2019t head into further details to keep this review as spoiler free as possible.  It may sound fairly generic or an average normal story, but it starts with so many dark undertones from the first episode and keeps growing and developing until the show becomes surrounded by darkness and despair.  A positive point in this story is the mystery around the events that occur was very well executed, giving the watcher the feeling that something is going to go wrong at some time in the plot but not knowing what will happen. Other than they did a terrific job at developing the dark undertones and shaping them until the anime because a bona fide dark psychological story. However the show does have two major flaws when it comes to writing, first is the presence of plot holes that grow bigger by each explanation about the \u201cwish granting\u201d part of the show and its mechanisms and the unsatisfying ending that does leave a lot of questions to be asked, while I do know that there is a season 2 planned I am reviewing the first season and merely pointing out what the first season lacks. Other than that, the card game aspect of this show doesn\u2019t even have proper explanation when it comes to rules to the point where I start thinking that whatever you do is allowed there, and again I am aware that the card game is not an end but a mean however I at least want to know what the hell is going on when there is a battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  7/10\\n\r\nCharacter development in this anime is only giving to the characters that need it, which means our main character Ruuko and her friend Yuzuki are the only one whose personality you grasp and who clearly made a noticeable change with the progress of the plot, the others are given proper development progress by degree of importance to the story with the exception being the villains. By the way, the character of Yuzuki is given more spotlight when it comes development than the main character which is by no means bad, it even made me like her more than any other character, but that spotlight did come with huge consequences, the main one being that they just kind of froze her progress as a character by the last episodes of this show. Enough about the protagonists, the villains constitute the setback of the character department. There are three antagonists in this story, the first is Akira which did a great job at being hated then disappeared after being dealt with, then there is Iona, \u201cthe great demon lord\u201d of our tale, which appears a lot more evil and creepy than the last villain and finally the main villain that kept a brief appearance in the first season to be more developed in the second season perhaps, this one is related to the \u201cwishing\u201d aspect of this show. The common point, shared by these different persons, is their obvious lack of background or explanation behind their motives.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is above average, the dark tone is well presented by the rather shadowy colors used, the character designs are not exceptional but not really bad either and the animation shines when it is most needed to affect the watcher either by giving an eerie feeling of uneasiness or by accompanying the already painful events happening, the opening and ending are also good as standalone tracks. The soundtracks are taken from different genres and, while not remarkable when heard alone, are well used to fit the happenings and the change of tones during the episode. I can\u2019t say much about the voice acting other than it was believable and unforced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment largely depended on the other elements of the show, the sound and animation did a good job to keep me watching the story, the characters made the time I spent watching this anime worthwhile and lastly, I liked the twist and turns the story took even the ending that was, in my opinion, rushed and not properly set up. Though I was turned off in some moments due the striking resemblance the story has with Madoka Magica, another show I liked a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score:  7/10\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, I am positive that this show is by far one of the greatest this year has had so far. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a dark anime or anyone wanting to spend some time watching a good story.

I only watched first season, i don't really care about watching more. Characters were blend, especially the main character and her card. \r\nStory and characters\r\nI said the premise is dumb, but the story isn't really that bad. There is nothing really good about it, but it's not a trainwreck. It's simple enoguh and very much character driven. And this is where this show kinda lost me. All characters are blend and ididn't care about any of them. In Madoka(with which Wixoss is compared) i at leat cared about one character, Sayaka. They have very little personality and character development, i'd say even Madoka and Bokurano have better character than this show. \\n\\n\r\nIncest\\n\\n\r\nI like how they handeled incest here. Sure, it's not Koi kaze, but did fine. There is no fanservice for perverts, ans they never say incest is a good thing. They don't say it's bad either, but that's fine. Too bad the brother character was just an empty doll...\\n\\n\r\nDeconstruction and a card game\\n\\n\r\nThis is a deconstruction of duel shows, like Yu gi oh, and Duel Masters. But i never liked those shows anyway, so i don't really care about that. Just like i did't care about Madoka deconstructing(just to reconstruct the whole thing at the end, pfft) maho shojo genre, because i don't watch magical girl shows anyway.\\n\r\nBut i did care about that card game they play. And the one thing that really bugged me is the fact they never explain the rules. Seriously, they never explain any rules of the game, so most of the time they were playing, i was thinking what the hell is going on. Who is winning? How is the main character so good? I don't see it, because i don't get it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending\\n\\n\r\nI'd say it was anti-climactic. It's also left opened for the second season. Since i don't really care about S2, it was just meh.\\n\\n\r\nStory is 5, art is 7, direction/frames is 5, sound is 7, characters 4, my personal enjoyment is 4, i'd say it's overall 5/10. \\n\r\nPff\\n",

Definetly enough to keep you interested and invested. Like i mentioned, itdoesn't focus on the card game that much, but instead focuses on the characters, which in this case just adds to the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThere isn't actually anything phenomenal about the art, but i personally like the art style, and the battle scenes within the card game are well animated, so that's why it's scored this highly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThere are a few nice tracks in the soundtrack, but there's not really that much to drag this point up aside from the fact that it has a pretty nice opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters themselves aren't the reason i've given it a 9/10. The reason for that is the way the characters change based on the events they go through. This is a psychological show, and Wixoss hits the nail on the head, showing the psychological struggles the main characters go through.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis might also come from the fact that i really like psychological shows and card games, but i enjoyed Wixoss a lot which is why i think it's deserving of such a high score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't go out of my way to call it a masterpiece, but it's definetly a great show. If you like psychological shows and plot twists, i highly recommend it!",

            "content": "3/10\r\nGoing into this show I was expecting a lot. But it's safe to say my expectations for this series fell flat.\r\n First of all the animations seem kinda dated and unpolished. For the most part they do their job but they also don't leave a lasting impression, Mediocre overall.\r\n The sounds aren't that memorable either. Where this anime really falls flat on it's face is the pacing. Right off the bat we are thrown into a world dominated by card games without much context. As the story develops all of the characters get introduced seemingly out of nowhere at the most convenient of times. Somecharacters even get abandoned without much explanation and more often than not things are resolved off screen. The characters themselves feel one dimensional and not really fleshed out. Oh and the most vexing part of it all is the whole card games as a plot device. It's supposed to be this mystical popular game that everyone plays but the rules are all over the place. Not once is there even a remote explanation of how the card games work. Then throw in the supernatural elements and the game becomes even more confusing. It's hard to get invested in something when you don't really understand what's going on. The games are there for little more than an excuse to induce psychological trauma. While that in and itself isn't necessarily bad if done right, we should at least get some explanation of the rules to understand when things get tense. The whole series tends to run on drama alone and for a series supposedly focused on card games it gets hurt as a result. Also it does tend to get full of itself with how it goes on and on about fulfilling dreams and whatnot but being at the same time ambiguous as to what the exact conditions are for it to occur.\\n\\n\r\n Overall this is not a good series. It tries to do too much and gives very little context. I was debating whether to give this series a 3 or a 4 but after viewing it and finishing it, it definitely deserves a 3. It's not the worst series out there but it definitely is way below average. Do not recommend, unless you really want to see for yourself.",

            "content": "Selector Infected WIXOSS [Review]\r\nThis is my first review, let me know if it's any good or if you found it helpful.\r\nSpoilers obviously!\r\nStory [4/10]\r\nThe story follows girls who are known as 'Selectors' and they have special 'LRIG' cards which are basically alive but can only be heard by Selectors and so the Selectors battle and when they win enough then there wish is granted and they become an eternal girl, this properly feels very Madoka Magika like and that's because it is very similar. It's if Madoka Magika was a card game basically, the story doesn't follow anyone really well, episodes can focus on different charactersbut overall it moves at a snail's pace and nothing ever happens because although the show tricks you into thinking a development has happened in reality everyone is in the same position they were in before and not much has changed. If I was to sum up the story in one word it would be 'inconsistent' which is a massive problem I have with the show. When Hitoe loses her third battle her wish is reversed and she loses her memory about being a selector, however when Akira loses her third battle her wish is reversed but she still has her memory, why? Well the show later claims that Hitoe only forgot because those memories were related to her wish being reversed, which is fine if it weren't for the fact that the wish being reversed and memory loss were stated as being two different things, so the main problem is inconsistency in the story telling and outside of that it's not too interesting either.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation (Art, Music, Etc.) [5/10]\\n\r\nThe art is as you would expect, there is nothing special about it. There are no beautifully amazing pieces that make me take screenshots and use them as my IPads wallpaper. There is nothing special about the designs, it's not bad but nothing special either, just as you would expect from anime. The music is bland and reparative at best, rarely making me feel involved and it never captures the atmosphere at all, the OP is generic the ED is forgettable I can at least remember the OP. The show goes for show rather than tell which is fine if it weren't for the fact that it didn't have anything special to show.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters [2/10]\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely one dimensional, the show is even more like Madoka Magika in the way it tries to fake being deep and meaningful when it's really just generic and pathetic to watch, I cringed multiple times when the show tried to be symbolical or deep or have the characters go through fake developement. Hitoe goes through the most developement and she was my favourite character at first but then they hit the reset button on her and once she re-enters the plot she is extremely bland and void of emotion. Ruuko is boring, she just complains about pointless things. When shinji complains in evangelism its for development and giving us a look into this mental state, while Ruuko is just sad because her friend left her and she will repeat the same thing over and over again, it's always the same she never offers anything new whenever she has a sad moment. Yuzuki is hot headed and in love with her brother, wow I haven't seen that before! *cough 'except everywhere' cough* despite that she is my favourite from the show, that doesn't make her any good but she is better than the others. At the start she's about the same as Ruuko, getting sad and saying the same things over and over but eventually she becomes happy and it's so much better and then she turns into an LRIG and she's still got more emotion than everyone else. Plus 80% of the side characters with very few lines have more emotion and feeling then some of the main people and that's not good. All the other LRIGs are even more one dimensional so you're dreaming if you think if going to bother mentioning them. An easy trap a casual view might fall into is that the show is looking at the character's mental state and that this is a physiological show but it not really, the show tries to do this but if you actually stop and think \"what did it tell me, what were they thinking, what was the point\" the answer is nothing. There are a few more main-ish characters like Akira and Iona but there also pretty bland. Again this is all my personal opinion so you might get more out of it then me but at the same time you might hate them even more as well.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Episode [6/10]\\n\r\nShows live and die by the final episode, it's meant to be a great climax and cinematic piece to finish off the show and leave people feeling like it was great since they're all hyped up over the ending and go into a review with positive vibes. Despite my obvious disliking of the show I was expecting the ending to at least be good and have a redeeming quality. Well the last episode is the better part of the show mainly because I'm bringing it down to one episode, if I singled out the first half that would also have a rather high score. The last episode somewhat finishes it off nicely, we see some REAL development for Tama and Iona gets a bit more interesting while at first she seemed super bland and generic this makes her seem much more real since she actually does have a wish. However the show ends on a cliffhanger and I'm going to be upset about that, not so much because I care but more so because even if there is going to be another season the final episode is meant to tie things off and set up the next season without being a cliffhanger, I feel like the show tries to tie things off and have set up but it's more of a cliffhanger and that's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nExtras [1/10]\\n\r\nThere is a 3 episode special out titled 'Selector Infected WIXOSS: Midoriko-san to Piruruku-tan' Specials don't usually get reviews so i'm gonna make this real simple, it's sucks. It has very weak attempts at humour which made me wanna slam my head into my IPad, but I didn't since its new. The only reason I bothered finishing is because it was so short I just decided I might as well, the jokes are weak, the animation is lazy and nothing works well at all the whole thing's a waste of time. It's nice when companies do something for people who bought the DVD but in this case they shouldn't of bothered.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIt's so hard to enjoy a show that's bland and boring but it's ever harder to enjoy a show that is trying to be something bigger and failing, even if a show is bad but does everything that it sets out to do then it's okay because it didn't really do anything wrong it was just bad, this show wants to be more but isn't and while I would be sympathetic I can't be since I sit through it all. The final episode was at least done right so the score gets a bit of a boost from that but personally I don't see we're all the praise comes from. I've been really negative this review but it's not all bad, the first half is pretty decent, once Hitoe loses her memory the show starts to go down and it has its moment even a few individual episodes I would give a high rating if I were to review each episode by itself, but the negatives greatly outweigh the positives and you have to keep that in mind if you're going to take the plunge. Once again this is all my personal view if your view is different don't hate me for it, it's just how I feel, maybe the show wasn't doing what I said it was but it gives off that impression which lowers my enjoyment of the show so I'm mentioning it so that you can get an idea for what the show was like for me. Don't get mad if you liked it because I'm not going to argue with someone about this, this is my opinion it's final and it doesn't affect you if you don't let it, however if you agree or don't watch the show because of me then let me know.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 4/10",

            "content": "Madoka: The Gathering\r\nIf there's one thing to be said about selector, it's that you can pretty much rip-off anything - and still get away with it.  Selector Infected WIXOSS manages to do this to not one, but two popular (albeit completely different) brands to come up with its own story to tell.\r\nFirst, there's the Madoka Magica comparisons.  Anybody can play the WIXOSS card game, but only girls (called Selectors) are allowed to partake in battles to have their wishes fulfilled during the supernatural battles.  Accompanied by another female LRIG inside a card, they can win countless matches and still never know whenit will happen, but if they lose three times, well, that's just one of the dark secrets of this twisted game to determine who can become an Eternal Girl.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does a game of WIXOSS work?  That's where the Magic: The Gathering traits come from.  Being a former player myself, the comparisons were far too obvious. The colors each indicate the style of play you use, along with the type of person you are.  WIXOSS is not subtle with this idea, as they literally the use the exact same colors as Magic. White is peace and defense, red is passion and fire, green is the natural world, blue is illusion and trickery, and black is cold, soul-less death.\\n\\n\r\nAll this aside, the series takes the opposite route that Madoka Magica does.  Instead of fulfilled wishes, girls are fighting to have their wishes fulfilled. I won't spoil the exact result, but when a Selector loses three times, she encounters the equivalent of despair.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not the most enjoyable.  They are specifically written to show us what happens when there are a variety of desires to go after.  Innocence, immorality, wickedness, twisted...or in the main character's case - Ruko's - even nothing at all.  In my eyes, she certainly isn't the ideal heroine.  Fighting for nothing but the sake of enjoying the game when you know that beating others results in their despair is a very cruel thing.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this aside, I'm pretty generous to a production that makes a creative effort.  I also believe that watching long enough to discover the darkest truth of WIXOSS is worth the ride.  I give it a 7/10 for overall being a generally entertaining series.",

I could make a joke about how casuals would love this because of Madoka Magica and how casual anime watchers love \"original anime,\" but I am not going to. Actually when the anime started, people were saying it wasn't really good because it gave a \"Madoka Magica feeling to it.\" I thought they were idiots because Madoka wasn't the first to deconstruct the magical girl genre and most magical girl anime does have dark materials in them, but enough of me rambling. \r\nWixoss deconstructs the the card game anime genre. It doesn't explainhow to play the game and it doesn't use \"the power of friendship\" to draw the right card or to be able to go through the card battle. Although the second point i mention is a good thing, most people complain about the first  point. The point of a card game anime is to promote the card game by making it seem super awesome and cool. So, how will Wixoss promote the game if it doesn't ever explain how to play the game? I don't see the problem with this. I can explain why I don't mind them explaining the rules of the game from a comment that a anime reviewer on Youtube, ThatAnimeSnob, said. \"If they explained the rules it would be like Yu-gi-oh.\" And no card game anime should be like Yu-gi-oh. They also use the point that you have no idea what happens in the battles. I do agree with that. With no rules explained, you are clueless if you never played the game before, but do you really care. When watching a card game anime, do you really care why things are happening. I mean a card game anime is used to make the game seem cool. The viewer should be concerned about the mechanics of the game, but the over- the-top action that is going on in the card battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I really liked this anime was because it is interesting(That reason hasn't been beaten to death). Card game anime is usually for children, very happy-go-lucky, and depend on the power of friendship. Wixoss doesn't do this(I mean duh, its a deconstruction.) I mean sure, again quoting from ThatAnimeSnob, \"It is a bunch of lolies that have psychological problems playing  a card game\" but it handles its psychological maturely. I mean, if this was a generic anime for casuals, Yuzuki would have no problem boning her brother and have \"Aki-lucky\" have the generic comedy cliche were she changes from happy-go-lucky to crazy bitch instantly in front of everyone, but Wixoss doesn't do that.They make Yuzuki know it is not socially right to want to bone her brother. The dark undertones is very interesting. I also like the anime  because it isn't formulaic. It doesn't go from point A to Point B to Point C and do it over next episode with some twist like other card game anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne complaint I have with the show is its continuity. Not to go into spoilers, there were some parts that didn't make sense. And even though I did say that Wixoss didn't follow card game anime cliches, there was one point where it did use the power of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nOver all Wixoss is a show that you should watch.",

Madoka Magica opens the gates for Gakkougurashi attends with a creative way the moe, and Kill la kill the magic girl. Also a deconstruction work may be one great series by itself like Neon Genesis Evangelion. This sadly doesn't happen with Selector Infected WIXOSS.\r\nSelector infected pretends to deconstuct series like Yu-gi-oh, Bakugan or Idon't know, No game no life but it stays in the half of it. It doesn't shake the bases so much, it's dark of course butthat's not enough. A deconstruction ponders on what and why we create but it's not like that in Selector.\\n\\n\r\nIn selector there is a cards game but among the players there shall be some girls that are chosen to be Selectors, players with the opportunity to make truth any wish they have if they get an undefined number of wins but if they lose three games the wish turns against them. My questions are: why must to be only girls? And why their motivation should be a wish? This two things look like the series copy from Madoka Magica when it's supposed must be elements that takes from the series it supposes to deconstruct. \\n\\n\r\nYu-gi-oh, Bakugan, Bayblade and all that kind of series involve boys and girls some even adults and their motivation used to be the fight versus evil forces. Selector infected should attend these tropes but the series disregardes them or at least in the major part of it.\\n\\n\r\nResults that every Selector has a card that is alive and comes from another world that hides dark secrets, that actually is a really good point for the series but doesn't talk about this untill the last third, there are a second season where I wanna believe they talk more about this but I haven't seen it yet so I hold where I'm not speculating.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the series that Selector deconstruts are just and excuse to sell toys and when I investigate I found that the game in the series actually exists that says a lot about Selector.\\n\\n\r\n At the end of the day Selector is not a bad anime, I actually like it but it's a bad deconstruction because it's conformist and that's supposed aganist the deconstruction fights to. I don't recommend the series so much but if you like interest and dark stories this a good option for you.",

I can't exactly say what drew me to watch the series, but I found something unique. First of all, I think this is the first show to ever the flunk the Bechedel test in reverse. So that ought to give you some ideas about the cast.\r\nHowever, part of the reason I continued with the series was that, from what I can tell, it's an entire original story. There's no source manga or light novel that the anime has to properly pace orjuggle to its detriment. (Looking at you SAO.) It was a strength of Code Geass R1 and it's a strength here. There needs to be more anime based off original stories. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main problem I had with this story is that it's game is about as coherent as the card game back in Duelist Kingdom Yu-Gi-Oh, sure there's' some internal logic, but the vast majority of the game is left unexplained, besides some vague 'leveling' up and attacking.\\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the story is a lot darker than one would expect. Bunch of girls get into card game, some whom are good enough get their wishes granted? But lose three times and their wishes become null and void? Sounds straightforward? But there are darker consequences to every decision and the result of every battle can carry massive consequences.",

            "content": "Spoiler-free\r\nDescribed as Yu-Gi-Oh meets Madoka this doesn't miss its mark. While having the prospect of getting your wish granted for playing cards, anyone would think this as an attractive deal, but naturally it got a catch.\r\nThe story is very well executed. You got a good amount of foreshadowing, which can help you guess the key points when you are familiar with these kinds of stories, still I would say that the end is surprising.\r\nWhile the focus is on the main story, you still have your subplots which get enough attention that you care for the story, as well as the characters and you feel satisfiedin the end. Most of the subplots get nicely wrapped up, before the finale, others I guess will bleed into the second season.\\n\r\nThe stories are neatly told, but you won't get a lot of the rules for the WIXOSS Card Game, which is okay, because it isn't vital to the story. You get how the duels work and later on how the wish-system works, which is enough to get the story told.\\n\r\nThe plottwists are really well established, so that you don't feel cheated when you get the resolution for certain storylines. Overall there is a lot of suspense, which is quite nicely handled and lets you fly through the episodes.\\n\r\nAt the end you get some more question to take with you into the second season, also a lot of feelings and suspicions. While most of the subplots are wrapped up, it seems the main story is just gaining speed.\\n\\n\r\nFor our main character we have quite a blank slate in the beginning, which is perfectly okay in this case, because it kinda ties into the story and what is happening with her. Still Ru-chan is really likeable. In general you have a lot of trope-characters, which isn't as bad as is sounds. While meeting the other Selectors, especially Yuzuki and Hitoe, Ru-chan gets a lot of character-development, which still is kinda slow, but not a problem.\\n\r\nAlso the LRIG characters are really well developed. Hanayo, Midoriko and Tama make a great addition to the main cast. Throughout the story and their dialogues you get a lot of hints, but if you're not familiar with these kinds of storylines, you won't be able to put them together quite that fast.\\n\r\nAnother thing I really liked were the dynamics between the name-characters (all the nameless ones seemed to be kinda bad and ill-mannered). You get a lot of friendship, but some are also enemies. While there are emotions in the mix, I never felt forced to feel something for the characters or the storylines, it felt really natural.\\n\r\nThere where some minor setbacks for characters introduced but then vanishing, but I'm hoping, we will see them again in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked the music, especially the opening and ending met my taste, but also the music within the episodes was good and well placed. It never felt too much or too over the top. The mix between intense and calming tunes is well rounded.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series a lot and am looking forward starting the next season. I got a lot of questions I want to have answered!\\n\r\nI would recommend it to people who are into magical girl animes, with dark themes and can take a bit of heartache thrown at them. It looks like cute girls playing cards, but it is so much more!",

            "content": "When I first looked at Selector Infected Wixoss, I didn't have high expectations. The expectations I had were COMPLETELY blown out of the water by this series, that I can tell you.\r\nStory: 9/10. \r\nThe story is very good. Going into depth about the story is pretty spoiler-ific, but I'll try to explain what I can without ruining anything.\r\nBasically it's about a group of girls, Selectors, who have living cards that can grant their any wish if they win enough battles. However, if they lose three games, something bad comes their way. The series is heavy on emotion and the consequences of a card game, whichquickly turns out to be more dark and horrific than the girls could have ever imagined. The story itself was well made, and the sequence of events was also well made. Again, It's hard to explain the series of events because it quickly would become spoiler-ific. I can say that I was NOT expected that ending, and I can't wait for the dubbed version of the second season to come out. \\n\\n\r\nThey didn't go into depth about how the card game worked during battle, but I didn't really mind that. I caught on that you have to \"grow\" your LRIG, and that there are cards on different levels, but you never really are told how the battling rules go besides a few superficial points. To me it didn't matter, but it might bother some people that they skipped over that. I felt that the anime focused more about the effects of the card game and the lives and emotions of the characters, not the battle strategies. \\n\\n\r\nI thought that the way the writers handled the despair, heartache, and very dramatic consequences of the card game was well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. Animation was smooth and of high quality, and it certainly looked gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the soundtrack? Let's start with the opening, Killy Killy Joker. I'm a huge Kanon Wakeshima fan as it is, but I have to say that is one of her best songs yet. The lyrics, voice, cello, and the entire feel of the song was brilliant. One of the better opening songs I have seen yet.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the background music. Missing Parts and Profane Wish were AMAZING OSTS. The piano sounded purposefully out of tune, which gave it a strange, melancholic charm that I couldn't get out of my head for days. Even if you have no interest in watching this anime, I highly recommend that anyone who enjoys piano music should listen to Missing Parts and Profane Wish. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes used a lot of dubstep - kind of like Parasyte did - which I didn't mind at all. It pumped me up and gave it a lot of hype.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the dubbing was great in this show. I watched the dub because of Anastasia Munoz, and was not disappointed with a single character's voice actor/actress. All of them fit very well with their character, and they certainly performed very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were pretty well written. The characters shown in this anime, as they had a lot of personality. Even though some characters were driven a lot by certain stereotypes (like Yuzuki and her wish), they still felt like actual people instead of cliches. \\n\\n\r\nRuko:\\n\\n\r\nProbably the least interesting character of them all, but certainly not uninteresting by any means. She finds herself drawn into the card game and becomes quite conflicted at times, pitting her sane realizations against her growing lust for battle. She felt very human.\\n\\n\r\nHer dub actress did well. \\n\\n\r\nTama:\\n\\n\r\nOne of those cute-sy bloodlust characters, but of the innocent variety. She doesn't really remember anything about her past, or who she is exactly, but she DOES know that she loves battle, and she likes Ruu. \\n\r\nYou do see a bit of character development here. She goes from wanting nothing but battle to not wanting to battle, as she starts realizing that if battling makes Ruu sad, she doesn't want to battle. \\n\r\nShe starts putting her friend above her insane lust for battle. \\n\\n\r\nHer dub actress did quite well too.\\n\\n\r\nYuzuki:\\n\\n\r\nUsually I hate these kind of characters. Her wish is to have her twin brother, Kazuki, fall in love with her, as she has loved him since she was little. Mostly every single anime makes incest pretty unappealing, but Wixoss had a way to make it so I didn't want to throw myself out of a fifth story window. \\n\r\nInstead of being an annoying, whining, \"Oniiii-channnn\" type girl, she (at least in the dubbed version, as I have no idea what her dialogue is like in the Japanese version) seemed very human. Yuzuki was a normal, fun, kind girl who just happened to have a wish that she believed was extremely wrong, but was something she wants more than anything else. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed her dub actress. Terrific performance.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo:\\n\\n\r\nA intelligent, level headed LRIG who belongs to Yuzuki. She was the first person that Yuzuki told her wish to. At a certain point, I really disliked her for spoiler-ific reasons, but then I realized that Hanayo cared about Yuzuki and was simply stuck in really shitty circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nAnother stellar dub actress.\\n\\n\r\nHitoe:\\n\\n\r\nHitoe arguably gets the worst of the worst thrown her way into the story. She's kind, shy girl who only wants to have friends, and her wish is ultimately turned against her in the worst of ways. I felt really, really bad for her most of the time, and started feeling extremely sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nHer dub actress brought out the despair to delicious levels. Well done.\\n\\n\r\nMidoriko:\\n\\n\r\nHitoe's LRIG.\\n\r\nPissed me off slightly. I know she was caring towards Hitoe and wanted the best for her, but if she had simply explained everything when she had the chance, she would have EASILY prevented all the suffering that Hitoe went through. But again, like Hanayo, she was thrown into really shitty circumstances, so it is hard to completely blame her.  \\n\\n\r\nHer dub actress did quite well too.\\n\\n\r\nAkira:\\n\\n\r\nAkira is the \"rich bitch\" who acts really nice on the outside, but is incredibly sadistic and self-centered in truth. She, like Iona, will bulldoze over anyone in her way in order to obtain her goal. \\n\\n\r\nHer dub actress was amazing. Pulled out the self-centered, sadistic, slightly crazy perfectly from Akira.\\n\\n\r\nPiruluk:\\n\\n\r\nPiruluk is an \"emotionless girl\" who states everything matter of factly and doesn't seem to ever be under pressure, even when Akira threatens to rip her in half. I'm quite sure that the emotionless girl is a cover, however, because of the smirk she has during that one scene, which is quite chilling. I loved her physical design too.\\n\\n\r\nGreat dub actress.\\n\\n\r\nIona:\\n\\n\r\nRuthless and cold, rich and powerful, Iona is absolutely brutal. If Akira is the \"rich bitch\",  Iona is  the \"cold queen who plays everyone into her hand.\"\\n\\n\r\nIona is the reason I watched the dub instead of the sub. Iona Urazoe's English voice actress was Anastasia Munoz, who I am a big fan of. Of course, fantastic voice actress. 10/10. Would listen to every Iona line back-to-back if someone made a clip of that.\\n\\n\r\nUlith:\\n\\n\r\nOut-sadists everyone in the series. Loves to taunt and torture anyone that she can. I loved her physical design as well.\\n\\n\r\nGreat dub actress too.\\n\\n\r\nBonus:\\n\\n\r\n I love the interaction between Iona and Ulith because it becomes pretty apparent that they dislike each other, but they work together extremely well and have no problems doing so, as they know that they can get what they want with the other's help.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI was absorbed by this anime. Absolutely loved it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nThey meshed battle, happiness, despair, desperation, high-stakes game, fantastic plot, fantastic music, great voice actors, wonderful art, and everything together into a solid, high quality piece of work. \\n\\n\r\nMyanimelist has no in-between numbers, so I entered in a 10 overall. But, if you add the story (9), art (10), sound (10), characters (10), enjoyment (10) and divide it by the number of categories, you get an average of 9.8. Really high score. Fantastic job. \\n\\n",
