            "content": "'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Loli Don't Mind The Slime Part It Is Just a Marketing Bait' is truly a fantastic self-insert series because the mc's face looks like a dead moth and the story line is basically Overlord but isekai. \"B.. b-b..b.but isn't Overlord an isekai?\" Not compared to this.. piece of.. slime.\r\nThe setup is a really great excuse for the story. One of the best ever to be honest. 37 years-old virgin NEET who hasn't left his apartment for 38 years goes outdoors for the first time ever and dies because the world is really a fucked up and sad placeto be living in anyway. Even his last words are \"Please wipe my PC's HDD's.\" Lucky for him, he reincarnates and turns into a loli in this ideal world where he is awesome, everyone (especially people with tits) love him and in generally, here he is \"pretty much a big deal\". That's not literally how it goes, but the differences are miniscule (he has been outside before, sorry for the exaggeration). Totally not a loser or anything in his past life. \\n\\n\r\nThe reincarnation of our mc is the polar opposite of the real him and this new version of him happens when you put gary stu, swag and the outcome of a certain glopping sound in a blender, but instead of these things mixing together, they just start skipping over the 18000rpm blades like waddup are you even trying? and for some reason the color blue is relevant here. I guess because everything is blue for him. The sole worst part of the writing is the comedy in the series and since it heavily relies on the personality of our main character, he becomes quite useless piece of... slime rather quickly. For example, one of the first comedic reliefs is a scene regarding his daily life as a slime and there he says \"I eat veggies because there is really nothing else to do here.\" And that's supposed to be a joke. Now, if this had been presented a bit differently, for example the mc saying \"Ugh, I am so fucking bored I am eating grass\", there is a high change that I would have sided with him, called him ma man and perhaps even laughed. The real alternative was just a childish, supposedly-witty remark that achieved nothing. And that's pretty much how this side of the thing works. There are even some lame Gintama-tier poop jokes. Not approved. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are great tho. Mainly because they consists of ridiculously hot and weird looking females that are not even humans. Some of them has green skin and big boobs, another comes with oni-features, pretty sure third one is a squirrel. Also, elves, elves and ero elves. As a person who likes that weird hentai shit, I have highly enjoyed the ecchi fanservice regarding our harem casting. There is also a huge-ass, badass dragon in the series who ends up being kinda tsundere. 10/10 idea, best since tsundere-shark subreddit. However, the outsome is 2/10 lameness and pure waste of potential. Especially dialogue between it and the mc is so dreadful it makes both of these characters seem exponentially worse than they would otherwise be. Most lines in the series is just filler be it mc talking with wolfies, orc grills or elves. Good thing they all love him/worship him as a god because he is such a nice guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story of this series is simple. Our mc eats the dragon and becomes Naruto, then he starts exploring the fantasy world and committing acts that play out like side stories in j-rpg games except he does it with highly overpowered isekai Jesus manner because that's the entire point of this series + is being nice because nice is so nice. People get impressed over how amazing he is, others who are literally evilzz get hyped over the tsundere dragon. Real basic stuff that could shine if it was filled with interesting characters, cool action sequences or some details worth of anything. None is to be found in here. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is somewhat experimental. There are drawings made by children, some type of spectrogram-tier audio logging shit, exhaust pipes against red backgrounds because Iunno why exactly, enter the void type of all-colors-of-rainbow sequences that quite well match the definition of digital vomit, and stuff that is too stupid to be even described. Gladfully these scenes are scarce and the real thing is way more generic, which is good because generic > this pseudo-artsy nonsense. The art during the actual story parts is simplistic yet efficient. Nothing to complain there. Sounds-wise, the mc sounds like a loli so I guess they achieved what they tried to do. The opening song and ending song both are easily the worst I have heard this season, but the OP has been kinda started to fit the acquired taste definition.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nI think isekai is one of the best genres in the modern anime industry because it rarely takes itself too seriously. It tends to be over the top stupid and that makes it so genuinely entertaining to watch. It is also so very easy to forgive whatever problems they have, but loli datta end up disappointing me. It's not very fun to watch at all, just childish to a point that it feels like kids cartoon, and especially the ridiculously slow tempo is ruining the experience and making the whole thing just be all over the place. The manga is like 11x faster and better.",

            "content": "Insert obligatory pretentious quote here because I\u2019m not good at starting a review. The Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime or TenSuru is an anime that slipped into the radar of ever hungry anime watchers in October 2018. Since then, the anime has been praised as being a wholesome isekai deviating from the norm and positing a new and refreshed take on the genre. So, imagine my confoundment when only the first 5-6 episodes held true to the preceding sentence. After the first 6 episodes it turns into your typical harem loli bait. Allow me to elaborate.\r\nThe anime starts off pretty good actually withour protagonist (who is a not-so-social-virgin at 37) dying, with his dying wish being \u201cIf I ever get reborn, I want to be OP af and want to screw as many girls as I like\u201d; to be fair, I would probably also wish something along those lines. After citing his wish, \u201cthe great sage\u201d reincarnates him into another world as the most OP slime ever. Stuff happens and he ends up saving a tsundere dragon from eternal imprisonment by eating him and also saves a village of goblins from direwolves. He, then names all the goblins and direwolves and takes it upon himself to create an ideal living environment for the monsters to live in. Just because he worked as a \u201ccontractor\u201d in his previous life, he\u2019s able to plan out a whole city mostly by himself. He also becomes an expert in holding a conversation even though he was lonely and awkward in his previous life. I don\u2019t know how that works, but good for him right? \\n\\n\r\nAfter planning a whole city mostly by himself, begins the directionless adventure of the slime. This is one of the main problems with this show, it does not know what it wants to be. There\u2019s no overarching narrative, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but audiences at least need a sense of direction of movement in order not to be bored. There was something about there being a demon lord or something, idk it\u2019s probably the same guy that\u2019s present in every other isekai. What the show does is, it makes one of the characters say \u201cDemon Lord\u201d in some way or the other and the anime is like \u201cwell that\u2019s enough plot progression for one episode. Who wants tiddies?\u201d. Instead of actual plot we get \u201cplot\u201d. Not \u201cplot\u201d plot, but PLOT. Every girl the slime ever comes across is infatuated with him because we need to construct a harem or it will not be an isekai. Thus, the slime turns into chad slime and is swimming in tiddies, literally. The second problem with the show is that the danger does not feel real. Since the slime, who gets the name Rimuru by the way, is as OP as Goku in his Rainbow Super Saiyan Ultra Instinct Super Saiyan Legendary Super Saiyan God Ultra BS Level 5 form, nobody stands a chance against him. Anyone who challenges him, gets their ass handed to them in about 5 milliseconds. The fights usually go like this:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tRimuru\u2019s henchmen fighting evil guy.\\n\r\n2.\tEvil Guy: You are just cannon fodder.\\n\r\n3.\tHenchmen lose; evil guy laughs; Rimuru arrives.\\n\r\n4.\tEvil Guy: You\u2019re just a slime, you can\u2019t do anything.\\n\r\n5.\tRimuru beats the shit out of evil guy.\\n\r\n6.\tEvil Guy: *gasp* *starts following Rimuru for no reason*\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, everyone who ever comes in contact with Rimuru becomes as loyal to him as you\u2019re to anime. There\u2019s this direwolf whose father is killed by Rimuru, but he\u2019s like \u201cmeh, shit happens. You killed my father and dozens of my friends with whom I\u2019ve spent my life till now, but you gave me a name so I instantly forgot about them\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is ehhh??? I know comedy is subjective, but I can distinguish between well written comedy that isn\u2019t funny just to me and just plain bad comedy. There\u2019s this character who doesn\u2019t speak and just says \u201cmmmhh\u201d and whenever he does that Rimuru goes \u201cSpeak up, man\u201d. It was funny the first time but became annoying after it was repeated for a million times. There\u2019s this lizardman who\u2019s arguably the most irksome character in the show because his only purpose in life seems to be to make stupid decisions for the sake of tasteless humour. But, the most annoying part is that those actions, those asinine actions that he takes in the show which we took for granted, actually contribute to plot progression. He overthrows his father, the king of the lizardmen, from the throne during an invasion just because 3 of his henchmen told him that he is strong *annoyed nose exhale*.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are painfully mediocre. Except for one female character, all others are there just to show some cleavage and get wet over Rimuru for no goddamn reason. Rimuru himself isn\u2019t that interesting of a character. We never get an explanation to his motivation or what he wants to do, he just does whatever is presented to him. That\u2019s weak writing. If your character holds his/her characterisation only in the context of the story then that\u2019s weak character writing. There\u2019s not even much to write as the characters are the definition of average. If they were on either end of the spectrum you would have something to say about them, but the characters in this show don\u2019t have much of a personality. Only one character gets anything resembling a backstory which was so cursory that I forgot about it as soon as it happened. The characters are introduced as some kind of badasses only to further paint them as only superficially badass. There\u2019s a character who tames the orcs and has a calm demeanour in his first scene but loses his mind when his plan fails. He\u2019s portrayed as smart and shrewd but isn\u2019t even able to figure out that his own slave is going to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast consists of useless fanservice character #1, useless fanservice character #2, useless fanservice character #3 up to useless fanservice character #10, and Shizue. You can literally replace the female cast with boobs and it wouldn\u2019t make a dent of a difference. Every female in this show, in one way or another, is only present to hold Rimuru between her boobs or to get angry for absolutely no reason in order to provide \u201ccomic relief\u201d. I\u2019ve put comic relief if massive quotations because all it does is annoy the viewer or pad for time as every episode needs to be 20 minutes long. The \u201ccomic relief\u201d usually (and by usually I mean all the time) consists of girls vying to get wet over Rimuru or having other characters eat food that they\u2019ve prepared; usually (and by usually I mean all the time) the food is very unpalatable and causes the person eating said food to faint. As you can see these are entirely new concepts that have never been executed or seen before in any anime, ever. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a demon loli who runs around in bikinis blowing up whatever she wishes and is supposed to be a \u201cdemon lord\u201d who are apparently the most OP people in the world. The demon loli is defeated by Rimuru by stuffing her mouth with honey; a feat which is applauded by his loyal followers quoting it as \u201cA feat which only Rimuru-sama can accomplish\u201d *exasperated sigh*. The demon loli (that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna call her because she was only present in the show to appeal to pedos and was such a superfluous character that I don\u2019t even remember her name and can\u2019t be bothered to search for it), becomes besties with Rimuru because, well, we need an excuse to shoehorn in a loli with enough helium in her voice to lead to dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness and ultimately death.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be thinking that despite shitting on this show why have I still given it a 4/10. Well, that\u2019s because even though everything about this anime is utterly mediocre, I still had an urge to click the next episode and ended up finishing it in a day so it gets some points there. Even though the fights themselves can\u2019t be considered anything other than one sided massacre, they were still fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOh, almost forgot. The music is ok, the OPs and EDs are just fine and with the exception of one piece (which I just can\u2019t seem to be able to find), all the others are forgettable. The animation is pretty solid though, especially during the fights. But, what good is animation when the majority of the show is as bland and tasteless as frozen dry fruits.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\r\nIf isekai is your thing, then go for it, but again if you really like isekai then you\u2019ve probably already watched it. If you don\u2019t like isekai and are going to try it because you\u2019ve heard so many good things about it, then I\u2019d recommend you to refrain from watching it. This is another one of those mediocre isekai that has been hyped to high heavens by the anime community. It\u2019s literally like any other isekai. \\n",

These 6 episodes actually focuses a lot on the world building andour MC finding a proper way to live there instead of giving him a harem.\\n\\n\r\n*minimum spoiler review*\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\\n\r\nIt is about our MC who got stabbed and was reincarnated as a slime. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand this but the selling point of the series for me was that everything was just making more sense than the rest of the isekais out there. The MC isn't just powerful by sheer luck he was\\n\r\nreincarnated in a cave and was named by a dragon and because of that he became powerful WHICH is the reference to the game logic that the villains having a name are more powerful than the ones without it. The MC then swallows him. The story right now focuses on the adventures of our MC (his name is Rimuru btw so I should probably stop calling him MC) in this world as a slime. The lowest level monster there is and waiting for the dragon to come out so that he can tell him about his adventures.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\\n\r\nThere is our MC which is the most realistic person to die die into the fantacy world. NO HE IS NOT A LOW LIFE ANIME LOVING WEEB, he is just a gut who works in an office. And he is a virgin.\\n\r\nGoblins were the first creatures that were introduced to us in that world and rather that making goblins look like..well like..Goblin Slayer goblins (i haven't checked the other reviews out yet but I am 100% sure EVERYONE has mentioned this) they are wayyyy more lovable and sweet.\\n\r\nDwarfs are awesome and manly creatures who are true to their masters.\\n\r\nAnd the wolfs are pretty much the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\\n\r\nThere is not particularly any track that is spectacular.

The OP and ED are both really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation-9\\n\\n\r\n8bit studios have never been bad with animation. The animation is spectacular and consistently good with great details.The fight scenes so far (even if they are small) are good. The art is also pretty good with vibrant colors that just mixes well with the world. \\n\\n\r\n*\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\\n\r\nThe show has its own charm that just makes you wait eagerly for the next episode to come. It makes me happy and is a treasure for isekai genre.\\n\r\nAfter watching the first episode of Goblin Slayer I was actually planning to make a sarcastic review by just talking about it. But I just couldn't.\\n\r\nYou might have noticed that I have not made an enjoyment section, that's because it is subjective (not because I am too tired and lazy :P). For me it is 10/10. This is my first review so I hope you will be easy on me.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading\\n\r\n*",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime has one huge issue preventing it from being the fun wholesome D&D comedy it wants to be. There are no stakes. \r\nNothing matters, there is no reason to care all because the main character is insanely overpowered. Rinmuru was a 37-year-old-virgin office worker randomly killed and then reborn in a new world as a blue slime in a JRPG-like fantasy world. Like most isekai power-fantasies, he is immediately overpowered. Anything he encounters in the world can be effortlessly defeated, draining any tension out of the show. \r\nThe premise isn\u2019t inherently flawed, especially because it aims fora more comedic and light-hearted tone in a genre full of overly-serious edgefests. The animation in the first episode was amazing, background art was highly detailed and consistent. The art quickly went from great to just decent, however it never lost its colorful style. From its first few episodes, I found that it had an infectious fun cartoony feel. It balanced this light-hearted tone with some drama sprinkled throughout. The stakes were always low, at first, the lack of stakes was compensated for with all of the side characters who had their own drama. But no one is ever developed, it is just filler. Even the for with zany comedy grows stale the longer the series progresses, the jokes never evolve, it\u2019s the same dumb jokes repeated over and over. \\n\\n\r\nA relaxed plot structure isn\u2019t inherently bad. This series just does nothing with any part of its story. But it tries to have its cake and eat it too. You can\u2019t have a zany bit comedy with characters who fulfill roles in a comedy, then try to use them for emotional payoffs and build tension. It had the childish silly comedy, it had the occasional drama. SEPARATELY. Then it lost track of its plot threads, there was no direction, inevitably the tone became so mismatched that it was no longer enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in Tensei Slime is so far below the main character in every way that they are glossed over, cannon fodder and fools to entertain him. He never needs any of them. By the midpoint in the show, the most important supporting character is Shion, because she is constantly on screen being jiggled by Slime loli hiding under her boobs. Aside from that the side characters don\u2019t have enough personality, development, or even relevant dialogue. Most of them just linger around Rinmaru like his giant harem, showering him with praise and the occasional quip as if they were NPCs\\n\\n\r\nIn truth, there is only one character the show cares about. Slime loli. \\n\\n\r\nOur slime isekai protagonist Rinmuru is mildly entertaining before he becomes a loli, after that you realize you've been baited. You thought this would be an original take on the isekai genre? Wholesome? Guess again. He\u2019s just the average thirty-something-year-old isekai protagonist but he looks like a loli. Rinmaru\u2019s loli form with his bland background, and his annoying habit of draining any tension make him an awful main character. And I'm not against the surprising amount of violence this show used. What bothers me about the violence is that it tends to clash horribly with the wholesome tone of the irreverent Rinmuru and his band of misfit goofballs. The tone is a disaster for most of the show, many times it is difficult to tell how the series wants you to watch it. It may want you to take it seriously then laugh at it all in one scene, and the result is just confusion and boredom.\\n\\n\r\nAny character who offered intriguing subplots to digress from Rinmaru is forgotten by the writer almost immediately after their introduction. Make no mistake, they all stick around the main character, but they become ornaments rather than characters. For various reasons, anyone Rinmuru defeats decides to pledge their loyalty to him. Non-player-characters, just members of his party with the sole purpose to compliment him and be his battle fodder until he decides to one-punches the enemy into oblivion. There is one other character who exceeds him in power, but she comes so far late in the series and she does nothing. Imagine an immovable object meets an unstoppable force. Instead of building off of one another she does nothing and acts like an idiot, then gets ordered by Rinmuru. \\n\\n\r\nFrom time to time the dialogue doesn\u2019t take itself seriously at all, and it\u2019s the show\u2019s best, but also worst feature. The only thing that made it watchable, that kept me awake for all twenty-five episodes was the occasional moronic, sarcastic quip. If a funny line is tossed randomly into a bad scene or if it\u2019s sandwiched between bland dialogue it goes so far in giving the show more energy. When Rinmaru quips at a weaker enemy for being stupider than him, it's fun. Conversely, there is some palpable tension when a conflict has been developed for episodes and Rinmaru\u2019s underlings work to succed. However, he always steps in with an annoyed expression, taunts his enemy with an awkward joke, then easily defeats it. Who would want a main character like this? Before a fight Rinmaru often says \"this fight won't be easy\" BUT IT IS ALWAYS EASY. He is too ludicrously overpowered for what this show is trying to be. Like a vacuum, he drains away all of the tension. Without tension in a fantasy-action anime, there is little left to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem with the broken story structure of this show is the pacing. The author has so little attention span that there can never be more than one plotline occurring at once. No time for character development. No time for world building. We have a conflict and we\u2019ll have to see it all the way to its boring unsatisfying conclusion before the next plotline can even be introduced. I never thought I would actually miss Overlord, but at least that show made an effort to tell a competent story. Also, every arc in Tensei Shit but one ends incredibly anticlimactically. Even the arcs that end on flashy action set pieces are still unsatisfying because the main character is so overpowered nothing poses a threat to him. Dozens of potential plot threads are cut off and left open to potentially be revisited in the future. And this is not a writing technique the author is intentionally using. Rather, it is more of a \u2018Plan B\u2019 in case the main plotline becomes too boring and repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nThe final arc in the show comes out of nowhere. The new characters, a group of kids, have no personalities other than one trait if we're lucky. Hollow, boring characters are par for the course in Slime Shit, but this is where the show went from boring to painful. It tries to make us care about the new NPC kids. We were told by the show that they are going to die if Rinmaru doesn\u2019t help. Thankfully he doesn\u2019t care about anything so he ditches his small civilization temporarily to help them. He resolves the conflict by himself, totally separately of the kids, and they end up just following him around trying to act important like the rest of the supporting cast in this terrible hackneyed series. After the anticlimactic finale, there is nothing left worth caring about. But of course they teased a second season.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t wait for another 25-episodes of this drivel...\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 3/10] Disjointed, shallow, forgettable, cliche.\\n\r\n[Character: 1/10] There is only one character who matters, and I hate him.\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10] Attention grabbing character designs, decent art, good animation. \\n\r\n[Sound: 5/10] Forgettable soundtrack that doesn't always fit the scene, good first op and ed.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 4/10] Boring aside from some banter between the characters, but it is repetitive and basic.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 3/10]\\n\r\nOverpowered main characters are a staple of the isekai genre, and That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is no different. Studio 8bit's stellar art style and the first two theme songs were fantastic. However, the production was not enough to carry such a disjointed and underwhelming story. If you're a fan of the isekai genre then you might enjoy the irreverent humor for a little while. Until that too gets devoured by the slime-loli-thirty-seven-year-old-virgin and then all you're left with is a long boring waste of time.",

            "content": "I use to ponder how isekai is an unusual phenomenon, seeing how it's rather so popular and draws so many people in with its stories. But the more you watch, you start to see that it really isn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s quite understandable, really. The fandom of light novels tends, more than most, to be fond of wish-fulfillment and self-insert type stories. And of course, isekai is the ultimate platform for that. Maybe there was a time, before it became almost unimaginably overused and tired, that the word \u201cisekai\u201d didn\u2019t immediately elicit a groan\u2014but that time has long since passed. The genre is overplayed and overdone, and almostnothing that slaps a ridiculously long title on itself and surfs the wave is any good.\\n\\n\r\nThe standard for isekai anime continues to take a dive with each passing season, reaching new depths, with its played tropes from harem antics, its ridiculously overpowered protagonists and how it uses cheap plot devices, usually around the topics of rape and slavery to shock its audiences and pull them into something they think will be dark and mature\u2014only for the show to turn into the same old generic, edgelord power fantasy. Is Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime in English and TenSura for short) any different? While TenSura follows every clich\u00e9 trope to ever exist but executes them in such a way that it remains narratively engaging as we follow the progress of the main protagonist of this story who is Mikami Satoru, who at a later time, goes by the name of Rimuru Tempest, as he literally builds a technocrat federation from nothing after being reborn in a different world.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise\u2014a 37-year-old virgin NEET gets heroically stabbed to death after finally venturing outside and winds up reincarnated as a slime with superpowers in an alternate universe, which seems about as arbitrary as it gets. Slimes are recognized as one of the weakest creatures, but after meeting a Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Verudora, who he later merged with and was named by him\u2014as Rimuru Tempest\u2014and gaining some unique skills, he sets off on an adventure to travel this world and make the best of a second chance at life. The unique skill \u201cPredator\u201d allowed him to devour Verudora and gain some of his abilities and the \u201cGreat Sage\u201d is like another consciousness that exists inside Rimuru, it has this clinical female voice, marked by kanji descriptions and psychedelic shifting colors, punctuates his internal monologue and pretty much acts as a guide for him. It has all sorts of abilities that make our Slime hero almost that of a demigod.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the idea of a superpowered slime is definitely among the sillier concepts to build a story on, there's no doubt that the creator Fuse has done his work building this story's world, and it shows in 8-bit\u2019s adaption here.  It's a combination of RPG trappings from both east and west, with elves, dwarves, slimes, ogres, goblins, kobolds, etc., that still plays into the basic isekai notion that people are going to be summoned or reborn from our world. In fact, it's specifically stated that people are both reborn and summoned, with the summoned being more valuable because of the great difficulties associated with surviving the magic. This is where the story\u2019s main subplot comes in\u2014Rimuru's story is juxtaposed with that of Shizue Izawa, a little girl who barely survives a firebombing during WWII and ends up being summoned by a particularly unpleasant demon lord. Shizue's story is undeniably tragic, and her fate makes a decided contrast to his. Shizue's tale shows the darker side of the summoning process that we don't often see in novels like these. The two narratives do connect in a way that gives Shizue's story some closure, as well as opening the door for the next stage in Rimuru's evolution. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru is the type of character that very much stays true to how he was in his previous life and using his experience with MMO\u2019s, RPG\u2019s, otaku culture, and his occupation to help him solve the situations he finds himself in. He tries to avoid conflict, tries his best to avoid killing others, and helps to make peace between others when need be. Due to his nature, he solved a conflict between Goblins and Dire wolves which led them to all come together and build a village where everyone is accepted. Our main character was to become this village\u2019s leader and he would name each one that resides here. As for the supporting characters, there is something for everyone. You have all \u2018dere\u2019 types and ones with the \u2018badassery\u2019 stamp of approval. There is a large number of supporting characters who are more than cardboard cutouts and are constantly contributing, they have personalities and have moments of introspection. When it comes down to the overall narrative, TenSura is about family, friendships, and bonds that Rimuru makes with other beings that he encounters on his journey in this magical world. He understands that every race is different, they have their own culture, their own ways of doing things, but he becomes a bridge to everyone that anyone can peacefully live together. Through these interactions, a small tribe becomes a village, then a town, then a city, then a nation and finally a federation.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding in TenSura deserves praise. Much later into the show, you can see how much that Rimuru and his people have built in this world, all the other nations and kingdoms he has traveled too, all the allies he has made and some potential foes. Each nation is unique in how they operate, the laws, politics, location etc., there are even rumors, folklore and gossip happening around in these places that make you feel immersed in this world. However, there were things that bothered me that need to be mentioned. First thing is that the beginning of the show, while very informal, is tough and slow. Its filled with exposition and it feels like you\u2019re constantly getting smacked in the face with it, it takes a while for the show to start rolling and felt it dwelt too long on all the info-dumps (mostly explaining the same things over and over). The other issue was Rimuru being too much of a sue character and being ridiculously overpowered. A lot of the show\u2019s comedy helps with making it a bit tolerable but once you get past the shows first cour, all tension starts to evaporate because all of his battles end in a stomp match or are easily resolved by his natural ability to sway one\u2019s heart. All his struggles and confrontations are easily and quickly resolved. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, 8-bit did a good job with the visuals and they are a good match for the narrative. The art style tends to go for a bright and colorful look during the more light-hearted scenes, with the dramatic moments taking on a darker and less cartoonish palette. For an isekai like TenSura, I\u2019d say the monster designs are done really well, especially the physical evolution of some of the characters after receiving a name or leveling up. Also, worth noting is the way the visual direction depicts Rimuru getting used both his forms. The show is visually at its best during the big battle scenes. There are few episodes that \u2018drop\u2019 in terms of quality, a few that unfortunately had the cringe-worthy CG but it remained relatively consistent. Overall character designs are done well, although, the fanservice did get a bit too much where I found myself rolling my eyes. I felt the score could have been better but it does stay true to the RPG-like aspect of things, VA\u2019s all did good jobs in fitting to their given characters' personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, TenSura is rather one of the better isekai in its catalog with great worldbuilding, accomplishes what it sets out to achieve and for the most part, is actually fun. Yes, there are flaws and tired tropes, which is to be expected in isekai but it avoids all the nonsense that we commonly see in these types of anime\u2014there is no edgelord protagonist who is the chosen one, with a bland personality and surrounded by a harem of little girls. Rather focusing a lot of the fighting aspect, TenSura\u2019s story is told in a competent way that explores the relationships between people, what people could have with each other, and ultimately have them fight for what they believe for. It introduces the idea that people can connect with each other, build bridges and mend borders simply through conversation, learning to develop great relationships with one another instead of always relying on violence to resolve everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe most appealing aspect of TenSura is that Rimuru acts like a normal person, after dying one day and ending up in a different world where he is reincarnated into a slime, he decides that he is going to make the best of this opportunity, and if he can help others along the way then great! All he wants to do is live happily and make it a fun time while using his gifts responsibly within this world. The main story ends at episode 23 while the last two are a side story/revision. I do look forward to what the sequel will bring. If this sounds like your cup of tea then give TenSura a try, provided you're in the market for a less serious take on both fantasy and isekai. It's able to maintain a light-hearted tone without completely abandoning the plot, and its efforts at world-building have been honestly interesting.",

I personally enjoyed it very much. The plot itself wraps p pretty originally and in a good way it connects up beetween events, in a not-rshed pace everything gets developed in a way that you get to really like most of its characters.\r\nRimuru himself is the star of the show, this cool slime fella is imensely cool, cute andpretty likeable, he is a good guy, everyone in the anime likes him, everyone watching the anime likes him, he's the kind ideal protagonist a show should have, and most of all, he's original, I mean, when did you see a talking genious magician slime before? I say, never! He being a slime is the main reason everyone likes him, he's jsut original, if he was a simple teenager japanese boy, it wouldn't be the same thing.\\n\r\nMost of the sub-characters are great, we get to know the goblins(which in this anime are good, as opposed to the goblins in a certain other anime), they're carismatic, they're likeable. Same thing can be said about the wolves, tough less carismatic, the leader of the bunch is pretty cool.\\n\r\nAnimation-wise this anime is great, I simply love the opening theme's animation, it's really well done, as well as the general animation, nothing feels bad or rushed in it.\\n\r\nOST, except for the great OP theme I don't think there's something really great about it, quite forgetable I must say :/\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about it, a more great than good story, a outstanding art, a ok music, a great character and of course I had a outstanding enjoyment.\\n\r\nOverall a great show with imense potential.",

            "content": "*This review contains SPOILERS!*\r\nThat time I got reincarnated as a slime is basically a bad version of overlord. It started as a light hearted slimavilization which was fun in the beginning but then became horribly boring.\r\nThe premise starts off with our 37 years old virgin NEET being killed and reincarnated as a jesus with a mix personality of a mary sue and being nice because supposedly being nice and having a god like power can make girls with big tits or naked lolis to like you. There's literally no story here. Rimuru is building his own slimavilization along with everyone he meets. There are nothreats, no stakes, nor any tension in this already 1 dimentional story. The same goes with political workings as well. Our MC takes this Jesus attitude with everything, and characters always end up going 'oh okay, lets all be nice to each other'. In the meanwhile, the world has such physics that if monsters are named, then they will evolve. Basically my cat will evolve into a leopard if I name her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are bland. All we have is an edgy MC, a big tiddy onee-san, another big tiddy dryad, a naked OP loli, a wolf and a bunch of goblins. Rest weren't rememberable at all. The only ones I liked were eaten the very episode they were introduced. \\n\\n\r\n The worldbuilding is trash. The only thing we know about this world is about different species that live. The voice acting is bad at various levels accounting to childish voices. Even the music is pretty bad. Except for the first ending theme, which was semi-decent; the songs are a measure of how childish the show can go. The only thing that is preventing me from giving it a 1 is the artstyle and the animation, because of 8bit's solid technical staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Life can be harsh and I\u2019m sure most of us think so in some way or another. The typical everyman at adult age works an 8-5 schedule on weekdays to make a living. Satoru Mikami is a very ordinary person until he gets reincarnated as a slime after being killed in a knife attack. As tragic as that sounds, it may not be a harsh life after all. Isn\u2019t life just full of surprises?\r\nAfter being turned into a light novel, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken (That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime) is one of the few isekai shows that I genuinely looked forwardto this year. While it subscribes to usual fantasy gimmicks, this show also does a unique job at entertaining the audience through its charismatic main lead, world fiction, and creative storytelling. I refer this show as more of a fantasy  isekai, one that has a slime as the superstar. \\n\\n\r\nCan the isekai genre really have potential to be more than just what's on paper? It certainly could for some franchises. This show is one of them. Satoru is reborn as a slime and his role is crucial to everything around him. Taking on the alias \u201cRimuru\u201d, he makes up for his appeal through a variety of personality traits: kind, witty, laidback, sarcastic, courageous, and among others. When you look at all these character personalities together, Rimuru can be very likable. In the early portion of the show, we see Rimuru\u2019s charisma and being able to lead supernatural creatures without fear. He even gives names to his new friends while showing his compassion. Rimuru is built to be special in the show. This is established through his immense abilities (such his Predator skill), where viewers can easily point fingers at him for being overpowered. Indeed, this isn\u2019t an overstatement. In most of his battles, they are more like curb stomp face offs where Rimuru dominates his opponents. From isekai shows in today\u2019s world, overpowered characters aren\u2019t uncommon. What actually sets Rimuru apart is his unnatural charisma and human behavior. The witty conversations and small talks he engages with others often makes his fights much entertaining than they should be. Even in serious conflicts, Rimuru finds time to make jokes while being strategic enough to formulate a plan. Now, that my friends, is setting a likeable isekai protagonist by example.\\n\\n\r\nYet, this show can be a tearjerker at times too. The emotional context draws important value with a character named Shizu. After a titanic battle against a demon known as Ifrit, we learn about her past and Rimuru even inherits her will. Taking on her form, Rimuru realizes that he can\u2019t save everyone regardless how powerful he is. It sets the path of his journey to keep promises such as being a mentor for younger kids. In the latter half of the show, Rimuru finds a group of children with magical potential and tries to lead them as a positive role model. \\n\\n\r\nEven as an isekai show established with such a powerful protagonist, its character cast shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. We meet a variety of characters with colorful personalities during Rimuru\u2019s adventures. Some of the most noticeable ones includes his allies such as Shion, Shuna, Gobuta, Benimaru, Ranga, and later on, the Demon Lord Millim. Through Rimuru\u2019s character interactions, it\u2019s easy to see how his charisma inspires others. Many of Rimuru\u2019s followers shows great respect for him and similarly, he deeply cares about them. Even Millim, a Demon Lord with overwhelming powers, takes a liking to him as the two forms an unlikely alliance. Respect of course isn\u2019t just demanded but earned. Thanks to Rimuru\u2019s abilities, he manages to make alliances with the most unlikely races. Under Rimuru\u2019s leadership, he even sets forth to build a new country with his allies. The central element of storytelling relies on Rimuru\u2019s way of showing his will. He proves this throug his actions and words. Really, by the end of the show, I felt like I understood Rimuru far more than I originally anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my love for the show\u2019s witty humor, colorful character cast, and storytelling, I should point out the anime still suffers from pitfalls. Fan service scenes with baths are common and Rimuru is still vulnerable to earthly desires in the fantasy world. In fact, I dare say the author made the monster girls as cute and sexy as possible. Millim and Shion are prime examples for their character designs. Just take a close look at them. Millim is pretty much half naked in her default outfit while Shion gives more of a mature lady vibe. Like most fantasy isekai, elves are characterized as desirable by males. This is shown early in the show when Rimuru encounters them and finds himself in brief moments of lust. While the storytelling has adequate development and carries an emotional weight, it\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s great writing. In fact, many of Rimuru\u2019s battles are extremely predictable even against the strongest of adversaries. In most of those fights, you should certainly expect Rimuru to be the winner. While the series also gives some of its supporting cast time to shine, most of the spotlight falls under our little slime-kun. Perhaps a bit too much...\\n\\n\r\nFinally, 8-bit is back. After years of mediocre light novel adaptations like Infinite Stratos and Knight\u2019s & Magic, Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken\u2019s sets a bar for being a marvelous example of world fiction. The magical world contains fruitful amount of content such as the various nations we see. Tempest is the most prominent one ruled by Rimuru. Located in the Jura Forest, it\u2019s a prime example of a monster country filled with larger than life characters. Meanwhile, other locations such as Brumund Kingdom and Dwargon reminds me of the high fantasy elements of the isekai genre. While the visual quality can look a bit cartoonish at times, it remains vibrant, bright, and contains a fine degree of palette. It suits for this particular show with its lighthearted humor. The character designs are of course worth mentioning in the case of Rimuru, the Demon Lords, his monster allies, and the infamous Veldora Tempest. At times, I feel like the author really put his thought into making them look as otherwordly as possible. The battle choreography also delivers a visual direction of what isekai shows should be. Nothing too groundbreaking but being able to showcase what characters\u2019 abilities can really do. You should definitely not expect a DBZ-level style of action quality but be prepared for some jawbreaking cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t you just wish life was simpler these days? Looking back at Rimuru\u2019s adventure, I confess that I am a bit envious of his life. He is so carefree despite being an such a prominent figure in his world. Whether taking on the form of a slime, human, or Shizu, Rimuru makes everything look so easy. As such, watching this show felt like an easy way of passing time and enjoying what the author creator wanted us to experience. Now I wish life was easier.",

They are typically weak, but certain slimes, such as massive ones, ones made of special materials, or ones that are immune to damage, can be quite dangerous and deadly. Its usual attack is to engulf its prey.\r\nThe Slime is an iconic creature from Dragon Quest, but the existence of slime monsters dates back at least as far as Dungeons and Dragons, to the Gelatinous Cube. Which is suggested to be an invention of Gary Gygax.\r\nTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken is an adaptedseries of Manga written by \"Fuse\" is the Maga Theme adventure and fantasy series was first released in March of the year two thousand five eventually got serialized this season.Seri was adapted by \"8bit\" and got twenty four episodes that started to date the two months ago, this series was so much not found many loggers of manga and anime because this series has a very unique story story as well as in the bamps of comedy elements that are very inviting lace tits make this series begin to reap its popularity.\\n\\n\r\nTells the story of an office employee named \"Satoru Mikami\" who wants to go to a restaurant to eat with his theme. But in the middle of a trip an unexpected event a criminal suddenly attacked his theme armed with courage and a sense of responsibility he was willing to sacrifice his life just for the theme Stabbed by the villain. Before he died he told his theme to destroy his PC (Personal Computer) because inside the PC had a very important secret document. For most people, we thought that we only lived once in this world but Satoru was strangely thrown into fantasy world where things that are impossible can happen in some of their abilities in the world he did some experiments including magic. But he still did not know why he was thrown in that strange world and why he turned into a slime instead of a human?\\n\\n\r\nAfter being thrown into the world Fantasy Satoru met a dragon he asked about the world after chatting so many satoru decided to make the dragon his family and they changed his name to the \"Tempest\" Sorator himself changed his name to \"Rimuru Tempest\" but the dragon was still in the seal by the big crystal chunks to sealed the dragon's power the Satoru decided to bring the dragon by eating and analyzing how to free the dragon and that's the story rolling.\\n\\n\r\nThe themed of this series adventure has a good graphic quality not just a background or can we call the Landscape this series is also good in the character design.Seri has a very unique character that rarely owned any series is \"slime\" color selection so so many contrast making the real impression of the audience.Seri adapted from the manga is illustrated by \"Kawakami Taiki\" is quite interesting because it has a very unique character makes the illustrator difficult to adjust to other characters but it is not a big obstacle even with the very unique character can add to the storyline to become more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a main character \"Rimuru Tempest\" he is a work office worn for stabbed by a criminal, in the unique capability of making this main character this is much popular than people not only the time appearance also no less as a unique creature Slime also has a funny and adorable impression. \"Tempest\" is a family name that has two members that is \"Tempest Verudora\" is a dragon that is cighed in the crystal and the other \"Tempest Rimuru\".\\n\\n\r\nIncomplete if a good animation is not supported by the sound section. The \"8bit\" studio party brought in \"Okasaki Miho\" who will fill the Rimuru Tempest voice. For the studio's opening theme, \"Takuma Terashima\" will sing the nameless story as the opening theme. the opening theme will be sung by \"TRUE\" titled another colony.\\n\\n\r\nAs the Manga and Light novel reader if the two things got the serialization then it was so glad to be first-shaped and the following now the series began adapting to being a video.Resial was honestly he was nice since I read the Mangananya series and I really enjoyed the series and in the end the series got a serialization was the news is happy. In this season has some very good series of one of these Tensei Slime this.",

Amorphous.  Pliable.  Flaccid.\r\nNo.  This is not an explanation of Rimuru \u201cThe Slime\u201d Tempest\u2019s appearance \u2014 or a Donkey Kong dong Shlong \u2014 rather, it\u2019s a succinct description of That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime\u2019s (henceforth, will be referred to as just\u201cSlime\u201d) unstructured plot and the easily influenced cast of characters.  Now before the various facets of the show in question are taken apart to illuminate its numerous failures, one must give credit where credit is due.  For Mikami Satoru (Rimuru Tempest) to have the wherewithal to instruct his friend to destroy his hard drive \u2014 due to the massive amounts of downloaded pornography, allegedly \u2014 in the midst of his final moments on earth, was nothing short of being hilarious and befitting of the modern day virgin.  But as well-timed as this joke was, it bamboozled the viewer into thinking that Slime\u2019s story would entail more adult-oriented humor, instead of a puerile adventure about freeing a dragon (Veldora) from an Endless Prison.\\n\\n\r\nBesides this subterfuge, Slime grants Rimuru with \u2014 no exaggeration \u2014 the most ridiculously over-powered \u201ccheat code\u201d in the existence of Isekai.  Although, at first, Rimuru is perceived as a relatively weak, helpless being, his ability to absorb literally anything to amass new skills is ridiculously \u201cbroken.\u201d  Furthermore, Rimuru can alter his appearance on demand and can later combine different abilities to forge new, stronger spells/attacks.  Plus he can create potions for healing, various weapons for killing, and manipulate time itself.  Still, though.  This does little justice to the wide array of skills he displays throughout the series.  Literally, if you can think of it, Rimuru either possesses it or can ascertain it through his absorptive powers.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhy is this a problem, though?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPeople, typically, can not acquire new skills on the drop of a dime.  It takes time and a great deal of dedication.  Take Naruto, for example.  Even though humans will never produce a Rasengan in their life (a terrible pity), they can empathize with Naruto\u2019s hard work and determination in mastering the difficult, new skill.  Rimuru, on the other hand, appropriates spells/powers rather effortlessly, making his \u201carduous\u201d journey difficult to empathize with.  To put it another way: imagine the smartest person you knew growing up, and how effortlessly they achieved straight \u201cA\u2019s.\u201d  Their accomplishments seem watered down because they are expected given their superior intelligence, rather than achieved through rigorous persistence.  This is the same dilemma the viewer is faced with when watching Slime.  Rimuru, to the detriment of the series, is too perfect and no task seems formidable enough to properly challenge him.  \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, as far as characterization goes, Rimuru is as bland as oatmeal without milk (that\u2019s right, dry out of the bag mother f\u2014ker\u2019s).  He presumably lived 37 years as a human, but routinely acts like a child \u2014 especially in the presence of voluptuous women.  Due to him possessing incredible powers, having an altruistic mindset, and not having any discernible personality (besides being a kind individual), he immediately evoked comparisons to the Gary Stu complex.  Which hits the nail right on the head!  What\u2019s worse, is that Rimuru \u2014 the focal point of Slime \u2014 experienced diminutive growth/development throughout the course of the series.  He is the veritable vanilla protagonist in this metaphorical Slime sundae (ewww!) that was so sorely missing in delicious toppings (what am I talking about?). \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast of characters, woefully, failed to elicit any fond memories, as the writing staff seemed more concerned about character quantity, rather than quality.  Essentially, each character get\u2019s their five minutes of \u201cuseful\u201d screen time, and then they are effectively disregarded to clear the way for even more characters.  Besides Shizue Izawa \u2014 who had a mildly interesting backstory \u2014 every character is easily forgettable, becoming a distant memory after the end of each episode.  Until they come back in another episode and you\u2019re like, \u201coh, they still exist?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the plot, it proceeded like clockwork.  Various problems occurred to create \u201ctension,\u201d but no situation felt insurmountable.  Rimuru, per the hero obligation, spouted useless, uninspiring lines, such as: \u201cIf I don\u2019t don\u2019t kill him now, it really will be a disaster,\u201d to substantiate the stigma of the boring, invincible hero archetype.  It also perpetuated the overall laziness of modern day anime writers.  Their inability to craft new, interesting stories and layered characters \u2014 with a semblance of authenticity \u2014 demonstrate their lack of ambition and willingness to take bold risks.\\n\\n\r\nSlime is an anemic mimicry that never breaks free from its own constraints, hamstringing its potential to inspire excitement and joy in the viewing audience.  Instead of a \u201chot mess,\u201d Slime is just a mess.  A wet, goopy mess.",

            "content": "\"That time I got roped into thinking that this anime might actually be good after seeing all of the praise for it only to be terribly disappointed\" basically sums of my experience with TenSura right now. \r\nThis season's token isekai anime is super duper original because it's protagonist gets reincarnated as a slime instead of a person. Mind = Blown. Our hero is portrayed as an embarrassment to society with no unique qualities who dies a horrible death when he ventures outside to communicate with other humans. Now here we have the moral of the story: Don't go outside kids. So after dying a virginand being reborn in a fantasy world as a slime, our hero suddenly develops communication and tactical skills out of nowhere and gets a voice actor who doesn't sound dead on the inside. This is where the mediocre adventure of a slime begins.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what the biggest flaw of this anime is? It isn't entertaining. I just don't find the humor funny, and when you're a comedy anime, this is a pretty significant issue. And the one thing that the anime included that was actually amusing, which was the frickin tsundere dragon, the protagonist just has to go and ruin it by eating said tsundere dragon. I mean damn, If I wanted to watch vore, I'd find some messed up hentai to watch  instead. So before being consumed, the tsundere dragon and the slime gave each other the name Tempest. Now another reason why I'm bored slimeless by this anime is because Tempest is a pretty lackluster protagonist. He just does things with seemingly no actual purpose, and...yeah, there's really nothing else to say about him actually. Oh wait, his most notable characteristic is the fact that he's a pervert who likes boobs. Which leads us to the one  enjoyable aspect of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nMonster Girl Tiddies \\n\\n\r\nThat's right, we've got goblin tits, elf boobs, and so many other female species with cleavage. I can't wait to see what monster they decide to slap breasts on next! Because when everything else fails, just throw in some fan service, and all problems are solved, amiright? It doesn't matter if the plot is garbage, because sexy anime girls make everything better! Seriously though, the plot of TenSura has been painfully mediocre so far. Nothing eventful has happened. Every character worships Tempest because he's da supah cool protagonist with no flaws whatsoever who helps out everyone he meets. Yep, that's basically the synopsis of the narrative. Plus the visuals and sound of this anime are rather standard and forgettable, which doesn't help.\\n\\n\r\nIf a comedy anime makes me yawn more than laugh like TenSura's done thus far, then there's a problem. Sprinkle in a generic isekai plot and add a teaspoon of undeveloped characters and you get quite the slime of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd nobody wants that.",

            "content": "Honestly, the whole isekai trope isn't inherently bad- It's definitely feasible to make something genuinely good with creative world building, interesting character interactions, good direction and premise, and so on. Unfortunately, this series, like most others, has none of those and is quite literally the most trite isekai that could be made by what I'd presume to be a human. Though if someone said this was computer generated by re-using every awful isekai trope ever, I'd unironically believe it. This is a prime example of a series using an incredibly \"clickbaity\" title as a hook without offering anything of substance beyond it, and it reallyshows.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, even the title is boring as shit aside from the \"slime\" part. \"That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime\" says nothing aside from the fact that the main character is going to be a slime. Big if true. Shocking. Apparently the author had real difficult time coming up with the title. Sure, there isn't anything inherently wrong with making an eyecatching title- But if the answer to that is just literally putting the premise as one, then it's pretty safe to say the author is very obviously creatively bankrupt and the series isn't worth the time. And to add to the insult, the character is an overpowered sue character that doesn't even abide by the common notion of a slime and the series becomes another self-insert power fantasy. And to even further add to the insult, it still manages to use the generic cute anime girl design instead of the slime in the promotional poster. Amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of this series is also disgustingly generic, and it really boggles my mind how some people unironically think any of this is good world building. Slimes, dwarves, goblins, orcs, monster wolves, dragons, elves, demon lords, and just any other Dragon Quest reject mobs you can think of, and it's got them all. Essentially it's like making a randomly generated dungeon with RPG Maker's premade assets and just calling it a day. There's nothing interesting to look at, because you've seen them all before- The only thing that could remotely subvert an expectation would be that they act slightly differently from the \"norm\", but even that is overdone and tiring. \\n\\n\r\nBut you might be thinking, \"Who cares if it borrows assets from every other isekai fantasy series ever? That doesn't say anything about its writing quality.\" And you'd be right- It doesn't. But what it says about the series, is just complete utter lack of creativity not only in assets, but also in just general writing. \\n\\n\r\nJust look at this nonsense up to the sixth episode:\\n\\n\r\n[minor spoiler below]\\n\r\nThe main character gets reincarnated as a slime in a different world- Then immediately by the second episode, he becomes an overpowered sue character that can quite literally do anything. They can just eat anything of any size and instantly gain all of its powers and abilities, because apparently that's what slimes do. He also has infinite storage of what he eats, and can finitely but perfectly reproduce anything he also eats as long as he has the resources in his infinite storage. Then if that wasn't enough, he also gets a giant exposition machine called The Great Sage in his head that just explains away anything that he might be unfamiliar with, so there's absolutely no struggle. Then if that also wasn't enough, he doesn't have any motivation whatsoever other than completing a few \"side quests\" he might encounter along the way, so his characterization is the most boring \"good guy\" trope you can think of. Then of course, everyone likes him because he's Number One. And if there's someone who doesn't like him? Clearly must be evil or stupid. Or both. \\n\r\n[minor spoiler above]\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the writing needs a gigantic exposition machine in the first place already shows that the writer is absolutely incompetent and that unraveling his dollar store isekai world care package through other means is simply beyond his talent. This exposition machine is also incredibly obnoxious as it constantly cuts off whatever is happening on the screen into some Shaft-style Powerpoint presentation mode whenever it wants to explain, which just doesn't do well for the flow of the show. This sort of exposition machine is commonly used in narrative when the main character isn't talkative or is a video game character that responds based on player input to add some sort of character dynamic while maintaining that form of interactivity- So when it's used aside a very talkative main character, it really goes to show terrible the writing is to warrant the usage of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the show doesn't even make great use of what little it has going for it- The production budget. I guess they thought they found the next Overlord in the making, so the quality of the visuals is actually pretty good. Sadly, the series also spends a lot of time on minutes and minutes of monologue, explaining characters' powers and abilities, and covering backstories of side characters nobody cares about. Essentially, this is the Weeny Hut Jr. version of Sword Art Online, but I guess people don't even notice the similarities because Kirito got a cool slime mask. With this trend, I can already see that \"Reborn as a Vending Machine, Now I Wander the Dungeon\" series having a bright future as soon as it's picked up by any semi-decent studio. No, that actually is a thing. And yes, anime is fucking dead.\\n\\n\r\nPress F to Pay Respects.\\n",

            "content": "As someone with literally thousands of hours of playtime in the Sid Meier's Civilization series over the years, I very much appreciated this anime.\r\nIsekai series are a standard staple in the anime industry nowadays and managing to stand out from the crowd can be easier said than done. Generally the way people do this is by giving some sort of twist to an otherwise quite generic setup, which in the case of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is quite simply that the protagonist gets reincarnated as a slime of all things once he gets transported to this particular fantasy world. However, it is important tounderstand that that part is *NOT* what makes this anime stand out from most other isekai series. Rather it is how likeable the protagonist is as a character and most importantly the general style and execution of its story.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, regardless of what kind of twist people like to throw into their isekai novels, in general they still boil down to a similar end goal. You normally have some sort of greater peril to tackle or evil demon lord for the MC to defeat and in the process of doing so he'll get his own harem etcetera; it's all very shounen-like in terms of writing. But Slime isn't really like that. Instead, this anime is much more relaxed and focuses on completely different kinds of challenges.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, watching Slime is like watching a let's play of a fantasy version of a game of Sid Meier's Civilization. At the beginning of the story, our protagonist Rimuru comes across a poor goblin village, very basic and currently suffering from attacks by nearby wolf packs in the forest. He offers to help the tribe, and in the process not only manages to deal with the threat of the wolves, but by using his powers he's able to help the goblins domesticate them and join forces for mutual benefit. After being chosen as the new leader of the tribe due to his accomplishments, Rimuru starts the long and arduous task of trying to transform the village into something greater.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a large part of what the anime is truly about: the evolution of civilization. Over the course of story we get to see more and more races join the village as it grows into a larger town. We get to see the establishment of culture and diplomacy with other nations, the progression of science and infrastructure, the birth of an independent country and the political negotiations of a fresh, multi-species society with the rest of the world. It's all quite fascinating to watch and it makes me wonder why this is such a rare thing to see in anime. It's not only rare but at least if you ask me, it's also a hell of a lot more interesting than a group of people feeding off the power of friendship to go overthrow some evil demon lord or whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nNow that is not to say that Slime doesn't have its fair share of action and clashes with hostile forces as well, but they are generally more large-scale conflicts with other nations. Also, while it is undeniable that Rimuru is ridiculously strong due to his completely broken Predator ability that lets him devour anything, I never felt that this was much of a drawback for the anime. Even if he may be overpowered, at the end of the day the eventual goal of the anime isn't just to defeat a bunch of enemies. The main challenges of this story are not ones that can simply be solved with brute force; they are a lot more sophisticated in nature, and I appreciate that a lot.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the second half of Slime isn't quite as good as the first half as there are less challenges standing in the way both in terms of peaceful and hostile ones. It feels a bit more slice of life-like and also contains a bit of a side arc that I don't really think did a whole lot good for the anime as a whole. I did have the show scored as a 9 for the majority of its airing but ultimately I had to chop off a point towards the end for this fact alone. Nevertheless, with a second season already confirmed, I can only hope that it finds its footing again once that comes around.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Slime is a great isekai show for the simple reason that it's focused on what it's simply like to start a new life in a new world\u2014as well as the aforementioned evolution of society\u2014without having to turn the story into a generic shounen fantasy adventure in the process. It's just a fun anime in general, and Rimuru's cheerful, smug and smart outlook on the world does a great deal for its overall enjoyment value as well. The show certainly wouldn't be the same without him. Overall, it's a very enjoyable and surprisingly creative show which is always cheerful, light-hearted and relaxing, without any excessive drama needed. Definitely recommended.",

            "content": "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime \u2014 but not really, since writing a fantasy story with an actually weak main character would take some effort, so let's just throw that overpowered blue blob into the usual generic JRPG fantasy world and hope we can get away with it.\r\nWell, they did. After all, that title would be too long even for a light novel. And the isekai formula still works like a charm: you just need to change whatever the main character gets incarnated in next, be it a polar bear, a vending machine, or \u2014 oh for fuck's sake \u2014 bloody Vladimir Putin(just make sure to make them all overpowered self-insert characters, or else...they might start taking you seriously).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDude dies and gets reincarnated as a demigo...I mean, a slime, in the aforementioned generic fantasy world (which needs no introduction, if you saw one you saw them all). Every obstacle is won over some stupidly overpowered ability the slime was incarnated with for some reason; probably cheat codes. It doesn't last long, though, since a cute blue-haired girl sells more.\\n\r\nAt first, it got me excited, since the first episode is pretty irreverent and fun, and I thought I was in for a parody-esque anime in the vein of Konosuba; as the second kicked in, however, it was obvious this would be just your run-of-the-mill isekai with nothing new under the sun. I kept watching to see if they could turn it around, but it doesn't seem it will. It can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or not, and meanwhile, it bores you to death.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nInexistent I guess? Rimuru's voice got annoying right on episode 2, and he (?) doesn't really have a relevant personality. Everyone else but two characters who receive the flashback treatment on the Dwarf Town (which doesn't really help us care about them) is just fodder for jokes or for Rimuru's slow descent into megalomania. \\n\r\nIn episode 6 we finally meet our promised main girl...which proceeds to fall in love at first sight with our dear blob, so I figure we can get her out of the picture as to having any chance of being a decent character.*\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is actually pretty good when it wants, but most of the time it doesn't really matter. The bits in which Rimuru communicates with the sage, especially at the first episode, were pretty nice to look at. A shame the rest is just unremarkable.\\n\r\nThe opening/ending is ok. Not much to look at. Rimuru's voice gets annoying, though, especially when he starts laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something that will make you mildly amused at best for a couple of minutes each week, give it a try. It might just be your cup of tea. Otherwise, it's just an utter waste of time and you won't find anything redeemable here. Better dispose of that ever-growing plan to watch list before.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER: she dies. The episode after. Now this is going swell.",

            "content": "I love to see how the anime industry supports these authors who in their stories abjectly abuse the same format, and within the same format take advantage of the same resources and end up creating a garbage like this BUT that inevitably takes the liking of Most, I love it. \r\nIt must be clear that the protagonist, a man of 37 yo, is a failure, so the first thing that is mentioned in the anime is that it is a virgin and all that, but being transported magically to another world and lifestyle, its existence begins to be more interesting, a premise that reminds meof another 200 animes that I saw. \\n\r\nBeing more specific, my problem with most of the stories that are based on reality, but that have supernatural facts, is the mediocre execution that they decide to give him in a hurry, here in less than 5 minutes we had a protagonist lying on the floor about to pass for the other side, they even tried to dramatize the moment even knowing that it was going to turn into a blue bug. The process of translacion although it has been mediocre, although that supposedly should not matter could be worse...\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that has \"original\" in this anime is the most obvious, the Slime is usually portrayed as a weak and insignificant creature, the author knowing that and had the great idea of \u200b\u200bturning it into an all-powerful being and protagonist of its history, Deconstruction = masterpiece. \\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, at no time I noticed a good interaction between the cast shown so far, the dialogues are boring at all times, the moments that predominate the chapters try to be mature or at least serious, the protagonist spends too much time talking alone inquiring about irrelevant things. \\n\\n\r\nGenders \\n\r\nFantasy 5/10 \\n\r\nLike any other isekai, is it well executed but seriously, again the same? \\n\r\nShounen 5/10 \\n\r\nThe series has no message, the writing is very poor and off, the fights I do not know if they deserve to be called fights because their modality is absurd, because of the context that they are given, and because of the acting of the characters especially the powers of the Slime. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not allowed to be bad because it is one of the things that the viewer has more in mind today with these mediocre animes, therefore, the animation is spectacular, but the settings are not good enough for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the fever of overrating began with what the manga started and because the protagonist is a blue Slime OP.\\n\\n\r\n(Review translated from Spanish to English)",

            "content": "What started off as a unique premise of a middle aged man being reincarnated into a Slime in a fantasy setting, slowly devolved into another generic, power fantasy Isekai. [Warning spoilers]\r\nThe light hearted slimevilization was fun for a while, but it became boring. \r\nStory (4/10):\r\nThere\u2019s not much to the story. Rimuru says he wants to get avenge Shizu and defeat the demon lord Leon, well not really it\u2019s just building Rimuru\u2019s nation until the next enemy attacks. There\u2019s no tension/stakes, especially after Milim joins. The loli demon lord is too OP for her own good. She could oneshot all of the enemies, but doesn\u2019t becauseof plot convenience. Milim\u2019s basically a get out of free card as long as she\u2019s by Rimuru\u2019s side, which removes tension from an already tensionless story.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building isn\u2019t that good. While we learn about the races/species that inhabit the Great Jura Forest and watch how Rimuru\u2019s nation is built, we don\u2019t know much about the other regions. If the story shifted it\u2019s focal point to other regions the world would have felt more grand and alive.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one-dimensional and are only made likeable through a couple of character traits. They aren't remotely realistic or relatable. They don\u2019t develop past their initial introduction. The author constantly introduces more characters instead of developing the ones he has already e.g. Benimaru looks like he has potential, but he doesn\u2019t have much going for him besides being a loyal servant like everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru has no personality or character flaws aside from being a laid-back \u2018good guy\u2019. He\u2019s pretty much a self-insert character. Everyone loves Rimuru in the world. They worship Rimuru and join his side soon after meeting him, to the point it becomes cheap and unearned. They literally bow down and promise to serve him and in return they get a powerup from being given a name! It reaches \u201cSASUGA AINZ SAMA!!1!\u201d in terms of annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nThe Great Sage is essentially a exposition plot device. It knows and explains everything in this world that Rimuru is unfamiliar with and solves all of his problems. Basically it\u2019s lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe humanification of the races annoys me because it\u2019s blatant fanservice. For example, Benimaru turns into a handsome man, Shion turns into a busty oppai bodyguard, the lizard girls look like hot kunoichis. Whereas, what happens to Gabiru & the male lizards? They just get wings...    \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are awful. The writer approaches them by making Rimuru so ridiculously overpowered and the enemy so much weaker that they stand no chance in beating him, so fights end in a oneshot. When the enemy is stronger than Rimuru, Milim just takes care of it. Slightly off topic, in the fight against Charbydis, it annoyed me that Rimuru forced her to sit out while willing to risk the danger of his people and rely on his allies when Milim\u2019s standing right next to him. Rimuru came across as a hypocrite when he insulted Souei, Ranga and Shion and told them to \u201crely on me a bit\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI digress, my biggest problem with Slime is how EVERYTHING gets handed to Rimuru easily:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Encountering the goblin village and becoming their leader right away.\\n\r\n\u2022 Defeating the Orc Lord\\n\r\n\u2022 Dwargon King arriving with his men and issuing a duel-> ends up forming a peace treaty\\n\r\n\u2022 Charbydis was described as an apocalyptic event coming to destroy the Jura Tempest nation and had the whole forest scared-> Milim one shots him. \\n\r\n\u2022 Carrion shows up and makes a non aggression pact because plot\\n\r\n\u2022 Milim betraying the Demon lords to join Rimuru\u2019s side because of honey and them being \u201cbest friends\u201d...\\n\r\n\u2022 Rimuru asking enemies to become friends and build a nation together. \\n\\n\r\nEverything seems to work out for him. None of the races fight in his nation or have any conflict. Rimuru acquires abilities to resolve any situation because of how overpowered the great Sage is. It really should have some drawbacks.\\n\\n\r\nIf this was one situation I would overlook it, but it\u2019s a constant occurrence. Nothing feels like it\u2019s taken seriously. There\u2019s no meaningful/real conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nAny build up to a situation is always killed off in the most anti-climatic way e.g. Charbydis was hyped up being this Calamity as strong as the Demon Lords, however everything was resolved in less than a day and ended with Milim oneshotting him. What did Charbydis subplot add to the story? Nothing, besides being a shoe horned plot device that came out of nowhere to show powerful Milim is. I would have enjoyed watching everyone fight together to defeat the \u201craid boss\u201d, but instead she made everyone\u2019s efforts seem pointless.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is average. The soundtracks are fine. I do enjoy the opening and think the upbeat, lighthearted song fits the tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10): \\n\\n\r\nSlime peaked in the Shizu arc. Everything revolving her was great. It\u2019s really telling that even though Shizu had little screen time, she managed to be the most fleshed out character in the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nSlime is relatively good until the Orc arc. It goes downhill in the 2nd half, particularly after the arrival of Milim. According to manga and LN readers, the anime skips a lot of content, especially world building and it\u2019s noticeable e.g. the students arc is rushed, we get subtle foreshadowing about Veldora, something strange about Chloe\u2019s summoning but the show doesn\u2019t expand on them.\\n\\n\r\nSlime would have been better if it wasn\u2019t always so lighthearted, if it stopped introducing so many characters without developing out the previous ones first and followed through with the buildup instead of everything getting easily resolved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels as if the story is on easy difficulty.",

            "content": "After hearing so much about Reincarnated as a Slime I finally decided to binge the 13 eps that are out to see what the fuss is about. I am pretty disappointed with what I found, not because the show is terrible, but at how over-hyped it has been.\r\nTo start, the story so far is pretty boring. Pretty much every conflict that has happened so far has been resolved either by our OP protag, or the OP ability gifted by our protag to his friends (I'll leave it at that for spoilers). This was fine at first but by episode 13 I should have seen ourcharacters struggle against SOMETHING- and to be clear this is not One Punch Man. There is no hidden conflict for our MC, and very little humor regarding our MC's easy victories. And just when a plot point get's interesting (around ep 7-8) the show gets rid of it, seemingly to swerve the audience expectations at the expense of creating a fun and interesting character dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are nothing special either. Our MC is a typical overpowered shounen protag, a pervy incel thrust into a wish-fulfillment fantasy. He has a few funny one liners but there is nothing interesting about him (it?) except that he/it is a slime. Oh and by episode 10 he has a human form because a show about a slime MC didn't want to commit to keeping a slime MC. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters aren't much better. Every time an interesting character is introduced the plot pushes them out of spotlight in one way or another, and replaces them with boring one dimensional anime tropes. I have nothing against anime tropes- but a show has to do something special and when every other aspect of the show is just average, the boring characters really stand out. In all fairness, there is one fun character (Gobta) who is honestly the highlight of the show imo. Maybe he can save the show in the last 11 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in this show are fine, if not above average. a lot of the action looks smooth and the animations are pretty. Unfortunately above-average animation has almost nothing to do with making a show good. On the other, I have found strong musical scores can really add to the emotional impact of a scene, and help mask some messy plot at times. Unfortunately none of the music here was of that quality. Not to say it was bad, but the best way to describe it is that I watched all 13 episodes within 40 hours of writing this and can't recall a single tune. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this show is the kicker imo. Easily the most subjective category here and while I've bashed the show up til now I can definitely tell this is a show that many enjoy and many reading this would enjoy it as well. It's a \"turn your mind off and watch the protag kick ass\" kind of show, and even I have a special spot for guilty pleasure shows (looking at you Irregular at Magic High). If you are simply a fan of isekai or need a tropey pick-me-up then this might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is pretty average and I don't understand the hype. Pretty much every other review I've read or heard has glowingly praised the show as \"charming\" yet this seems to a fairly intangible concept used to cover up a show that really doesn't do anything unique. If you want a \"charming\" average isekai then this is the show for you, but I would not recommend Reincarnated as a Slime to anyone who has been misled to the idea that this is the next big thing or SAO done right. \\n\\n\\n\r\n**Edit: Through Episode 16 nothing has changed and the show has only doubled down on its flaws. I'm still hopeful for a fun and challenging arc to close out the series though, so I can't write it off just yet.",

            "content": "When was the last time a light novel adaptation or isekai tried to be straightforward? Nothing fancy, nothing repetitive or self-indulgent, just simple. With the likes of Re:Zero, Akashic Records, Overlord, and Mahouka, it\u2019s become harder and harder to find an LN or isekai show that just wants to entertain (parodies like Konosuba don't count cuz fuck you). Even many of the \u201csimpler\u201d, \u201csafer\u201d anime like The Asterisk War and Isekai wa Smartphone fail to realize that we just want something simple and satisfying. That\u2019s probably why Slime is as popular as it is. It just wants to entertain us with a fun, digestible isekaiworld for an adorable protagonist to build in and explore. Not to mention, it does so with some decent visuals, good music, and the sense of whimsey you\u2019d expect from a show about being in a game-like world. That\u2019s not to say the show never gets violent, that it never indulges in typical LN and isekai cliches, or even that it\u2019s a good show. It\u2019s just that Slime values entertainment above all else, never overindulging to the point of stupidity or alienation. Frankly, this is the first isekai in years to not suck.\\n\\n\r\nSlime\u2019s visuals are honestly strange. It doesn\u2019t really feel like it was made in 2018 or 2019. Something about this odd and inconsistent art style doesn\u2019t feel like something you\u2019d see nowadays. While the art style certainly feels unorthodox, a lot of the facial expressions are priceless and adorable as a result, particularly with Rimuru\u2019s slime form. The sheer liveliness of some of the environments trumps even the likes of No Game No Life, which is arguably the most visually stunning isekai on the market. The show often experiments with different styles, like swapping between anime and photorealistic footage when getting us acquainted with Rimuru\u2019s slime form in episode 1, or when he fantasizes about hot elves and they\u2019re drawn in a 90s aesthetic. Several moments in the show, along with the first ED, also add a sort of digital, VR-like filter to whatever\u2019s happening onscreen. Speaking of the first ED, the visuals for it change 4 times, and each version looks great. Even when they\u2019re not experimenting, some of the action scenes and sequences of Rimuru wandering around in slime form look stunning and fluid. The first OP is a wonderful example of this. Sadly, the visuals are about as inconsistent as everything else. For every moment of smooth or lively visuals, we have moments of typical static shots, and episodes where we don\u2019t get much animation. Some of the background and foreground scrolling tends to look awkward as well, and the rampant CGI tends to be even worse. Still, the character designs are generally great, and the high points in the animation put nearly every other isekai or LN adaptation to shame. Studio 8bit is probably one of the better sources of isekai anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nEven more vibrant is the music. Early on, we\u2019re treated to some fun chiptune pieces, along with some adventurous tracks. Somehow, the amount of more lighthearted and fun tracks, and even the amount of battle themes is completely overshadowed by the sheer volume of great emotional pieces. A track that perfectly exemplifies both sides of this is actually the first ED, \"Another colony\" by TRUE. The guitars and drums give this energetic vibe that\u2019s both invigorating and a tad emotional, and the violins more than add to the more emotional aspect of the song. Along with the decent vocals, these elements turn this into one of the better EDs of 2018, and a great way to cap off each episode. I don\u2019t care as much for the second ED despite its more sentimental tone. Takuma Terashima does the 2 OPs of this season, and they are both fantastic. The first, \u201cNameless Story\u201d, is a striking tune, especially with that bombastic usage of the special guitar which gives a more rustic, perhaps 2000s vibe. The visuals accentuate that vibe, as both aspects of the OP meld to create both this sense of adventure and danger. The second OP, \u201cMeguru Mono\u201d is a far calmer, more emotional piece that shows just how far Rimuru and his civilization have come, and how wondrous things will remain in the future.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from an isekai, the writing is a bit of a mess. The show\u2019s pacing is often strange, and it has a ton of pointless and bewildering time skips. Emotional moments often feel rushed or conjured out of thin air, and the show often forgets about its characters until they randomly appear later. Examples of the latter include the time when Gobta\u2019s just left alone in a cell halfway into episode 5 and forgotten about, or when the goblins and wolves are told to wait outside at the beginning of episode 4 and are forgotten about until episode 6, where we see them and a whole new batch of goblins working. The show also tends to resort to time skips, glossing over the progression of the central village Rimuru builds, and making the town\u2019s progression and some of Rimuru\u2019s absences feel utterly ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the world-building is sometimes inconsistent and unexplained, like how Rimuru could only name like 50 or so goblins and one wolf before passing out in episode 3 and then 500 goblins in episode 6. The worst case of the latter is in episode 19 where the wolf Ranga suddenly has a strong partnership with Shion and pulls a flying ability out of nowhere, since the characters ask how and when he learned that and became that close with her, and we never get an answer. Granted, the world-building is never indigestible and rarely broken like it is in Mahouka or Smartphone. It\u2019s just that these issues become especially distracting when the narratives are already rather unremarkable and badly paced. It\u2019s even worse when most of the arc conclusions are drawn-out, anticlimactic, or cheesy, with the 4th arc\u2019s finale being the worst example. That said, some of the storylines in this show are genuinely good. The best example of this is the 3-part storyline with Shizue at the end of arc 1, with its intense backstory and a sentimental payoff for Shizue and her ultimately tragic tale. If only more of this show\u2019s arcs and mini-stories were as good as this or even the majority of the second arc, but inconsistency really is Slime\u2019s middle name.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the characters in this show are actual yes men, often with one defining character trait and only some level of chemistry to make them salvageable. Barring Rimuru (the little asshole), his internal sage assistant, and perhaps the utter dolt that is Gabiru, it seems like the best characters in this show are ones that appear for a short time, like Shizue, Veldora, or the trio of guild adventurers at the end of the first arc. They along with the characters I\u2019ve named often have the most entertaining personalities and chemistry, and the most we get from them are a few gags at Gobta\u2019s, Shion\u2019s, and Rimuru\u2019s expense. Almost none of them have any exceptional personalities or amazing chemistry to rival the GOATs in anime casts, nor do any of them necessarily wring any hype out of me aside from a character introduced in the penultimate episode. However, none of them are insufferable or horribly written. Still, this is probably Slime\u2019s weakest and least entertaining aspect. \\n\\n\r\nThe experience of watching this anime at its best is a lot like that of playing a Kirby game. It has an adorable, round, expressive protagonist who absorbs his enemies\u2019 powers while exploring new lands, and a sense of whimsy crafted by the bouncy slime animation and wonderfully varied OST. The experience of watching this anime at its best is a lot like that of playing a Kirby game. It has an adorable, round, expressive protagonist who absorbs his enemies\u2019 powers while exploring new lands, and a sense of whimsy crafted by the bouncy slime animation and wonderfully varied OST. It\u2019s not necessarily well-written, visually stunning, or even consistently entertaining, but it sets a benchmark for isekai that frankly hasn\u2019t been met in half a decade. All it needed to do in order to not suck was just be straightforward and willing to entertain. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, can we finally have a good isekai again, please? I don\u2019t want another isekai ending with a recap episode, as amusing as this one was. (Yes, the recap is listed as its own anime now, but it was still advertised as the final episode by the show itself, and MAL did not list it as its own entry when this review was made. Fuck you, it's my review...you bullies.)\\n\\n\r\nWritten and Edited by: CodeBlazeFate\\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine",

I've watched many Isekais so far, including Death March and Isekai Smartphone (that one was pretty fun to be honest), so when I heard we're getting ANOTHER Isekai anime, how can I not check it out?\r\nIt was paired with tons of praise (thanks r/anime) which made me think it's some hot stuff.\r\n8 episodes in, and nope. Nothing.\r\nIt's not bad, it's not good, it's \"Fine I guess\".\r\nThe pacing is the biggest problem with the anime. I already have one anime to follow which has the pacing of a snail (thanks One Piece), but unlike One Piece which actually has somedecent stuff going on, Slime has definitely nothing.\\n\\n\r\nToday's episode (8) had 0 content in it (it was 1 page in the manga) yet spread out to 24 minutes, including the MC summarizing what happened in the last few episodes TWICE.\\n\\n\r\n8 Episodes in, and we still have no definite story. Our \"super interesting\" Slime MC does nothing but wander around and beat some bad guys on the way for no real reason. Then we get introduced to a new, interesting character, and the writer hypes us up. Nope, gone.\\n\\n\r\nSo Slime-san is just wandering aimlessly, while showing us some fanservice  of huge elf/goblin/whatever boobs (because why not?)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Smartphone was fun because it didn't take itself seriously, it just shits on everything the Isekai Harem genre presents. But it seems like Slime Datta wants to take itself... seriously?\\n\\n\r\nOh and I say it has no Harem but everyone love him because he's such a nice guy. Not a Harem of 5 girls, but of many women and men.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we already see from the get go that our Slime-san is OP. That's ok, but instead of showing us some flashy fights with him using his super OP powers, nah, he wins because of some other stupid reason.\\n\\n\r\n[Spoiler] Imagine there's a big fire spirit who is super strong and destroyed a village in a second. Our MC must fight him. Fire spirit makes everything burn, while our MC is thinking of a way of action. Then he gets caught in the flames! Oh what will he do? Will he eat the flames and enhance himself? Will he transform into one of the bigger monsters he just ate? Will he cover himself in water? Oh boy what will he do?! Nah, he's just fire resistant. So fire doesn't affect him at all. Great...[EndSpoiler]\\n\\n\r\nBoring, I might not drop it just yet, but I might soon.",

            "content": "Sometimes in anime there comes a point when there is just too much friendship. Characters who were enemies seconds ago suddenly become best friends for no real reason. No hard feelings, no suspicion or anything. Never any problems, just one happy family. There are no alliances of convenience, no fear of being backstabbed, no slow defrosting of relations. I can appreciate the idea of talking people out of hostilities, but come on. Just a few words and there we go, best friends forever? Am I supposed to take this completely unironically?\r\nAnd apparently this is because they really respect the protagonist, whom they have suddenly chosenas their new leader. Yes, they have found their one true love: Rimuru Tempest. Their love for him is so great that they can put aside all their previous grudges just to serve under him or otherwise be friends with him. Everything is forgiven in nanoseconds and they can all live together in perfect harmony. The second ending perfectly pictures the problem: pretty much the entire cast having fun together. There is nothing at stake. There is no conflict. Just sunshine and rainbows all day, every day. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRimuru has no goals in life. He wants nothing for himself, instead wandering around and helping random people he meets. When people gather around him, he likewise dedicates his time to helping them with their mundane problems. Furthermore, he does this in a very passive manner. Something new comes up, and he reacts, for instance by beating up some random generic villain that showed up for no reason. When he does obtain long-term goals, even those are simply things he was entrusted with by people he barely knew. In one particular case, we are informed of the importance of the person beforehand by prophecy because of course this is the best plot device for the job. They are destined for each other even though they have never met because... destiny or something. Seems legit.\\n\\n\r\nHow can I relate to someone like that? They have gone out of their way to write a protagonist so altruistic that angels would blush in envy. It's too much. Especially in a strange new world full of dangers, no believable person would behave in this way, and even if they somehow did, they would be utterly unrelatable. People are not stereotypical heroic protagonists. People are more nuanced, and they carry flaws. Imagine random people, whom you've never met, walking in and asking you to take care of their mundane errands for no real reward. Repeat this over and over again. Of course, you would every time do everything they wanted, right? Without a single complaint, without ever having desires of your own?\\n\\n\r\nI imagine you wouldn't. Because most people are not angels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, we learn very little of Rimuru's personality. This is pretty much all we know:\\n\\n\r\n1) He likes waifus to an extent, and\\n\r\n2) he performs generic good deeds, often against generic villains.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond his fondness of mammary glands and his dislike of generic evil overlords, he does not appear to have any well-defined beliefs or interests. And it is not as though he actively seeks out waifus either. A few of them join him on their own, and while he enjoys their presence, it is not like he actively seeks out their company or tries to develop his relationship with them. After so many episodes, I still don't know what makes him tick. He just kind of... hangs around passively and helps the people around him who make him solve all their problems.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter his rebirth, Rimuru nearly instantly gains nigh godlike powers so that almost nobody is a real threat to him. He didn't even have to work for it much at all because of the cheat abilities he received at birth. Kind of makes the part about being reborn as a slime meaningless when the slime \u2012 an allegedly weak monster \u2012 is instantly godlike. There would be ways to handle an overpowered protagonist. He could at least deliver witty lines or semi-decent jokes on its basis. It could be a satire of overpowered characters. It could be that the protagonist uses his powers in an interesting way, maybe by scheming or making difficult moral judgments. Highlighting their own ruthlessness can actually be funny as well. Unfortunately, Rimuru is in favor of mechanical infodumps and generic super-altruistic lines, so here we are then. \\n\\n\r\nOverpowered abilities and perfect altruism are a terrible combination because it lets characters bypass any difficult moral judgments. They can take the easy way out and trivially solve almost anything, implying that we should all follow their example and take care of every problem we come across. But the rest of us don't have godlike powers, so what do you expect us to do? Sometimes we have to make difficult decisions, and those tend to be the most interesting ones in fiction too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is usually even worse. As I was implying earlier, Rimuru is surrounded by a fanclub whose members worship him without question. They praise him many times during each episode, which gets old fast and really dampens character interaction. They barely have any characterization beyond this either. This fanclub includes women desperate for him because of course it does. You can debate whether it counts as a genuine harem, but either way it is another symptom of the fanclub mentality. This is not how actual people speak to each other, at least if they are being honest. I don't want protagonists to be surrounded by fanatic fanclubs 24/7. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are somehow even worse. There are essentially two types:\\n\\n\r\n1) The card-carrying, mustache-twirling villains in black capes that are the bane of anime and fiction in general. They are so obviously evil that it hurts. God forbid the protagonist has to make difficult moral decisions; we can't have that. Plus the antagonists receive approximately zero characterization and zero interesting lines. Also, they are as incompetent as you'd expect, so a miss in that regard as well. \\n\\n\r\n2) The \"antagonists\" who actually have no interest in opposing Rimuru in the first place. In fact, give it a few minutes and they will be best friends with him. Their reasons for this change of heart are so trivial that there was no real conflict to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a brave stance this show is taking. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad. All the good guys love the protagonist. Actually, many of the alleged bad guys aren't bad either because \u2012 as noted \u2012 they become friends with the protagonist anyway. Sometimes even without fighting. Try offering them some candy. Maybe that will do the trick. Incidentally, does \"Demon Lord\" stand for \"official envoy of friendship\" in this world? Because \u2012 judging by the Demon Lords onscreen \u2012 that sure is what it looks like. What a happy-go-lucky bunch of people. They say you \"fall from grace\" to become one, but that is probably just a troll.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably guess what this does to the plot. Because adversaries instantly become friends, what can the author do to move it along? If you guessed \"make new ones appear out of nowhere,\" you are right, and this is the result. The plot abruptly transitions from one point to another without any strong underlying theme or message, never stopping to think about the events more thoroughly. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru defeats generic evil (or \"evil\") villain A.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru defeats generic evil (or \"evil\") villain B.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru travels somewhere and solves mundane errand X.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru defeats generic evil (or \"evil\") villain C.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru travels to random location Y and saves a bunch of people from a technobabble-based illness or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what did we get out of all this? No cohesive plot, that's for sure. No interesting themes, either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy falls flat as well. The reason is in part the same friendship I have been ranting about. The comedy consists of the usual lighthearted slapstick that we have seen thousands of times, complete with the equally predictable fanservice. I know we shouldn't expect too much, but the show is afraid to offer even the slightest hint of black comedy or scathing commentary. Nor is there any irony or satire found here or even a hint of the simplest sarcasm. No self-awareness. No subversions as far as the eye can see. No funny rants against existing conventions. Here everything is obvious, in-your-face and very conventional, but comedy only works if it is surprising and audacious enough. This show plays it too safe. It is afraid of rocking the boat in any way or form. As a result, it is not funny, even when it is clearly trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Rimuru's dialogue seems really dull and generic, including his inner monologue. He and his infodumping exposition ability \u2012 essentially a robot \u2012 simply describe surrounding events and offer very little in terms of personal viewpoints or deeper thoughts. The wrong way to do world-building is to just dump the info, go \"Hmm? So that's how it is,\" and leave it at that. Sure, Rimuru may plan to use this info to beat the enemy in front of him, but this always takes place in a very mechanical and straightforward manner. There is very little in terms of tactics. There is even less in terms of any moral debate because the world is so black-and-white, and the arbitrary infodumping does little to help this. It is also a problem with the way the dialogue was written. Lines are delivered in a simplistic and predictable fashion. At least lighten it up with your personal ideas or some witty remarks, but nope. To be fair, Rimuru tries to deliver jokes sometimes, but they fall flat for the reasons outlined above.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"But we can't have a protagonist with well-defined personal beliefs. How will people self-insert as him?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, maybe self-inserting is not always necessary. But even if you wanted to, the problem is the opposite. How am I supposed to self-insert as someone who is so passive and lacks initiative? I don't want to self-insert as a cardboard cutout or blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nInteresting characters actually believe in things. They have goals in life, and they struggle to fulfill them.",

            "content": "'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Loli Don't Mind The Slime Part It Is Just a Marketing Bait' is truly a fantastic self-insert series because the mc's face looks like a dead moth and the story line is basically Overlord but isekai. \"B.. b-b..b.but isn't Overlord an isekai?\" Not compared to this.. piece of.. slime.\r\nThe setup is a really great excuse for the story. One of the best ever to be honest. 37 years-old virgin NEET who hasn't left his apartment for 38 years goes outdoors for the first time ever and dies because the world is really a fucked up and sad placeto be living in anyway. Even his last words are \"Please wipe my PC's HDD's.\" Lucky for him, he reincarnates and turns into a loli in this ideal world where he is awesome, everyone (especially people with tits) love him and in generally, here he is \"pretty much a big deal\". That's not literally how it goes, but the differences are miniscule (he has been outside before, sorry for the exaggeration). Totally not a loser or anything in his past life. \\n\\n\r\nThe reincarnation of our mc is the polar opposite of the real him and this new version of him happens when you put gary stu, swag and the outcome of a certain glopping sound in a blender, but instead of these things mixing together, they just start skipping over the 18000rpm blades like waddup are you even trying? and for some reason the color blue is relevant here. I guess because everything is blue for him. The sole worst part of the writing is the comedy in the series and since it heavily relies on the personality of our main character, he becomes quite useless piece of... slime rather quickly. For example, one of the first comedic reliefs is a scene regarding his daily life as a slime and there he says \"I eat veggies because there is really nothing else to do here.\" And that's supposed to be a joke. Now, if this had been presented a bit differently, for example the mc saying \"Ugh, I am so fucking bored I am eating grass\", there is a high change that I would have sided with him, called him ma man and perhaps even laughed. The real alternative was just a childish, supposedly-witty remark that achieved nothing. And that's pretty much how this side of the thing works. There are even some lame Gintama-tier poop jokes. Not approved. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are great tho. Mainly because they consists of ridiculously hot and weird looking females that are not even humans. Some of them has green skin and big boobs, another comes with oni-features, pretty sure third one is a squirrel. Also, elves, elves and ero elves. As a person who likes that weird hentai shit, I have highly enjoyed the ecchi fanservice regarding our harem casting. There is also a huge-ass, badass dragon in the series who ends up being kinda tsundere. 10/10 idea, best since tsundere-shark subreddit. However, the outsome is 2/10 lameness and pure waste of potential. Especially dialogue between it and the mc is so dreadful it makes both of these characters seem exponentially worse than they would otherwise be. Most lines in the series is just filler be it mc talking with wolfies, orc grills or elves. Good thing they all love him/worship him as a god because he is such a nice guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story of this series is simple. Our mc eats the dragon and becomes Naruto, then he starts exploring the fantasy world and committing acts that play out like side stories in j-rpg games except he does it with highly overpowered isekai Jesus manner because that's the entire point of this series + is being nice because nice is so nice. People get impressed over how amazing he is, others who are literally evilzz get hyped over the tsundere dragon. Real basic stuff that could shine if it was filled with interesting characters, cool action sequences or some details worth of anything. None is to be found in here. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is somewhat experimental. There are drawings made by children, some type of spectrogram-tier audio logging shit, exhaust pipes against red backgrounds because Iunno why exactly, enter the void type of all-colors-of-rainbow sequences that quite well match the definition of digital vomit, and stuff that is too stupid to be even described. Gladfully these scenes are scarce and the real thing is way more generic, which is good because generic > this pseudo-artsy nonsense. The art during the actual story parts is simplistic yet efficient. Nothing to complain there. Sounds-wise, the mc sounds like a loli so I guess they achieved what they tried to do. The opening song and ending song both are easily the worst I have heard this season, but the OP has been kinda started to fit the acquired taste definition.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nI think isekai is one of the best genres in the modern anime industry because it rarely takes itself too seriously. It tends to be over the top stupid and that makes it so genuinely entertaining to watch. It is also so very easy to forgive whatever problems they have, but loli datta end up disappointing me. It's not very fun to watch at all, just childish to a point that it feels like kids cartoon, and especially the ridiculously slow tempo is ruining the experience and making the whole thing just be all over the place. The manga is like 11x faster and better.",

            "content": "Insert obligatory pretentious quote here because I\u2019m not good at starting a review. The Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime or TenSuru is an anime that slipped into the radar of ever hungry anime watchers in October 2018. Since then, the anime has been praised as being a wholesome isekai deviating from the norm and positing a new and refreshed take on the genre. So, imagine my confoundment when only the first 5-6 episodes held true to the preceding sentence. After the first 6 episodes it turns into your typical harem loli bait. Allow me to elaborate.\r\nThe anime starts off pretty good actually withour protagonist (who is a not-so-social-virgin at 37) dying, with his dying wish being \u201cIf I ever get reborn, I want to be OP af and want to screw as many girls as I like\u201d; to be fair, I would probably also wish something along those lines. After citing his wish, \u201cthe great sage\u201d reincarnates him into another world as the most OP slime ever. Stuff happens and he ends up saving a tsundere dragon from eternal imprisonment by eating him and also saves a village of goblins from direwolves. He, then names all the goblins and direwolves and takes it upon himself to create an ideal living environment for the monsters to live in. Just because he worked as a \u201ccontractor\u201d in his previous life, he\u2019s able to plan out a whole city mostly by himself. He also becomes an expert in holding a conversation even though he was lonely and awkward in his previous life. I don\u2019t know how that works, but good for him right? \\n\\n\r\nAfter planning a whole city mostly by himself, begins the directionless adventure of the slime. This is one of the main problems with this show, it does not know what it wants to be. There\u2019s no overarching narrative, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but audiences at least need a sense of direction of movement in order not to be bored. There was something about there being a demon lord or something, idk it\u2019s probably the same guy that\u2019s present in every other isekai. What the show does is, it makes one of the characters say \u201cDemon Lord\u201d in some way or the other and the anime is like \u201cwell that\u2019s enough plot progression for one episode. Who wants tiddies?\u201d. Instead of actual plot we get \u201cplot\u201d. Not \u201cplot\u201d plot, but PLOT. Every girl the slime ever comes across is infatuated with him because we need to construct a harem or it will not be an isekai. Thus, the slime turns into chad slime and is swimming in tiddies, literally. The second problem with the show is that the danger does not feel real. Since the slime, who gets the name Rimuru by the way, is as OP as Goku in his Rainbow Super Saiyan Ultra Instinct Super Saiyan Legendary Super Saiyan God Ultra BS Level 5 form, nobody stands a chance against him. Anyone who challenges him, gets their ass handed to them in about 5 milliseconds. The fights usually go like this:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tRimuru\u2019s henchmen fighting evil guy.\\n\r\n2.\tEvil Guy: You are just cannon fodder.\\n\r\n3.\tHenchmen lose; evil guy laughs; Rimuru arrives.\\n\r\n4.\tEvil Guy: You\u2019re just a slime, you can\u2019t do anything.\\n\r\n5.\tRimuru beats the shit out of evil guy.\\n\r\n6.\tEvil Guy: *gasp* *starts following Rimuru for no reason*\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, everyone who ever comes in contact with Rimuru becomes as loyal to him as you\u2019re to anime. There\u2019s this direwolf whose father is killed by Rimuru, but he\u2019s like \u201cmeh, shit happens. You killed my father and dozens of my friends with whom I\u2019ve spent my life till now, but you gave me a name so I instantly forgot about them\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is ehhh??? I know comedy is subjective, but I can distinguish between well written comedy that isn\u2019t funny just to me and just plain bad comedy. There\u2019s this character who doesn\u2019t speak and just says \u201cmmmhh\u201d and whenever he does that Rimuru goes \u201cSpeak up, man\u201d. It was funny the first time but became annoying after it was repeated for a million times. There\u2019s this lizardman who\u2019s arguably the most irksome character in the show because his only purpose in life seems to be to make stupid decisions for the sake of tasteless humour. But, the most annoying part is that those actions, those asinine actions that he takes in the show which we took for granted, actually contribute to plot progression. He overthrows his father, the king of the lizardmen, from the throne during an invasion just because 3 of his henchmen told him that he is strong *annoyed nose exhale*.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are painfully mediocre. Except for one female character, all others are there just to show some cleavage and get wet over Rimuru for no goddamn reason. Rimuru himself isn\u2019t that interesting of a character. We never get an explanation to his motivation or what he wants to do, he just does whatever is presented to him. That\u2019s weak writing. If your character holds his/her characterisation only in the context of the story then that\u2019s weak character writing. There\u2019s not even much to write as the characters are the definition of average. If they were on either end of the spectrum you would have something to say about them, but the characters in this show don\u2019t have much of a personality. Only one character gets anything resembling a backstory which was so cursory that I forgot about it as soon as it happened. The characters are introduced as some kind of badasses only to further paint them as only superficially badass. There\u2019s a character who tames the orcs and has a calm demeanour in his first scene but loses his mind when his plan fails. He\u2019s portrayed as smart and shrewd but isn\u2019t even able to figure out that his own slave is going to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast consists of useless fanservice character #1, useless fanservice character #2, useless fanservice character #3 up to useless fanservice character #10, and Shizue. You can literally replace the female cast with boobs and it wouldn\u2019t make a dent of a difference. Every female in this show, in one way or another, is only present to hold Rimuru between her boobs or to get angry for absolutely no reason in order to provide \u201ccomic relief\u201d. I\u2019ve put comic relief if massive quotations because all it does is annoy the viewer or pad for time as every episode needs to be 20 minutes long. The \u201ccomic relief\u201d usually (and by usually I mean all the time) consists of girls vying to get wet over Rimuru or having other characters eat food that they\u2019ve prepared; usually (and by usually I mean all the time) the food is very unpalatable and causes the person eating said food to faint. As you can see these are entirely new concepts that have never been executed or seen before in any anime, ever. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a demon loli who runs around in bikinis blowing up whatever she wishes and is supposed to be a \u201cdemon lord\u201d who are apparently the most OP people in the world. The demon loli is defeated by Rimuru by stuffing her mouth with honey; a feat which is applauded by his loyal followers quoting it as \u201cA feat which only Rimuru-sama can accomplish\u201d *exasperated sigh*. The demon loli (that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna call her because she was only present in the show to appeal to pedos and was such a superfluous character that I don\u2019t even remember her name and can\u2019t be bothered to search for it), becomes besties with Rimuru because, well, we need an excuse to shoehorn in a loli with enough helium in her voice to lead to dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness and ultimately death.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be thinking that despite shitting on this show why have I still given it a 4/10. Well, that\u2019s because even though everything about this anime is utterly mediocre, I still had an urge to click the next episode and ended up finishing it in a day so it gets some points there. Even though the fights themselves can\u2019t be considered anything other than one sided massacre, they were still fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOh, almost forgot. The music is ok, the OPs and EDs are just fine and with the exception of one piece (which I just can\u2019t seem to be able to find), all the others are forgettable. The animation is pretty solid though, especially during the fights. But, what good is animation when the majority of the show is as bland and tasteless as frozen dry fruits.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\r\nIf isekai is your thing, then go for it, but again if you really like isekai then you\u2019ve probably already watched it. If you don\u2019t like isekai and are going to try it because you\u2019ve heard so many good things about it, then I\u2019d recommend you to refrain from watching it. This is another one of those mediocre isekai that has been hyped to high heavens by the anime community. It\u2019s literally like any other isekai. \\n",

These 6 episodes actually focuses a lot on the world building andour MC finding a proper way to live there instead of giving him a harem.\\n\\n\r\n*minimum spoiler review*\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\\n\r\nIt is about our MC who got stabbed and was reincarnated as a slime. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand this but the selling point of the series for me was that everything was just making more sense than the rest of the isekais out there. The MC isn't just powerful by sheer luck he was\\n\r\nreincarnated in a cave and was named by a dragon and because of that he became powerful WHICH is the reference to the game logic that the villains having a name are more powerful than the ones without it. The MC then swallows him. The story right now focuses on the adventures of our MC (his name is Rimuru btw so I should probably stop calling him MC) in this world as a slime. The lowest level monster there is and waiting for the dragon to come out so that he can tell him about his adventures.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\\n\r\nThere is our MC which is the most realistic person to die die into the fantacy world. NO HE IS NOT A LOW LIFE ANIME LOVING WEEB, he is just a gut who works in an office. And he is a virgin.\\n\r\nGoblins were the first creatures that were introduced to us in that world and rather that making goblins look like..well like..Goblin Slayer goblins (i haven't checked the other reviews out yet but I am 100% sure EVERYONE has mentioned this) they are wayyyy more lovable and sweet.\\n\r\nDwarfs are awesome and manly creatures who are true to their masters.\\n\r\nAnd the wolfs are pretty much the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\\n\r\nThere is not particularly any track that is spectacular. Some are rather forgettable but they all give that *fantasy world* charm that is necessary to have and they do it really well. The OP and ED are both really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation-9\\n\\n\r\n8bit studios have never been bad with animation. The animation is spectacular and consistently good with great details.The fight scenes so far (even if they are small) are good. The art is also pretty good with vibrant colors that just mixes well with the world. \\n\\n\r\n*\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\\n\r\nThe show has its own charm that just makes you wait eagerly for the next episode to come. It makes me happy and is a treasure for isekai genre.\\n\r\nAfter watching the first episode of Goblin Slayer I was actually planning to make a sarcastic review by just talking about it. But I just couldn't.\\n\r\nYou might have noticed that I have not made an enjoyment section, that's because it is subjective (not because I am too tired and lazy :P). For me it is 10/10. This is my first review so I hope you will be easy on me.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading\\n\r\n*",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime has one huge issue preventing it from being the fun wholesome D&D comedy it wants to be. There are no stakes. \r\nNothing matters, there is no reason to care all because the main character is insanely overpowered. Rinmuru was a 37-year-old-virgin office worker randomly killed and then reborn in a new world as a blue slime in a JRPG-like fantasy world. Like most isekai power-fantasies, he is immediately overpowered. Anything he encounters in the world can be effortlessly defeated, draining any tension out of the show. \r\nThe premise isn\u2019t inherently flawed, especially because it aims fora more comedic and light-hearted tone in a genre full of overly-serious edgefests. The animation in the first episode was amazing, background art was highly detailed and consistent. The art quickly went from great to just decent, however it never lost its colorful style. From its first few episodes, I found that it had an infectious fun cartoony feel. It balanced this light-hearted tone with some drama sprinkled throughout. The stakes were always low, at first, the lack of stakes was compensated for with all of the side characters who had their own drama. But no one is ever developed, it is just filler. Even the for with zany comedy grows stale the longer the series progresses, the jokes never evolve, it\u2019s the same dumb jokes repeated over and over. \\n\\n\r\nA relaxed plot structure isn\u2019t inherently bad. This series just does nothing with any part of its story. But it tries to have its cake and eat it too. You can\u2019t have a zany bit comedy with characters who fulfill roles in a comedy, then try to use them for emotional payoffs and build tension. It had the childish silly comedy, it had the occasional drama. SEPARATELY. Then it lost track of its plot threads, there was no direction, inevitably the tone became so mismatched that it was no longer enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in Tensei Slime is so far below the main character in every way that they are glossed over, cannon fodder and fools to entertain him. He never needs any of them. By the midpoint in the show, the most important supporting character is Shion, because she is constantly on screen being jiggled by Slime loli hiding under her boobs. Aside from that the side characters don\u2019t have enough personality, development, or even relevant dialogue. Most of them just linger around Rinmaru like his giant harem, showering him with praise and the occasional quip as if they were NPCs\\n\\n\r\nIn truth, there is only one character the show cares about. Slime loli. \\n\\n\r\nOur slime isekai protagonist Rinmuru is mildly entertaining before he becomes a loli, after that you realize you've been baited. You thought this would be an original take on the isekai genre? Wholesome? Guess again. He\u2019s just the average thirty-something-year-old isekai protagonist but he looks like a loli. Rinmaru\u2019s loli form with his bland background, and his annoying habit of draining any tension make him an awful main character. And I'm not against the surprising amount of violence this show used. What bothers me about the violence is that it tends to clash horribly with the wholesome tone of the irreverent Rinmuru and his band of misfit goofballs. The tone is a disaster for most of the show, many times it is difficult to tell how the series wants you to watch it. It may want you to take it seriously then laugh at it all in one scene, and the result is just confusion and boredom.\\n\\n\r\nAny character who offered intriguing subplots to digress from Rinmaru is forgotten by the writer almost immediately after their introduction. Make no mistake, they all stick around the main character, but they become ornaments rather than characters. For various reasons, anyone Rinmuru defeats decides to pledge their loyalty to him. Non-player-characters, just members of his party with the sole purpose to compliment him and be his battle fodder until he decides to one-punches the enemy into oblivion. There is one other character who exceeds him in power, but she comes so far late in the series and she does nothing. Imagine an immovable object meets an unstoppable force. Instead of building off of one another she does nothing and acts like an idiot, then gets ordered by Rinmuru. \\n\\n\r\nFrom time to time the dialogue doesn\u2019t take itself seriously at all, and it\u2019s the show\u2019s best, but also worst feature. The only thing that made it watchable, that kept me awake for all twenty-five episodes was the occasional moronic, sarcastic quip. If a funny line is tossed randomly into a bad scene or if it\u2019s sandwiched between bland dialogue it goes so far in giving the show more energy. When Rinmaru quips at a weaker enemy for being stupider than him, it's fun. Conversely, there is some palpable tension when a conflict has been developed for episodes and Rinmaru\u2019s underlings work to succed. However, he always steps in with an annoyed expression, taunts his enemy with an awkward joke, then easily defeats it. Who would want a main character like this? Before a fight Rinmaru often says \"this fight won't be easy\" BUT IT IS ALWAYS EASY. He is too ludicrously overpowered for what this show is trying to be. Like a vacuum, he drains away all of the tension. Without tension in a fantasy-action anime, there is little left to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem with the broken story structure of this show is the pacing. The author has so little attention span that there can never be more than one plotline occurring at once. No time for character development. No time for world building. We have a conflict and we\u2019ll have to see it all the way to its boring unsatisfying conclusion before the next plotline can even be introduced. I never thought I would actually miss Overlord, but at least that show made an effort to tell a competent story. Also, every arc in Tensei Shit but one ends incredibly anticlimactically. Even the arcs that end on flashy action set pieces are still unsatisfying because the main character is so overpowered nothing poses a threat to him. Dozens of potential plot threads are cut off and left open to potentially be revisited in the future. And this is not a writing technique the author is intentionally using. Rather, it is more of a \u2018Plan B\u2019 in case the main plotline becomes too boring and repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nThe final arc in the show comes out of nowhere. The new characters, a group of kids, have no personalities other than one trait if we're lucky. Hollow, boring characters are par for the course in Slime Shit, but this is where the show went from boring to painful. It tries to make us care about the new NPC kids. We were told by the show that they are going to die if Rinmaru doesn\u2019t help. Thankfully he doesn\u2019t care about anything so he ditches his small civilization temporarily to help them. He resolves the conflict by himself, totally separately of the kids, and they end up just following him around trying to act important like the rest of the supporting cast in this terrible hackneyed series. After the anticlimactic finale, there is nothing left worth caring about. But of course they teased a second season.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t wait for another 25-episodes of this drivel...\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 3/10] Disjointed, shallow, forgettable, cliche.\\n\r\n[Character: 1/10] There is only one character who matters, and I hate him.\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10] Attention grabbing character designs, decent art, good animation. \\n\r\n[Sound: 5/10] Forgettable soundtrack that doesn't always fit the scene, good first op and ed.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 4/10] Boring aside from some banter between the characters, but it is repetitive and basic.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 3/10]\\n\r\nOverpowered main characters are a staple of the isekai genre, and That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is no different. Studio 8bit's stellar art style and the first two theme songs were fantastic. However, the production was not enough to carry such a disjointed and underwhelming story. If you're a fan of the isekai genre then you might enjoy the irreverent humor for a little while. Until that too gets devoured by the slime-loli-thirty-seven-year-old-virgin and then all you're left with is a long boring waste of time.",

            "content": "I use to ponder how isekai is an unusual phenomenon, seeing how it's rather so popular and draws so many people in with its stories. But the more you watch, you start to see that it really isn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s quite understandable, really. The fandom of light novels tends, more than most, to be fond of wish-fulfillment and self-insert type stories. And of course, isekai is the ultimate platform for that. Maybe there was a time, before it became almost unimaginably overused and tired, that the word \u201cisekai\u201d didn\u2019t immediately elicit a groan\u2014but that time has long since passed. The genre is overplayed and overdone, and almostnothing that slaps a ridiculously long title on itself and surfs the wave is any good.\\n\\n\r\nThe standard for isekai anime continues to take a dive with each passing season, reaching new depths, with its played tropes from harem antics, its ridiculously overpowered protagonists and how it uses cheap plot devices, usually around the topics of rape and slavery to shock its audiences and pull them into something they think will be dark and mature\u2014only for the show to turn into the same old generic, edgelord power fantasy. Is Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime in English and TenSura for short) any different? While TenSura follows every clich\u00e9 trope to ever exist but executes them in such a way that it remains narratively engaging as we follow the progress of the main protagonist of this story who is Mikami Satoru, who at a later time, goes by the name of Rimuru Tempest, as he literally builds a technocrat federation from nothing after being reborn in a different world.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise\u2014a 37-year-old virgin NEET gets heroically stabbed to death after finally venturing outside and winds up reincarnated as a slime with superpowers in an alternate universe, which seems about as arbitrary as it gets. Slimes are recognized as one of the weakest creatures, but after meeting a Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Verudora, who he later merged with and was named by him\u2014as Rimuru Tempest\u2014and gaining some unique skills, he sets off on an adventure to travel this world and make the best of a second chance at life. The unique skill \u201cPredator\u201d allowed him to devour Verudora and gain some of his abilities and the \u201cGreat Sage\u201d is like another consciousness that exists inside Rimuru, it has this clinical female voice, marked by kanji descriptions and psychedelic shifting colors, punctuates his internal monologue and pretty much acts as a guide for him. It has all sorts of abilities that make our Slime hero almost that of a demigod.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the idea of a superpowered slime is definitely among the sillier concepts to build a story on, there's no doubt that the creator Fuse has done his work building this story's world, and it shows in 8-bit\u2019s adaption here.  It's a combination of RPG trappings from both east and west, with elves, dwarves, slimes, ogres, goblins, kobolds, etc., that still plays into the basic isekai notion that people are going to be summoned or reborn from our world. In fact, it's specifically stated that people are both reborn and summoned, with the summoned being more valuable because of the great difficulties associated with surviving the magic. This is where the story\u2019s main subplot comes in\u2014Rimuru's story is juxtaposed with that of Shizue Izawa, a little girl who barely survives a firebombing during WWII and ends up being summoned by a particularly unpleasant demon lord. Shizue's story is undeniably tragic, and her fate makes a decided contrast to his. Shizue's tale shows the darker side of the summoning process that we don't often see in novels like these. The two narratives do connect in a way that gives Shizue's story some closure, as well as opening the door for the next stage in Rimuru's evolution. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru is the type of character that very much stays true to how he was in his previous life and using his experience with MMO\u2019s, RPG\u2019s, otaku culture, and his occupation to help him solve the situations he finds himself in. He tries to avoid conflict, tries his best to avoid killing others, and helps to make peace between others when need be. Due to his nature, he solved a conflict between Goblins and Dire wolves which led them to all come together and build a village where everyone is accepted. Our main character was to become this village\u2019s leader and he would name each one that resides here. As for the supporting characters, there is something for everyone. You have all \u2018dere\u2019 types and ones with the \u2018badassery\u2019 stamp of approval. There is a large number of supporting characters who are more than cardboard cutouts and are constantly contributing, they have personalities and have moments of introspection. When it comes down to the overall narrative, TenSura is about family, friendships, and bonds that Rimuru makes with other beings that he encounters on his journey in this magical world. He understands that every race is different, they have their own culture, their own ways of doing things, but he becomes a bridge to everyone that anyone can peacefully live together. Through these interactions, a small tribe becomes a village, then a town, then a city, then a nation and finally a federation.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding in TenSura deserves praise. Much later into the show, you can see how much that Rimuru and his people have built in this world, all the other nations and kingdoms he has traveled too, all the allies he has made and some potential foes. Each nation is unique in how they operate, the laws, politics, location etc., there are even rumors, folklore and gossip happening around in these places that make you feel immersed in this world. However, there were things that bothered me that need to be mentioned. First thing is that the beginning of the show, while very informal, is tough and slow. Its filled with exposition and it feels like you\u2019re constantly getting smacked in the face with it, it takes a while for the show to start rolling and felt it dwelt too long on all the info-dumps (mostly explaining the same things over and over). The other issue was Rimuru being too much of a sue character and being ridiculously overpowered. A lot of the show\u2019s comedy helps with making it a bit tolerable but once you get past the shows first cour, all tension starts to evaporate because all of his battles end in a stomp match or are easily resolved by his natural ability to sway one\u2019s heart. All his struggles and confrontations are easily and quickly resolved. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, 8-bit did a good job with the visuals and they are a good match for the narrative. The art style tends to go for a bright and colorful look during the more light-hearted scenes, with the dramatic moments taking on a darker and less cartoonish palette. For an isekai like TenSura, I\u2019d say the monster designs are done really well, especially the physical evolution of some of the characters after receiving a name or leveling up. Also, worth noting is the way the visual direction depicts Rimuru getting used both his forms. The show is visually at its best during the big battle scenes. There are few episodes that \u2018drop\u2019 in terms of quality, a few that unfortunately had the cringe-worthy CG but it remained relatively consistent. Overall character designs are done well, although, the fanservice did get a bit too much where I found myself rolling my eyes. I felt the score could have been better but it does stay true to the RPG-like aspect of things, VA\u2019s all did good jobs in fitting to their given characters' personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, TenSura is rather one of the better isekai in its catalog with great worldbuilding, accomplishes what it sets out to achieve and for the most part, is actually fun. Yes, there are flaws and tired tropes, which is to be expected in isekai but it avoids all the nonsense that we commonly see in these types of anime\u2014there is no edgelord protagonist who is the chosen one, with a bland personality and surrounded by a harem of little girls. Rather focusing a lot of the fighting aspect, TenSura\u2019s story is told in a competent way that explores the relationships between people, what people could have with each other, and ultimately have them fight for what they believe for. It introduces the idea that people can connect with each other, build bridges and mend borders simply through conversation, learning to develop great relationships with one another instead of always relying on violence to resolve everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe most appealing aspect of TenSura is that Rimuru acts like a normal person, after dying one day and ending up in a different world where he is reincarnated into a slime, he decides that he is going to make the best of this opportunity, and if he can help others along the way then great! All he wants to do is live happily and make it a fun time while using his gifts responsibly within this world. The main story ends at episode 23 while the last two are a side story/revision. I do look forward to what the sequel will bring. If this sounds like your cup of tea then give TenSura a try, provided you're in the market for a less serious take on both fantasy and isekai. It's able to maintain a light-hearted tone without completely abandoning the plot, and its efforts at world-building have been honestly interesting.",

            "content": "Tensei Slime is THE isekai of the season, with a great first episode, it presented a relatable main character and how he ended up getting into another world but in a slime's body, all of this on a great animation budget and a good background music. I personally enjoyed it very much. The plot itself wraps p pretty originally and in a good way it connects up beetween events, in a not-rshed pace everything gets developed in a way that you get to really like most of its characters.\r\nRimuru himself is the star of the show, this cool slime fella is imensely cool, cute andpretty likeable, he is a good guy, everyone in the anime likes him, everyone watching the anime likes him, he's the kind ideal protagonist a show should have, and most of all, he's original, I mean, when did you see a talking genious magician slime before? I say, never! He being a slime is the main reason everyone likes him, he's jsut original, if he was a simple teenager japanese boy, it wouldn't be the same thing.\\n\r\nMost of the sub-characters are great, we get to know the goblins(which in this anime are good, as opposed to the goblins in a certain other anime), they're carismatic, they're likeable. Same thing can be said about the wolves, tough less carismatic, the leader of the bunch is pretty cool.\\n\r\nAnimation-wise this anime is great, I simply love the opening theme's animation, it's really well done, as well as the general animation, nothing feels bad or rushed in it.\\n\r\nOST, except for the great OP theme I don't think there's something really great about it, quite forgetable I must say :/\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about it, a more great than good story, a outstanding art, a ok music, a great character and of course I had a outstanding enjoyment.\\n\r\nOverall a great show with imense potential.",

            "content": "*This review contains SPOILERS!*\r\nThat time I got reincarnated as a slime is basically a bad version of overlord. It started as a light hearted slimavilization which was fun in the beginning but then became horribly boring.\r\nThe premise starts off with our 37 years old virgin NEET being killed and reincarnated as a jesus with a mix personality of a mary sue and being nice because supposedly being nice and having a god like power can make girls with big tits or naked lolis to like you. There's literally no story here. Rimuru is building his own slimavilization along with everyone he meets. There are nothreats, no stakes, nor any tension in this already 1 dimentional story. The same goes with political workings as well. Our MC takes this Jesus attitude with everything, and characters always end up going 'oh okay, lets all be nice to each other'. In the meanwhile, the world has such physics that if monsters are named, then they will evolve. Basically my cat will evolve into a leopard if I name her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are bland. All we have is an edgy MC, a big tiddy onee-san, another big tiddy dryad, a naked OP loli, a wolf and a bunch of goblins. Rest weren't rememberable at all. The only ones I liked were eaten the very episode they were introduced. \\n\\n\r\n The worldbuilding is trash. The only thing we know about this world is about different species that live. The voice acting is bad at various levels accounting to childish voices. Even the music is pretty bad. Except for the first ending theme, which was semi-decent; the songs are a measure of how childish the show can go. The only thing that is preventing me from giving it a 1 is the artstyle and the animation, because of 8bit's solid technical staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Life can be harsh and I\u2019m sure most of us think so in some way or another. The typical everyman at adult age works an 8-5 schedule on weekdays to make a living. Satoru Mikami is a very ordinary person until he gets reincarnated as a slime after being killed in a knife attack. As tragic as that sounds, it may not be a harsh life after all. Isn\u2019t life just full of surprises?\r\nAfter being turned into a light novel, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken (That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime) is one of the few isekai shows that I genuinely looked forwardto this year. While it subscribes to usual fantasy gimmicks, this show also does a unique job at entertaining the audience through its charismatic main lead, world fiction, and creative storytelling. I refer this show as more of a fantasy  isekai, one that has a slime as the superstar. \\n\\n\r\nCan the isekai genre really have potential to be more than just what's on paper? It certainly could for some franchises. This show is one of them. Satoru is reborn as a slime and his role is crucial to everything around him. Taking on the alias \u201cRimuru\u201d, he makes up for his appeal through a variety of personality traits: kind, witty, laidback, sarcastic, courageous, and among others. When you look at all these character personalities together, Rimuru can be very likable. In the early portion of the show, we see Rimuru\u2019s charisma and being able to lead supernatural creatures without fear. He even gives names to his new friends while showing his compassion. Rimuru is built to be special in the show. This is established through his immense abilities (such his Predator skill), where viewers can easily point fingers at him for being overpowered. Indeed, this isn\u2019t an overstatement. In most of his battles, they are more like curb stomp face offs where Rimuru dominates his opponents. From isekai shows in today\u2019s world, overpowered characters aren\u2019t uncommon. What actually sets Rimuru apart is his unnatural charisma and human behavior. The witty conversations and small talks he engages with others often makes his fights much entertaining than they should be. Even in serious conflicts, Rimuru finds time to make jokes while being strategic enough to formulate a plan. Now, that my friends, is setting a likeable isekai protagonist by example.\\n\\n\r\nYet, this show can be a tearjerker at times too. The emotional context draws important value with a character named Shizu. After a titanic battle against a demon known as Ifrit, we learn about her past and Rimuru even inherits her will. Taking on her form, Rimuru realizes that he can\u2019t save everyone regardless how powerful he is. It sets the path of his journey to keep promises such as being a mentor for younger kids. In the latter half of the show, Rimuru finds a group of children with magical potential and tries to lead them as a positive role model. \\n\\n\r\nEven as an isekai show established with such a powerful protagonist, its character cast shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. We meet a variety of characters with colorful personalities during Rimuru\u2019s adventures. Some of the most noticeable ones includes his allies such as Shion, Shuna, Gobuta, Benimaru, Ranga, and later on, the Demon Lord Millim. Through Rimuru\u2019s character interactions, it\u2019s easy to see how his charisma inspires others. Many of Rimuru\u2019s followers shows great respect for him and similarly, he deeply cares about them. Even Millim, a Demon Lord with overwhelming powers, takes a liking to him as the two forms an unlikely alliance. Respect of course isn\u2019t just demanded but earned. Thanks to Rimuru\u2019s abilities, he manages to make alliances with the most unlikely races. Under Rimuru\u2019s leadership, he even sets forth to build a new country with his allies. The central element of storytelling relies on Rimuru\u2019s way of showing his will. He proves this throug his actions and words. Really, by the end of the show, I felt like I understood Rimuru far more than I originally anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my love for the show\u2019s witty humor, colorful character cast, and storytelling, I should point out the anime still suffers from pitfalls. Fan service scenes with baths are common and Rimuru is still vulnerable to earthly desires in the fantasy world. In fact, I dare say the author made the monster girls as cute and sexy as possible. Millim and Shion are prime examples for their character designs. Just take a close look at them. Millim is pretty much half naked in her default outfit while Shion gives more of a mature lady vibe. Like most fantasy isekai, elves are characterized as desirable by males. This is shown early in the show when Rimuru encounters them and finds himself in brief moments of lust. While the storytelling has adequate development and carries an emotional weight, it\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s great writing. In fact, many of Rimuru\u2019s battles are extremely predictable even against the strongest of adversaries. In most of those fights, you should certainly expect Rimuru to be the winner. While the series also gives some of its supporting cast time to shine, most of the spotlight falls under our little slime-kun. Perhaps a bit too much...\\n\\n\r\nFinally, 8-bit is back. After years of mediocre light novel adaptations like Infinite Stratos and Knight\u2019s & Magic, Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken\u2019s sets a bar for being a marvelous example of world fiction. The magical world contains fruitful amount of content such as the various nations we see. Tempest is the most prominent one ruled by Rimuru. Located in the Jura Forest, it\u2019s a prime example of a monster country filled with larger than life characters. Meanwhile, other locations such as Brumund Kingdom and Dwargon reminds me of the high fantasy elements of the isekai genre. While the visual quality can look a bit cartoonish at times, it remains vibrant, bright, and contains a fine degree of palette. It suits for this particular show with its lighthearted humor. The character designs are of course worth mentioning in the case of Rimuru, the Demon Lords, his monster allies, and the infamous Veldora Tempest. At times, I feel like the author really put his thought into making them look as otherwordly as possible. The battle choreography also delivers a visual direction of what isekai shows should be. Nothing too groundbreaking but being able to showcase what characters\u2019 abilities can really do. You should definitely not expect a DBZ-level style of action quality but be prepared for some jawbreaking cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t you just wish life was simpler these days? Looking back at Rimuru\u2019s adventure, I confess that I am a bit envious of his life. He is so carefree despite being an such a prominent figure in his world. Whether taking on the form of a slime, human, or Shizu, Rimuru makes everything look so easy. As such, watching this show felt like an easy way of passing time and enjoying what the author creator wanted us to experience. Now I wish life was easier.",

They are typically weak, but certain slimes, such as massive ones, ones made of special materials, or ones that are immune to damage, can be quite dangerous and deadly. Its usual attack is to engulf its prey.\r\nThe Slime is an iconic creature from Dragon Quest, but the existence of slime monsters dates back at least as far as Dungeons and Dragons, to the Gelatinous Cube. Which is suggested to be an invention of Gary Gygax.\r\nTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken is an adaptedseries of Manga written by \"Fuse\" is the Maga Theme adventure and fantasy series was first released in March of the year two thousand five eventually got serialized this season.Seri was adapted by \"8bit\" and got twenty four episodes that started to date the two months ago, this series was so much not found many loggers of manga and anime because this series has a very unique story story as well as in the bamps of comedy elements that are very inviting lace tits make this series begin to reap its popularity.\\n\\n\r\nTells the story of an office employee named \"Satoru Mikami\" who wants to go to a restaurant to eat with his theme. But in the middle of a trip an unexpected event a criminal suddenly attacked his theme armed with courage and a sense of responsibility he was willing to sacrifice his life just for the theme Stabbed by the villain. Before he died he told his theme to destroy his PC (Personal Computer) because inside the PC had a very important secret document. For most people, we thought that we only lived once in this world but Satoru was strangely thrown into fantasy world where things that are impossible can happen in some of their abilities in the world he did some experiments including magic. But he still did not know why he was thrown in that strange world and why he turned into a slime instead of a human?\\n\\n\r\nAfter being thrown into the world Fantasy Satoru met a dragon he asked about the world after chatting so many satoru decided to make the dragon his family and they changed his name to the \"Tempest\" Sorator himself changed his name to \"Rimuru Tempest\" but the dragon was still in the seal by the big crystal chunks to sealed the dragon's power the Satoru decided to bring the dragon by eating and analyzing how to free the dragon and that's the story rolling.\\n\\n\r\nThe themed of this series adventure has a good graphic quality not just a background or can we call the Landscape this series is also good in the character design.Seri has a very unique character that rarely owned any series is \"slime\" color selection so so many contrast making the real impression of the audience.Seri adapted from the manga is illustrated by \"Kawakami Taiki\" is quite interesting because it has a very unique character makes the illustrator difficult to adjust to other characters but it is not a big obstacle even with the very unique character can add to the storyline to become more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a main character \"Rimuru Tempest\" he is a work office worn for stabbed by a criminal, in the unique capability of making this main character this is much popular than people not only the time appearance also no less as a unique creature Slime also has a funny and adorable impression. \"Tempest\" is a family name that has two members that is \"Tempest Verudora\" is a dragon that is cighed in the crystal and the other \"Tempest Rimuru\".\\n\\n\r\nIncomplete if a good animation is not supported by the sound section. The \"8bit\" studio party brought in \"Okasaki Miho\" who will fill the Rimuru Tempest voice. For the studio's opening theme, \"Takuma Terashima\" will sing the nameless story as the opening theme. the opening theme will be sung by \"TRUE\" titled another colony.\\n\\n\r\nAs the Manga and Light novel reader if the two things got the serialization then it was so glad to be first-shaped and the following now the series began adapting to being a video.Resial was honestly he was nice since I read the Mangananya series and I really enjoyed the series and in the end the series got a serialization was the news is happy.

Amorphous.  Pliable.  Flaccid.\r\nNo.  This is not an explanation of Rimuru \u201cThe Slime\u201d Tempest\u2019s appearance \u2014 or a Donkey Kong dong Shlong \u2014 rather, it\u2019s a succinct description of That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime\u2019s (henceforth, will be referred to as just\u201cSlime\u201d) unstructured plot and the easily influenced cast of characters.  Now before the various facets of the show in question are taken apart to illuminate its numerous failures, one must give credit where credit is due.  For Mikami Satoru (Rimuru Tempest) to have the wherewithal to instruct his friend to destroy his hard drive \u2014 due to the massive amounts of downloaded pornography, allegedly \u2014 in the midst of his final moments on earth, was nothing short of being hilarious and befitting of the modern day virgin.  But as well-timed as this joke was, it bamboozled the viewer into thinking that Slime\u2019s story would entail more adult-oriented humor, instead of a puerile adventure about freeing a dragon (Veldora) from an Endless Prison.\\n\\n\r\nBesides this subterfuge, Slime grants Rimuru with \u2014 no exaggeration \u2014 the most ridiculously over-powered \u201ccheat code\u201d in the existence of Isekai.  Although, at first, Rimuru is perceived as a relatively weak, helpless being, his ability to absorb literally anything to amass new skills is ridiculously \u201cbroken.\u201d  Furthermore, Rimuru can alter his appearance on demand and can later combine different abilities to forge new, stronger spells/attacks.  Plus he can create potions for healing, various weapons for killing, and manipulate time itself.  Still, though.  This does little justice to the wide array of skills he displays throughout the series.  Literally, if you can think of it, Rimuru either possesses it or can ascertain it through his absorptive powers.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhy is this a problem, though?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPeople, typically, can not acquire new skills on the drop of a dime.  It takes time and a great deal of dedication.  Take Naruto, for example.  Even though humans will never produce a Rasengan in their life (a terrible pity), they can empathize with Naruto\u2019s hard work and determination in mastering the difficult, new skill.  Rimuru, on the other hand, appropriates spells/powers rather effortlessly, making his \u201carduous\u201d journey difficult to empathize with.  To put it another way: imagine the smartest person you knew growing up, and how effortlessly they achieved straight \u201cA\u2019s.\u201d  Their accomplishments seem watered down because they are expected given their superior intelligence, rather than achieved through rigorous persistence.  This is the same dilemma the viewer is faced with when watching Slime.  Rimuru, to the detriment of the series, is too perfect and no task seems formidable enough to properly challenge him.  \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, as far as characterization goes, Rimuru is as bland as oatmeal without milk (that\u2019s right, dry out of the bag mother f\u2014ker\u2019s).  He presumably lived 37 years as a human, but routinely acts like a child \u2014 especially in the presence of voluptuous women.  Due to him possessing incredible powers, having an altruistic mindset, and not having any discernible personality (besides being a kind individual), he immediately evoked comparisons to the Gary Stu complex.  Which hits the nail right on the head!  What\u2019s worse, is that Rimuru \u2014 the focal point of Slime \u2014 experienced diminutive growth/development throughout the course of the series.  He is the veritable vanilla protagonist in this metaphorical Slime sundae (ewww!) that was so sorely missing in delicious toppings (what am I talking about?). \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast of characters, woefully, failed to elicit any fond memories, as the writing staff seemed more concerned about character quantity, rather than quality.  Essentially, each character get\u2019s their five minutes of \u201cuseful\u201d screen time, and then they are effectively disregarded to clear the way for even more characters.  Besides Shizue Izawa \u2014 who had a mildly interesting backstory \u2014 every character is easily forgettable, becoming a distant memory after the end of each episode.  Until they come back in another episode and you\u2019re like, \u201coh, they still exist?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the plot, it proceeded like clockwork.  Various problems occurred to create \u201ctension,\u201d but no situation felt insurmountable.  Rimuru, per the hero obligation, spouted useless, uninspiring lines, such as: \u201cIf I don\u2019t don\u2019t kill him now, it really will be a disaster,\u201d to substantiate the stigma of the boring, invincible hero archetype.  It also perpetuated the overall laziness of modern day anime writers.  Their inability to craft new, interesting stories and layered characters \u2014 with a semblance of authenticity \u2014 demonstrate their lack of ambition and willingness to take bold risks.\\n\\n\r\nSlime is an anemic mimicry that never breaks free from its own constraints, hamstringing its potential to inspire excitement and joy in the viewing audience.  Instead of a \u201chot mess,\u201d Slime is just a mess.  A wet, goopy mess.",

            "content": "\"That time I got roped into thinking that this anime might actually be good after seeing all of the praise for it only to be terribly disappointed\" basically sums of my experience with TenSura right now. \r\nThis season's token isekai anime is super duper original because it's protagonist gets reincarnated as a slime instead of a person. Mind = Blown. Our hero is portrayed as an embarrassment to society with no unique qualities who dies a horrible death when he ventures outside to communicate with other humans. Now here we have the moral of the story: Don't go outside kids. So after dying a virginand being reborn in a fantasy world as a slime, our hero suddenly develops communication and tactical skills out of nowhere and gets a voice actor who doesn't sound dead on the inside. This is where the mediocre adventure of a slime begins.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what the biggest flaw of this anime is? It isn't entertaining. I just don't find the humor funny, and when you're a comedy anime, this is a pretty significant issue. And the one thing that the anime included that was actually amusing, which was the frickin tsundere dragon, the protagonist just has to go and ruin it by eating said tsundere dragon. I mean damn, If I wanted to watch vore, I'd find some messed up hentai to watch  instead. So before being consumed, the tsundere dragon and the slime gave each other the name Tempest. Now another reason why I'm bored slimeless by this anime is because Tempest is a pretty lackluster protagonist. He just does things with seemingly no actual purpose, and...yeah, there's really nothing else to say about him actually. Oh wait, his most notable characteristic is the fact that he's a pervert who likes boobs. Which leads us to the one  enjoyable aspect of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nMonster Girl Tiddies \\n\\n\r\nThat's right, we've got goblin tits, elf boobs, and so many other female species with cleavage. I can't wait to see what monster they decide to slap breasts on next! Because when everything else fails, just throw in some fan service, and all problems are solved, amiright? It doesn't matter if the plot is garbage, because sexy anime girls make everything better! Seriously though, the plot of TenSura has been painfully mediocre so far. Nothing eventful has happened. Every character worships Tempest because he's da supah cool protagonist with no flaws whatsoever who helps out everyone he meets. Yep, that's basically the synopsis of the narrative. Plus the visuals and sound of this anime are rather standard and forgettable, which doesn't help.\\n\\n\r\nIf a comedy anime makes me yawn more than laugh like TenSura's done thus far, then there's a problem. Sprinkle in a generic isekai plot and add a teaspoon of undeveloped characters and you get quite the slime of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd nobody wants that.",

            "content": "Honestly, the whole isekai trope isn't inherently bad- It's definitely feasible to make something genuinely good with creative world building, interesting character interactions, good direction and premise, and so on. Unfortunately, this series, like most others, has none of those and is quite literally the most trite isekai that could be made by what I'd presume to be a human. Though if someone said this was computer generated by re-using every awful isekai trope ever, I'd unironically believe it. This is a prime example of a series using an incredibly \"clickbaity\" title as a hook without offering anything of substance beyond it, and it reallyshows.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, even the title is boring as shit aside from the \"slime\" part. \"That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime\" says nothing aside from the fact that the main character is going to be a slime. Big if true. Shocking. Apparently the author had real difficult time coming up with the title. Sure, there isn't anything inherently wrong with making an eyecatching title- But if the answer to that is just literally putting the premise as one, then it's pretty safe to say the author is very obviously creatively bankrupt and the series isn't worth the time. And to add to the insult, the character is an overpowered sue character that doesn't even abide by the common notion of a slime and the series becomes another self-insert power fantasy. And to even further add to the insult, it still manages to use the generic cute anime girl design instead of the slime in the promotional poster. Amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of this series is also disgustingly generic, and it really boggles my mind how some people unironically think any of this is good world building. Slimes, dwarves, goblins, orcs, monster wolves, dragons, elves, demon lords, and just any other Dragon Quest reject mobs you can think of, and it's got them all. Essentially it's like making a randomly generated dungeon with RPG Maker's premade assets and just calling it a day. There's nothing interesting to look at, because you've seen them all before- The only thing that could remotely subvert an expectation would be that they act slightly differently from the \"norm\", but even that is overdone and tiring. \\n\\n\r\nBut you might be thinking, \"Who cares if it borrows assets from every other isekai fantasy series ever? That doesn't say anything about its writing quality.\" And you'd be right- It doesn't. But what it says about the series, is just complete utter lack of creativity not only in assets, but also in just general writing. \\n\\n\r\nJust look at this nonsense up to the sixth episode:\\n\\n\r\n[minor spoiler below]\\n\r\nThe main character gets reincarnated as a slime in a different world- Then immediately by the second episode, he becomes an overpowered sue character that can quite literally do anything. They can just eat anything of any size and instantly gain all of its powers and abilities, because apparently that's what slimes do. He also has infinite storage of what he eats, and can finitely but perfectly reproduce anything he also eats as long as he has the resources in his infinite storage. Then if that wasn't enough, he also gets a giant exposition machine called The Great Sage in his head that just explains away anything that he might be unfamiliar with, so there's absolutely no struggle. Then if that also wasn't enough, he doesn't have any motivation whatsoever other than completing a few \"side quests\" he might encounter along the way, so his characterization is the most boring \"good guy\" trope you can think of. Then of course, everyone likes him because he's Number One. And if there's someone who doesn't like him? Clearly must be evil or stupid. Or both. \\n\r\n[minor spoiler above]\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the writing needs a gigantic exposition machine in the first place already shows that the writer is absolutely incompetent and that unraveling his dollar store isekai world care package through other means is simply beyond his talent. This exposition machine is also incredibly obnoxious as it constantly cuts off whatever is happening on the screen into some Shaft-style Powerpoint presentation mode whenever it wants to explain, which just doesn't do well for the flow of the show. This sort of exposition machine is commonly used in narrative when the main character isn't talkative or is a video game character that responds based on player input to add some sort of character dynamic while maintaining that form of interactivity- So when it's used aside a very talkative main character, it really goes to show terrible the writing is to warrant the usage of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the show doesn't even make great use of what little it has going for it- The production budget. I guess they thought they found the next Overlord in the making, so the quality of the visuals is actually pretty good. Sadly, the series also spends a lot of time on minutes and minutes of monologue, explaining characters' powers and abilities, and covering backstories of side characters nobody cares about. Essentially, this is the Weeny Hut Jr. version of Sword Art Online, but I guess people don't even notice the similarities because Kirito got a cool slime mask. With this trend, I can already see that \"Reborn as a Vending Machine, Now I Wander the Dungeon\" series having a bright future as soon as it's picked up by any semi-decent studio. No, that actually is a thing. And yes, anime is fucking dead.\\n\\n\r\nPress F to Pay Respects.\\n",

            "content": "As someone with literally thousands of hours of playtime in the Sid Meier's Civilization series over the years, I very much appreciated this anime.\r\nIsekai series are a standard staple in the anime industry nowadays and managing to stand out from the crowd can be easier said than done. Generally the way people do this is by giving some sort of twist to an otherwise quite generic setup, which in the case of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is quite simply that the protagonist gets reincarnated as a slime of all things once he gets transported to this particular fantasy world. However, it is important tounderstand that that part is *NOT* what makes this anime stand out from most other isekai series. Rather it is how likeable the protagonist is as a character and most importantly the general style and execution of its story.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, regardless of what kind of twist people like to throw into their isekai novels, in general they still boil down to a similar end goal. You normally have some sort of greater peril to tackle or evil demon lord for the MC to defeat and in the process of doing so he'll get his own harem etcetera; it's all very shounen-like in terms of writing. But Slime isn't really like that. Instead, this anime is much more relaxed and focuses on completely different kinds of challenges.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, watching Slime is like watching a let's play of a fantasy version of a game of Sid Meier's Civilization. At the beginning of the story, our protagonist Rimuru comes across a poor goblin village, very basic and currently suffering from attacks by nearby wolf packs in the forest. He offers to help the tribe, and in the process not only manages to deal with the threat of the wolves, but by using his powers he's able to help the goblins domesticate them and join forces for mutual benefit. After being chosen as the new leader of the tribe due to his accomplishments, Rimuru starts the long and arduous task of trying to transform the village into something greater.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a large part of what the anime is truly about: the evolution of civilization. Over the course of story we get to see more and more races join the village as it grows into a larger town. We get to see the establishment of culture and diplomacy with other nations, the progression of science and infrastructure, the birth of an independent country and the political negotiations of a fresh, multi-species society with the rest of the world. It's all quite fascinating to watch and it makes me wonder why this is such a rare thing to see in anime. It's not only rare but at least if you ask me, it's also a hell of a lot more interesting than a group of people feeding off the power of friendship to go overthrow some evil demon lord or whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nNow that is not to say that Slime doesn't have its fair share of action and clashes with hostile forces as well, but they are generally more large-scale conflicts with other nations. Also, while it is undeniable that Rimuru is ridiculously strong due to his completely broken Predator ability that lets him devour anything, I never felt that this was much of a drawback for the anime. Even if he may be overpowered, at the end of the day the eventual goal of the anime isn't just to defeat a bunch of enemies. The main challenges of this story are not ones that can simply be solved with brute force; they are a lot more sophisticated in nature, and I appreciate that a lot.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the second half of Slime isn't quite as good as the first half as there are less challenges standing in the way both in terms of peaceful and hostile ones. It feels a bit more slice of life-like and also contains a bit of a side arc that I don't really think did a whole lot good for the anime as a whole. I did have the show scored as a 9 for the majority of its airing but ultimately I had to chop off a point towards the end for this fact alone. Nevertheless, with a second season already confirmed, I can only hope that it finds its footing again once that comes around.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Slime is a great isekai show for the simple reason that it's focused on what it's simply like to start a new life in a new world\u2014as well as the aforementioned evolution of society\u2014without having to turn the story into a generic shounen fantasy adventure in the process. It's just a fun anime in general, and Rimuru's cheerful, smug and smart outlook on the world does a great deal for its overall enjoyment value as well. The show certainly wouldn't be the same without him. Overall, it's a very enjoyable and surprisingly creative show which is always cheerful, light-hearted and relaxing, without any excessive drama needed. Definitely recommended.",

            "content": "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime \u2014 but not really, since writing a fantasy story with an actually weak main character would take some effort, so let's just throw that overpowered blue blob into the usual generic JRPG fantasy world and hope we can get away with it.\r\nWell, they did. After all, that title would be too long even for a light novel. And the isekai formula still works like a charm: you just need to change whatever the main character gets incarnated in next, be it a polar bear, a vending machine, or \u2014 oh for fuck's sake \u2014 bloody Vladimir Putin(just make sure to make them all overpowered self-insert characters, or else...they might start taking you seriously).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDude dies and gets reincarnated as a demigo...I mean, a slime, in the aforementioned generic fantasy world (which needs no introduction, if you saw one you saw them all). Every obstacle is won over some stupidly overpowered ability the slime was incarnated with for some reason; probably cheat codes. It doesn't last long, though, since a cute blue-haired girl sells more.\\n\r\nAt first, it got me excited, since the first episode is pretty irreverent and fun, and I thought I was in for a parody-esque anime in the vein of Konosuba; as the second kicked in, however, it was obvious this would be just your run-of-the-mill isekai with nothing new under the sun. I kept watching to see if they could turn it around, but it doesn't seem it will. It can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or not, and meanwhile, it bores you to death.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nInexistent I guess? Rimuru's voice got annoying right on episode 2, and he (?) doesn't really have a relevant personality. Everyone else but two characters who receive the flashback treatment on the Dwarf Town (which doesn't really help us care about them) is just fodder for jokes or for Rimuru's slow descent into megalomania. \\n\r\nIn episode 6 we finally meet our promised main girl...which proceeds to fall in love at first sight with our dear blob, so I figure we can get her out of the picture as to having any chance of being a decent character.*\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is actually pretty good when it wants, but most of the time it doesn't really matter. The bits in which Rimuru communicates with the sage, especially at the first episode, were pretty nice to look at. A shame the rest is just unremarkable.\\n\r\nThe opening/ending is ok. Not much to look at. Rimuru's voice gets annoying, though, especially when he starts laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something that will make you mildly amused at best for a couple of minutes each week, give it a try. It might just be your cup of tea. Otherwise, it's just an utter waste of time and you won't find anything redeemable here. Better dispose of that ever-growing plan to watch list before.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER: she dies. The episode after. Now this is going swell.",

            "content": "What started off as a unique premise of a middle aged man being reincarnated into a Slime in a fantasy setting, slowly devolved into another generic, power fantasy Isekai. [Warning spoilers]\r\nThe light hearted slimevilization was fun for a while, but it became boring. \r\nStory (4/10):\r\nThere\u2019s not much to the story. Rimuru says he wants to get avenge Shizu and defeat the demon lord Leon, well not really it\u2019s just building Rimuru\u2019s nation until the next enemy attacks. There\u2019s no tension/stakes, especially after Milim joins. The loli demon lord is too OP for her own good. She could oneshot all of the enemies, but doesn\u2019t becauseof plot convenience. Milim\u2019s basically a get out of free card as long as she\u2019s by Rimuru\u2019s side, which removes tension from an already tensionless story.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building isn\u2019t that good. While we learn about the races/species that inhabit the Great Jura Forest and watch how Rimuru\u2019s nation is built, we don\u2019t know much about the other regions. If the story shifted it\u2019s focal point to other regions the world would have felt more grand and alive.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one-dimensional and are only made likeable through a couple of character traits. They aren't remotely realistic or relatable. They don\u2019t develop past their initial introduction. The author constantly introduces more characters instead of developing the ones he has already e.g. Benimaru looks like he has potential, but he doesn\u2019t have much going for him besides being a loyal servant like everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru has no personality or character flaws aside from being a laid-back \u2018good guy\u2019. He\u2019s pretty much a self-insert character. Everyone loves Rimuru in the world. They worship Rimuru and join his side soon after meeting him, to the point it becomes cheap and unearned. They literally bow down and promise to serve him and in return they get a powerup from being given a name! It reaches \u201cSASUGA AINZ SAMA!!1!\u201d in terms of annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nThe Great Sage is essentially a exposition plot device. It knows and explains everything in this world that Rimuru is unfamiliar with and solves all of his problems. Basically it\u2019s lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe humanification of the races annoys me because it\u2019s blatant fanservice. For example, Benimaru turns into a handsome man, Shion turns into a busty oppai bodyguard, the lizard girls look like hot kunoichis. Whereas, what happens to Gabiru & the male lizards? They just get wings...    \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are awful. The writer approaches them by making Rimuru so ridiculously overpowered and the enemy so much weaker that they stand no chance in beating him, so fights end in a oneshot. When the enemy is stronger than Rimuru, Milim just takes care of it. Slightly off topic, in the fight against Charbydis, it annoyed me that Rimuru forced her to sit out while willing to risk the danger of his people and rely on his allies when Milim\u2019s standing right next to him. Rimuru came across as a hypocrite when he insulted Souei, Ranga and Shion and told them to \u201crely on me a bit\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI digress, my biggest problem with Slime is how EVERYTHING gets handed to Rimuru easily:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Encountering the goblin village and becoming their leader right away.\\n\r\n\u2022 Defeating the Orc Lord\\n\r\n\u2022 Dwargon King arriving with his men and issuing a duel-> ends up forming a peace treaty\\n\r\n\u2022 Charbydis was described as an apocalyptic event coming to destroy the Jura Tempest nation and had the whole forest scared-> Milim one shots him. \\n\r\n\u2022 Carrion shows up and makes a non aggression pact because plot\\n\r\n\u2022 Milim betraying the Demon lords to join Rimuru\u2019s side because of honey and them being \u201cbest friends\u201d...\\n\r\n\u2022 Rimuru asking enemies to become friends and build a nation together. \\n\\n\r\nEverything seems to work out for him. None of the races fight in his nation or have any conflict. Rimuru acquires abilities to resolve any situation because of how overpowered the great Sage is. It really should have some drawbacks.\\n\\n\r\nIf this was one situation I would overlook it, but it\u2019s a constant occurrence. Nothing feels like it\u2019s taken seriously. There\u2019s no meaningful/real conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nAny build up to a situation is always killed off in the most anti-climatic way e.g. Charbydis was hyped up being this Calamity as strong as the Demon Lords, however everything was resolved in less than a day and ended with Milim oneshotting him. What did Charbydis subplot add to the story? Nothing, besides being a shoe horned plot device that came out of nowhere to show powerful Milim is. I would have enjoyed watching everyone fight together to defeat the \u201craid boss\u201d, but instead she made everyone\u2019s efforts seem pointless.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is average. The soundtracks are fine. I do enjoy the opening and think the upbeat, lighthearted song fits the tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10): \\n\\n\r\nSlime peaked in the Shizu arc. Everything revolving her was great. It\u2019s really telling that even though Shizu had little screen time, she managed to be the most fleshed out character in the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nSlime is relatively good until the Orc arc. It goes downhill in the 2nd half, particularly after the arrival of Milim. According to manga and LN readers, the anime skips a lot of content, especially world building and it\u2019s noticeable e.g. the students arc is rushed, we get subtle foreshadowing about Veldora, something strange about Chloe\u2019s summoning but the show doesn\u2019t expand on them.\\n\\n\r\nSlime would have been better if it wasn\u2019t always so lighthearted, if it stopped introducing so many characters without developing out the previous ones first and followed through with the buildup instead of everything getting easily resolved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels as if the story is on easy difficulty.",

            "content": "After hearing so much about Reincarnated as a Slime I finally decided to binge the 13 eps that are out to see what the fuss is about. I am pretty disappointed with what I found, not because the show is terrible, but at how over-hyped it has been.\r\nTo start, the story so far is pretty boring. Pretty much every conflict that has happened so far has been resolved either by our OP protag, or the OP ability gifted by our protag to his friends (I'll leave it at that for spoilers). This was fine at first but by episode 13 I should have seen ourcharacters struggle against SOMETHING- and to be clear this is not One Punch Man. There is no hidden conflict for our MC, and very little humor regarding our MC's easy victories. And just when a plot point get's interesting (around ep 7-8) the show gets rid of it, seemingly to swerve the audience expectations at the expense of creating a fun and interesting character dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are nothing special either. Our MC is a typical overpowered shounen protag, a pervy incel thrust into a wish-fulfillment fantasy. He has a few funny one liners but there is nothing interesting about him (it?) except that he/it is a slime. Oh and by episode 10 he has a human form because a show about a slime MC didn't want to commit to keeping a slime MC. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters aren't much better. Every time an interesting character is introduced the plot pushes them out of spotlight in one way or another, and replaces them with boring one dimensional anime tropes. I have nothing against anime tropes- but a show has to do something special and when every other aspect of the show is just average, the boring characters really stand out. In all fairness, there is one fun character (Gobta) who is honestly the highlight of the show imo. Maybe he can save the show in the last 11 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in this show are fine, if not above average. a lot of the action looks smooth and the animations are pretty. Unfortunately above-average animation has almost nothing to do with making a show good. On the other, I have found strong musical scores can really add to the emotional impact of a scene, and help mask some messy plot at times. Unfortunately none of the music here was of that quality. Not to say it was bad, but the best way to describe it is that I watched all 13 episodes within 40 hours of writing this and can't recall a single tune. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this show is the kicker imo. Easily the most subjective category here and while I've bashed the show up til now I can definitely tell this is a show that many enjoy and many reading this would enjoy it as well. It's a \"turn your mind off and watch the protag kick ass\" kind of show, and even I have a special spot for guilty pleasure shows (looking at you Irregular at Magic High). If you are simply a fan of isekai or need a tropey pick-me-up then this might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is pretty average and I don't understand the hype. Pretty much every other review I've read or heard has glowingly praised the show as \"charming\" yet this seems to a fairly intangible concept used to cover up a show that really doesn't do anything unique. If you want a \"charming\" average isekai then this is the show for you, but I would not recommend Reincarnated as a Slime to anyone who has been misled to the idea that this is the next big thing or SAO done right. \\n\\n\\n\r\n**Edit: Through Episode 16 nothing has changed and the show has only doubled down on its flaws. I'm still hopeful for a fun and challenging arc to close out the series though, so I can't write it off just yet.",

            "content": "When was the last time a light novel adaptation or isekai tried to be straightforward? Nothing fancy, nothing repetitive or self-indulgent, just simple. With the likes of Re:Zero, Akashic Records, Overlord, and Mahouka, it\u2019s become harder and harder to find an LN or isekai show that just wants to entertain (parodies like Konosuba don't count cuz fuck you). Even many of the \u201csimpler\u201d, \u201csafer\u201d anime like The Asterisk War and Isekai wa Smartphone fail to realize that we just want something simple and satisfying. That\u2019s probably why Slime is as popular as it is. It just wants to entertain us with a fun, digestible isekaiworld for an adorable protagonist to build in and explore. Not to mention, it does so with some decent visuals, good music, and the sense of whimsey you\u2019d expect from a show about being in a game-like world. That\u2019s not to say the show never gets violent, that it never indulges in typical LN and isekai cliches, or even that it\u2019s a good show. It\u2019s just that Slime values entertainment above all else, never overindulging to the point of stupidity or alienation. Frankly, this is the first isekai in years to not suck.\\n\\n\r\nSlime\u2019s visuals are honestly strange. It doesn\u2019t really feel like it was made in 2018 or 2019. Something about this odd and inconsistent art style doesn\u2019t feel like something you\u2019d see nowadays. While the art style certainly feels unorthodox, a lot of the facial expressions are priceless and adorable as a result, particularly with Rimuru\u2019s slime form. The sheer liveliness of some of the environments trumps even the likes of No Game No Life, which is arguably the most visually stunning isekai on the market. The show often experiments with different styles, like swapping between anime and photorealistic footage when getting us acquainted with Rimuru\u2019s slime form in episode 1, or when he fantasizes about hot elves and they\u2019re drawn in a 90s aesthetic. Several moments in the show, along with the first ED, also add a sort of digital, VR-like filter to whatever\u2019s happening onscreen. Speaking of the first ED, the visuals for it change 4 times, and each version looks great. Even when they\u2019re not experimenting, some of the action scenes and sequences of Rimuru wandering around in slime form look stunning and fluid. The first OP is a wonderful example of this. Sadly, the visuals are about as inconsistent as everything else. For every moment of smooth or lively visuals, we have moments of typical static shots, and episodes where we don\u2019t get much animation. Some of the background and foreground scrolling tends to look awkward as well, and the rampant CGI tends to be even worse. Still, the character designs are generally great, and the high points in the animation put nearly every other isekai or LN adaptation to shame. Studio 8bit is probably one of the better sources of isekai anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nEven more vibrant is the music. Early on, we\u2019re treated to some fun chiptune pieces, along with some adventurous tracks. Somehow, the amount of more lighthearted and fun tracks, and even the amount of battle themes is completely overshadowed by the sheer volume of great emotional pieces. A track that perfectly exemplifies both sides of this is actually the first ED, \"Another colony\" by TRUE. The guitars and drums give this energetic vibe that\u2019s both invigorating and a tad emotional, and the violins more than add to the more emotional aspect of the song. Along with the decent vocals, these elements turn this into one of the better EDs of 2018, and a great way to cap off each episode. I don\u2019t care as much for the second ED despite its more sentimental tone. Takuma Terashima does the 2 OPs of this season, and they are both fantastic. The first, \u201cNameless Story\u201d, is a striking tune, especially with that bombastic usage of the special guitar which gives a more rustic, perhaps 2000s vibe. The visuals accentuate that vibe, as both aspects of the OP meld to create both this sense of adventure and danger. The second OP, \u201cMeguru Mono\u201d is a far calmer, more emotional piece that shows just how far Rimuru and his civilization have come, and how wondrous things will remain in the future.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from an isekai, the writing is a bit of a mess. The show\u2019s pacing is often strange, and it has a ton of pointless and bewildering time skips. Emotional moments often feel rushed or conjured out of thin air, and the show often forgets about its characters until they randomly appear later. Examples of the latter include the time when Gobta\u2019s just left alone in a cell halfway into episode 5 and forgotten about, or when the goblins and wolves are told to wait outside at the beginning of episode 4 and are forgotten about until episode 6, where we see them and a whole new batch of goblins working. The show also tends to resort to time skips, glossing over the progression of the central village Rimuru builds, and making the town\u2019s progression and some of Rimuru\u2019s absences feel utterly ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the world-building is sometimes inconsistent and unexplained, like how Rimuru could only name like 50 or so goblins and one wolf before passing out in episode 3 and then 500 goblins in episode 6. The worst case of the latter is in episode 19 where the wolf Ranga suddenly has a strong partnership with Shion and pulls a flying ability out of nowhere, since the characters ask how and when he learned that and became that close with her, and we never get an answer. Granted, the world-building is never indigestible and rarely broken like it is in Mahouka or Smartphone. It\u2019s just that these issues become especially distracting when the narratives are already rather unremarkable and badly paced. It\u2019s even worse when most of the arc conclusions are drawn-out, anticlimactic, or cheesy, with the 4th arc\u2019s finale being the worst example. That said, some of the storylines in this show are genuinely good. The best example of this is the 3-part storyline with Shizue at the end of arc 1, with its intense backstory and a sentimental payoff for Shizue and her ultimately tragic tale. If only more of this show\u2019s arcs and mini-stories were as good as this or even the majority of the second arc, but inconsistency really is Slime\u2019s middle name.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the characters in this show are actual yes men, often with one defining character trait and only some level of chemistry to make them salvageable. Barring Rimuru (the little asshole), his internal sage assistant, and perhaps the utter dolt that is Gabiru, it seems like the best characters in this show are ones that appear for a short time, like Shizue, Veldora, or the trio of guild adventurers at the end of the first arc. They along with the characters I\u2019ve named often have the most entertaining personalities and chemistry, and the most we get from them are a few gags at Gobta\u2019s, Shion\u2019s, and Rimuru\u2019s expense. Almost none of them have any exceptional personalities or amazing chemistry to rival the GOATs in anime casts, nor do any of them necessarily wring any hype out of me aside from a character introduced in the penultimate episode. However, none of them are insufferable or horribly written. Still, this is probably Slime\u2019s weakest and least entertaining aspect. \\n\\n\r\nThe experience of watching this anime at its best is a lot like that of playing a Kirby game. It has an adorable, round, expressive protagonist who absorbs his enemies\u2019 powers while exploring new lands, and a sense of whimsy crafted by the bouncy slime animation and wonderfully varied OST. The experience of watching this anime at its best is a lot like that of playing a Kirby game. It has an adorable, round, expressive protagonist who absorbs his enemies\u2019 powers while exploring new lands, and a sense of whimsy crafted by the bouncy slime animation and wonderfully varied OST. It\u2019s not necessarily well-written, visually stunning, or even consistently entertaining, but it sets a benchmark for isekai that frankly hasn\u2019t been met in half a decade. All it needed to do in order to not suck was just be straightforward and willing to entertain. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, can we finally have a good isekai again, please? I don\u2019t want another isekai ending with a recap episode, as amusing as this one was. (Yes, the recap is listed as its own anime now, but it was still advertised as the final episode by the show itself, and MAL did not list it as its own entry when this review was made. Fuck you, it's my review...you bullies.)\\n\\n\r\nWritten and Edited by: CodeBlazeFate\\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine",

            "content": "Sometimes in anime there comes a point when there is just too much friendship. Characters who were enemies seconds ago suddenly become best friends for no real reason. No hard feelings, no suspicion or anything. Never any problems, just one happy family. There are no alliances of convenience, no fear of being backstabbed, no slow defrosting of relations. I can appreciate the idea of talking people out of hostilities, but come on. Just a few words and there we go, best friends forever? Am I supposed to take this completely unironically?\r\nAnd apparently this is because they really respect the protagonist, whom they have suddenly chosenas their new leader. Yes, they have found their one true love: Rimuru Tempest. Their love for him is so great that they can put aside all their previous grudges just to serve under him or otherwise be friends with him. Everything is forgiven in nanoseconds and they can all live together in perfect harmony. The second ending perfectly pictures the problem: pretty much the entire cast having fun together. There is nothing at stake. There is no conflict. Just sunshine and rainbows all day, every day. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRimuru has no goals in life. He wants nothing for himself, instead wandering around and helping random people he meets. When people gather around him, he likewise dedicates his time to helping them with their mundane problems. Furthermore, he does this in a very passive manner. Something new comes up, and he reacts, for instance by beating up some random generic villain that showed up for no reason. When he does obtain long-term goals, even those are simply things he was entrusted with by people he barely knew. In one particular case, we are informed of the importance of the person beforehand by prophecy because of course this is the best plot device for the job. They are destined for each other even though they have never met because... destiny or something. Seems legit.\\n\\n\r\nHow can I relate to someone like that? They have gone out of their way to write a protagonist so altruistic that angels would blush in envy. It's too much. Especially in a strange new world full of dangers, no believable person would behave in this way, and even if they somehow did, they would be utterly unrelatable. People are not stereotypical heroic protagonists. People are more nuanced, and they carry flaws. Imagine random people, whom you've never met, walking in and asking you to take care of their mundane errands for no real reward. Repeat this over and over again. Of course, you would every time do everything they wanted, right? Without a single complaint, without ever having desires of your own?\\n\\n\r\nI imagine you wouldn't. Because most people are not angels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, we learn very little of Rimuru's personality. This is pretty much all we know:\\n\\n\r\n1) He likes waifus to an extent, and\\n\r\n2) he performs generic good deeds, often against generic villains.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond his fondness of mammary glands and his dislike of generic evil overlords, he does not appear to have any well-defined beliefs or interests. And it is not as though he actively seeks out waifus either. A few of them join him on their own, and while he enjoys their presence, it is not like he actively seeks out their company or tries to develop his relationship with them. After so many episodes, I still don't know what makes him tick. He just kind of... hangs around passively and helps the people around him who make him solve all their problems.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter his rebirth, Rimuru nearly instantly gains nigh godlike powers so that almost nobody is a real threat to him. He didn't even have to work for it much at all because of the cheat abilities he received at birth. Kind of makes the part about being reborn as a slime meaningless when the slime \u2012 an allegedly weak monster \u2012 is instantly godlike. There would be ways to handle an overpowered protagonist. He could at least deliver witty lines or semi-decent jokes on its basis. It could be a satire of overpowered characters. It could be that the protagonist uses his powers in an interesting way, maybe by scheming or making difficult moral judgments. Highlighting their own ruthlessness can actually be funny as well. Unfortunately, Rimuru is in favor of mechanical infodumps and generic super-altruistic lines, so here we are then. \\n\\n\r\nOverpowered abilities and perfect altruism are a terrible combination because it lets characters bypass any difficult moral judgments. They can take the easy way out and trivially solve almost anything, implying that we should all follow their example and take care of every problem we come across. But the rest of us don't have godlike powers, so what do you expect us to do? Sometimes we have to make difficult decisions, and those tend to be the most interesting ones in fiction too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is usually even worse. As I was implying earlier, Rimuru is surrounded by a fanclub whose members worship him without question. They praise him many times during each episode, which gets old fast and really dampens character interaction. They barely have any characterization beyond this either. This fanclub includes women desperate for him because of course it does. You can debate whether it counts as a genuine harem, but either way it is another symptom of the fanclub mentality. This is not how actual people speak to each other, at least if they are being honest. I don't want protagonists to be surrounded by fanatic fanclubs 24/7. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are somehow even worse. There are essentially two types:\\n\\n\r\n1) The card-carrying, mustache-twirling villains in black capes that are the bane of anime and fiction in general. They are so obviously evil that it hurts. God forbid the protagonist has to make difficult moral decisions; we can't have that. Plus the antagonists receive approximately zero characterization and zero interesting lines. Also, they are as incompetent as you'd expect, so a miss in that regard as well. \\n\\n\r\n2) The \"antagonists\" who actually have no interest in opposing Rimuru in the first place. In fact, give it a few minutes and they will be best friends with him. Their reasons for this change of heart are so trivial that there was no real conflict to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a brave stance this show is taking. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad. All the good guys love the protagonist. Actually, many of the alleged bad guys aren't bad either because \u2012 as noted \u2012 they become friends with the protagonist anyway. Sometimes even without fighting. Try offering them some candy. Maybe that will do the trick. Incidentally, does \"Demon Lord\" stand for \"official envoy of friendship\" in this world? Because \u2012 judging by the Demon Lords onscreen \u2012 that sure is what it looks like. What a happy-go-lucky bunch of people. They say you \"fall from grace\" to become one, but that is probably just a troll.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably guess what this does to the plot. Because adversaries instantly become friends, what can the author do to move it along? If you guessed \"make new ones appear out of nowhere,\" you are right, and this is the result. The plot abruptly transitions from one point to another without any strong underlying theme or message, never stopping to think about the events more thoroughly. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru defeats generic evil (or \"evil\") villain A.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru defeats generic evil (or \"evil\") villain B.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru travels somewhere and solves mundane errand X.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru defeats generic evil (or \"evil\") villain C.\\n\r\n->\\n\r\nRimuru travels to random location Y and saves a bunch of people from a technobabble-based illness or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what did we get out of all this? No cohesive plot, that's for sure. No interesting themes, either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy falls flat as well. The reason is in part the same friendship I have been ranting about. The comedy consists of the usual lighthearted slapstick that we have seen thousands of times, complete with the equally predictable fanservice. I know we shouldn't expect too much, but the show is afraid to offer even the slightest hint of black comedy or scathing commentary. Nor is there any irony or satire found here or even a hint of the simplest sarcasm. No self-awareness. No subversions as far as the eye can see. No funny rants against existing conventions. Here everything is obvious, in-your-face and very conventional, but comedy only works if it is surprising and audacious enough. This show plays it too safe. It is afraid of rocking the boat in any way or form. As a result, it is not funny, even when it is clearly trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Rimuru's dialogue seems really dull and generic, including his inner monologue. He and his infodumping exposition ability \u2012 essentially a robot \u2012 simply describe surrounding events and offer very little in terms of personal viewpoints or deeper thoughts. The wrong way to do world-building is to just dump the info, go \"Hmm? So that's how it is,\" and leave it at that. Sure, Rimuru may plan to use this info to beat the enemy in front of him, but this always takes place in a very mechanical and straightforward manner. There is very little in terms of tactics. There is even less in terms of any moral debate because the world is so black-and-white, and the arbitrary infodumping does little to help this. It is also a problem with the way the dialogue was written. Lines are delivered in a simplistic and predictable fashion. At least lighten it up with your personal ideas or some witty remarks, but nope. To be fair, Rimuru tries to deliver jokes sometimes, but they fall flat for the reasons outlined above.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"But we can't have a protagonist with well-defined personal beliefs. How will people self-insert as him?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, maybe self-inserting is not always necessary. But even if you wanted to, the problem is the opposite. How am I supposed to self-insert as someone who is so passive and lacks initiative? I don't want to self-insert as a cardboard cutout or blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nInteresting characters actually believe in things. They have goals in life, and they struggle to fulfill them.",

            "content": "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is a serias about a guy who got reincarnated as a slime\u2026 I know, sounds innovative, but isn\u2019t, really. What we got is a pretty casual isekai, one more similar to Overlord than Re:Zero, but worse than both of them. We won\u2019t ever experience a tension present in many anime of this kind, because our main character is overpowered from the start, just after swallowing some glowing stones, green herbs and tsundere dragon(?). We won\u2019t see any interestings political affairs or interracial conflicts too. Everything can be summarised to \u201cand than Rimuru came, and everything went well\u201dreally. The pacing is lazy as heck too. Our lovely slime has something like \u201cSage\u201d, which can literally explain every detail of the world to us at any time. I honestly don\u2019t know which is worse - long scenes of two people talking, doing nothing else than explaining the world presented (SAO lol) or this\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\tStory:\\n\r\nWe meet Mikami Satoru, a normal man who gets stabbed as he saves his friend and due to his last words becomes slime in the another world. At first this tale presents itself as a journey of a character, who have problems in his new body form, and struggles no only with the world, but also with himself. I was looking forward to see how he suits himself in that new form of his, how he mindfully overcomes his new weaknesses and gets a use of new abilities. Nor of that happend. All of his growth is about swallowing stuff. He don\u2019t have to think, or try, he can just as Great Sage, and be provided with answers. He gets stronger extremely fast and find powerful allays as easly. Everyone in this world wants to be under his wings or atleast work with him. Maybe expect the \u201cbad guys\u201d who are bad because, well,  someone have to. Story gets repetitive. We meet another groups who have some problems, Rimuru help them, they want to serve him because \u201cugh, hes so good\u201d and so on.\\n\r\n\tCharacters:\\n\r\nI wrote characters, but they are more of gimmicks presented as people. I know, this show is partly a comedy, and it\u2019s pretty common in that genre, but really, you can describe most of the cast members with a single adjective. Exceptions were Shizue and adventurers, who had some more depth. \\n\r\n\tArt:\\n\r\nNothing special, really. Although anime is about a slime, animation is quite static. Fights quickly get to \u201clarge scale\u201d, so we often see just pillars of flames, thunders and weird balls of energy (or something). No emotional weight is presented through art, everything from color pallet to movement stays the same. Sometimes we see some goofines and out of shape animation which serves a comedic purpose. \\n\r\n\tMusic:\\n\r\nIs indistinguishable. If there is something like \u201cstandart isekai anime ost\u201d than it\u2019s this one.\\n\\n\r\nI feel beited, as not only our hero\u2019s form isn\u2019t playing a big role in the story, but also he begins to stay more and more in his human state as show progresses.\tI\u2019ve watched many worse isekai series, but thay\u2019ve had one advantage - only 12/13 episodes. This show is just too long to be bearable. I bet it intrigued many with an unexpected title but sadly it turned out to be not worthy at all.",

I felt forced. This type of comedy is used too much on animes that It lost its uniqueness and its effect.\r\nCharacters: There are characters just for fanservice and there are idotic characters supposed to be funny. The only moderate character : Rimuru. He shows thatthere is no need for war because of mistakes from the past. And everyone can be allies/friends anytime..  He is using his op powers to create peace. But the dumb thing is most of the groups retreat and be friendly way too easy..\\n\\n\r\nThe action is fine. There are'nt any overdone skills, fights. mcs' fight logic is always improving. Every action concludes to a new group and a stronger peace. \\n\r\nBut everything concludes to a 'happily ever after' vibe very fast and easy that makes me lose the purpose to watch the anime. Everything is happy ,bright and basic.\\n\r\nSfx in action makes 0 sense and Power charges / transformations / hits sfx volumes' are at unneded high Db that I was close to having multiple earrapes. The sfx should'nt be louder than talk sounds.\\n\\n\r\n''The main idea may be superficial but It gets to its point what it wants to tell the viewers''(no).\\n\r\nIf the fiction does'nt have depth , it won't have flaws much. That makes the anime basic.\\n\\n\r\nthey failed to build up dramatic parts because the occurances ended too fast without improving like when slime met with Shizue. Shizue died after 2 episodes. I think the  emotional buildup was'nt enough. Maybe the part was just made to add purpose and power to the slimes' objective. But they made the same buildup for most of characters' stories. Even they had shorter and less powerfull build up. Bad drama - action build up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm open to critics. That would help me improve.",

            "content": "This anime is complete garbage. There is really no way I can sugarcoat it. Out of every anime I have ever watched, I have only rated this one absolutely appalling. I highly recommend anyone with any sort of quality standards stay away from it.\r\nThis won't be a long, drawn out review because the problems with this anime are so gross and apparent that there's no need to go into any in-depth analysis. \r\nFirst comes the characters:\r\nCompletely pathetic. Every character in this anime is bland and unlikable. The side characters have basically no personality, and everyone exists only for the sake of bowing down to theprotagonist's power. In turn, he gives them an immediate level up. Wow. Nice. This leads us to the protagonist himself -- His first main quality is being a pervert and his second main quality is being overpowered enough for everyone to like him. Other than that, he's just the most generic anime protagonist imaginable. \\n\\n\r\nNext comes the story:\\n\\n\r\nSomehow the story itself is far worse than its terrible characters. The entire plot is just the protagonist being overpowered. Occasionally he'll level up some characters, so that they can also be overpowered. Every fight the protagonist goes into, you'll know he's gonna be OK because he will pull out some mystical special ability that will make him instantly impervious to whatever challenge awaits. Granted, people keep saying stuff like \"wait until the end of the series!\" but that doesn't matter. If the first 13 episodes of a series are garbage, I'm not gonna wait until episode 23 for it to get good. That isn't how watching a show works.\\n\\n\r\nThere have been numerous other anime like One Punch Man or even Overlord that have done OP characters infinitely better than this anime. How? The other anime add in some sort of special circumstance in addition to unique traits to the protagonist. In One Punch man and Overlord, they never act as if the opponent realistically has any chance. In this anime they act as if the opponent actually has a chance of defeating the protag. In this anime, the protagonist doesn't have any special unique traits that make him cool and likeable. They don't embrace the fact that the slime is just an OP god. They don't give the slime any personality or circumstance to counteract the fact that he's OP. Tbh if the characters had any personality, this story would be a lot better but they DON'T. \\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound: Fine. Honestly nothing special. I guess the art is pretty good overall but it would be better in a story that was actually good.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't know much else I can say about this anime. It's just the blandest piece of media I've ever accidentally consumed. Typically I'm able to avoid anime this terrible, but MAL rated this a top-tier show for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ratings: 1 across the board, except for the art and sound which were 6 and 4 respectively.",

And thank fuck for NO FUCKING CGI goblins/monsters! Sound wise, the OST isn't mind blowing and neither is the OP but they are acceptable and borderline good but yet again Ihave to give props to the VAs for this anime, especially the slime's VA which completely matches the characters cute, lovable personality that makes you really cheer for it/him/her?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters=8/Plot=6:\\n\r\nNow although there haven't been many key characters introduced besides the slime, all the background characters are different yet likeable which is difficult to do; I find myself liking every character in every new episode, even the asshole characters! However, yet again, the slime shines through as easily one of the most likeable protagonist this season simply due to the fact that the MC doesn't follow a typical \"I'm OP, lemme start a shitty harem and be a massive dick while beating the shit out of everything in my way!\" I love Rimuru simply for the fact that he's genuinely a good and likeable character! Plot wise, the show has been average, maybe above average at best with some very familiar tropes early on although the introduction into the isekai is rather original and quite a cool concept! However, the freshness of the concept is later overshadowed by tropes that happen in every isekai; I understand that some of them are simple ways to world build etc. but it's been done so much that it ruins the excitement of wanting the plot to progress. \\n\\n\r\nOverall=8:\\n\r\nDue to a lackluster plot and not enough indulgent into other characters besides the slime, this anime loses some points but it doesn't mean that it isn't one of the funnest and most enjoyable shows of the season because it fucking is! Honestly, I should probably lower the score to a 7 or so but I can't do that simply for my enjoyment factor and how awesome that adorable little slime is! (He really makes you root for him!)",

            "content": "SO\r\nI love this anime. And I think it's very sad to see so many negative reviews... that bring up invalid points\r\nI don't want to put anyone down, but you are either misinterpreting somethings, or haven't watched far enough ahead for it to be covered.\r\nFirst off! Rimuru... is a slime. Slimes are sexless. Slimes are genderless. So people have boobs, happens in real life too. Sure it can be a little fan-service-ey, but it's not really important. How can you NOT notice boobs that are being squished against your face? Because you are only a face. And are being carried. By someone with boobs.\r\nSecond! Rimuru seemsoverpowered... because he can absorb the powers of things he eats. So all he needs to do is eat something strong and boom, he's a God! Except Um... he needs to EAT IT. He's not as strong as he seems.\\n\\n\r\nNext! Yes, it seems a little slow at the start. This is a somewhat complicated world that needs to be built. It's going slow because Rimuru is new to this world and understandably knows nothing.\\n\\n\r\nExposition! Yes he has a Exposition machine in his head. But it avoids unnecessary explanations from other characters. And it isn't used particularly much. It's just fantasy Google. It also isn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nRimuru as a person:\\n\r\nSo I love Rimuru's character. He helps the Goblins... but anyone would. That doesn't make him a Gary Stu. Everyone loves him... probably because he's considered \"super powerful'... and in a world full of monsters it's good to join up with powerful people? He even seems somewhat cold and distant from people, actually. It's other people that are almost worshipping the strongest thing they have after the only being protecting them disappeared. He also has his own reasoning for helping out further in the series. He's just generally a normal dude that's disconnected from reality slightly.",

            "content": "One of the best fantasy world based anime's this year, this anime manages to be unique in the most over-saturated genre. \r\n  Our mc becomes a slime, and the biological and emotional challenges are presented to us in a comedic way in the first 2 episodes. For the rest of the 6 episodes I've watched, the mc is meeting new characters where the few main supporting characters are developed rapidly. This gives a sense of a real community as it wouldn't be realistic to build meaningful relationships with every other character. The story gets 9/10\r\n  for Art and Sound, they bothget 10/10. The animation is crisp, even the physics of the slime is nearly spot on. Music is excellent and carries the fantasy world feel to it.\\n\\n\r\n  Character and Enjoyment and 9/10 and 10/10 respectively. The mc is excellent but in some cases, stalls too much to use his power which does create some suspense but is logically not needed. Characters who are needed to be developed are, but the add-ons can be very generic. Nonetheless, this doesn't hinder how enjoyable the anime is, the atmosphere is done well and carries the fantasy feel to it. The anime can be funny, exciting, suspenseful, and dramatic all in one episode. This is the most enjoyable anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall it gets a 9.5/10, great watch to probably everyone who likes fantasy worlds.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well well, seems like the story to this popular series isn't ending yet, at least for now. Nonetheless, I would like to declare TenSura as one of the greatest Isekai series ever made, and 8-bit's adaptation of the source material (majority from the manga, some with LN/WN) couldn't have come any closer to pure excitement and enjoyment, even after some big falls and hiccups along the way. And with Season 2 in the horizon to come (at the time of this review) in 2020, let's dissect what Season 1 here has already churned out so far.\r\n*This will be a tad bit spolier heavy, but I'llpromise to keep it very generalistic!*\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe Isekai \"other world\" genre at this point is nothing new, becoming a commonplace in modern-day anime, and TenSura is no different. Some dude lost his life in an \"everyday typical\" incident, except that the scenario causes his death...and what happens next is even more mysterious (and honestly one of the big selling points of the series). He is reincarnated as a gender-less slime (and it's even proven in the myriad of source materials), and honestly Rimuru Tempest is legit one cool lit character, quite possibly one of the best characters I've ever seen in an Isekai series. As time passes, by captializing on the differenitating MC cast and crew, it truly is something that is special against the many generic Isekai stories out there.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the get-go, Rimuru, in slime or transformed human form, is quite the OP figure. Being a slime, it can traverse everywhere with the versaility to transform as and when Rimuru likes it. With the help of the basic but powerful Unique Skills Predator and Great Sage, plus the meet-and-greet consumption of the tsundere Storm Dragon Veldora, it is set to create a name for itself under the guidance of Great Sage and harmonize the assortment of characters coming its way in the Jura forest. As the series grows, the plot building of the Jura (Forest) Tempest Foundation town in the light of Veldora's disappeared large domineering presence is a very important one, not only for Rimuru and his teams of growing fellow mercenaries, but of combatting external threats as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the very concerned parties, pertaining to the source materials, TenSura Season 1 covers:\\n\r\n- Manga: Pretty much the entirety of the manga, both Japanese and English subbed releases.\\n\r\n- LN/WN: LN Volumes 1-4 and WN Arcs 1-3 (with some non-linear episodes adapting relative chapters), not gonna mention them here, but please do check them out.\\n\r\n- Some episodes are anime originals (or rather, side stories) too, I'll leave that for y'all to find out as well!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOvertime, we get to see the many characters, starting from strong pack of direwolves (Ranga, leader of the pack) to good-looking goblins (Gobuta you deserve the high praise here), even the insanely strong small community of dwarves (Kaijin and Co.) and ogres (Benimaru and Co.), and also both the Lizardmen (reminds me of the proud jerk Gabiru) and eventually the orcs themselves also. Not to mention even the Demon Lords make their first appearances, and while we have seen the first of the Demon Lords (Destroyer Milim Nava, Clayman, Leon Cromwell and others), Season 1 didn't go as far as to mention their purposes and motives, I'd bet that LN/WN readers who most likely already know how big the action is, and we'll sadly have to wait till Season 2 to fully let the proceeding major arcs flesh in its glory.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and don't miss out the companion MC in line: Shizu Izawa, quite possibly the integral character close to Rimuru. Dubbed \"The Conqueror of Flames\" with the fire spirit Ifrit, that was embedded by Demon Lord Leon himself, Shizu is pretty much in common with Rimuru, that both are \"World Travellers\", summoners that are required to be powerful, so much so that their existence comes off as totally rare. Once a subject of constantly failed experiments, a sacrifical pawn at the heart of it all, she is saved by Rimuru due to the curse inflicted upon her heart that turned into hate. As a consequence, she always wears the power-nullifying (Anti-Demon) mask to encapsulate Ifrit's massive power. In the later stages, Rimuru redeems her life, promises to take up her request of vengeance and teaches the summoned children on behalf to improve on their magic abilities. In a sense, we can all symphatize with Shizu as a memory of pure hell and torture, and how Rimuru sees her as a close friend brings the feels.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a well-rounded cast of characters, and I pray that Season 2 knocks off the walls with more key characters that will arrive in due time to come and break the door open for bigger possibilities, between Rimuru and Co. and the other characters not yet revealed!\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nMy outlined preliminary review after the first 1.5 months still stands, and highly so to even greater effect as Season 1 is officially wrapped up. Props to the production staff and everyone's contributions over at 8-bit for this amazing series. An overall high quality, top-notch product through and through, certainly the flagship series that the studio has to offer. Though sometimes the series will have certain hiccups in quality, but on an overall standpoint, we viewers stand to gain tenfold. And how can I forget about the references for anime original episodes? [b]*Salt meme* intensifies[/b]\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nWhen will a series be stretched wholesome by its OST alone? The endless amount of reveals throughout these past 6 months through the 2-cour OPs and EDs just made more hype and pleasures all the more redeeming as time goes by. Not to mention that all 4 songs are awesome to listen in their own right, but many would agree that the OP/ED pairing of the 1st cour shines brighter than its counterpart. The OST shines during its battle segments, whether be it with major enemies or even just friendly fire. Heck, the music here is one awesome ball of fire.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclsion, with people complaining about the cut content towards the adaptation, it's hardly noticeable at its first steps, it regretfully interpolates through the hurts-and-shreds of its erratic pacing. But for anime-onlys like myself, I feel that with this much disruption (ever since Milim arrived and the Royal Capital arc with Shizu's students), the attention to detail subsequently increases and it's hard to call it a good adaptation overall. But whatever the case is, it does not detract from the overall experience, and is still a fun and enjoyable series to watch in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nNow we'll just have to wait for the continuity that is Season 2, bringing even bigger hype in 2020. Until then, have a wonderful \"It's Slime Time!\", on behalf of Rimuru and Shizu, #SlimeTime out!",

            "content": "Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken may be one of the most decent isekai recently released\u2026 But please, can we stop pretending this serie is perfect?\r\nThe premise of this serie is pretty much the same as other isekais: MC dies and gets transported to a fantasy/RPG game world, but in this case he reincarnates as a slime. Slimes are well recognized to be the most basic and weak creatures in fantasy worlds, but sometimes they have some traits like broken skills, elemental resistances or ailments inmunity, that may make them powerful creatures which shouldn\u2019t be underestimated (Dragon Quest is a well-known example). \r\nSlimes in this worldare pretty much like that, but since they don't have intellect enough they are not considered as a threat. Here is when our MC appears. MC, subsequently named Rimuru Tempest, wakes up in a cave in this amorphous and gummy body, after a quick review he is informed about his condition by a kind of inner voice just called Daikenja (think of her like those pop ups tutorials in videogames) and without much else to do, Rimuru starts to explore the cave.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow talking about the serie in general, one of the best aspects about TenSura is the worldbuilding. Yes, this isekai actually HAS worldbuilding. The serie basically explains everything, the current situation, the world and its creatures, terminology, skills, magic effects, you name it. Of course this means there is a lot of exposition, sometimes too much (like in the first chapter), but it is presented in straightforward and concise sentences instead of walls of texts, so it doesn't end up being overwhelming. Most of this exposition comes from Daikenja to Rimuru and hence the viewer, but sometimes Rimuru himself explains the situation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSlimes have an unique skill called Predator that allows them to absorb, keep and analyze materials and enemies, so Rimuru spends like a month in the cave farming materials and gaining experience, stats and skills, becoming very powerful in the process. Soon he meets a sealed dragon named Veldora, and after a cringe but funny conversation, Veldora helps him to see, gives him a name and they become friends. Rimuru is also told more about the world and how he is not the only person transported from another world. That\u2019s how, after absorbing Veldora in order to eliminate the seal, Rimuru leaves the cave with a new objective: to find more people from his world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow Rimuru and the viewer are facing a new world, a\u2026 pretty common fantasy world. The serie is honest and doesn\u2019t hesitate to show a normal and lighthearted fantasy enviroment with its typical creatures like goblins, dwarfs, orcs and of course humans. Helped with a decent palette of colors and nice backgrounds, this world feels alive and charming. TenSura is self-conscious about what it\u2019s showing, without pretensions of being what it\u2019s not, the plot is not supposed to be taken so seriously so you can get in the mood pretty easily.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom this point the plot can be summarized in Rimuru getting involved in some races\u2019 problems and helping them solving those problems, either by meritocracy or by force, and in the end making these creatures his subordinates and building a big \u201cfamily\u201d. Pacing is another positive point, every arc lasts enough to introduce new characters and main problem, it handles to explain all the important information and resolves the situation without rushing or lengthening. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEven so, there is a big issue this series has: Rimuru gets so OP that he gets basically everything with little to no effort at all, even when the serie justifies everything. Predator and Daikenja are very broken tools, not only Rimuru can use all the skills he absorbs to beat all enemies he faces with ease, not only he can stock almost infinite materials and use them without caution when it\u2019s necessary, but he also gets convenient explanations of what he doesn\u2019t know via Daikenja. All of this breaks the tension and makes the serie predictable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut major issues around the serie are not just because of Rimuru\u2019s powers, it\u2019s the way the plot is too convenient to him that it puts the perfect situation so that Rimuru can solve it very easily. Just look at the first chapters, for example: He CONVENIENTLY appears in a place full of materials and monsters he CONVENIENTLY can absorb with his OP skill, then he CONVENIENTLY meets a powerful dragon that helps him to escape, and after that he CONVENIENTLY finds a goblin village with a problem he can easily solve because of his absorbed skills. Now he has a village of goblins and wolves which revere him, but he needs blacksmiths so he goes to a city to get them, he CONVENIENTLY meets the best blacksmith dwarfs in the city which have a big problem that Rimuru can CONVENIENTLY solve by just absorb a sword, analyze it and make a lot of copies with all the materials he CONVENIENTLY kept from the cave, so now the dwarfs are happy to revere him\u2026 Again, the serie at least explains the basics about every individual situation so it\u2019s possible to justify them (like how he was able to make sword copies because he had enough saved materials), this is enough to put TenSura above others of the genre, but it\u2019s not enough justification for all the plot conveniences surrounding Rimuru. This is just a mediocre writting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a big problem especially for action moments because no matter how powerful the enemy is, you know Rimuru and his gang can easily get rid of it without much complication. You know the good guys are going to win against the bad guys, like a shounen, but unlike shounen or actions series in general, here tensi\u00f3n is non-existent because how OP good guys are. Actions scenes are not always supposed to be good because of the sometimes obvious outcome, but the scene by itself, to see how good guys handle to beat bad guys against all the problems they might go through (and even they may lose). Here nothing of that happens, making actions scenes pretty dull and uninterested in the long run.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSince there\u2019s an overall lighthearted mood around, there are comedy moments too, but comedy is a pretty weak aspect of the serie. Most comedic scenes are summarized in dull boke-tsukkomi gags and plain jokes using cliches LNs are plagued of, making comedy in general feel very forced and fail to be funny. This serie is also overwhelmingly cliche, almost every trope of the manual can be found here: lolis, onee-sans, fanservice, bishounens, bouncing boobs, harem elements, and going through typical situations like OP characters wrecking everyone and everything easily, bullying the ineptest guy, harem chicks arguing each other, mortal cooking, onsen, etc. All of those issues aren\u2019t bad per se, but in this case they are just flatly placed onscreen with no subtlety and with the vague intention of being funny. Tropes that have been heavily used and are no longer funny. Even when there are scenes with gags, situations or jokes that at least can make you smile, in regards of purely comedic scenes there\u2019s not creativity, there\u2019s not enough wit to make a genuinely funny scene, just the same well-known cliches reused. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are by far the weakest part of the serie. Rimuru as a character is just ok, at least he has personality unlike other Light Novels MCs, but it\u2019s a pretty basic one. That\u2019s not entirely bad because it fits with the lighthearted mood the serie has and makes Rimuru easy to relate with. Actually the main issue with that is the lack of any depth, making the character plain, and for a MC this is bad because it might make the viewer get bored or lose interest, also limits a lot the character\u2019s potential. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big depth, but something that says Rimuru is more than just your average MC. Also, it\u2019s really hard to believe how someone that basic and limited apparently has so much charm as the serie puts it; just some kind words and a demostration of his powers are enough to convince people that Rimuru \u201cis such a very nice and reliable slime\u201d and instantly they are willing to be part of his family and revere him\u2026 That\u2019s the kind of things that make Rimuru look more like your typical Gary Stu light novel MC.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven all said before, Rimuru is maybe the best character in the serie, but that\u2019s because the rest of the cast are just stereotypical characters who barely have personality (and some of them mainly for \u201ccomedy\u201d purposes). Actually there are pretty interesting characters there, but the main problem is that they revere Rimuru so much that they lose any hint of characterization or development they might have: \\n\\n\r\n-Ok, goblins and wolves were just simple monsters so initially they didn\u2019t need characterization at all, but after they evolved some of them were shown with actual personality, but they just kept there as background characters revering Rimuru, with no evolution or something that would make viewer get interesed on them as individual characters, like Gobuta, Rigur or Rigurd. This may also apply to Kaijin or Gabiru who had characterization before becoming Rimuru\u2019s subordinate. \\n\\n\r\n-Ranga actually started with personality, doubts about his father and former leader, but after this latter were defeated and killed by Rimuru he just\u2026 accepted him, and became one of his most loyal subordinates, losing basically any trace of personality. I mean, for real? He saw how his father was brutally killed in front of him and he didn\u2019t get mad, sad or decided to take the leadership, he just forgot everything and became so affective with his new leader in a way you can\u2019t believe it. You may blame the fear of see how someone that strong easily kills his leader as a reason to surrender to him, and in fact it is a reasonable justification to that, but not to become so affective and losing any personality in order to be just a guardian dog. \\n\\n\r\n-Onis are where the serie wasted a lot of potential. When I said that there were pretty interesting characters I was referring mostly to them. They are more than simple monsters unlike goblins or wolves, each one of them have different personalities that were kept after becoming Rimuru\u2019s subordinates, and actually they had a goal before that, since they lost their village. So\u2026 what happened after they reached their goal and decided to stay as Rimuru\u2019s subordinates? Were their personalities and pasts developed or even exploited? Of course not! Well, they are treated as more than just NPCs unlike goblins and wolves, but most of their interventions are very shallow, like if they weren\u2019t so important as characters. We have the proud leader, the wise old man, the mysterious silent man and the big quiet one just fulfiling those roles, some \u201ccomedic\u201d moment and nothing more. The two girls are worse, they are just waifu baits with opposite personalities that the serie uses for the classic \u201charem chicks arguing about MC attention\u201d, even worse, they are kind of like Ranga when they suddenly became so affective towards Rimuru that you can\u2019t believe it, losing any posibility of individual characterization thanks to that extreme loyality.\\n\\n\r\n-Millim is the loli factor in this equation and your typical \u201cridiculously powerful but kawaii brainless chick\u201d who allied with Rimuru because plot said so (really, she didn\u2019t have a reason at all) and we need another waifu bait for the weebs. Nothing more worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\n-You may have noticed I haven\u2019t talked about Shizu yet even when she\u2019s supposed to be important for the main plot, that\u2019s because her characterization was so shallowly shown she can\u2019t even count as proper character, and it\u2019s the main proof this serie is terrible in characterization. This girl is, like Rimuru, another person invoked from his world, and when they met she established their situation is not so uncommon, potentially making this a pillar for the main plot and for Rimuru and Shizu\u2019s development and relation. So what the serie did after that? Instead of giving Shizu an important role and time to develop her, the serie just showed her cruel past when she arrived with excesive victimization, then she \u201cunleashed\u201d her power CONVENIENTLY after meet Rimuru so he could \u201chelp her\u201d absorbing her power (becoming more OP) finishing her life in the process and then giving him her \u201clast will\u201d by allowing Rimuru to absorb her body and appearance\u2026 All in an attempt to create cheap drama around Shizu, trying to make the viewer empathize with her but in the wrong way because at the end there\u2019s nothing important left to bond with, all that just makes Shizu more a plot device than a proper character. That was actually one of the worst arcs of the show, and it evidences that the serie is bad at dealing with dramas and serious issues, which also affects narrative of those serious arcs. \\n\\n\r\n-Veldora is in a similar situation. After he got absorbed by Rimuru he just stopped existing as a character and more as a plot device, because his absence just worked as a reason to move the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the serie can\u2019t be expected to develop all characters since there are a lot, but at least it should pick the most important ones and give them some depth (especially for story purposes) instead of just treat them like walking tropes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to the final arc, which it\u2019s about the other invoked people Shizu talked about, and which I said it might be a pillar for the main plot and for Rimuru\u2019s characterization, so it\u2019s supposed to be a pretty important arc\u2026 And what did we get? This arc sums up basically everything that is wrong with this anime: Rimuru\u2019s skills and OPness killing any tensi\u00f3n (now he can assemble spirits too? Are you kidding me?), wasted characters with tiny to no characterization (none of the supposedly important kids\u2019 personalities or pasts were explored, they were just mere plot devices), A LOT of plot conveniences (in just one chapter Rimuru got kids\u2019 respect by killing a dragon that CONVENIENTLY appeared from nowhere, that was seen CONVENIENTLY by a merchant that accepted to do business with Rimuru, and one of his girls CONVENIENTLY knew where Spirit Queen can be found) and otaku pandering. On top of that, a new problem the serie hadn\u2019t faced up to this point: the pacing was very rushed (several weeks of bonding between Rimuru and the kids passed in just a few minutes, for example), making the plot even more convenient than the rest of the serie, and the introduced characters were forgettable. This arc makes clear that this serie isn\u2019t going to improve in any way. It\u2019s a shame.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said above, I just can ask: why is this serie, full of those issues commonly criticized in most LN adaptations, getting a free pass? Why is getting too much praise and high scores even when it falls under the same tropes that mediocre and much more criticized LNs also fall?\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut please don\u2019t get me wrong, with all its ups and downs TenSura is a decent serie I pretty enjoyed. But the serie is far from being perfect, and I thought it would be good bringing some criticism to the table pointing out all the good and bad things the serie did instead of just say shallow claims like \u201cit\u2019s good because I liked it and characters made me laugh\u201d or \u201cthis is utter crap because Rimuru is so OP and nothing happens\u201d. So yeah, the reason this serie stands out as one of the most decent isekais recently released is more because most of those isekais are pretty bad rather than by its own merits. But hey! It actually HAS merits.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Interesting premise, charming mood and decent worldbuilding, but terrible characters and bad handling of serious issues when tries to be more ambitious. This serie is fine but it\u2019s not a masterpiece or even something close. Please stop overrating and overhyping things, THAT is the real cancer of the community.\\n",

            "content": "Being a huge fantasy junkie, and someone who always enjoys a good laugh, I decided to give this series a shot. It seemed like a match made in heaven for me. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t pan out.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nA nice, normal 37 virgin guy is tragically stabbed whilst protecting his friend. His last words are to wipe his hard drive of pornography so no one can see it. Then he dies and is reincarnated as an overpowered Slime monster in a fantasy world (because of course). I guess helping someone means you get to be reincarnated as an OP blob. It makes one wonder what God decidedto do with all those heroes who died storming Normandy beach.\\n\\n\r\nI think the main problem here is that there is absolutely nothing outstanding about the plot. It\u2019s a generic fantasy world. That alone wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a problem, except the plot never seemed to want to go somewhere meaningful. The protag meets a tsundere dragon, and after releasing the seal on said dragon, it causes monsters to run amuck in the nearby forest. For the next 20 episodes, he spends the entire time helping build up a goblin village. Getting them food, shelter, supplies, teaching them various things so that they may help themselves, fighting off monsters, recruiting new allies, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut why should we care about these goblins and other monsters? Why does the slime care? Because they\u2019re in trouble?  Since he can basically do whatever he wants to, why doesn\u2019t he instead go out and explore the world and cure cancer or, you know, do something actually meaningful? He\u2019s ridiculously OP and almost nothing can touch him anyway. Go do something more grandeur and exciting. If he only wants to help others, there are far more efficient (and more interesting) things he could be doing. Most of the story never feels original. The world is dull. No overarching plot or direction to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all that being said, there are in fact, two unique things, which are also the most interesting aspects. First, others from Japan find themselves in this world, albeit none of them are reincarnated as OP slimes and are instead used as mediums for others to do their bidding, IE like a magic summon. The other aspect is the fact the protag is a slime. But this has literally zero impact on anything. It allows him to eat things and take their powers via Kirby. But it\u2019s not like a mimic ability itself is particularly unique and there are other ways one could go about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s downright gorgeous. I found it impressive on multiple levels. Attack animations and movement are aesthetically pleasing. Being a two cour show made it all the more impressive. Rarely will you see animation that isn\u2019t a movie look this good. There are only a couple of inconsistencies that prevent it from being perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects usually sound good, and it pairs up beautifully with the impressive animation. The only disappointment here is the OST, which felt lackluster overall. I only watched a small part of the dub, but it seemed respectable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is the biggest problem here. \\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s OP, can do anything, and is a nice guy with perfect morals. He\u2019s a Gary Stu. Apparently he still wants girls though, despite lacking necessary parts\u2026not sure how that works but whatever. The idea itself couldn\u2019t even make me chuckle. Just another \u201cOverpowered reincarnated isekai nice guy who does nice things and meets cute girls.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are uninteresting. The goblins have vanilla personalities, as do the orcs, the lizards, the dwarves\u2026you name it. It doesn\u2019t particularly matter which race or group of people you think of, their normalized colloquialisms and character motivations makes it hard to care about any of them. Not a single group felt like it\u2019s own culture. The orcs came the closest, but unfortunately that aspect was pushed aside in favor of more meathead action scenes instead.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some demon lords who are villains or something, and yes, they\u2019re also as standard as your villains come. Muhahaha, you think you are strong little slime? Well you certainly seem interesting, maybe I\u2019ll finally get off my laurels and do something in about 20 episodes. But don\u2019t worry, it would be inconvenient to the plot if I did it myself, so instead I\u2019ll send some weak minions who will get progressively stronger before I do anything. Truly I am a mastermind genius! Something something evil something.\u201d The other side antagonists are just comical anyway- maniacal laughter, weak motivations\u2026you\u2019ve seen this hundreds of times already.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one colorful character, Milim, who appears towards the end of the series. She\u2019s a demon lord who looks 12 but is actually 2000 years old (because of course). Naturally she wears a ridiculous thong-thing to go with it. I guess skimpy outfits give women super powers in Japan or something. Anyway, she is introduced as being 10x stronger than the Slime protag- and a potential enemy intially. But he gives her some honey so she decides they should just be friends. Lord knows she couldn\u2019t have just taken it by force. What a waste.\\n\\n\r\nThe one character who was mildly interesting was gone after a couple episodes early on in the series. Not going to spoiler the circumstances, but that was disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has some of the prettiest animations that are further enhanced by the fantastic sound effects. But the forgettable story, bland characters and listless world make this title an especially hard sell, even to fantasy fanatics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  3/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Gorgeous animation\\n\r\n+Top-notch sound effects\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Bland, uninteresting story\\n\r\n-Dull characters, especially the protagonist\\n\r\n-World-building is terrible\\n\r\n-Lackluster OST\\n",

            "content": "This is the first Isekai series (that take itself seriously) that I really enjoy. I can say for certain that this is DIFFERENT from any isekai anime I've ever watched before. \r\nWhy?\r\nThis show actually gives us something what most isekai RPG lacks these days, the thing that gets diluted by pointless drama, fan-service, and pointless curb-stomp battle. This anime gives us something that I think most isekai failed to bring.\r\nThat's right, this show gives us an ISEKAI.\r\nThe amount of details and world-building that were put into creating this awesome anime is just extraordinary. It not only tells a charming story about a little slime whohas changed the life of so many, it also gives us a world to explore.\\n\\n\r\nThis series gives us so much details about the world they live in. From the towns, villages, organizations, and the geographical name of every place. Watching it feels like traveling across a whole world and watching it grow. The way each episode feature something new, added with a gripping tale of a simple slime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also doesn't shy away from featuring non-human character. Heck, humans here got the least amount of screentime in the show. Most we see are goblins, orcs, slime, dwarfes, and lots of monsters that reminds me just how much of a wonderful world this show took place in.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThis show also gives us a fresh new look on how to handle an RPG anime. Starting off inside a magic cave, then to a goblin village, and showing us different civilizations filled with different races. It is entirely different than your cliche (woke up in the middle of the town, meet your first magic Girlfriend, go to the nearest pub, discover looming threat, save the world, etc). This series actually gives us a story told from an entirely different perspective.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see from the perspective of the monsters. Giving life to many faceless beasts that's been killed for the purpose of grinding. We get to see the shift in power between monster, the unspoken politics between each races, and many others.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but we get to see the world GROW. We get to see how the simple slime slowly but surely shaping up this wonderful world into something better. Gaining allies along the way and building up civilizations. The subtle details on how the building changes, the clothings, and how the people there look like. It's just so refreshing to see this amount of world-building and exploring from a single anime.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nAs for the downsides: The emotions, drama, and some of the serious scenes really didn't tug any heartstrings. (Though, it could be that I'm just THAT apathetic), hence why the dramatic scenes like one of the actual death of one of the main character didn't really faze me. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scene is also pretty boring. Since most are just curb-stomp battles, but the diverse ability and monster might make it worthwhile... Maybe...\\n\\n\r\nStill, good watch. Enjoyable and pretty much a good isekai anime.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS; MIGHT REVISE AT END OF SERIES\r\nTLDR: Decently animated and voiced but cursed with a mediocre story smothering its own promise, Slime is carried by two strong characters; but these two bright (and perhaps short lived) sparks cannot save the show from a disappointing supportive cast and overly frequent detours into generic trope territory. An experience that may be enjoyed by some, if you're willing to put substance aside and just roll with the ride.\r\nI didn't expect much from this show, but I did consider changing my mind in the first episode. But eventually I've been proven right: I found this show to bepainfully average. In fact, Slime's criminal flaw is not in a very shaky story or lacklustre characterisation \u2014 this show is just simply uninteresting to me when I look at it as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a pretty basic story, reminiscent of Overlord but with more...docile and far less hostile characters. Slime charts the rise of the now reborn protagonist: Rimuru Tempest, a wisecracking and perverted slime that's attempting to build an empire through sweat and steel. What's good about this whole journey is how the show paces itself and how it realistically shows genderless slime creature Rimuru tackle obstacle after obstacle when it comes to forging its kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nThat's...pretty much all that's good about the plot.\\n\\n\r\nLike many shows, friendship power is greatly abused in this show. Enemies and characters who have every right to be hostile, roll over easily for Rimuru to (literally and figuratively) scratch their bellies. Slime's opportunism can sit well some times, but it eventually turns the story shallow and despicably loathsome. There's pretty much nothing at stake for Rimuru Tempest, as it gets what it wants, settling issues through a show of immeasurable force or by flaunting the strength of its allies. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru literally murders a creature BRUTALLY, only to have the creature's own child AND its WHOLE group follow him loyally\u2014with a very half asses explanation after, no questions asked. The son of this murdered creature also fawns over and almost worships Rimuru\u2014the very individual that murders his father, before his very eyes. He encounters powerful kingdoms who just lie down and want to befriend him. He makes two warring groups come to peace with each other and live together; disregarding the fact that they had been spilling each others' blood and intestines just a day or two before. He somehow makes friends with one of the strongest beings in his world (way, WAY stronger than him at that moment) by offering aforementioned being some honey, thus gaining an unbeatable ally that effectively grants Rimuru immunity from the very few things that can actually threaten it in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the way this show completely tosses aside the idea of actions having consequences that irritates me. Things are handled with a couldn't care less attitude in Slime, making it quickly repeat itself again and again...like a broken record. Rimuru could slaughter half of his villagers; yet the remaining half would still flock around the Great Rimuru adoringly, as though he crowned them with roses. \\n\\n\r\nSlime's best arc came in its first few episodes, and ended just as quickly. The show has steadily dipped in terms of quality since then. Perhaps due in great part, to its lack of well written characters.\\n\\n\r\nRimuru Tempest starts off to me as a pretty good character, even considering that he is exceptionally overpowered. His moments prior to reincarnation as a slime monster highlight the person he is: cynical, somewhat on a high horse and very goal centred; but still deeply loyal and selfless in the end. I was happy with how many layers they added to Rimuru and to a large degree, Rimuru is still a great positive even throughout the show at its lowest points (as in, the time I'm writing this review). His actions and line of thought stay true to the person he is and though he has VERY LITTLE character growth, that element of characterisation is presented very well by the writers. So you have Rimuru with all its flaws and strengths (personality wise), ensuring that this genderless slime is at very least, never a bland slime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series' supporting characters are the ones that hurt the show greatly. There's literally nobody of worth except for Shizue Izawa, who has an extremely interesting backstory and character arc. Her involvement in the show marks the best part of the series, as her dynamic with Rimuru is a powerful one\u2014that continues to define the series to this very moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe twist in their relationship is especially profound and dare I say, heartbreaking. Such poetic undertones would complement Slime's overall carefree nature very well...add a layer of depth to its happy go lucky gait. Too bad Slime never introduces more ideas like this.\\n\\n\r\nRimuru's inner circle is filled with the typical trope characters. Blunted yandere, deredere, loli, male kuuderes...you get my point. Characters have no real role but to function as plot devices: they're inserted in such a way that it is IMPOSSIBLE to imagine any of them getting any development at all. Every character you're introduced to ends up being mostly irrelevant, used sparingly after their 10 minutes of fame per season card expires. Except Milim Nava, who just gets showtime EXCLUSIVELY for fan service.And when I say that, you can probably surmise that there's nothing going for this show as of now in the character department. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact the words shallow and half assed come quickly to mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art in this show were major strengths at the start of the series. I think many of the initial fights were handled well, from hand to hand combat to the magic battles. I'm also still fond of the character designs here and the colours used, especially in battle. There's some vibrant stuff here. Sad to say that the quality of the animation has...dipped slightly from the explosive start. So you don't have anything really on the level of those first ten episodes, especially since we're in a very much slower arc right now. So as a whole, I could still say that it's pretty decently animated and good to look at. Nothing much to expect here in terms of visual storytelling or cinematography though: expect a lack of depth comparable to Sword Art Online's art here (although some of those Aincrad shots had GREAT cinematography BUT BACK TO POINT).\\n\\n\r\nShow has two great OP and endings, but nothing too great in way of the OST. Voice acting tends to be solid, especially from Rimuru. But in comparison to the other shows that have come out this season, it's clear to see that this show really cannot compete in this category.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this show is enjoyable for some amount of time, but I got quickly tired of it. Would I recommend it? Probably not, I've enjoyed other isekai more and I'm not particularly sure that Slime brought anything new or interesting for ME to the table. However, there are SOME really fun parts in this show that may lead to it being enjoyed. I don't know, that's up to you.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish that this show could have kept strong to most of what it started with.\\n",

            "content": "Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken Review.\r\nI haven't watched allot of isekai animes, mainly because the ones i have watched mostly bored me. i find the genre to be the same story repackaged in different formats, there is often a person wich gets teleported to another world and becomes overpowered and gets a bunch of girls. Now a overpowered character can be funn but seeing it over and over again in the same medival setting gets boring fast. If there was a show wich did something funn with this consept i would gladly watch it. This is where That Time I Got Reincarnated as aSlime comes into the picture. It does something new and interesting with the consept of being overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nSo far the story focuses on a guy living a lonely life, then getting stabbed and getting transported or (Reincarnated) to another world as a slime, im not going into detail so i am just going to say that a Big evil threat apeared and this man/slime now called rimuru tempest is the only one who can stop it! What i will say is what sets this show apart from other shows with overpowered main cahracters. It is how our main character chooses to use his powers, the plot progresses allitlebit like a videogame. think of Civilisation5. Our main character meets different monsters and recruits them to be his fellow comrades, you see them getting stronger and stronger for each episode passing. I found this to be very funn to watch, you see how this small party of people become a little Village.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:5\\n\r\nThe artstyle is fine and the animation is fine nothing really impressed me but i still cant say its bad. there are moments of cool well done animation and the character designs are fine aswell, some of the cgi looks really bad and some of the cgi looks good. This really just has to do with personal taste so i am just going to say that overall its allright.\\n\\n\r\nSound and music:7 \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually allright, the songs fit very well to the scenes they where playing over. Now the sound design is very good, the sound of an orc punshing a lizardman in the back of the head might be a bit higher than in real life but very satisfying. \\n\r\nThe opening and ending are funn and has a good amount of worldbuilding aswell. Overall its good, i like it and when i think of the series i can hear the soundtrack aswell as the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:4\\n\r\nThe characters are possibly the most important aspect of a show in MY humble opinion. The show has very simplistic characters wich isnt a bad thing. The monsters our main characters have become friends with all have their own little arcs some more satisfying than others. most of the characters are just funn to watch, and honestly thats ok for a show wich doesent take itself to serious although there are a few characters wich begin to annoy me. i would like to see more development for the characters in the future and i think the show will make that happen. our main character has many unanswered questions about the world and himself. The story steadily progresses forwards to answer those questions so far and i hope it will continue to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nI am happy i started watching this show. If you are interested in watching it i recommend you do, it is probably the best isekai i have watched although the characters arent perfect there hasnt really been any big tension or gutrenching drama so far i enjoy every episode and look forwards to the next one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\r\nI find the show to be funn and well made, it is better than most isekais and knows what it is. And remember i am only a guy saying my opinion.\\n\r\nSorry for bad English and grammatical errors :) \\n",

            "content": "This is the first time I write a review, but I enjoyed the anime a lot (even though it was just the first 6 episodes)\r\n(spoiler free)\r\nStory (10) -\r\nI have to admit I dropped the manga at chapter one a year ago since the exaggerated and unrealistic storytelling was a bit obnoxious, but now I see how I was wrong. While the events that take place in the beginning (the human world) feel more like a sit-com, it contributed well to the main isekai storyline. That's because you feel a sense of detachment from the real-world characters and their feelings as the anime itself doesn't takethem seriously. That aside, the story is more easy-going. There are some out-of-the-box ideas here and there, as well. The storytelling is simple but does its job really well, and that's how it should always be (especially since the story isn't complex).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9) - \\n\r\nWe can all agree that the main character, Rimuru, is pretty damn OP. But the anime handles it well as his knowledge of the otherworld's rules are very vague and nonexistent, creating an obstacle for our MC. Luckily, the anime also introduces a possible \"antagonist\" that is yet to make a proper appearance. So far there isn't a proper one as the characters have just been fully introduced.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) - \\n\r\nIt's easy to tell that a lot of care has been put into the art and animation. The backgrounds set a fitting mood for the story. The animation is smooth and doesn't use CG that often (thank god). The art style does have some flaws (in my opinion) but they're very minor. Overall, the colors are bright and the animation isn't lazy, what more do you need?\\n\\n\r\nSound (9) -\\n\r\nI will admit that I haven't focused on the OST. The OP is good and catchy but doesn't stand out that much. Nevertheless, it's not bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) -\\n\r\nI really have to give it to the author and producer because this show is possibly the most entertaining one this season. It's not complex or filled with edge or gore. There is some fanservice, but it doesn't get in the way of the main events\u2013 in fact, it contributes positively to the comedic side of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10) -\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, this is quite possibly the most entertaining show I've watched this season (and maybe my favorite). It keeps things simple and not many factors contrast others. Yes, it's an isekai, but it's a gem compared to others in the genre (*cough* How Not to Summon a Demon Lord *cough*) speaking of which, this show does everything better than \"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord.\" Hopefully, this helped",

Story wise it got better and better as it went long, and also I think one thing so many studios even big ones get in trouble is that constant animation but studio 8bit really nailed it in the animation department. Many people do no know but studio 8bit is a small studio but that does not stops them from giving us the quality animation.\r\nThe main character is also likable even thoughhe is in a isekai anime, I say that because because many isekai protagonists are just plain bad and boring but that is not the case here. Even though the name alone makes you believe that its gonna be a echi/harem series but I was stunned to find its more story driven and action packed series, which was of course a pleasant surprise. And I have to say it below my expectations but there are some problems which needs to addressed as well, the those problems are the secondary characters, because side characters do not get the enough time to shine or progress and mind I remind you there are a lots of sides characters, I mean a lots of.\\n\\n\r\nI hope the side character dilemma will be resolved in second season now that its has been announced, other than that its a fun series.",

            "content": "Great first half, disappointing latter half.\r\nWhen the otaku mc who had no girlfriend and questionable content in his PC died by the stab of a passerby robber, I thought this was going to be a parody. Turns out it is not. I have always disliked stories where mc dies and gets reincarnated again because the significance of death is lost from that moment. This makes any life threatening situations meaningless - why would you care about someone's death if they might just get reincarnated again? But surprisingly, the story hooks you on despite the cliched start because the struggle of the characters is not merelyto survive, but to build a country where everyone exists peacefully via diplomacy and talk.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character changes his personality by about 180 degrees once he becomes a slime. He is no longer brooding over his past, no regrets in his previous life and becomes a very cheerful character. But that is for the best because his cheerful mood and how he takes most of the things lightly makes the show enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are many problems that become evident as the story goes on. The characters of this show come off as very superficial. There is a character that serves as the main motivation for the actions of Rimuru. This character gets the most development in the story so far. Rimuru lacks any backstory or personal developments to make him interesting. There is nothing really special about any other characters. The character interactions are interesting but very predictable. They are directly taken from your typical RPG setting with stiff roles. Most of the characters lose all relevence soon after they are introduced. \\n\\n\r\nSomehow all the female monsters in this series end up becoming very cute (even if they aren't initially when they are introduced) - it is as if the anime thinks that we can't like them if they look different. There is also some fanservice thrown around for good measure. Whether that is good or bad is upto the viewers and how they like their anime. But there is no forced romance or harem elements allowing this to be one of the better isekai out there.\\n\\n\r\n**Spoilers from here onwards**\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the season introduces the world Rimuru is in and gives an idea about the various species, their kingdoms and the relationships between them. The Orc Lord story is honestly well done. It tells how some demon lords manipulate entire races for their personal gains. This is what made the show interesting. But once the second half of the season starts, it feels more like filler.\\n\r\n There is Milim - far stronger than Rimuru, but immediately becomes his ally because he gave her some honey and tasty food?! She is in there for so long and has never tasted honey before? It would work as comedy but when her friendship with Rimuru has far reaching consequences for the main plot, it just looks bad. Also how come no other demon lords, known for evil haven't manipulated her till now?\\n\r\n There is the half dragon thing originated from Veldora - only accounting for an unnecessary fight just to show how strong Milim is. But soon after we go to another arc where Milim is not relevent anymore. So till she or the demon lord of animal kingdom become relevent again, it only feels like pointless filler. They could have interchanged these arcs for better continuity.\\n\r\n There is the sky dragon which appeared from nowhere and was defeated even faster than it appeared. All the fights Rimuru was involved till then had some foreshadowing or preparations behind the curtain. This however feels like a disconnected event entirely there for the merchant to like Rimuru.\\n\\n\r\n**Spoilers End Here**\\n\\n\r\n The ending for the season skips some plot points and instead includes a flashback styled AMV and uses two episodes for content that should have been OVA's. The last episode is another recap episode when we already got a recap in 23rd episode. They should have used that episode for better adaptation of main story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation most of the time is good looking and action scenes are great. But sometimes they start using CGI and it really looks bad. The CGI score I would give is a 5/10, barely serviceable. (For reference, 10 would be ufotable or production IG's CGI and 1 would be the berserk CGI)\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few memorable ost's, but most of them do not stand out. The openings and endings were good enough that I didn't skip them.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is an above average adaptation. The pacing was great till 8th episode. But the adaptation is slightly rushed beyond that point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I still find it enjoyable to watch despite the obvious shortcomings. There seems to be a good underlying plot that the author has just started. Season 2 has been announced and it should be better because of all the setups in this season. It is similar to Overlord in many aspects, but far better than watching an emotionless mc slowly and inevitably take over the world.\\n\r\nOverall 6.5/10",

            "content": "Edit: I have completed watching this anime and stand by the points made. In fact, it feels like the points have just been reinforced more. The 'ending' is not concise in any way and the final episode is a terrible recap with 90% of the episode being recycled footage. Don't watch it. You won't miss anything notable.\r\nIf you're looking for an Isekai that doesn't get too deep into plot and story, and goes through plot events like its crossing out items in a shopping list, you will probably enjoy this. I'm not an Isekai connoisseur, but I've seen and read many isekai novels that havegotten me more invested into the world and its characters. To me, Slime was a shallow anime and became something I endured through. Here are my issues with it:\\n\\n\r\n- My biggest issue: EVERYTHING IS RESOLVED TOO EASILY. Not just fights, but political workings as well. As someone else has mentioned, our MC takes this Jesus attitude with everything, and characters always end up going 'oh okay, lets all be nice to each other and sing Kumbaya'. Even in Overlord, where the MC is OP beyond belief, undergoes several layers of steps with nuance to his actions, with planning to achieve his goal. Here, MC steps in at the big boss moment, uses his op ability, goes 'I'll forgive you and let's all be nice to each other' and the evil person suddenly has a change of heart and turns lawful good. Are you serious?\\n\\n\r\n- No character attachment: The mysterious character we saw in the first episode that was the prelude to the anime? She barely gets screentime. You don't ever feel attached to her, even though the anime tries to get you to care. The rest is the same. The anime tries so hard to give the characters meaning, but then they are tossed aside and thrown into a cookie cutter personality and you're left wondering why you cared in the first place. The Dragon in the first few episodes was getting somewhere but nope they RUINED that too.\\n\\n\r\n- The 'villains' or 'bosses' are boring. You don't feel any threat from them. It's not even because MC is OP. Later in the anime, a \"calamity tier\" monster is awakened and has the same level of destruction as a demon lord. It is shown and there's nothing for you to do but scoff. It looks ridiculous and the least the anime could do was give a sense of urgency as it rampaged towards its destination leaving a trail of destruction, but nope. It harmlessly glides above a forest and all it takes is ONE EPISODE. CALAMITY TIER by the way -- same level as a DEMON LORD. You might say, oh it's probably because our Slime is so powerful, but that's not the case. A demon lord was the one who dealt with it. Epic fight of evenly matched enemies? Nope. Development of urgency leading up to a climactic endscene? You wish.\\n\\n\r\nI could rant more about how most characters lack charisma (including MC), the story isn't engaging, and all the other frustrating aspects of this disappointing anime, but at least the art was nice, and the sounds were decent. But as someone who has enjoyed several shows and novels that detail how the characters take careful and deliberate steps of figuring out the world and overcoming problems, the shallowness of this anime really let me down.",

This anime is super adorable,  and sometimes something simple and lighthearted can be just what the doctor ordered.   Achieving an 8.6 on the 5 point rating system, That Time I Got Reincarnated As a Slime oozes up to a final score of [9/10]\r\n             The story TenSura offers is pretty grand.   It beginswith the main character losing his life AND his physical humanity as he begins his existence anew as a gelatinous optimist in a fantasy type world.   In this anime, you will not find a pointy haired protagonist overcoming mountainous adversities, but YOU WILL be taken a comedy filled adventure sporting an underlying theme of \"broaden your horizons and expand your world\".  However, as adorable and funny as TenSura was, it does use misdirection a little to often, to the point it becomes a little to predictable.   All its flaws aside, this little slime squeaks out a 8/10 for story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n              The art was great,  nothing ground breaking,  but the landscapes are diverse and plenty, and there are a ton of different characters and animations.   So while I am tempted to call it average,  the diversity inside TenSura keeps it funky and fresh.  Definitely not a  6 spaces recycled, or one room type show. [8/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\n                  The music and voice acting were very good for this show.  From the opening and ending themes, to the little jingles in the middle, I was really sold on this experience.  [8/10]  \\n\\n\\n\r\n               AHHHHHHHH,  I just love all the little characters in this show, and there are SO MANY!.   Remuru Tempest is your modern typical over powered protagonist, but so comically written.   Sometimes,  the greatness of the comedic timing each of these characters offer,  makes TenSura feel like a parody Anime.  They all have earned a special place in my memory,  and their dialogue earns the character category an [9/10].\\n\\n\\n\r\n                \"There is no way you can enjoy an anime about an overpowered tier one video game monster\" ,  -  Preconceived Notions.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Well I just kicked that sentiment square in the gooch,  cause my \"would be\" ninja self just roundhouse delivered a serious [10/10] for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n                      That time I got reincarnated as a slime  may not be the most powerful mind blowing experience of your  anime watching career,  but its hilarious, adorable, and well worth worth the watch.    - Grizzziff Kingsbeard  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I often try to avoid dropping animes, especially when I am fairly far in, however with Slime I was very tempted to - it was a drag to watch. In my previous Slime review, I stated that I thought the anime was getting better - how wrong I was. Finishing it this season was a drag, and I certainly won\u2019t be picking up season 2.\r\nIt\u2019s surprising to see the positive reception that the anime has received on My Anime List. Usually, I\u2019m a fan of isekais, however slime was simply boring to watch. I\u2019ll explain why below.\r\nStory & Characters\r\n----\r\nThis is one of the more disappointingaspects of the anime - to put it bluntly, the story is simply an overpowered slime running around, making friends and killing things that it can\u2019t make friends with.\\n\\n\r\nA slightly extended version is this - a man gets stabbed in the streets of Japan (the anime makes sure that you know they are a virgin), and when he dies, he essentially gets reincarnated as a slime in a different world. And then the above applies - he simply runs around, kills things that are against him and inherits their power, and makes friends with every single thing he comes into contact with. The slime has never been defeated - it manages to win every, single, battle, making the anime repetitive and frankly boring. Oh, and don\u2019t forget, he died a virgin.\\n\\n\r\nPacing is terrible - no character development is done, no world building is done, it simply changes from one arc to another. Every fight scene is over quickly, due to the slimes overpowered nature, with him moving away with a bored expression, after consuming the opponent to gain even more power. Here is how a fight goes - enemy appears, slime plays around with them for a few dozen seconds, then the slime wins. Imagine that, 20 times. Then, the arc is suddenly over, with an anti-climatic ending. And off goes the slime, to find another opponent that will supposedly \u2018won\u2019t be easy\u2019, and then is thrashed in a short space of a minute. Thus, there is no tension - in a battle, you know who is going to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime introduces the female characters like so - here is fanservice character #1, fanservice character #2, and so on. And don\u2019t forget, they have big boobs. The male characters are barely introduced - after all, why focus on them when you can focus on boobs? Remove all the characters of the anime apart from the slime, and little would change - they are that flat and undeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nMilim, a \u20182000 year old\u2019 girl who looks about 12, running around in a skimpy bikini, is portrayed as one of the most powerful beings in the planet. Oh, but she was \u2018defeated\u2019 with a spoon of honey, to which the slimes followers exclaimed praise that it was \u2018A feat which only Rimuru-san can accomplish\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last arc, that was rushed to, the characters were simply glossed over; I found that I knew very little of the personality of the characters. They had no personality at all, being given one trait, and having it left at that. The author has a very short attention span, simply skipping to another arc when they fancy, leaving character and world development in the dust behind them. The slime decides to ditch his civilization to go help some random kids, resolving the conflict separately from the characters, thus making him useless - any old person could have solved it. But hey, this gives the author an opportunity to run off to some other undeveloped location with undeveloped characters and try to rub the \u2018importance\u2019 of the slime in everyones face.\\n\\n\r\nAs said, I\u2019m usually a fan of isekais, but the dead, undeveloped and repetitive storyline of this one simply killed it for me. Shallow writing makes this one of the worst stories in any show I\u2019ve watched.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nTo give the anime it\u2019s credit, the animation is fine. There have been some oddities, particularly regarding running scenes with the wolf, however I certainly can\u2019t complain about the animation. However, I\u2019ve seen much, much, worse (I\u2019m looking at you Berserk 2016).\\n\\n\r\nRanga, whilst shallowly developed, was at least enjoyable in a few scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI did find that after the first episode, where the art was incredibly detailed in all areas, it did go from great to fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nThis was okay - I like the outro song, despite it being rather forgettable. However throughout the anime I found that certain parts of music did not fit the scenes at all. It wasn\u2019t something that blew me away, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as the storyline of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nYou may think that I\u2019m being a little harsh - I\u2019m not. Why did I finish this? Because I like completing what I start. If it wasn\u2019t for the decent animation, the anime would have been even more of a struggle to watch. I would not have been able to finish it without the weekly spacing.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why the rating? The storyline. To summarize, it was undeveloped, flat, and simply boring to watch. Characters had no personality, the world was unexplained, and the author rushed to different arcs every episode essentially, leaving the previous one ending rapidly and badly. The slime was overpowered, simply destroying everything that came against it, or more often the case, making a friend of everything that was unlucky enough to encounter it.\\n\\n\r\nOh, as a side note, the last episode of season 1 is just a recap of the terrible season, with a demon and the dragon talking to each other. Waste of time watching.\\n\\n\r\nGive That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime a pass. It\u2019s not worth your time to watch, and you\u2019ll probably regret it as you suffer through more episodes.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Give this a hard pass. A shallow and undeveloped storyline only supported by decent animation.",

Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.\r\nThe series started off promising enough, but quickly developed into a boring mess. The cause is twofold - once, the main character is incredibly overpowered to the point where nothing is a real threat. None of the battles in the series feel important or in any way exciting.\r\nSecondly, the way the series develops, almost every faction or individual becomes an ally of the main character slime with laughable ease. It's not a very interesting development and tookaway a large piece of my enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself seems muddled. What is it about, really? The slime itself does not seem to have particular goals. And while there is a particular goal he pursues in the second half, it's mostly to help someone he knew. He is not as self-motivated like I had hoped.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and soundtrack are average and ultimately forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I still felt compelled to follow it to the end and see where it went, but that is more because I wanted something to watch and enjoy isekai in general, not because the series is that good. It was enjoyable enough to watch and not drop it, but that's about it.",

            "content": "The anime that I like has been getting a lot of shit it seems, so I will be the one to take the role of praising the show. \r\nThis review will contain events that happen in the anime, I recommend watching the show before continuing reading it.\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is about an overpowered slime that builds their own town, and hardships it encounters on the way. \r\nThe most distinct feature about this anime is how it is able to keep its lightness while still touching on the serious topics, unlike most shows Slime is almost not edgy at all and always goes onwith being a chill anime. With some of the best cryptic foreshadowing, it managed to make me keep on watching even though it was the third time I was experiencing the same things happen.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Slime with its gorgeous animation keeps your attention on the screen, and unlike most anime, this one has great background arts. Constantly switching between styles to define Magic, Potions, etc. makes up for a pleasant experience on its own.\\n\\n\r\nWith some of the best characters, I have witnessed in a while, it made the show very enjoyable. Many people tend, for some reason unknown to me, hate Rimuru, and most side characters. The protagonist is a very refreshing character that constantly tries to solve everything by peace and no fighting, it is not like he won\u2019t win if he will fight, but he is trying to solve by peace. Him receiving help from The Great Sage also results in Rimuru essentially possessing 2 distinct points of view. Some of the side characters also possess fun personalities, and watching them interact is also one of the things which makes the Slime the anime fun.\\n\\n\r\nGreat Sage has a very big role in explaining the world that the protagonist transported. In contrast to many different isekais or any anime, which has anything that contradicts the physics of the world we live in, slime anime uses Great Sage to detail the details of the world that the protagonist is in, unlike most anime which doesn't expand on the topic and only poorly explains it or expects you to understand what is the rules of the world as it progresses.\\n\\n\r\nI will have to admit that the series becomes very tedious for an arc, the Charybdis arc, but later it redeems itself, it is tolerable comparing the enjoyment you will get after the arc.\\n\\n\r\nHaving read the LN I could easily state that the story only gets better as it advances. Having the second season already announced it is reassuring that we will be able to see what occurs to this lovely slime and his town. Already knowing the story, I would predict If the show right now is a solid 7 the second season would probably end up being a strong 8. \\n",

            "content": "Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken or That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is one of the newest isekai anime with the twist being that the main character Satoru Mikami gets reincarnated as a slime in another world with a bunch of pretty overpowered abilities. Does the anime have more to offer than just an original take on the isekai genre though?\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story of the anime is quite simple. Satoru Mikami gets reincarnated as a slime in another world and while he is exploring the power of his abilities over the course of a few months, he meets the storm dragon Veldora whowas trapped in a cave by 'the Hero'. While befriending this tsundere dragon, Satoru Mikami gets his new name Rimuru Tempest, while Veldora gets the name Veldora Tempest. Rimuru tries to find a way to break the seal which traps Veldora. As Rimuru does not know how to break the seal he absorbs Veldora in order for him to find a way to break the seal from the outside and Veldora from the inside. After his encounter with Veldora, Rimuru travels outside the cave and stumbles upon a goblin village in which he is praised through his power and quickly becomes the leader of the village. After this he expands the village and lets all kinds of monsters cooperate in the village and live together, which eventually results in him creating his own country. Many events in the anime revolves around certain situations which happen in and around the country Rimuru has created. There are several conflicts within their country, several wars with other tribes of monsters and diplomatic missions with other countries. Rimuru often tries to be diplomatic with everyone, creating many allies in the process. However, it does not always work out for him, which is when he shows his powers and fights in wars against his enemies. Overall, the story of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is quite simple, but has some interesting aspects in worldbuilding and developing a country, which is quite enjoyable to see unfold.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the anime is pretty good. In the first episodes some more experimental animation is used, but after those episodes the animation is pretty basic, but still looking quite good. The character designs are overall very unique and the anime offers a variety of different characters through all the different species the anime has. A downside to the animation is the use of bad CGI for some of the monsters in several battle scenes. Luckily, this does not occur too often. Overall, the art and animation of the anime are pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is very good and fitting with its themes. There are plenty of soundtracks used for the comedic, dramatic and the several action scenes throughout the anime. These soundtracks can really set the mood well for the big fight scenes, some more mysterious scenes and are used to make some of the moments more heartfelt. The opening themes are also very good and add very well to the anime. Lastly, the voice actors do a very good job expressing the different emotions of the characters. Overall, the sound used in the anime is very good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a slime has a very large cast. This gives room for a variety of different characters with different motives and character traits. Rimuru Tempest himself has a pretty straightforward character, as he wants to create a better world where different species of monsters and humans can happily live together. Aside from that he seems to just be enjoying his time in another world very much. He is a simple character overall, but can be pretty likeable. Aside from Rimuru, there is Veldora, the tsundere dragon, Ranga, Rimuru\u2019s loyal wolf and leader of the wolf clan as well as several goblins in the goblin village like Gobta and a whole lot more of characters from races like orcs, lizardmen, dryads, humans as well as characters who are demon lords. A downside with the characters is that although many can be likeable and have different character traits, there is very little character development and the characters can be a bit stereotypical at times. However, the characters are pretty good overall. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching the anime. It has got some pretty good action scenes and some very fun character interactions. There\u2019s also a lot of worldbuilding and it is very interesting to see the country which Rimuru has created develop. The characters can also be very likeable, even though they are a bit one dimensional at times and there are plenty of fun comedic moments throughout the anime. Overall, my enjoyment was very good. \\n\\n\r\nBonus Categories: 8/10\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nAction: 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime has got plenty of action scenes. From great wars between a lot of monsters and people to individual battle scenes between Rimuru and a strong opponent. Even though Rimuru is very strong with his abilities he cannot defeat every one of his opponents very easily and often needs to find creative ways to beat his opponents. The action scenes are overall very fun to watch and can be pretty interesting to see unfold.\\n\\n\r\nWorldbuilding: 8/10\\n\r\nA majority of the anime focusses on worldbuilding and developing the country which Rimuru has created. You can see the several ways in which Rimuru gains more allies and makes trade agreements and diplomatic relationships with other countries. You can also see the way in which the technology through the country slowly evolves, how the building quality improves and how the town gets bigger and bigger with multiple species inhabiting the country. Several other countries are also shown on occasion and explanations are given for how some humans are summoned to their world as well as well as some information about how the magic works. Overall, I think they handled the worldbuilding aspect very well. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (7,5/10)\\n\r\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a slime was a very good and enjoyable anime to watch. It has a simple story to tell with a lot of very good world building. It has a very large cast of characters with unique character aspects, which although sometimes a bit one dimensional, can be very  likeable. It has pretty good animation with a very good soundtrack fitting the anime and it has plenty of action and comedic scenes throughout the anime. It definitely is a unique take on the isekai genre, executed well. Hopefully season 2 will continue this trend and improve upon the somewhat more weaker aspects of the anime, like the lack of a lot of character development.\\n",

            "content": "'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime' is a mess\r\n It goes without saying that Isekai has been dominating the Japanese anime scene for quite some time now. It feels like just yesterday that Sword Art Online set the genre aflame kindling what I like to call the 'New Isekai' fan. \r\n Now if you aren't familiar with the term, Isekai, it simply means 'otherworld'. This is secluded to and it seems quite limited to, (at least now) characters being thrust into such a world without their consent, (unlike something like Hack Sign). Having to discover things and literally start a new life -it seems ingenious really. Throw a character into a new world giving them the same perspective as the viewer, lets discover things together, what could go wrong? Many things, however, many things according to the sub-genres of the Isekai(s) in question. \\n\\n\r\nExamples being Hack Sign, Overlord (which is being rushed beyond belief) and as dubiously mentioned in retrospect, Sword Art Online. You might be wondering why I'm bringing these Game-Isekai up. If you haven't forgotten yet, Slime is a Game Isekai and it's been fooling you by pretending it's not this whole time. This recurring theme of being trapped in a Game-World and having to deal with it forever, or, being stuck in a Game-World and the only way out is to beat the game. The plots are usually all the same, one of these two, Slime is just another copycat. Slime reminds me of Konosuba in a way; it's a Game-World but the tone is nothing like a Game-World anime and God forbid it reminds you of it's rehash. It doesn't want to remind you. It is literally in denial of it's own genre.\\n\\n\r\n I have a major issue with Rimuru Tempest, the main character of the show. He is powerscaled according to the plot and the plot revolves around his powerscaling. When a new set of characters are introduced they are instantly scaled, evaluated and elevated in status by being scaled by Rimuru. (The latter term being literal - powered up to a point and/or re-scaled.) When you instance more characters into your story they shouldn't be 'renewed' straight away - they need time to develop.\\n\r\n If you aren't familiar with what I'm talking about let me go into it according to the show's logic. Rimuru meets some characters, they have no names, names mean power. When these creatures are named (by Rimuru) they 'evolve' and their power increases very much. The guy thinks he's Adam essentially.\\n\r\n These characters weren't even 'characters' before being named, they weren't even background noise to the story. Giving something a name, especially the mickey-moused names he gives them, doesn't make them 'special characters' regardless of this universe's supposed word-physics. It's tantamount to me naming my cat, it gives it some meaning but it doesn't and shouldn't define it's personality or how strong it is. Yes I named my cat 007, now he has evolved and he wields a pistol with a silencer, drinks it shaken not stirred and has lustful relationships with the female cats in the neighborhood. Let's just call this for what it is, lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\n I have an overwhelming hate for Milim the Demon Lord. Have you seen DragonBall Z? If not I'm sure you've heard the names Goku, Gohan or Vegeta before. Let me talk about Vegeta for a minute. Vegeta is a character who's sole purpose is destruction and self-gain due to his environment and upbringing. However in the manga, (or anime, whichever you prefer) he makes the choice that the main villains are against. Indefinitely on Namek when he 'helps' keep the Dragonballs away from Freeza and his men because he wants them for himself. This is the turning point when Vegeta goes from being a villain to an anti-hero. Eventually turning into a hero later in the story.\\n\\n\r\n Anti-heroes are so important because they contrast the main character and quite literally write themselves based on the main characters' decisions. \\n\r\n Milim could've been Slime's anti-hero but it was all wasted on an encounter containing honey, because a 12 year-old looking Demon Lord who is 'supposedly' stronger then Rimuru can't fight him, that'd ruin the shounen power-trip this anime has turned into.\\n\\n\r\n It isn't farcical to say that Milim is a character that had no thought put into her besides her clothing, to which she hardly bares any.\\n\\n\r\n This over-hyped and drunken brigade of fans who would take a bullet for Fuse, the original story creator, are some of the most block-headed people I've ever encountered. Just because the source material is a novel doesn't make it great. Especially in this case, to say it isn't fleshed out (especially for being a novel) is an understatement. Ironically in a twist of fate the defenders of this show haven't consumed much of the anime medium to begin with, looking at some of their anime profiles on AniList and Myanimelist, I can see why. This isn't a show for veterans of the medium; we've seen this cookie-cutter shit a thousand times over. \\n\r\n 'That (one stupid time I got stabbed and) Got Reincarnated (into an overpowered-being in a dumb world that revolves around me and doesn't pose a challenge to me at all) Slime' is 20 weeks into it's 25 week airtime slot and I can't see it redeeming itself. Slime has it's metaphorical feet stuck in a mire of meta. \\n\r\n It currently sits at a laughable 8.45/10 on Myanimelist but we all know who's scoring it that high. Slime gets a solid 5.2/10 from me. It's fun but incredibly unoriginal, dull, equal to seeing anything by Micheal Bay, really. No brain function required.",

This makes for one-dimensional, predictable battles without any chance the build up real tension.\r\nCharacter personalities and relationships are not fledged out making it hard to get emotionally invested.\r\nIt doesn't feel like the story is being motivated in any interesting way.

Everything in this show is drawn out and made to take excessively long despite knowing the conclusion minutes before it happening.  The ogres for example... That just bored me to tears because the plot was so overwhelmingly predictable.\r\nIf the pace of this show was doubled and the filler removed it could be excellent, but when so many episodes are wasted on camp time and there isn't enough intelligent plot to keep theshow entertaining with the lack of combat, for example, the show just comes up feeling like something integral is missing.\\n\\n\r\nI thought surely with over an 8 average I would be dying to watch each episode, but as it is now, I wonder how slow and uneventful this next episode will be, and it usually is as bad or worse than I think.\\n\\n\r\nSome complain about a show moving too fast, I am complaining that this show moves too slow, is painfully obvious, and is just rather boring compared to the latent potential it showed within the first few episodes.  It's still only 10 episodes in, but so far I'm underwhelmed.  I look forward to the next episode of goblin slayer much more than this show, despite starting it later and it's early and rather distasteful shock value of the first episode.",

            "content": "Reincarnated as a Slime started with a bang, with awesome production quality and a great, humorous approach to the isekai tropes. It subverts many usual parts of the genre, nukes the obligatory harem angle with its genderless protagonist and simply has fun with the formula, rather than developing deep drama or even focusing heavily on action.\r\nThe thing is, while the show gradually evolves from dynamic adventure to a SoL story in another world, it doesn't do as good of a job making the latter part enjoyable. The protagonist is quite interesting, despite being ridiculously-indestructible (and later plain overpowered), but the supporting cast is just ok.With tons of characters circulating through the story, we don't learn very much about any of them and they're pretty much just background to protagonist's exploits. Thus, whenever we don't see the protagonist facing a new challenge, things get somewhat dull, and that's what most of the second half of the season consists of. It's humorous and still relatively fun, but in no way brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music are rather brilliant all the way through and I don't think I ever noticed the team behind it making noticeable shortcuts. Voices are good, but as I didn't find many characters memorable, they also couldn't help much. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, this is a lovely-produced and overall enjoyable series, but you have to be ready for it being more of a \"healing anime\" in isekai's skin than another Log Horizon, if you really want to enjoy it. I also think the pacing and character development in second half of the season were genuinely flawed - there was just not enough happening and too many things worked in protagonist's favour. A solid 8/10, but not a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Never thought I'd be defending the seasonal Isekai, but some of you dorks are savage - and unfairly so, in this case. \"That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime\" (or \"Slime Time Live\" for short) is by no means a perfect show, or a particularly deep piece of fiction, or necessarily the best at anything it does, but there are strong positives and touches of craft that I think are being glossed over.\r\nSlime Time Live is set-up as the typical Isekai power fantasy, where an audience stand in dies so he can be reincarnated into a magical land where his total loserdom is actuallya source of immense power (along with his literal immense power). I've seen a few criticisms of this show just stop at this description, as if that alone is damning, and I think that's the wrong way to approach this enterprise. To paraphrase Roger Ebert, \"A show is not about what it is about. It is about how it is about it.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd the how is the crucial thing, because Slime Time Live (at least in the beginning) uses the basic Isekai foundations and hits the beats well without taking itself too seriously. While the show dips its toes in the drama well (to admittedly so-so results), it generally keeps its tone light and even tongue-in-cheek. This is greatly communicated by the visuals. Not only is the animation consistently well-done (and well above par compared to most of its contemporaries), but Studio 8Bit continually includes great little visual touches and artstyle shifts. The studio's efforts reflect what seems to be genuine enthusiasm for the source material, and it really gives the whole production a big boost.\\n\\n\r\nAnother of the show's boons comes from its main character. Where a lot of these protagonists come off as vapid husks, Rimuru has enough personality to make him a decently compelling lead, and I think part of that comes from the smart decision to make him a decidedly older man (and not just deaging him either, a la Death March). His manager-like approach to problem solving whatever issue happens to be in front of him, and the way it attracts an increasing load of responsibilities like any real workplace, is a fun twist on the aimlessness often exhibited by Isekai protagonists. It's my understanding that Rimuru's VA is a relative newcomer to the industry, but she manages to infuse a lot of personality into the character through her performance. It's hopefully an auspicious start to a great career. \\n\\n\r\nSlime Time Live also benefits from its supporting cast. No one here is particularly deep or original, but the show puts in the work of developing the side characters enough to keep them from feeling one-note. Take a personal favorite, Gabiru. The incompetent blowhard is a well-worn character archetype, but I really appreciated the little touches (how his well-meaning yet sycophantic soldiers build up his ego across the arc, how he justifies his coup of the kingdom, how the strategy he employs against the orcs is actually sound and he is undone because no one informed him of their ability to assimilate the dead, etc.). None of this was necessary to tell the story, but there's still a level of thought that is just missing from most other seasonal Isekai cash-ins, and if we're being honest, a lot of other seasonal anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nNow, all this being said, the show is certainly strongest in its first cour. As Slime Time Live goes on and the plot starts to expand, its tongue-in-cheek sensibilities start to get a little drowned out under the escalating world-building and increasingly perfunctory threats. That's a fair issue to take umbrage with. However, I also think it would be unfair to say that the show's charm is lost entirely, or that the gradual regression to the genre mold completely counteracts the strengths of its first half. Heck, even as just another entry in the Isekai genre, Slime Time Live is still better crafted than most of the cheap, effortless, and disposable trash heaps that are its contemporaries.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if you want to see what a \"1\" looks like, go watch Death March. Or better yet, don't do that at all, and just take my word for it.\\n\\n\r\nI love dunking on trash, especially of the Isekai-variety, so it's not like I don't get  the appeal. However, I think there's also a zealousness to be the first to dunk, and to dunk the hardest, so much so that it can tempt us to not really contemplate the show right in front of us. Complaints about elements like, say, Ranga quickly getting over the death of his father at Rimuru's hands might have more merit in a self-serious dramatic series (like Overlord), but that's not what Slime Time Live is. Watching anime isn't a Space Jam; you shouldn't have to stretch so hard to get your dunks. It's a very easy way to miss out on the better qualities of what you're watching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Slime Time Live is a capably-executed entry in the Isekai genre and a perfectly enjoyable show on its own merits. If you don't have any fondness for this type of story, the show probably won't convince you, but it at least has enough personality and fun touches to give it some charm. Give it a watch; if you're not careful, you might just enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so ends my review, aka \"That Time I Wrote 1000 Words Defending A Show I Thought Was Just Fine.\"",

            "content": "LA was not expecting to like it but damn was LA surprised by Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken by the end of it.\r\nIsekai had flood of mediocre and lazy installments for anime from Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. to Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku and LA just started to get tired of the trend, but Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken was a fresh of breath air in a sense.\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken at the start starts off like your typical isekai overpowered main protagonist harem-like anime series just that this time the main protagonist turns into a slime before he goes intoanother world and he quickly learns overpowered abilities that make him feared, but him being a slime, a monster KNOWN to be a \"starter monster\" in RPG's, not many buy this. LA didn't like this as a premise not to mention slightly rushed especially with the transition of the main protagonist Satoru Mikami into another world into a slime and his quick gather of abilities making him an all powerful monster. But Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is definitely one fo those shows where you just have to carry on watching it and to this credit LA will say the first few episodes weren't a great first impression towards this series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not until Rimuru (Satoru's slime form name in his new world) starts making a small goblin village flourish and gaining new allies where the key to this anime truly lies. See Rimuru knows he can't go back to his world, his previous life was snuffed out, so he has no plans of going back so he might as well make the most of it in this new world, so with the good natured person he is, he helps the small goblin village from attacks from other monsters and from then on, gathers allies, monster and human alike. Thing is due to his good natured demeanor, Rimuru NEVER kills anyone and rather talks it out, he only \"eats\" them if he has no choice and the villain in question is causing more trouble than he's worth that he'll resort to extreme \"final move\" methods and with this he gain allies, from wolves, lizardmen, dwarves, fairies, demons and oni.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one other character of note and that is Rimuru's \"chosen\" one by the name of Shizue Izawa voiced bu Yumiri Hanamori, another person summoned into this world, but forced through a demon pact, Rimuru befriends her and later on passes her legacy onto Rimuru, giving Rimuru more motivation and something to strive for in this world than his own and two great things comes from entire ordeal.\\n\\n\r\nOne and the most obvious one being that Rimuru grows through his friendships and allies especially with Shizue as she was extremely important to Rimuru's growth as a character throughout the anime because of it and this extends onto any new ally he faces even if they are at first deterred by Rimuru, he let bygones by bygones and makes their place in Rimuru's flourishing village grow that much more as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and the more obvious one is that Shizue's inclusion added ALOT of world building to Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken's world, what does LA mean by that?, well though the anime mostly resides in the goblin village at first, Rimuru explores his new world, makes trade deals, recruits blacksmiths, architects, magic users to grow not only his village but the world building itself, like a two for one deal and how they implemented this was actually ingeniously done. Coming from an isekai, the main focus for the most part, the bland main male protagonist, Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken manages to work it's world building and it's character development all in one just by simply befriending them.\\n\\n\r\nNow the other part of the world building comes in with Shizue and how she was summoned into the world, which brings up new lore as the world Rimuru is in now are also inhabited by humans from his previous world, like this is a normal occurrence. Lastly would be the villains themselves and this ties it in as a demon summoned Shizue and one of Shizue's motivations was to find her master, now passed onto Rimuru wants to find Shizue's master, but it's not easy when the demons are one, powerful and two, send in monsters or plan up something that threatens Rimuru's village and his allies' territories.\\n\\n\r\nIf Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken was telling of a theme, it's showing the positive, befriending nature of Rimuru that is at the core of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken and sure it took time for this theme to be fleshed out in the anime but it was pretty solid by the end of the anime even with all the demon scheming and other important character backstories were going on at the time.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, LA's favourite characters form the anime (and there are ALOT of character to be honest) are, Millim Nava voiced by Rina Hidaka as a hyper genki and powerful demon lord but fancies Rimuru also she had some great comedic moments at that (though LA thought she was a filler only character for some reason but no she's canon!), Shino voiced by M.A.O an oni who is Rimuru's secretary and has an obvious crush on Rimuru and finally Gobuta voiced by Asuna Tomari, a pipsqueak of a goblin but has some crazy latent luck or he was naturally powerful (an obvious but good gag for this character and comes to a direct comparison to Rimuru in a ways of looking weak but is waay more powerful than they look) and Shizue gets a mention for being a pinnacle part of the anime and the turning point of when the anime got REALLY good.\\n\\n\r\n8Bit who did the animation actually did an amazing job with the animation, from the exotic character designs and some impressive battle animation. The character designs are just by default exotic with the variety of species Rimuru take sin and sometimes some changes to them with Rimuru's magic and whatnot and LA is some fo the few that actually liked the oni's change to be more human-like features. The battle animation was greatly done with each attack done with great impact helped by the sound direction and background work. 8Bit outdid themselves with the animation to be totally honest here though 8Bit had always had potential from their other anime works, this was just showing what they could really do and maybe more.\\n\\n\r\nVoice cast, well due to the large cast, LA will go with only the most notable ones, Miho Okusaki as Rimuru was great with an amazing range of cadence and really gave life to Rimuru and his likable personality, Rina Hidaka of course gets a mention as the destructive genki Millim, Yumiri Hanamori as Shizue was awesome, M.A.O and Sayaka Senbongi as Shion and Shuna was rather well done even as a pigeonholed role from both but still. Great cast what else?\\n\\n\r\nLA will say that Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken isn't without flaws, LA already mentioned the first few episodes were rushed and cliched of an isekai but there is another one and that is as much as LA LOVES the world building in this anime, Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken does tend to exposition ALOT using the Grand Sage voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi, but man there were episodes where it was exposition and not much else, yes it helps us the audience gets us in the know as well as setup and build up for the upcoming episodes but it did kill the pacing....\"rarely\" though.\\n\\n\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is one of those shows you just can't judge on the first episode, you NEED to watch the entire thing and your judgment and feelings towards this anime will change, it did for LA as LA thought LA was gonna see the typical overpowered harem isekai anime scthick all over again, but nope, we get a one part Rimuru wrecks a monstrosity that the demons made, one part wholesome anime about a slime who befriends and grows a NATION of monsters filled with character development from even some minor characters and great amount of world building to make this world both have that nostalgic RPG feel but also make the world alive and realized at the same time, yes the anime does get exposition heavy at times but that does not detract from what Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken has and had going for it and with it already announcing a second season, there is ALOT more potential that Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken can go and LA will be interested where it'll go in it's second season. Color LA surprised by this isekai installment. \\n\\n\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken maybe on normal mode, but man LA didn't think making a Civilization anime adaptation with a slime could be this much fun!",

            "content": "\u2018That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime\u2019 is simply put just an average isekai show - with nothing special to offer. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, it wasn\u2019t terrible, in fact I did enjoy moments throughout the show but in the end it didn\u2019t really leave an impact on me nor did I enjoy it all too well overall.\r\nThe main plot revolves around Rimuru: a middle-aged neet who ends up dying and in turn is given a \u2018second chance\u2019 at life in another world as a slime - a common trope within isekai shows. At the beginning of the show, Rimuru easily adapts tohis surroundings and his form as being a slime - he learns of his abilities and what is needed for him to grow stronger. His character is refreshing: he\u2019s a powerful & a strong slime who helps people with the power he gains & proves all those who doubt his strength wrong - it\u2019s fun and enticing for the audience. But, within the first arc or so his character started to become boring, everything started to become repetitive: his actions, dialogue, reactions etc. and it seemed like no actual character development happened throughout, he\u2019s the same slime as he was at the beginning stages of the show, it seemed like none of the events had affected him or built him up as a character in any way really. That\u2019s not necessarily a problem but it in turn makes Rimuru kind of boring to watch which affects the overall story - I mean he is the main character after all. Now, throughout the story we\u2019re introduced to several side characters: the goblins, Shizue, Verudora and so on; the side characters within the show, in all honesty, don\u2019t really add much to the story for me. They all fit the basic archetypes (e.g Millim, a half-naked loli who, of course, is 500+ years old & is a dragon) that we tend to see in most isekais\u2019 - it\u2019s nothing new. The fact that I cared more for a dragon that appeared in literally one episode compared to any of the other characters is kinda sad honestly; a character I actually liked within the show, Shizue, was introduced and somehow ended up as an \u2018important\u2019 character for Rimuru\u2019s \u2018development\u2019 despite not appearing for all that long, maybe I just misinterpreted things but I honestly don\u2019t see how she became an important character. It felt really forced like they just needed a character that\u2019ll be Rimuru\u2019s driving support & someone he thinks about for motivation or whatever - I liked her character so in my opinion it\u2019s kind of a waste to only see her for a while - I feel like they could\u2019ve done a lot more with her.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, it was average: the settings and character design wasn\u2019t anything too special and it wasn\u2019t really all too aesthetically pleasing but the action scenes flowed well visually and in turn made it more exciting and thrilling. The animation isn\u2019t something that is anything bad nor do I think it affected the show - it\u2019s the story & characters that I have problems with.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, to me, was an utter mess: some episodes had almost no progression while others just threw everything into your face leaving you unsatisfied and disappointed - especially some of the action episodes e.g episode 19. I enjoyed the beginning arc along with the orc arc but after that I became disinterested - I\u2019m just not a fan of messy progression. I do understand the show revolves around action and therefore requires a few episodes of \u2018down-time\u2019 before picking up the pace again but in all honesty it wasn\u2019t well executed: each slower episode of info-dumping felt more like fillers rather than setting up for what's to come while the action episodes started to become more and more repetitive. After a while the episodes just left a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design & sound track weren\u2019t anything all too special. I\u2019m not a big fan of the OP or the ED - I do think they\u2019re good songs and compliment the show well, but they\u2019re just not for me - and none of the OST really stood out to me at all. I\u2019m not an expert in sound design so I\u2019m not going to really comment on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was an OK experience - nothing more than average. It had fun moments but also messier moments too (which, for me, seemed to outweigh the good moments) and, to add to that, I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of any of the characters. It left me feeling unsatisfied and I just ended up feeling disappointed with the show - after all it has a lot of hype surrounding it and at the beginning it was an interesting concept. Would I recommend it? If you\u2019re an isekai fan go ahead and watch it: I feel like fans of isekai will enjoy this show a lot more than I did. But if you\u2019re not a fan of isekai, I don\u2019t really suggest this show as an \u2018ultimate go-to must watch\u2019, I think it\u2019s a show that you can avoid and you won\u2019t really be missing much by doing so.\\n\\n\r\nMy score: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n(to emphasise, since I know there are plentiful fans of this show: this is purely my opinion - feel free to disagree).",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest, the more I watched this show, the less I liked it. It definitely had me at the start; I liked the concept of an Isekai where the MC basically just nice guys his way to having his own kingdom, and the brisk pace made the show relatively easy to watch, but the father along I got into this show, more and more problems popped up that were too much of a distraction for me to really enjoy \"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime\" as a whole. \r\nStory is a 6 for me, and I think i'm being prettygenerous here if i'm going to be honest. The story is split into multiple separate arcs (which i'm guessing make up each of the various light novels) in which our protagonist Rimuru Tempest experiences troubles while adjusting to this new world he's been transported to. Like I said earlier, the pace is extremely quick, so by the time we get to the 4th episode, Rimuru has already become the leader of a village of goblins. I can see why so many people would get hooked by these early episodes, as a kind of turn your brain off easy to watch junk food anime. I actually had been enjoying it myself, and if the show had kept to this level during the duration of this show's airtime, but by the score i'm giving here it's pretty obvious that at least to me, it didn't. \\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the first cour, Rimuru meets another person who had been isekai'd into that world named Shizue Izawa, and for some reason, everything that had been previously going on just got dropped to focus on her, but only for two episodes for some reason. Rimuru apparently had been seing her in his dreams and thought they were \"destined to be together\" or something, but he literally knows nothing about her, until finding out her backstory via an episode long exposition dump, in which she subsequently dies. I seriously did not know what to take of this, with Rimuru for some reason absorbing her body being surrounded by characters we had just met and didn't know anything about crying like this was supposed to be some important landmark event. This event seriously dampened my excitement for the show, and it never really went back up to where it was before; with storylines being dropped just as quickly as they are picked up, resulting in a deflated, boring, power-creeping plot that has no clear path. This can be seen most clearly with the fight with the Charybdis, in which this monster, who was described as being able to destroy kingdoms, gets killed in one hit one episode after it had been brought up. This is when fast pacing becomes a detriment, not a positive.\\n\\n\r\nDon't know where to add this, but I forgot to mention just how jarring the ending was. 16 minutes into the 25th episode, with Rimuru heading back to his town of Rimuru(lol) after being gone for like 5 episodes, the song for the 1st OP begins playing and the rest of the episode just becomes a recap of what had happened so far. I was audibly shocked by this, and I couldn't stop laughing for a few minutes after this had happened.\\n\\n\r\nArt i'm giving a 7. The character designs are inoffensive enough, if a bit crazily sexualized, Rimuru is cute enough as an amorphous blob, and the background art is just the same bland characterless background art that's seen in every fantasy anime nowadays, but hey, at least they didn't use CG. The animation can be pretty good during action scenes, but the character animation is nothing to really write home about, and there are no scenes in particular that i'd really credit as \"amazingly animated\" , so overall it's just good but really nothing else-- well at least aside from the openings. those were pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm going to be honest, I don't remember any of the songs from this show. That's a bit of a shock for me, because I tend to pay a lot of attention to anime OSTs, usually really enjoying their sound palates and composition styles. It's not like I didn't like the OST, but nothing stood out to me at all, except for the aforementioned openings (I loved both of the openings, with the second OP tying for my favorite of the winter season alongside Dororo). So sound wise this is a relatively harmless show, with nothing that will really wow you, as well as nothing all that grating or unenjoyable. Besides the OPs. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is really the section that bothered  me the most, because to be blatantly honest, most characters don't really have that much. As much as I liked Shion and her design, we knew nothing about her besides the fact that she liked Rimuru and carried him around all over the place. The same can be said about basically all of Rimuru's groupies, and this is a huge problem as they are the characters we spend the most time with besides Rimuru himself. Besides that though, even if we were to learn more about these characters, they just get dropped like the stories get as Rimuru meets new people and travels to different places. Now, I 100 percent expect to see these characters again in the recently announced 2nd season, but that doesn't excuse how flimsy and 2 dimensional the characters are right now. Ranga is ok though. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWith how much I ragged on this show so far, it's not liked I HATED it or anything, but it was definitely extremely disappointing to see everything I liked about this show in the beginning kind of just unfold on itself. That being said, the show was an inoffensive enough watch that I was able to kind of just binge the show and forget about it not feeling like i'd wasted my time. i'll give my enjoyment a 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is a 6/10 for me, but you have to understand how I rate anime. The only kind of show i'll rate a 5/10 or under is either something i absolutely hate (Akashic Records, SAO, Kino's Journey remake), or something that is just so obviously bad I have to give it a low rating, no matter how much I enjoyed myself while watching it (Ousama game, Hajimete no Gal), so giving Slime a 6/10 really isn't saying much for this show. I know I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anybody, and if I were to grade it I would give it a failing grade, but it's just so middle of the road and forgettable by the end of it's 25 episode run that I didn't really feel anything by the time the credits showed up, except for confusion, and a lot of disappointment.",

It gives me genuine hope for humanity and what we can accomplish by working together as one. Rimuru earns every one of his followers not by sheer power alone, but by showing compassion towards those whom others wouldn't. He's powerful with magic sure, but he's nowhere near the strongest thing this world has to offer. \r\nHonestly this style of character and feel is very foreign in anime.  It makes megenuinely giddy seeing the different races getting along and past enemies making reparations and becoming friends. I still love dark and fast paced anime, but this take on Isekai is just so refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nI'll end by saying I know this show isn't for everyone. Its a slower paced show and Rimuru doesn't seem to have a clear goal, at least at the start. But I want everyone to at least give it a shot if it entices you. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

            "content": "\"I'm not a bad slime!\" The plot is very straight-forward and kept light-hearted. You could say it was dumbed down for the sake of pure entertainment. But there is something extremely beautiful about this simplicity. Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken has one appeal that you cannot find in other shounen anime. The drama here doesn't involve, dishonesty, betrayal, backstabbing, dirty tricks.. Yeah you heard me right. Problem1 appears, problem1 ends. Problem2 appears, problem2 ends. And it goes on and on that way without resolved case ever becoming an issue again. In a way that makes the characters unrealistically too good and the story, lacking somedepth. However that in itself makes the show very appealing. All of us are exhausted with work, school, everyday conflicts.. Why would we want to watch a stressful anime in our free time? There's not much relief from that. On the other hand, slime offers a beautiful world, a utopia, a peaceful universe that previously only exists in our imagination. A place where everyone understands and work together.. A TRUE BREAK from reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this has become a popular favourite is no surprise. It's rare to find an anime without overcomplicated drama that's dragged over the course of several episodes. Shitara Slime Datta Ken is a true dopamine rush with great subliminal message. \"CAN'T HUMANS LIVE PEACEFULLY JUST LIKE THIS?\". Overcoming our racial differences and darker past?\\n\\n\r\n.

I would put it next to LoGH, 90's Berserk and Overlord for greatest anime adaptions of all time.\r\nStory: \r\nThey didn't write it, they are adopting it and I absolutely adore it. Its innocence and complexity both go hand in hand so well. They could have turned it into harem trash early on and wasted everything but they didn't. You know it's a story about a MC who is actually trying to be a protagonistand he does a really good job at being a decent human being (that was irony). It's not a grimdark presentation or anything, but they do tackle hard truths and go over tough topics in a way that makes you feel bad and then gives you warm fuzzies. The writing is that amazing. I should give this a higher grade than 10 for writing because my god is it amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nUsually pretty good, but there are some sloppy, choppy battle scenes with less than perfect art. Everything else still looks really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt sounds amazing in general, with the battle sounds having actual impact and the clanging sounding like the real deal instead of two two hollow poles being slammed against each other [insert new Berserk reference here]. What I really want to address is their selection of voice actors for the Japanese version and how perfectly they fit into their roles. The MC is a perfect example of a lower/middle management desk worker who is uncomfortable with his job. It's almost getting comical now that his voice hasn't changed despite his obvious confidence in himself as the ruler of a kingdom. The rest of the actors/actresses are appropriately cast as well and they did a great job in general.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIt's why I'm watching the show. Go back to story, because it's a character story to understand why I love the MC so much. They nailed it on the head. The characters are understandable, grounded and realistic -- for a fantasy world involving dragons. The intrigue with them is never too deep, but the context around them is enough to give everyone at least a 2 or 3 dimensional character. Out of the dozens (literally) of characters introduced, no one has been the \"I'm bad because I'm bad\" character or the \"I'm super righteous because I'm good\" guy. We have back stories for every single minor character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nRead above. It's brilliant.",

            "content": "--Review may contain spoilers--\r\nMikami Satoru, your average businessman residing in Tokyo, Japan, gets stabbed and dies by a passing murderer. He gets reincarnated as a Slime in a parallel world. This Slime is not your average weak and lame Slime you'd find in every MMO game, but a Slime with special abilities and unique skills that make him overpowered. He meets Veldora, the Storm Dragon in a cave where he was reincarnated to, becomes friends with him and was named as \"Rimuru Tempest\".\r\nStory (9): This is undoubtedly the isekai series to set the bar for the upcoming isekai series out there. It all starts offwith a decent way of someone going into a parallel world, but from then on, the anime blew my mind. At first, I was a little skeptical of the anime title because it would just be a story of someone reincarnating as a Slime, A SLIME out of all things, how could that be any interesting? But fortunately, I gave it a try and now I just can't wait for the next episode to air. Despite being overpowered as hell, Rimuru just wants to co-exist with humans and monsters alike, even creating his own village which consists of different monster races. With some comedy every now and then, you would expect this to be one of the best animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): Art is simply beautiful. Nothing much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): The OP and ED are PERFECT. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): Like I said, despite Rimuru being overpowered as hell, he doesn't use his power to destroy everything in his path. Usually someone with this much power would just dominate the whole world but this anime is different and I love it. Every character is special in their own way and they're not textbook like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (9): I definitely hope that this anime would go on as it is. Would definitely be a shame if it were to start of so good and become bad later on.",

            "content": "Okay, I'm usually rarely the type to go blindly into series, but this one just popped up in recommended for Goblin Slayer. The synopsis seemed fun, even without romance, which I sometimes like depending on the mood. There have been shows before, shows with very similar premise, and that is even more exciting with the fact on-board - I am the type to search for shows that are similar to the ones I liked very much before, or at least in the way of what I'd like to see in a series I imagine interesting for myself.\r\nI started the first episodes and literally rushed itdown to 8 episodes. It has been ages since I saw such flowing story telling, visuals, fantasy THAT MADE SENSE and great communication among characters and the viewer. The visualization of the Rimiru's 'AI mind' is a lovely execution that appeals to me and lets you understand, receive, perceive the information even better, it does feel much more like-able as opposed if it was without such. It is the first show in a while that wasn't invoking a lot of obvious predictions in my mind - it only provoked theories that I wondered how and why would and could happen (especially seeing EDs/OPs), which would be cool to witness, but the action and the main character very well captures your attention not to bother with that! I love how the main character deals with the difficult decisions and how certain people, for example, the Conqueror of Flames, entrusts her life to the main character and her will is carried on. The main character, who appeared to have an uneventful life before, now has a life where he has an adventurous time, but still carries on the similar fate - to help, understand people. The fact that the main character has memories that can be applied to the current situations deepens the relation as well. The combat scenes and animation, in general, are very well done and presented, it is indeed slimeisfying watching a slime fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I hope is that this show does not fail on its way. The story will end eventually, everything will end eventually, but I wish the best of luck to the studio to execute it as well as those current episodes are airing. It definitely captivated me, and I do hope it continues to do so in the future!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10, with the right to change if any of the criteria are affected by the series further progress\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Keeping Rimiru in the form of Shizu definitely feels like something I look forward to seeing more often :>",

WTF?! WOW\r\nWhen I first watched the anime , I thought of this as weird, unusual way to tell a isekai/ Another world story.Like its really a Slime, we are talking about here on the first view and perspective. \r\nIt started a bit funnily and mysteriously , but after couple of episode, I grew fond and got hooked on the slime a.k.a Rimuru.\r\nOkay Rimuru has Over powered skill right from the start, especially after meeting the Dragon, but he really doesnt actall proud and mighty, neither trying to look cool or trying to abuse his power or neither some weird intent. I am like wow i am really starting to like this and before i knew i got hooked. \\n\r\nThe story has begun on the basis and elements of a MMO RPG , and boy i am Loving it! \\n\r\nWhen Rimuru came to the outside world from the cave, a whole lot of surprises awaited.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of races of monsters, Humans and different kind of beings we get introduced to like in a mmo rpg, But what makes it interesting is, how he is underestimated greatly since he is C'MON A FREAKING SLIME! but our boy (Sorry Slime) rimuru keeps us surprised and proving his abilities and imagination can knock us out our seats but also he can make us laugh with his hysterics.\\n\\n\r\nI love that kind of character development. He has good personality, loves to be serious and funny at the same time, his slimy expressions are so hysterical and enjoyable. He roams around acquires skills, he learns through a mysterious but amazing ability acquired through his afterlife choices., making allies and underlings, utilize his ability to the utmost. And you know the best part?? its just getting Started!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is beautifully balanced with good colors, detailed drawings and good animation perfectly made for a isekai scenario by 8 Bit studios.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, Takuma Terashima is performing the series' opening theme song \"Nameless story and for outro Miho karasawa/ True sings the ending theme song \"Another colony\".\\n\\n\r\nMany viewers are thinking that the main character will stay strongest forever. But gathering from the glimpses of other characters anime has shown us till now that's not the case at all. Soon the real story will begin and it will be get interesting and the story will keep on getting better i feel, 24 episodes is really worth to wait and watch how it unfolds. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the Best Anime's to watch this Fall season. I hope more viewers can watch and admire this great piece of work. Definitely Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of Isekai stuff, and, well, this anime is for me a tiny bit of enjoyment with a lot of frustration. I had read much the manga before watching the anime. (Oh, and btw I dropped watching anime around ep 15)\r\nWhere do the enjoyment comes from ? \r\nThe story in itself is quite good as an isekai, especially the quite original stuff with slime. Drawings are really good, and most animations are as well. However, soundtracks are awesome, with a lot of variations, and generally used at the right time. \r\nWhere do the frustration comes from ?\r\nFirst, MC is too overpowered,and other characters are existent and selfless. Usually I love overpowered MC, especially overpowered progression ones. So, what is the problem here ? There is no feeling of tension, the MC never overcomes something, it just instantly solves every problems appearing. It may had be fun, as in OnePunchMan for example, but it isn't fun, or maybe not funny enough for me to laugh. \\n\r\nSecond, the rhythm of the story is... Well, monotonic. Actually, there is no real rhythm. And I suppose this is what makes a big difference with the manga. When you read the manga, you choose the speed of the events, by reading slower or faster. Here you can't, so everything is way too slow, and you feel no difference between a casual meal and an \"epic\" fight. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it ? \\n\r\nThis anime is not so bad, it is just filled with a lot of useless and unpleasant moment. I would advise to either : \\n\r\n- Watch while doing something else (coding, cuddling with your cat ...) so you don't feel the monotony. \\n\r\n- Read the manga while listening to the OST of the anime\\n\\n\r\nPlease note : if it is your first \"isekai\" anime, you will probably just appreciate it, so watch it normally :)",

            "content": "Never in my life have I been so disappointed with an anime.\r\n[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nWhen I first started watching this anime, I thought it was great. The concept was awesome and the first episode had a pretty enthralling hook. I was sure that this would be an anime I would look back on with love and affection. The initial high of the first episode was great. But holy shit, it was a mad rush downhill from there.\r\nI have a few things with this anime that I would like to discuss, namely: Rimuru's potions, characters, enemies, pacing, plot and general repetition.\r\nFirst item on the list, Rimuru's potions.These potions are severely overused and essentially allow the main character's friends and comrades to rarely die or suffer any major consequences for fighting whatsoever. This gives every fight the feel that it doesn't really matter and removes any tension that you might feel during said fight. \\n\\n\r\nSecond item on the list, the characters. Some of the characters in this anime were well thought-out and deep. An example of this is Satoru Mikami, a character who is flawed, but who also has his strengths. Sadly, this is the end of the list of good characters that come to mind, as the remainder of them are shallow and seem to only serve the purpose of filling out the ranks. The creators of this anime seem to have focused on quantity rather than quality, constantly introducing multiple characters at a single time and not bothering to give them any depth. Looking at them now, more than 65% of the characters could have been completely cut from the show without any adverse effects whatsoever. The lack of strong supporting characters is made even more unbearable by the protagonist being a Mary Sue and falling into the clich\u00e9 of being nice because nice people are nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe third item on my list is perhaps the biggest one for me personally. The enemies. Oh my god the enemies. The show devotes a decent amount of effort into alluding towards a huge threat that\u2019s looming over the protagonist but fails to ever deliver, leaving an unfulfilling taste in the viewer\u2019s mouth and a desire for something of any consequence to happen. The conflict that does occur seems to materialize itself out of thin air, as if the creators finally realised that nothing had happened for 6 episodes and had a panic attack, quickly drawing up an idea for some large thing to get set up for half an episode, then promptly get defeated before you can take a sip of your coffee. Lovely. It\u2019s really disheartening for me to see an anime with such amazing potential and a great hook fizzle out into a big nothing-burger. \\n\\n\r\nThe fourth item on my list is pacing, which tends to be closely tied in with the third and fourth items, but still deserves its own listing. This show has some serious issues with pacing. On the one hand, they spend an entire episode on one character\u2019s death, and on the other, they only spend one episode on defeating a giant evil monster that\u2019s been slumbering for 1000 years or whatever. These major issues combined with the first item on my list leave a supremely bitter taste in my mouth, as the characters involved don\u2019t suffer any losses or damages when defeating \u2018super evil villain with the power to destroy the planet #45\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifth item on my list is the plot. While the concept of the anime is truly outstanding, the execution is what I would call piss-poor. One particularly jarring event of this occurring happens a little past the 2/3 mark of the series and features the main character completely fucking off from the place that the entire plot has revolved around and doing his own thing for someone that he knew for a single day and who died many episodes prior. I wouldn\u2019t have minded this if it had been for a character I cared about, but, going back to characters for a second, the character that the protagonist was doing it for was one that hadn\u2019t been well developed at all. And the plot largely revolves around this poorly-written and ill thought out character, constantly revisiting her 3 episodes of relevance.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my sixth and final point, repetition. This was probably the most annoying part of this anime to me, as it is an egregious insult to the viewer\u2019s intelligence. The way they repeat things over and over makes me think that the creators of the anime believe their viewers to have an attention span of less than a goldfish. Multiple pivotal plot mechanics are reiterated a multiplicity of times throughout the course of the anime and it really makes me feel a sense of contempt towards the creators.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I was extremely excited to watch this anime at first, as I had heard some good things about it. The sound and art were both good, but the plot and deeper concepts of the shows production were insanely lacking in both function and depth. I really wanted to like this anime, but the more I watched, the more I began to despise it.\\n",

            "content": "That Time I Reincarnated as a Slime (Slime) was the show I was not expecting anything out of and then it surprised me by being pleasantly good only to slowly burn all that goodwill away leaving me with what I expected at the start another generic isekia (a genre where the protagonist is whisked away to another world) show.\r\nSlime starts with how a lot of these shows do as an overworked salaryman is stabbed and murdered when he tries to defend a co-worker from a thief ( huh I guess Truck-kun must have been out sick for the day). He is then given the optionto reincarnate in another world and given some advantages that give him quite the edge against most of the denizens of his new world. After meeting with a mighty dragon named Valdora, they become friends and to free him from his imprisonment Rimaru ( the protagonist who is now a slime)absorbs him. This causes Valdora to disappear and creates a power vacuum in the forest where Rimaru has spawned. Rimaru comes upon some goblins and decides to help them.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this point, the show turns into a lite kingdom building show. Which let me tell you if done right is one of my favorite genre's. But therein lies the problem. I much enjoyed much of the start where Rimeru starts a village, and it becomes more powerful and prosperous, but at the same time, it felt like the whole show was rushing to get through some story beats. This is problematic as a good kingdom building story needs a decent amount of time to explore the minutia of the process of starting a state. Slime is also the rare case where I have read the source material( keeping in mind I dropped it a ways back as I had caught up to the current issue of the light novel, but it never was enjoyable enough to go back and catch up) to know that they were skipping a lot of crucial details.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the cast, Rimeru is a nice guy who tries to settle things amicably first in most scenarios. He was a reasonably exciting character to follow \u2014 the rest though not so much. No one was awful, but in that same vein, no one stuck out either. It has only been one day, and I have forgotten about most of them. I am sure I could tell you a detail or two but nothing that would make them memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise Slime was nothing to write home about. In the sound department, it was the same nothing stuck out. The OP was good, but that was about all. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Slime is going to be the show I forget about two weeks from now unremarkable in many ways. It is alright, but I would not recommend watching this show.\\n\\n",

I'm actually enjoying OPness of Rimuru as long as her character is developed and she keeps her cool.\r\n\u2b24 No shounen cry in this show, thanks for leaving my ears well-tended.\r\n\u2b24 Milim!\r\nWHY I DISLIKED:\r\n\u2b24 Rimuru is a straight loli who only turns into a slime when the animator grows tired... The 37 yo dude is just gone!\r\n\u2b24 I kept hearing \"Rimuru-sama! Rimuru-sama!\" onceevery 2 seconds, is something wrong with me ?

            "content": "Before this anime was even released, it was seen as something that was to be made fun of, considering the bizarre idea and how everyone is so used to Isekai at this point. And when it did release, it was uh...good? There wasn't really anything that you could criticize about, it just seemed like a light-hearted and decent show. I mean it had strange charm to it, a great opening and characters with alot of potential.\r\nBut as the first few episodes went by, it seemed almost fun to the point where a lot of Anitubers were praising it for how good it was and yesit was good....for 12 episodes that is. After the Orc Lord arc passed, I started to realize the show's plot development is actual really slow, the story was going no where and barely any main villains / demon lords have been revealed or mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nYup, the opening was clickbait; can you believe it? A clickbait anime opening, holy shit. I cannot stress this enough, the opening not only showed a bunch of villains, it also showed the fantastic fights that we were going to get. But nope, what has our protagonist done in the past 25 episodes? Let's recap since the anime loves to do that by putting two of them in a finale.\\n\\n\r\nRimuru Tempest Has Achieved The Following Things In The First Season:\\n\r\n- Become a slime\\n\r\n- Enslave and befriend everyone he meets\\n\r\n- Eat a human\\n\r\n- Eat a pig\\n\r\n- Filler\\n\r\n- Let someone else beat a bad cgi monster with one attack\\n\r\n- Become a teacher\\n\r\n- Disappoint me\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, Slime was an fun Isekai with alot of potential that turned into a boring mess that went no where and just ended off with 2 recaps. Now before I finish, just remember that behind that cute slime exterior, Rimuru is simply just your usual shitty Isekai protagonist in a usual shitty Isekai world. \\n\\n\r\n The end.....oh shit there's another season FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's a very specific kind of enjoyment which you can get from Reincarnated as a Slime, and the best comparison I can make - which might explain that enjoyment - is to time-loop movies. Movies like The Edge of Tomorrow or Source Code focus on an initially-incompetent protagonist being repeatedly put through the same sequence of events in the same place and trying to achieve some kind of goal. \r\nAt the beginning, the protagonist repeatedly fails or dies because they don't know what's coming next. But eventually, they begin to map out the possibilities and anticipate the events in their reality, and figures out thebest way to get through the obstacles, or the right thing to do at the right time, in order to succeed. And at the point that the protagonist has finally managed to git gud, you get a vicarious sense of enjoyment from watching them.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much what Slime is like, except, crucially, without the first part - which is to say, the part where the protagonist actually struggles. This basically turns the anime into a weirdly fun, oddly amusing journey through a fairly stereotypical isekai setting where the protagonist constantly makes the right choices, level-grinds (so to speak) in order to get all the powerful abilities he needs to consistently destroy his opponents, makes the right alliances to build up his kingdom, etc. If he was some kind of stereotypically handsome cool guy, this would probably be really annoying, but he's a literal slime, so it just becomes oddly funny to watch him take over a goblin village and turn it into a built-up town which is home to a multi-species coalition, or to befriend a legendary storm dragon just by being around and not being scared to talk to him. \\n\\n\r\nIf this sounds undistinguished and like it might be kind of boring, that's because it probably would be, which is why I decided to be fair and give it 5 out of 10. Certainly, after the entertaining early parts where Rimuru the Slime consistently wrecks every opponent he faces and becomes the founder of a new nation, there's a deeply shitty final arc where he has to babysit a bunch of annoying kids, which sucks. However, if you have nothing else to do and find isekai kind of annoying, it might be fun to watch a show where a super-powerful slime basically rampages through an isekai setting just by being smart, having a bunch of rare abilities, and using his common sense.",

However, I grew to love this anime, and I wish there was more. My love for this anime grew exponentially, in fact. After powering through the first episode, I came to love all the characters (goblins, direwolf, etc) and Rimuru, of course. This is like One Punch Man, the main character is very OP, however, the anime contains it very nicely (not like SAO). I consider myself a pretty hardanime rater, so giving this an 8 is surprising. However, there always is some way to improve. Some of the jokes are lame and one specific character was definitely not in the anime long enough. You'll know which one if you watch this. So overall, I would say this is nice, just power through the first episode and I bet you'll grow to love this anime. \\n\\n\r\n- Spacecraft555 UwU",

Well I guess it's worth checking out then. \r\nDude gets killed, wakes up in another dimension as a lowly slime. PLOT TWIST he's super powerful. One thing I absolutely love about this show is that it justified it's main character being overpowered. Aside from the inherent resistances that come with being a slime. The MC eats an elemental dragon and then grinds for a month in the cave he spawned in. Then, after literally clearing thecave out, he leaves and goes on a wild adventure making new friends and unexpected allies. The story never gets too complicated, so sit back an relax. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, the art is great. The team clearly got plenty of money and time to make the show look good. Even the CG animation isn't too egregious and is sparsely used.  \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the a good OP and ED, the music was mostly ambient. The sound effects ranged a little. Explosion and other magic sound good. Physical combat had some generic sword clanging noises, but the hand to hand stuff sounded good. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are good. There are a ton of reoccurring characters and none of them look alike. The characteristics of these characters are pretty generic though. There are a few good comedy characters but most of the others fit into a stereotype. The good news is that, much like with a big j-pop or k-pop group, with so many characters you are bound to like at least one of them. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment was clearly enough to stay invested till the end. My enjoyment only tanked at the last bit when the MC goes to help some kids with their powers. It was kind of a boring way to end a 24 ep. run. However, with there being an ep. 24.5 out and the show being massively popular, I'm guessing we are getting another season. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend the show. However, binging might be a bad idea as the show has a lot of story arcs, events and character introductions occur in rapid succession. It might be exhausting.",

            "content": "As I get older, I find myself often seeking out novelty when it comes to entertainment. Like with games, I still enjoy epic RPG and RTS games, but these days I'm mostly drawn to ones with unusual concepts like taking on the role of a shop keeper or a passport stamper rather than a world-saving hero.\r\nAnime is no exception, so when I came across one about a slime - that most humble of monsters residing on the bottom rung of the RPG food chain - my immediate reaction was \"sign me up, Scotty!\"\r\nNovelty concepts can only get you so far though; a lot hinges onthe execution. The execution of \"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime\", or TenSura for short, is nothing special. The show is passable, and has moments when it delivers on the novelty premise. But overall it doesn't feel as fresh as I had hoped.\\n\\n\r\nTenSura seems to have its fingers stuck in several popular pies. In case you haven't guessed from the synopsis-style name, the show originates from a series of light novels, set squarely in the trendy isekai game world, where girls are mostly big-breasted moebaits, all drawn to the protagonist like flies to a slimy poo. In addition, TenSura wants to be comedy, drama, action, fantasy adventure amongst other things. As a result of being spread so thinly, large parts of the series comes off as sterile, going through the typical motions of whatever it's trying to be with varying degrees of success, but never quite striking gold.\\n\\n\r\nTo start with, TenSura leans too heavily on its JRPG origins. While I can appreciate a few good jokes referencing the sort games the show parodies, the trappings of the settings are so in-your-face that it interferes with the storytelling. One of the main symptoms takes the form of the Great Sage. This is some AI-esq entity residing in the mind of Rimuru, our slimy main character, acting as his guide, his advisor and his analyst all rolled into one. I understand it's the in-story representation of a game's manual/system for easing in a new player, which is actually a pretty good parody idea. But that kind of gimmick can only be played for a quick laugh. TenSura chooses instead to have the Great Sage act as a uncomfortably big plot device, a cheap and deep well of knowledge which can be plumbed for exposition at the leisure of Rimuru, our slimy n00b.\\n\\n\r\nThis kick-down-the-barriers approach to storytelling is something TenSura does a lot. Not a single obstacle appear to exist in this fantasy world that Rimuru, our great slimy leader, cannot overcome within a couple of episodes, whether through brains or brawn. To be fair, I do like the fact that Rimuru doesn't just use his overpowered powers to muscle his way to solutions, he also applies the skills and experience of his previous life as a middle management salaryman. In this respect TenSura reminds me a little of Maoyuu. But it also suffers the same problem as Maoyuu, in that Rimuru operates at a level so far above everyone else that the story struggles to build up any tension or drama. With a few powerful attacks, Rimuru can decimate an army; with a few choice words or action, he can sway enemies into loyal allies. Everything feels too easy.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic elements of TenSura suffers particularly from the shortcuts taken by the writing. The anime's idea of fleshing out the characters consists of crowbarring in a tragic backstory right before they kick the bucket, and then expect you to care, even though you've only known the character for about half an hour. The underwhelming writing also shows itself in the dialogues, where we get treated to regurgitated \"classic\" lines such as \"BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA!!\"\\n\\n\r\nAs an action series, TenSura does serve up some pretty cool battle sequences and flashy special effects. But Rimuru, our overpowered slimy protagonist, tends to drain the tension out of most battles he gets involved in.\\n\\n\r\nComedy is what TenSura does best, and the show delivers its fair share of amusing jokes. Unfortunately though, TenSura thinks it's funnier than it actually is. The show has a tendency to milk its jokes beyond their worth through over-reaction and repitition. When the jokes are funny, the milking diminishes the humour; when the jokes aren't funny, the anime just comes off as lame. Kind of like being in the presence of an irritating guy who insists on gaffawing at every joke he makes. It only gets worse when he starts telling the same ones over and over.\\n\\n\r\nTenSura is at its most amusing when making good use of the novel premise. Had the show ended after one cour, it would have been better for it. But not content to focus on the one good thing it has, TenSura overextends in order to hit all the popular bases. Predictably, the novelty starts wearing off in the weaker second half, to which TenSura responds by turning to fake novelty, the kind which have become stone wall cliches by this point. For example, TenSura would introduce a demon lord who - get this - takes the form of a pink haired, hyper active moeblob with an annoyingly high pitched voice! Who could possibly have guessed! By this point, female characters in TenSura had become cancerous in general. It's like they were designed to irritate, and the voice actresses duly obliged by turning in a suite of nails-on-chalkboard-worthy performances. Also, The joke about Rimuru, our lecherous slimy harem-lead, nestling against a girl's jiggling jugs and being fawned and fought over by everyone not in possession of a dick may have been funny first time round, but it's certainly not good enough as a running gag.\\n\\n\r\nHmmm, this review came off harsher than I intended. I guess it's hard to expound on TenSura's strengths when it doesn't really have any outstanding points. Much like a slime, it mostly ambles along in an cutesy, inoffensive, mildly amusing kind of manner. \"Jack of all trades\" is another way of describing the show except labelling it as \"jack\" flatters it - it's more like an eight of all trades and certainly master of none.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating: +0.5 (decent)\\n",

            "content": "This has to be my first experience actually bothering with a story featuring such an extreme case of Mary Sue protagonist (although, I'm aware it's kind of a golden standard for modern isekai stories) and I cannot say that it was a pleasant experience. \r\nThe concept alone is solid: a not-particularly-successful guy (i.e. a virgin loser) dies and gets reincarnated as a slime (a mass of gelatinous fluid) in a medieval-like fantasy world. There's certainly a number of ways to handle such a story to a satisfying degree, but unfortunately, Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken takes the path of something that reminds me of areally poorly thought out RPG session. For anyone expecting to see our protagonist to struggle in his new body and work hard to overcome its limitations or maybe even question what it means to be human, I do not have good news. Rimuru, as our protagonist is eventually named, wakes up as a slime with a set of skills, supposedly stemming from his dying thoughts, that not only make him a really powerful slime, but even a contender for the title of the apex predator in the fantasy world that he gets transported to. As if things couldn't get any worse, Rimuru gets stronger with each defeated foe, thanks to a very convenient ability to \"consume\" things and add their properties to his repertoire. Needless to say, matches of strength in Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken are about as exciting as watching paint dry, as Rimuru easily overpowers all of his enemies and quickly befriends most of them (needless to say, strategizing is not required when might makes right and stronger opponents can be bribed with friendship). This is probably my biggest source of grief with this series. While some stories feature incredibly powerful protagonists who fight (both literally and figuratively) to find their own place in the society (a pretty common theme of supplementing external conflicts with internal ones), Rimuru does not fall into this trope, instead being presented as an extremely likeable individual, despite not actually showing much of a charm at any occasion - in a typical LN fashion, we have to take the author's word for it. Any sentient being he meets immediately falls head over heels for him. This gets so ridiculous, that even the few characters who are at first antagonistic towards him, despite not being shown as cut from a pure evil cloth (giving the audience hope for at least a hint of moral ambiguity), eventually succumb to his \"charisma\" and join his merry gang of monsters and humans seemingly driven by their unconditional love for Rimuru (this is the defining personality trait for the majority of the cast).\\n\r\nThe series dangles another bait in front of the audience by presenting an idea of building a society of monsters led by Rimuru himself. This could potentially counterbalance the awful way characters are handled, by having the development of that society at the center of the story. However, yet again, the potential is completely squandered, as all the hurdles of building a functional community are either glossed over or entirely disregarded. At some point it really seems like the author wanted to delve a little deeper into the mechanics behind building a town or supporting a growing society, but for whatever reason, what we end up getting is so childish that even stories aimed at young kids seem to have more complexity. The city, future capital of Rimuru's nation, just grows without ever addressing the issue of resources needed for that to happen and the townsfolk (whose numbers quickly grow to tens of thousands) appear to feed exclusively on savage beasts hunted in the forest, never taking into consideration an abstract concept of agriculture. A significant jump from literal mud huts to brick-built houses, paved roads and exquisitely decorated interiors is justified by having a few craftsmen around. There's suspending one's disbelief and there's weaving a story in a way that even small children would find ridiculous. The last arc and \"bonus\" episodes make me wonder if the series was just poorly planned or was it a matter of production hiccups, but it's oddly fitting that a weak series was ended (at least in the first season) in such a lame fashion.\\n\r\nWith lackluster, to say the least, characters and story, all hope to save Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken from being a complete waste of time lies in audiovisual qualities. Unfortunately, this is not a project of passion and technical aspects of the show fit the quality of content they have to present. Simply put, the animation is average. We get some really short and rare bursts of animation that could be considered artistic, but it's more exception to the rule. Sound is completely average as well, maybe even worse than that, with rather bland opening songs and some peculiar theme choices in key moments of the story (lighthearted tracks in seemingly serious scenes and vice versa).\\n\r\nAll in all, my review paints a very bleak image of the series, but I really tried hard to not be too harsh (believe it or not), because at the end of the day, with all the laziness and stupidity Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken showered me with every week, I feel that the end result is more than the sum of its parts. At times it was mentally grueling, trying to wrap my head around the concept of someone creating a story with such a disregard for world building and character development, but ultimately, I were entertained enough to continue watching. It wasn't exactly a guilty pleasure, more of a morbid curiosity to see how bad it's going to get. I guess mediocre series like that are needed to appreciate the true gems more.\\n\r\nWould I recommend Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken to anyone? Absolutely not, unless they wanted to experience firsthand why isekai and light novel stories should be avoided. Is it the worst anime I've ever seen? Definitely not, but its awfulness compelled me to write this review, so there has to be something special about it.",

            "content": "Most isekai anime out there do the same things with there plot where someone is trapped in another world, they are strong as hell, and just learn to live with there new life or try and get out. But this anime does something different with those common trops and makes them either funny or entertaining to watch. I didnt start watching this show until half way through the season and when i picked it up i was so glad to watch a good anime that i started watching more anime again thanks to this show.\r\nFirst the story. I really really love this story and whatthey do to move the plot foward. There were times were they might of skipped information or jumped months in advance, but just watching everything play out with the characters and what Rimuru Tempest does to make everyone equal and still help others out along his journey in this new world. Some parts of the story were a little boring, but when action happened and they feels you get at points are what makes this story really great in the world of isekai anime.\\n\\n\r\nNext the art. The art in this anime was completely beautiful. Every scene had vibrant colors and outstanding visuals. The characters had great colors to them that made each of them stand out in one way shape or form and then the backgrounds also were touched on very nicely which made watching this anime even better. Even the background characters had some sort of color to them to make them not just another boring character and then some of the support characters with there style as well made every bit of art in the anime something to look to.\\n\\n\r\nNext the sound. I will admit that some of the sounds in this anime were a little off, but all and all the sounds were really good. When there was a fight the sound sync was on point, when someone made a smirk or noise they were caught as well. The beginning and ending songs that played were also just as good when looking at sound. I think if the beginning of a anime can relay what the show is about and the music and also complement that then you should know your in for a good time and wanting to watch the new episode to see what else happens. \\n\\n\r\nNext the characters. All the characters that spoke in this anime had some sort of personality to them and each on had there time to shine in this anime. Each one had screen time and were not just one off characters where they were helped and never seen again. The were brought back a few times here and there which is better then nothing. Rimuru Tempest is a great character who didnt know nothing when coming to the world and was a fast learner to it which helped in a big way. Plus his personality is funny and great to watch when paried up with other characters like Rigurd,Ranga, and Shion all of which had there own personality as well and didnt make the plot slow with them in it.\\n\\n\r\nFinally my enjoyment. I did enjoy watching this anime from the beginning to the end and im already glad that there will be a second season coming next year because i want to see where these characters go and what king of problems they will have to face along there journey to make new allies and face even more enemies along the way. Plus i really want to see how strong Rimuru can be with the predator ability he has.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a really great anime to watch and i would recommend giving this a change if you like isekai anime or just want to watch something that can make you laugh and cheer at the same time.",

            "content": "That Time I Declined in Writing Quality\r\nWelcome to TenSura, one of the latest additions to the niche and undersaturated genre known as \"isekai\" *laugh track plays*. Since there are about 17 isekais produced every anime season, studios have realized that in order to produce a truly successful isekai, they need to grab the viewer's attention in the first couple episodes. What happens after that? Eh, who cares. The show's already popular.\r\nStory (4/10): I believe one of the greatest flaws of TenSura is the concept itself. The idea of a light-hearted Overlord may sound good on paper, but it fails in execution. Overlord works as ashow because Ainz is cool. The problem with TenSura is that Rimuru really... isn't cool. He's OP in a Kirito-like, boring way. After the pretty good first few episodes (up through the establishment of the goblin village) Rimuru just doesn't do anything interesting. I'm struggling to recall what actually happened in the arcs because there's not really anything connecting them. Rimuru just goes to some random place and gets more allies for his village. If you want to implement the one-dimensional Overlord plot of \"man build empire\", you can't have the main character be some nice guy that goes about building his empire by talking to random people. In essence, there's just nothing in the story department. There's no overarching plot, no cool/edgy factor, and no tension since Rimuru can literally defeat all enemies with his OP isekai protagonist skill. Oh yeah, apparently there was a comedy aspect here? I didn't find it funny, and apparently MAL didn't either since this show doesn't have a comedy tag.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10): Who? The only character listed as a \"main\" in TenSura is Rimuru, aka \"OP blank slate boring man\". The other characters include a harem of personality-less dolls, some side characters like Souei who attempt to inject some sort of edginess in the show, and random characters that appear once and are never brought up again. Shizu, the only character that may be argued to be \"well-written\" is nothing but a well-disguised MacGuffin. All she does is progress the plot, and nothing else. I'd like to talk about the random side characters in further detail. The problem here is that this season is pretty much an introduction into the universe. You get all of these characters that are simply introduced and left alone, like demon lord with clown servants, demon lord with blonde hair, knight girl who is hinted to be Shizu's disciple, those adventurers from the guild near the end of the show, and probably others that I've forgotten about. They're probably going to be important in the next season, but what about this season? \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Pretty solid. The character designs are relatively memorable. The color scheme and the overall art help build the comforting, light-hearted atmosphere that the show strives for. The fights are nicely animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): Idk why I'm giving this a high rating. There's this one OST that plays during every battle that's stuck in my head, so apparently that somehow makes the sound good. The OP and ED themes also nicely mirror the quality of the show. Just like the show was good at the start and turned into boring trash, the first OP and ED were good, and the second ones really weren't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall (6/10): TenSura was extremely bland, but I can't really give it a lower rating since it was decent enough for me to have the desire to watch every new episode. I'm really hoping that this was simply a setup season and that season two will be better, since this season seems to lay the groundwork and nothing else, but only time will tell.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is an isekai that came out of nowhere and went back to the sources of the genre\r\nAfter exploring the tragedy (Re: Zero) and the comedy (Konosuba), the genre returns to a version seemingly simpler and more refined, but that is all the more pleasant\r\n[This review includes some spoilers, read at your own risk if you have not completed the series]\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nClassic. Simple but not boring, it takes a relatively common scenario among the isekai genre : a lambda man (who for once is not a NEET, a good point to clarify) dies and is reincarnated in another world, aworld threatened by the forces of evil.\\n\r\nHowever it is the fact that the protagonist is an overpowered slime that changes everything: here the character does not seek to gain power but in a first time discovers the world, then wants to build something\\n\r\nThe story is quite different from a SAO (I will often mention SAO in this review, get used to it) but remains within the limits of the specifications of a traditional isekai\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt does its job. It is not beautiful, certainly, but the fights are pleasant to watch and the animation in general is well done\\n\r\nThe chara-design is relatively original. It keeps several clich\u00e9s about fantastic creatures but manages to transform them and thus creates endearing characters\\n\r\nMy only regret will be the use of the CGI several times, especially during the Charybdis arc. I'm still very sensitive to the CGI in anime and I admit to tolerate it badly, but during the aerial combat it is used to excess, especially on megalodons. I think it doesn't really stick with the whole atmosphere of the show\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\r\nThe dubbing of the characters is well done and nice, I find that the voices stick to them rather well\\n\r\nSimilarly, the various sound effects are well made (including the EXPLOSIOOONS) and we immerse a little more in the world of Tensei Slime thanks to them\\n\r\nHowever there is a very small flat that I may be the only one to have noticed: I did not find the OST very significant. It's just ... good. It does not bother me but I am very sensitive to music and I attach great importance to it, and at no point in the series did I say to myself at once: \"wow, this piece of music is really great \"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of the best point of the anime in my opinion\\n\r\nAlready there's something that surprised me: the goodness of the characters. There are not many who are really bad or keep doing bad things. We have rather a big cast of fundamentally nice characters, then are added characters initially presented as villains / semi villains who then show redemption (but it's well done, not like the cheap villains in Fairy Tail), and finally we sprinkle all of a few \"bad guys\" who remain, there are a few and have not (yet) been really shown on screen\\n\r\nRimuru is a very nice MC, because it is clear that he thinks a lot and makes logical decisions unlike many other MC (isn't it Kirito?). It is a pleasure to see a character making decisions that we would have made as well because they were logical and reasonable\\n\r\nThe other characters are also very endearing because they are kind and loyal to Rimuru (I have always feared that there will be revolts, treachery or dissension but it never happened, so much the better!), My favorites being Ranga and Gobuta\\n\r\nI also like the fact that powerful people, be they sovereigns or demon kings, decide quite naturally to join Rimuru and to become friends with him, whereas in most other animes, their pride or their ego would have prevented them from doing it.\\n\r\nMy only regret for the characters is that we didn't really see Veldra, who failed to break the seal during the first season. I really liked this character even though we saw him for a short time. Having a tsundere dragon becoming the best friend of a slime (or even a family member since they have the same name) and being extremely happy with it is adorable, and I'm really looking forward to see him in the second season\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly, this was not an anime that I looked forward to every week, but I had a good time watching each new episode (it's a little like my carrot for Monday, which pushes me to consider the day in a better way even if it's the worst of the week haha)\\n\r\nYou can watch it without having to think a lot, it is full of good feelings without ever being cutesy, with also action and interesting intrigues. I also like the humor of the series, it's very present but it never falls into ridicule!\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8.20 / 10\\n\r\nThe big isekai of the Autumn 2018 season will not have disappointed me and will have finally entertained me\\n\r\nI'm looking forward to watch the second season next year, hoping it will be as good as this one!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[French version]\\n\\n\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken est un peu l'isekai sorti de nulle part et qui retourne aux sources du genre\\n\r\nApr\u00e8s avoir explor\u00e9 la trag\u00e9die (Re:Zero) et la com\u00e9die (Konosuba), le genre revient \u00e0 une version en apparence plus simple et plus \u00e9pur\u00e9e, mais qui n'en est que plus agr\u00e9able\\n\\n\r\n[Cette critique comprend quelques spoilers, lisez \u00e0 vos risques et p\u00e9rils si vous n'avez pas termin\u00e9 la s\u00e9rie]\\n\\n\r\nHistoire : 8/10\\n\r\nClassique. Simple mais pas ennuyeuse, elle reprend un sc\u00e9nario relativement courant chez les isekai : un homme lambda (qui pour une fois n'est pas un NEET, un bon point \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser) meurt et est r\u00e9incarn\u00e9 dans un autre monde, menac\u00e9 par les forces du mal. \\n\r\nCependant c'est le fait que le protagoniste soit un slime assez overpowered qui change tout : ici le personnage ne cherche pas \u00e0 gagner de la puissance mais dans un premier temps d\u00e9couvre le monde, puis veut y b\u00e2tir quelque chose\\n\r\nL'histoire est donc assez diff\u00e9rente d'un SAO (je vais souvent mentionner SAO dans cette critique, autant vous y habituer) mais reste dans les limites du cahier des charges d'un isekai traditionnel\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nElle fait son travail. Elle n'est pas magnifique, certes, mais les combats sont plaisants \u00e0 regarder et l'animation en g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est bien faite\\n\r\nLe chara-design est relativement original. Il reprend plusieurs clich\u00e9s concernant les cr\u00e9atures fantastiques mais arrive \u00e0 bien se les approprier et cr\u00e9\u00e9 ainsi des personnages attachants\\n\r\nMon seul regret sera l'emploi du CGI \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, et plus particuli\u00e8rement lors de l'arc Charybdis. Je suis toujours tr\u00e8s sensible au CGI dans les animes et j'avoue le tol\u00e9rer assez mal, or lors du combat a\u00e9rien il est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 outrance, notamment sur les m\u00e9galodons. Je trouve que \u00e7a casse un peu l'ambiance\\n\\n\r\nSon : 7/10\\n\r\nLe doublage des personnages est bien fait et agr\u00e9able, je trouve que les voix leur collent plut\u00f4t bien\\n\r\nDe m\u00eame, les diff\u00e9rents bruitages sont bien r\u00e9alis\u00e9s (notamment les EXPLOSIOOONS) et nous immergent un peu plus dans l'univers de Tensei Slime\\n\r\nTout petit b\u00e9mol que je suis peut \u00eatre le seul \u00e0 remarquer : je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 l'OST tr\u00e8s marquante. Elle est juste...bien. Ca ne me d\u00e9range pas mais je suis tr\u00e8s sensible \u00e0 la musique et j'y attache beaucoup d'importance, et \u00e0 aucun moment dans la s\u00e9rie je me suis dit d'un seul coup : \"wow, ce morceau de musique est vraiment g\u00e9nial\"\\n\\n\r\nPersonnages : 9/10\\n\r\nL'un des points forts de la s\u00e9rie selon moi\\n\r\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 un c\u00f4t\u00e9 qui m'a surpris : la bont\u00e9 des personnages. Rares sont ceux qui sont vraiment mauvais ou qui multiplient les coups en douce. On a plut\u00f4t un gros casting de personnages fonci\u00e8rement gentils, puis viennent s'ajouter des personnages d'abord pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme m\u00e9chants/semi m\u00e9chants puis qui font preuve de r\u00e9demption, et enfin on saupoudre le tout de quelques rares \"m\u00e9chants\" qui le restent, mais il y en a peu et ne se sont pas (encore) vraiment montr\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran\\n\r\nRimuru est un MC tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able, car on voit bien qu'il r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit beaucoup et prend des d\u00e9cisions logiques contrairement \u00e0 beaucoup d'autres MC (n'est-ce pas Kirito ?). Cela fait honn\u00eatement plaisir de voir un personnage prendre des d\u00e9cisions que nous spectateurs aurions \u00e9galement prises car elles \u00e9taient logiques et raisonnables\\n\r\nLes autres personnages sont eux aussi tr\u00e8s attachants car gentils et loyaux envers Rimuru (j'ai toujours craint qu'il y ait des r\u00e9voltes, traitrises ou dissensions mais \u00e7a n'est jamais arriv\u00e9, tant mieux !), mes pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e9tant Ranga et Gobuta\\n\r\nJ'aime aussi le fait que des personnes puissantes, que ce soient des souverains ou des rois d\u00e9mons, d\u00e9cident tout naturellement de s'allier \u00e0 Rimuru et de s'en faire un ami, alors que dans la plupart des autres animes, leur orgueil et leur \u00e9go les en auraient emp\u00each\u00e9s.\\n\r\nMon seul regret au niveau des personnages reste qu'on a pas pu vraiment revoir Veldra, qui n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 briser le sceau pendant la premi\u00e8re saison. J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 ce personnage m\u00eame si on l'a vu peu de temps. Le fait d'avoir un dragon tsundere devenir le meilleur ami d'un slime (voire un membre de la famille vu qu'ils ont le m\u00eame nom) et qu'il en soit extr\u00eamement content est adorable, et je suis vraiment impatient de le revoir dans la deuxi\u00e8me saison\\n\\n\r\nAppr\u00e9ciation : 9/10\\n\r\nEtonnamment, ce n'est pas un anime que j'attends avec impatience chaque semaine, mais je passe un agr\u00e9able moment \u00e0 regarder chaque nouvel \u00e9pisode (c'est un peu ma carotte du lundi, qui me pousse \u00e0 bien consid\u00e9rer la journ\u00e9e m\u00eame si c'est la pire de la semaine haha)\\n\r\nOn le regarde sans se prendre la t\u00eate, c'est rempli de bons sentiments sans jamais \u00eatre mi\u00e8vre, avec \u00e9galement de l'action et des intrigues int\u00e9ressantes. J'aime aussi beaucoup l'humour de la s\u00e9rie, tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent mais qui ne tombe jamais dans le ridicule !\\n\\n\r\nTotal : 8.20/10\\n\r\nLe gros isekai de la saison Automne 2018 ne m'aura pas d\u00e9cu et m'aura au final bien diverti\\n\r\nJ'ai plut\u00f4t h\u00e2te de regarder la seconde saison l'ann\u00e9e prochaine, en esp\u00e9rant qu'elle soit aussi bonne que celle-ci !\\n",

            "content": "That time I got reincarnated as a slime is an interesting show, if you asked me what my favourite show was in the fall season I would have said slime without a doubt, that\u2019s not the case after the winter season. It\u2019s not that it got worse or anything, it\u2019s just that it never changed in any way, all of the interactions are almost the exact same every time. There are 2 different ways that an interaction with a new character can happen \r\n1. Arrogant new characters appear and underestimate our power protagonist(s), when shown the power of the protagonist they become humbled and areshocked by how forgiving he is of them for their previous arrogance \\n\\n\r\n2. The arrogant character is a very powerful loli that switches sides when given food\\n\\n\r\nIn both cases it\u2019s likely that they join Rimuru and if there are non human characters involved they get names and become very human looking, it gets old after a while, it\u2019s the same thing every time with very little differences, not to mention that\u2019s there\u2019s no suspense because the protagonists can seemingly fight anybody and anything without any problems. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that I hate the show or anything, it has very good animation and I love watching his little nation grow, but in the end it\u2019s strengths aren\u2019t enough to put it at an above average rating, if you like isekai then you\u2019ll probably like this but for me this is a 5/10\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nBased off a popular manga and light novel of the same name Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken which is better known by its English title of That time I got reincarnated as a slime and its synonym\u2019s of Tensura is a fantasy and shounen anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a mid-aged office worker who seemsto be content with his life as just another salaryman that lives in the metropolis of Tokyo were to one day while providing his juniors with some well earned life lessons were to suffer a truly untimely death that would rather than transport him to the netherworld where all deceased would go would rather see him transported to an alternate world that\u2019s more akin to that of a game world than the real world. However, rather than being transported to said world as a human being as one would expect he would instead be reincarnated as something that can be said to be the lowest of monsters which is that of a slime. \\n\\n\r\nThe Isekai genre of anime, light novels and manga fame is a well-trodden one thanks largely due to the ease of use of its main concept which is the transportation of a being human or otherwise from one world to another parallel world. Looking back through the previous anime season\u2019s one can see many great examples of the genre such as the famed Konosuba, Re Zero and Log Horizon series. However, apart from the genre, there is one other common theme that links these series together and this is the fact that whichever world the main characters of these series find themselves transported too they will still remain as human. In this Tensura can be said to be somewhat unique as after death the main character of the series rather than being reincarnated as a human as previous series have done instead is reincarnated as a slime a creature that is seen to be the lowest of monsters. \\n\\n\r\nThis concept of being reincarnated as a creature rather than a human being I thought was interesting and notable as while providing a much needed breath of fresh air into the genre it also provided an interesting opportunity to see a new fantasy world from the perspective of a human being that while being in the form of a monster has the knowledge that comes from the fact that he retains the memories that he had in his previous life. This combination of being a monster that has memories of subjects and matters that are visually unknown to the people of this new world was what can be said to be the main reason that drew me to the series as this knowledge of the mc allows him to not just create magic, organizations, towns and societies that are visually unknown to the world but also allow him to change and advance the various races that inhabit the land and dispel the sense of inherent distrust that exists between the various races by forging alliances between them and teaching them to respect and treat others fairly. This concept of trying to instill peace and order within the new world while making sure that each race is able to advance in tech level in uniform fashion, I felt was admirable as Rimuru\u2019s actions not only changed himself and his allies but also the world around him as well. This sense of trying to change the world through diplomacy and teaching of new concepts to others in order to change the various races and their views on others ensured that this series was one of the best series of this season and I was glad that I decided to watch the series from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Tensura takes place in a fantasy world that while having the standard races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins also have some unique exotic races like the ogre\u2019s, direwolves, dragons, demons and Dryad\u2019s that manage to fit surprisingly well into the fabric of the world\u2019s races. Similar to fantasy realms of other series the various races of the world are broadly divided into regions in which they inhabit with towns and villagers being the most common forms of settlements. In this world, while peace was indeed in full reign it can be said that not every race got on with each other with harmony and indeed conflict would break out with the suddenness of a flare. The series overall story follows the life of Rimuru tempest a human being from the modern world who after suffering an untimely death in his home world was reincarnated as a slime in this new fantasy world. Rather than become an OP fighter slime as one would no doubt expected him to be Rimuru instead decides to take it slow and learn not just about this world but also get a feel for not just his newfound abilities but also of how the various races that inhabit the land view him and other races that they share this land with. This sense of taking things slow and learning not just about how each race lived in the world but also how their societies can be advanced and integrated with others so as to create a sense of unity within the world and help bring about peace can be said to be one of the main themes of the story and a theme that I felt took great advantage of not just the various types of races that existed within the world but also of the sense of democracy that came from Rimuru\u2019s origin of being from a modern civilized democratic society like modern day Japan. \\n\\n\r\nRimuru Tempest \\n\\n\r\nRimuru Tempest portrayed by new seiyuu Miho Okasaki is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. In his initial form, Rimuru was a mid age salaryman that lived-in modern-day Tokyo that while having everything that life could have offered him aspired what many people in his position would wish for which was to have some sort of excitement in his life that would spice things up for him. As a result of this despite the demands of his job and the stress that came from modern-day city life, he still maintained a cheerful and friendly personality that enabled him to get on well with others easily a trait that unfortunately proved to be his undoing and caused him to become an unfortunate casualty. After his reincarnation as a slime Rimuru\u2019s personality changed dramatically. While still retaining his friendly and cheerful nature Rimuru also developed a sense of curiousness to explore this new world that he had been transported to and a desire to test out the various things that he had discovered. While being reincarnated as a slime would no doubt have taken an average human being some time to get accustomed to it can be seen that even as a slime, he had not lost any of the traits that he had in his previous life. While curious to explore Rimuru was also intelligent and fast thinking and wasn\u2019t afraid of experimenting with his new-found powers and form now that the old-world rules did not apply to him. This can be seen well in his attempts to create new attacks and trying them without any kind of safeguard in place. This sense of wanting to test out ideas however wasn\u2019t restricted to the testing of his powers however as Rimuru true to his nature was also willing to experiment with somewhat riskier ideas like creating completely new societies that have more than one race in them a plan that could easily have backfired had it not been Rimuru that was doing it. This shows that while developing a sense of curiosity Rimuru had also developed a sense of creativity as well and one that wasn\u2019t restricted to one world\u2019s knowledge and was willing to create a wide manner of things no matter how outlandish they may sound to the people of this new world with the town of unified races that Rimuru created over the course of the series to be a good example of this. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being transformed into a slime it can be seen that Rimuru has lost none of the friendly and easy-going nature that defined his original self. This can be seen well in the many first encounters that he has with the many races that inhabit this world. Despite commanding a number of impressive abilities that would have given most people pause it can be said that Rimuru is a calm and understanding person by nature that tries to ensure that all parties are relaxed before interaction begins. While this can be seen to be a weakness of sorts here it can also be said to be the opposite as Rimuru as a result of being freed from the stress and demands of modern day life now has all the time that he needs to analyze the various situations that he comes across in his journeys and come up with the best possible answers that can benefit all parties. While noted to be someone that preferred to deal with situations via diplomatic means it can be said that Rimuru was by no means someone that was afraid to counter those that were rude to him or his allies and was willing to verbally spar with those that he felt had offended him or his friends something that I felt matched well with his friendly and caring nature while also showing off his intelligence and his wittiness. A good example of this is shown in the initial exchanges between Rimuru\u2019s town and the lizardmen. In the beginning of the series largely due to the inexperience that he had in dealing with new races, Rimuru was noted to have a certain lack of awareness on the feelings of others and the needs and desires of the races that he encounters over the course of the series. As a result, in the beginning while his orders were certainly followed accordingly it can be seen that not all races were ready to follow him. However as the series goes on and Rimuru got to see and understand the kinds of struggles, needs and desires that each race had within them Rimuru gradually began to realize that in this world each race was like an individual person that had their own unique beliefs, needs and desires and as a result gradually learned to be more considerate towards the feelings of those around him something that I felt fitted well with Rimuru\u2019s role as a leader. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the character of Rimuru I felt was an interesting one and while death might have been a traumatic experience to some it can be said that the death of his initial body and the act of being reincarnated as a slime in a brand new world had the opposite effect as it instead gave him the freedom to for the first time in his life take things easy and slow and actually enjoy the new world in which he had been sent into. Seeing Rimuru manifest the infinite sense of curiosity and creativity that had been suppressed by the demands of modern day life and use it to try and change not just the races that he encounters in his travels but also the world as a whole as well in an effort to create a peaceful society I thought was an interesting development and direction for his character as while for the most part it derived from his desire to live an easy life in this new world it also derived from both the fact that he was from a modern democratic society where peace was second nature. This sense of combining character development and direction with the personal beliefs and desires that one has learned from hard-earned life experience I thought was interesting as it added a more personal feel to the development of Rimuru while also matching well with the series overall theme of advancing society. \\n\\n\r\nShizue \\n\\n\r\nShizue Izawa portrayed by Yumiri Hanamori of Yuru Camp fame is one of the main supporting characters within the series and is one of Rimuru\u2019s allies within the series. In her initial appearances Shizue who is more commonly known as the masked swordswoman on account of both her skills as a swordswoman and the mask that she wore when on duty was seen to be a quiet, calm and composed young woman who despite her fame was kind, caring and polite to all that she met in her journey. While a quiet and composed person by nature Shizue was also someone that was shown to be curious about matters and subjects that she had not seen before which is best shown in her reaction at seeing races that would otherwise have been hostile to her instead show her kindness and care. At the same time despite her fame as a famed swordswoman Shizue was someone that was noted to prefer observing and understanding new situations before making a decision rather than simply drawing her sword and fall back on standard protocols of eliminating races on the off chance that they are hostile something that I felt put her in good stead and ensured that she managed to bond well with not just the members of Rimuru\u2019s future town but also Rimuru himself. \\n\\n\r\nWhile a kind and caring person by nature and one that would not hesitate to use her powers to protect her friends and comrades from harm from the onset it can be seen that Shizue was someone that preferred to keep her true emotions and feelings hidden behind her mask. As the series goes on it can be seen that Shizue\u2019s mask rather than merely keeping her identity a secret from those that she doesn\u2019t trust also serves as a sort of sanctuary of sorts for her as it is only within the mask that Shizue is able to reveal her true feelings. Unlike the kind and confident personality that she shows on the surface it can be seen that beneath her mask Shizue is someone that\u2019s emotionally fragile and lonely that stems from not just her role and position as a famous swordswoman but also from the many regrets that had formed within her as a result of the many discoveries that she has made regarding not just her own powers but also that of her charges as well. As a result of this it can be seen that in addition to being emotionally fragile and lonely Shizue also possesses a deep fear that perhaps one day if she\u2019s not focused that her powers would not only go berserk but also injure those that she was supposed to be protecting. As a result of these fears, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that Shizue would desire to find and befriend people that she can share her secret pain and grief with but alas for her she was not successful until she encountered Rimuru. Though the interactions that Shizue had with Rimuru were relatively short ones it can be seen that in her last days Shizue thoroughly enjoyed spending her time with Rimuru as for the first time in her long life she was able to reveal to someone that she trusted all of the pain and regrets that she had been holding beneath her mask for so long and the one wish that she despite her power was unable to fulfill that she hoped that Rimuru her first confidant would be able to in her place. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Shizue I felt was an interesting one as the contrast between her position and role as a powerful swordswoman that was widely seen by many as a powerful but kind, steadfast and dependable fighter that can face down the fiercest of enemies with icy calmness and her hidden side of a lonely, insecure and emotionally fragile young woman that longed to find someone that she could pour her heart out to being especially so. In a way despite the way that society views her it can be seen that Shizue was somewhat of a tragic figure as she was not only brought to this world against her will but also forced to take up the role that she was ill-suited for. While persevering in her duties as a valued member of society in an effort to both protect the innocent but also find a way back home Shizue much to her horror found that not only will her control of her powers start to decrease as she ages but that her valued charges would also start to enter the final roads of their lives as well. This combination of a professional struggle and the hidden personal struggle that she tries hard to conceal with from friends in an effort to not worry them I thought was well done and conceived as it added a more emotional element to her character\u2019s struggles and made her relationship with Rimuru that much more special. \\n\\n\r\nShion \\n\\n\r\nShion portrayed by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Aoki Hagane No Arpeggio and Digimon adventure Tri fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Rimuru\u2019s main allies within the series. A member of the Ogre race and one of the survivors of that village Shion in her initial appearances was seen to be a proud, confident, stubborn and a somewhat fiery person by nature that preferred to strike first rather than use diplomacy when meeting new races.  This last trait is shown well in the first encounter that she and her party had with Rimuru and his village. However, despite her tendency to act first Shion is also someone that can be said to have a strong sense of honor and willing to respect those that are able to show their resolve even when they are backed into a corner which I felt goes well with her spirit as a warrior. In line with this Shion is someone that isn\u2019t afraid of facing down strong foes on the field even if the said foe has proven to be much more powerful that she is. \\n\\n\r\nAfter becoming a member of the village and after being uplifted by Rimuru Shion\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. While still retaining her strong loyalty to her fellow ogre\u2019s and to the village that acted as their homeland Shion like the rest of the ogre\u2019s also developed a strong loyalty to both Rimuru and the town that he had created due to the fact that he not only gave them a new location in which they can call home but also allow them to get revenge on the orc lord that was responsible for the destruction of their village. However, unlike the rest of the ogre\u2019s it can be said that with Shion\u2019s loyalty comes an intense romantic interest in Rimuru which while excessive at times often provides a good deal of comic relief for her character with notable examples being how bad she is at cooking. As a result of this dual amount of affection and loyalty that Shion has for her lord and the village it can be seen quite clearly that she\u2019s very proud of Rimuru and of the notable alliance that he had formed with the various races that inhabit it and as such she will not tolerate any type of slander of either. \\n\\n\r\nShuna \\n\\n\r\nShuna portrayed by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi of Girlish Number and Clockwork Planet fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one Rimuru\u2019s main allies within the series. A member of the ogre race and one of the survivors of that village Shuna is also Benimaru\u2019s younger sister and a true princess of that race. From her initial appearance Shuna was seen to be a quiet, perceptive and intelligent person by nature that unlike her brother Benimaru and her friend Shion was seen to understand the value of diplomacy and the need to be cautious and rational when dealing with new races and situations. While a quiet person by nature Shuna was also noted to possess a degree of bravery that one would hardly expect from a quiet girl like her and she was willing to go to great lengths to ascertain and confirm a theory that she had discovered. This is shown well during the first encounter between Rimuru and the members of the Ogre\u2019s of which she was a part off when she stepped in to defuse the quickly escalating situation that transpired between the two parties. \\n\\n\r\nAfter joining the village and being uplifted Shuna like the rest of the ogre\u2019s gradually began to change in personality. While still retaining her trademarked quiet and calm nature Shuna also began to develop a desire to be useful to her new lord and to be useful enough to be relied upon by giving her a degree of responsibility something that I felt was not just cute but also showed her desire to be of better use to her village and to her new allies. While certainly weaker than her fellow ogre\u2019s in frontline combat Shuna however more than made up for it with the vast knowledge that she had in medicine and in this, it can be seen is where she truly shines. While clearly intelligent Shuna true to her personality did not show any degree of arrogance in her actions and indeed she was willing to not just learn about different cultures but also techniques that have been created by other races which does well in showing her hardworking and earnest nature. Like Shion Shuna too is shown to have a great deal of affection for Rimuru but unlike Shion who is more open with her feelings Shuna\u2019s feelings towards her lords tend to be more subtle. Though not often seen the rivalry between the two friends over their affections for Rimuru are always amusing to watch and add a sense of hilarity to the scenes in which they take place. \\n\\n\r\nMillim \\n\\n\r\nMillim portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sword Art Online and Ryuuou no Oshigoto fame is one of the main supporting characters within the series and is one of Rimuru\u2019s main allies within the series. A young human female and also one of the oldest of the demon lords that currently inhabit the world to which Rimuru calls home Millim from her initial appearance is seen to be a positive, curious and earnest young lady that approached each new situation with both determination and a somewhat childish desire to be surprised. Unlike the more traditional image that can be inferred from that of a demon lord Millim rather than being a brooding, dark and cynical person who enjoys making mortals dance to their tune is quite the opposite in that she while disliking the various rules and agreements that are in place within the world is instead someone that can be said to be somewhat of a free spirit that approaches each day with cheerfulness and a desire to try out new food and experiences and meet new surprises aspects that are more in line with that a average teenage girl than that of a demon lord. However, this schoolgirl side of her will vanish once Milim gets serious for this is when she shows off the demon lord side of her that\u2019s she known for far across the land. \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to Millim\u2019s default schoolgirl self which is kind, caring and protective of her friends and allies Millim\u2019s demon lord self can be said to be the total opposite. In this form to which she will adapt when things get serious Millim\u2019s kind and caring personality is instead replaced by that of arrogance and confidence in her abilities as a demon lord and unlike in her alternate self she will not hesitate to strike the enemy before they can prepare for her. While hitting hard and fast with her attacks it can also be seen that Millim also takes great care to observe her enemy and use the knowledge that she gained in centuries of learning magic and actual combat to deal with the enemy\u2019s attacks while making sure that her own are as effective as possible showing that while she may look relatively young for her role that Millim\u2019s combat skills are indeed genuine. This is shown well within the first fight between Rimuru and Millim in which she was consistently able to get the upper hand in that fight despite Rimuru\u2019s attempt to counter her. Though Millim\u2019s demon lord form is indeed powerful its interesting to note that even in this form Millim\u2019s curiosity to experience new things are still present to some degree and can easily be exploited to end things peacefully as shown in the manner of how Rimuru ended the fight that he had with her. In this, it can be seen that while Millim herself is a fearsome combatant that can match Rimuru quite easily in terms of combat strength that she\u2019s a child at heart that can easily be distracted when presented with things that she hasn\u2019t seen before. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Millim I felt was an interesting one with the contrast between her two forms and with them their respective personalities being especially so. While the image that most people would have upon the mention of the term demon lord would no doubt be some scheming  demon that sits on a throne somewhere working on his next big plan of conquest Millim is a bit of an exception to this rule as if one did not know her personally one would no doubt think that she was just your average teenage girl that was enjoying the youth that all girls would go through before adulthood. Indeed, it is this view that truly makes her stand out for unlike other demon lords that are shown in the series Milim while a genuine demon lord with combat abilities that are equal to or above that of Rimuru rather than treat others with arrogance and cruelty instead treats all that she encounters with respect, politeness and cheerfulness that add a degree of freshness to her character. More than anything seeing Millim gradually learn about society and seeing how she befriends and bonds with the members of the village while enjoying all of the benefits that comes from living with those that she gradually learns to care about was an interesting experience for both us the viewer and for Millim herself as well. This development is seen especially well when Millim sees her friends and allies getting hurt by outsiders as it is here where we can truly see Millim\u2019s strong desire to protect them by unleashing her demon form. Seeing Millim not just learn about what a society is like but also see the value of friendship and bonds that can be found there I felt was interesting and highlighted just how much Millim has grown as a character. Seeing her switch between forms so readily in order to protect those that she considers dear to her was also endearing as well. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I thought that the various locations and settings that were featured within the series were both well thought out and designed and featured quite a strong variety of terrain that matched well with the races that called those locations their homes. Notable examples of this included the goblin village, the dwarven homeland of Dwargon and the Freedom academy that housed the students that Shizue was trying to save. Of these locations the Goblin village which later transforms into a city that serves as the capital of Rimuru\u2019s Jura Tempest Federation is undoubtedly  my favorite due to the fact that the city was essentially built from the ground up using both the ideas that Rimuru had from his former home and also because of how it symbolized the core beliefs of his dream which was to build a city that housed citizens of all races that can live alongside each other without fear of tension and disagreements that could escalate into conflict. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character design, I felt that the series featured quite the large variety of both races and creatures within its overall story. Each of the races within the series whether it was the beasts that Rimuru and co had to fight within the series or the individuals of each race I thought was very well designed and detailed. While the standard conventions of how humans, elves and dwarves looked were established long ago I thought that the series did well in showing the more exotic races that weren\u2019t featured in conventional work with the series depiction of the ogre\u2019s, Dryads and goblins being especially well done. The series depiction of Orcs as pigs I felt was an interesting take on how the race looked. In terms of combat animation, I thought that the series featured some pretty impressive fights that while usually short were well thought out and made great use of both terrain features and simple but creative use of tactics and Rimuru\u2019s own abilities. Notable fights within the series that I enjoyed seeing was the battle between the goblins and the direwolves, the battle to defend the village from Ifrit, the battle against the Orc Lord and the battle against demon lord Millim. While Rimuru is the main character within the series I was also thankful in that the various races that he had uplifted with the naming were also given the chance to show off their improved stats within the series as well with the Kijin in particular being able to make a satisfying bang in their combat debut.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, the series made use of two opening themes which was Nameless Story and Meguru Mono that was sung by Takuma Terashima and Three ending themes which were Nameless story that was sung by Takuma Terashima, Another colony that was sung by TRUE and Little soldier that was sung by veteran seiyuu singer Azusa Tadokoro. All of these songs I felt were catchy ones with Meguru Mono, Another Colony and Little Soldier being my favorites. Of the series OST, I felt that it did a great job of dividing its time between peaceful and calming music for scenes that showed the development of characters and infrastructure and more dramatic music for the combat scenes. At the same time, I also felt that the Opening and ending themes of the series was used well to both give us a look at characters that have yet to appear within the series and at the same time show the development of said characters and the town as the series progresses. While certainly subtle I felt that this aspect was used well to show not just how many friends and allies Rimuru has made over the course of the series but also in how much he changed the world as well. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular I feel that Miho Okasaki, Yumiri Hanamori, Mao Ichimichi, Sayaka Senbongi and Rina Hidaka deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job in portraying the characters of Rimuru, Shizue, Shion, Shuna and Millim respectively. Miho Okasaki in particular really impressed me with her portrayal of Rimuru and I hope that the experience that she had gained in portraying Rimuru would help greatly in allowing her to develop her skills as a seiyuu and make a career within the seiyuu industry. In addition, while I didn\u2019t cover them within this review, I also thought that Makoto Furukawa, Asuna Tomari, Chikahiro Kobayashi and Rie Tanaka all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Benimaru, Gobuta, Ranga and Treyni respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Tensura was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I have to say it\u2019s definitely one of this season\u2019s best animes. Its main strong points in my opinion is its excellent and unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting, its strong emphasis on real-world issues like nation building and integrating different races into one society and its emphasis on changing the world through society and tech advancement rather than through military means. At the same time, I also thought that the series did a great job at skillfully blending the genres of comedy, action and fantasy together something that can be said to be inherently tricky within an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of Tensura which is the death and reincarnation of a human being from the modern world to a parallel is nothing really new since it serves as the main form of transportation for the Isekai genre. However, while the form that they would reincarnate into can vary substantially being reincarnated as a slime which is a monster that is widely considered to be the lowest on monsters has to be the most unique form I ever seen. While being reincarnated as a slime instead of a normal human being that can make much more effective usage of his modern-day education and memories can be seen as a disadvantage as after all very few people take slimes seriously the form of a slime can also provide some unique advantages that the larger forms lack such as a unique perspective on how monsters behave and operate in the world, deception and misdirection and a less threatening appearance the last point being especially useful for Rimuru given his focus on diplomatic means to resolve crisis. All in all I felt that the form of a slime that Rimuru took after being reincarnated rather than give him a host of disadvantages that many would have expected actually provided a great deal of unique advantages that allowed him to not just overcome the many different trials that comes from his adventures but at the same time act as a safety net due to a slime\u2019s unique body structure. More than anything I felt that being a slime rather than say a human being actually had a hand in contributing to Rimuru\u2019s success in convincing the various races to work together with him. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series I felt was one of the series main strong points and was one that I really enjoyed. Typical Isekai stories tend to focus on a hero that after being reincarnated in the new world would one day receive a quest in which they must fulfill a difficult quest that would see them face anything from dragons to demons while protecting humans from the predations of the evil demi humans and monsters that inhabit the dark places. However, what if this story is replaced by one where the main focus rather than focusing on dealing out death to anything that\u2019s not human instead is replaced by one where the main focus is on learning about the various races that inhabit the land, uniting them and advancing their tech level in order to instill changes to not just their living conditions but also create an ability to evolve their society so that they can be equal to their surrounding countries and no longer be seen as a mere monsters. It is this focus on learning, expanding and advancing of the various races that Rimuru encounters over the course of his journey that can be said to be the true joy of this anime as we get to see Rimuru not just overturn the concept that all monsters were threats to humans by not just giving them personality but also their unique culture, taste\u2019s, likes and dislikes aspects that many would argue that only humans would have. Seeing Rimuru recognize this by treating them not as beasts but as humans by giving them names and working with them to forge bonds with others and make friends and not enemies that culminated  in the creation of not just the town of Tempest but also of the larger Jura Tempest Federation I felt was immensely satisfying as more than anything it represented a great change within the series not just to the various non-human races but also to the many human nations as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Tensura was an anime series that I really enjoyed, and it is undoubtedly one of the seasons best animes on account of its unique premise, strong story, excellent voice cast, its skillful use of real-world issues that aren\u2019t usually seen within anime and its emphasis on diplomacy rather than on physical might. As a final score, I would say that Tensura easily deserves a score of 9/10. While the series started strong I felt that the story arcs near the end while introducing some interesting new characters didn\u2019t expand them enough to make them compelling. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Main character is so Mary Sue and overpowered it just seriously gets to predictable as the series progresses. Barely anything is a problem for our main character it's so bland.\r\nThe supporting cast are into, what I can see, into 2 categories: Dumbass and boobs\r\nSeriously nearly any female character is depicted with either giant boobs or \"flat chest\"\r\nTheir only contributing is to fall for the main character without any rhyme or reason. \r\nI feel that theonly support characters with any development are the Male characters. And they are ok, but not enough for me to care to much about them. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while the fan service isn't all that much here it is pretty obvious when it gets on screen. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like more developed characters, even the support cast, then I would recommend you rather watch Log Horizon. A good isekai story with enjoyable characters that is actually believable",

            "content": "In case you couldn't tell from the \"episodes seen\" section above, this review is written as of 12 episodes of the show.\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken, or That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, is a 25 episode show of the isekai(another world) genre that began airing in the Fall 2018 season. Isekai are very widespread at this point, having done both amazing and terrible things. It's reached a point where the genre doesn't have anything new to do but creatively twist upon the tropes of it's base concepts, and this is one such show.\r\nOur main character, Rimuru Tempest(as mentioned in the synopsis above)has been reincarnated as a slime in a fantasy world after being murdered in his previous life. Slimes - also commonly called ooze - are common types of monsters in many fantasy roleplay games. True to their name, they don't usually have any distinct shape and appear as large masses of gelatinous fluid. Rimuru has multiple special abilities, one of which allows him to absorb things to gain more skills. After arriving in this new world, ends up becoming the leader of a goblin village in trouble with Dire wolves, and after solving their problem continues to work with them to increase their strength and resources, as well as possibly become a full fledged nation. Rimuru and the goblins slowly continue to make allies throughout the course of the story. Towards the latter half of the first cour(12 episodes), an army of approaching orcs is introduced as an impending threat. \\n\\n\r\nWhile entertaining, with an amazing first episode, I could help but feel that it was lacking. The plot is fine, the sound is good(though it's not anything that I'd want to listen to outside of the show),  while mostly average, the animation has its standout moments, and the supporting characters are entertaining enough with some decent comedy, but Rimuru as a character is inherently bland, lacking in enough overall presence(besides the story's focus on him) that he could have easily been a member of the supporting cast, with one of the more interesting members of that roster replacing him as the main character. Rimuru simply hops through the story almost without a care in the world, with only occasional moments where he seems to even have desires as a character, otherwise being a near personality-less blob that occasionally attempts to be goofy. The character is written as your standard \"good guy\" with almost no extra effort put in.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment value is still present, and this show definitely isn't a waste of time. However, if you have other things you could be doing, or other shows that you're watching, I'd recommend holding off on this one for a bit.",

The plot seems solid and progressing strongly, and I really look forward to every episode, andgladly we know it will have 24 eps, so they will have time to develop the story (or not...who knows) and we can have more of its weekly enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt is not overwhelming but the story does cover for it completely. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will see its manga for sure\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a really nice series !",

            "content": "This anime is one of the those animes that features an overpowered main character showing off his overpowered skills to those around him. Watch this anime if you want to sit still in awe on your chair because of how intensely overpowered the main character is in this show.\r\nI've read a few comments that said this show was boring. I think someone who has watched too much action anime recently and is looking for something that is more different from all the other animes that features OP MCs might say it's boring. Not only that, but it sort of gives the feeling of being insidea RPG game which many other anime produced nowadays also gave off.  Yup, it's an isekai anime with an overpowered MC - we actually see that very often nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nBut these are the points that I want to commend the anime of:\\n\r\n- the pacing is just right. The art doesn't falter throughout the episodes so far. Nothing feels sped up. Everything is smooth. What more can you ask for for a high-quality animation? It's worthy of getting 24 episodes.\\n\r\n- the anime has rendered the manga very well. A good anime producer will make a product more entertaining and worth spending time for than the actual manga. I haven't read the manga, but I just seem to end up thinking that the anime has made the story more entertaining by the qualities which mangas can't have: moving images, sounds, and speaking characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it's entertaining or not is relative. But if you are not one of the people who might think it's boring according to what i've said before in this review, maybe you'll be entertained.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to want to watch action to enjoy this anime. If action to you right now sounds like meaningless movements back and forth then don't watch this. There are indeed episodes that don't feature action so don't get me wrong - it's not only about fighting, it's about how far the MC's influence in this isekai spreads (to me at the moment that is in episode 9). You end up wondering how far the MC will go in this isekai world with his powers - as a slime of course!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10, Art: 10/10, Sound: 10/10, Character: 10/10, Enjoyment: 10/10, \\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 or 9/10",

The story follows a 37 years old virgin that died defending his co-worker from a (potentially) jealous assailant. Then he got reincarnated, but rather than being reincarnated as a human, he got reincarnated as a Slime. The part that really separates itself from any other generic Isekai (another world)genre shows is that the protagonist isn't a teenager, but a fully grown adult man which defines how he acts and reacts  compared to things around him. I wouldn't continue this part as it will get into some spoiler stuffs. The story never takes itself too seriously, putting gags here and there but never takes the jokes too far either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Tensura is just... amazing and jaw dropping even. The vibrant colors, the smooth animation, everything just clicks. I can really tell that this show is made with love and care from it's creators.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound design is amazing, the Slime sound effects, etc etc. I don't really have much to say since I'm not really a master when it comes to sound design.\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending song however, is just fantastic. Especially with the Ending, rather than making you rest after the episode to the point where you are just bored with the Ending song, it makes you hyped for what it has to offer next, which is rare considering that this is an Anime Ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, the fact that our main character Rimuru is previously a full grown adult man really changes the story. And the people (most of them are monsters but don't worry about it) really feels like actual people (except for some that is) while making us not forget that this show is goofy and cartoonish, which is impressive considering that many anime takes itself too seriously to the point where we just can't enjoy the show anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe fact that not only the show perfectly adapts the source material to another medium, but also improves it, really makes me love this show. I had high hopes when it was announced and my hopes were answered, I got more than I wished for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nTensura is a comedic and cartoonish Isekai fantasy show that manages to put a spin to the genre by being really good and enjoyable.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The 8 episodes that have aired up till now, I can safely say that Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is one of the best anime this year. \r\nWhy I say so? \r\nFirst things first. This is an isekai. The bad reputation that isekais have gained over the years with a few exceptions,can surely be overlooked in this anime. Why? WHERE HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PERSON GET ISEKAIED AND TRANSFORMED INTO A F***ING SLIME. \r\nBut in all seriousness this anime deserves a watch. And here's why...\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nThe characters in tensura are absolutely amazing and have an altogether unique characteristic of their own. The MC, our favoriteRimuru is just about the best MC this season (Only if it weren't for Sakuta from bunny girl). He is absolutely the type of character that the fantasy isekai genre is in dire need of (Disregarding sora & shiro, my favorite characters of all time). Rimuru is the major attraction of tensura. Well obviously because he is the slime but even so. But other than Rimuru, the goblins are just amusing (Gobta is love). \\n\\n\r\nPLOT:\\n\r\nThe plot, honestly, until now hasn't been a really intricate one. But seeing the OP and the ED and also from the Manga readers, I can surely say the plot is gonna take an amazing turn by the 12th or the 13th episode. Gotta wait about a month for that though.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nThe OP isn't so great as many other anime's but I have been addicted to it quite a while now. The general soundtrack is good though. It matches the mood of the anime pretty well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall what I can say is that ever since I had taken a break from watching anime for about a month, this anime was pretty much enough to get me hooked and right back on track.",

Though carrying a lot of the isekai-cliches it manages to create an original story which kind of resemble Overlord in the aspects of interacting with the world, learning, and creating and strengthening your society. \r\nStory: The story goes about it mostly like other isekai shows, with the hero/heroine waking up in an unfamiliar world, EXCEPT, he's a slime. He has some basic, but powerfulabilities and a steap learning curve. The story moves slow, making 1 episode only contain a little, but at the same time makes everything light hearted and fun.\\n\r\nPace: Since the pacing as of yet is so slow (I kind of like it) I am putting this as the biggest potential downfall of the story since, really, at 1/4 of the expected airing it still hasn't really gotten far. I'm afraid the this promising show might screw up the pacing, going too slow in the beginning, and then rushing to the end.\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are excellent and I didn't find the opening and ending songs annoying, like I find most.\\n\r\nThere isn't that much development of the characters as of yet, as it has only just begun, but what's there is pretty solid.\\n\r\nSummary: It's good story with a good beginning for its characters, which moves slow. I hope they get the pacing down right and think that, if the pacing ends up too slow in the beginning, that they make it longer, either through more episodes in the current season, or by making more seasons. I think extending the show would be of much more benefit for both the producers, the show and the people watching it, as I can see it becoming a popular anime.",

It's also the only anime where a tsundere dragon gets vored by a slime, so I definitely have to give it credit for that.\r\nHowever, as the show enters the 10+ episode mark, a critical issue becomes apparent. This issue is the fact that the show's writers don't care about the new side characters that are introduced for Rimuru to help with, yet at the same time expect us to care. For some unexplainable reason, the show decides to have some genericshonen fights, perhaps in an attempt to get some free publicity from \"Epic Anime Fight Scene Complication #12 2019\" on YouTube. Yet nothing about these fights is epic. There are no stakes, no \"wow\" moments, no memorable punches...they're just sort of there. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, I really didn't care about what Rimuru was going to do to save the day this time. The fun that was present in the beginning of the series had pretty much diminished as it churned out tropes that could probably be found done better in fantasy shonen from a decade ago.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my harsh criticism over the overall atmosphere/my enjoyment of the series, there are redeemable elements that belonged in a better series. Rimuru is a bit overpowered, but overall a good character. Shizue, the goblins, the wolves, Millim - all of them could've set the ground for a really good fantasy series.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe Slime overall is \"so close, yet so far.\" In the development of the series, an essential checkmark was clearly missed before releasing it: \"isn't freaking boring.\"",

After that I dunno wtf happened, instead of amping up the story and action everything became meaningless.\r\nThis show is still good it has all the characters and world you could want in a show, also a lot of creativity and i'm hoping season 2 will get a little more serious. That's the only thing Slime needs is a seriousarc to take it to the next level. I mean we got some serious side story on episode 24 with Shizu-san, if the whole show took that tone it would be a 10 out of 10 master piece but instead we need to focus on these little kids and meeting demon lords that are all talk and no action. There's all these demons that chat and sip wine in their mansion but why don't we see them do anything? Who knows but that's why I'm hopeful for season 2.",

            "content": "Welcome to my review of the anime 'Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken\", often also just called \"the Slime anime\". This anime is produced by the studio 8bit and it consists of 24 epsidoes, originally 25. The last episode became a special which I am also talking about in this review at its end. The studio 8bit is more or less unknown and rarely comes to attention with a great anime title, if at all. Only three anime they previously did have recognition in the anime community; those being Infinite Stratos, Rewrite, and the most known of all three, Grisaia no Kajitsu (Fruit of Grisaia). Thispretty dry track record might end now. Studio 8bit might find themselves on more contracts after they landed a massive hit with 'That time I got reincarnated as a Slime'. Slime has become a save watch for the last two seasons it aired. Mostly everyone watched this show and just as many praised it. But is the praise justified or this just another overhyped anime title like many others before? \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/plot: Before saying anything, let start with that this anime is an Isekai. I will trust you that you know what that word means in this community. The story starts with Mikami Satoru, a regular everyday nice guy who just happens to get stabbed in the back by a robber out of unfortunate events. What continues is Satoru being reincarnated as a Slime in a Fantasy World. It starts in a cave where he gradually evolves by absorbing and killing various things and creatures. At one point it ends up meeting the storm dragon Veldora who is locked in that cave thanks to a spell. The Slime and the Dragon Form a friendship and give each others names. From then on they are Veldora and Rimuru Tempest. And from that day on Rimuru ends up helping others and bukding up relationships with other creatures.\\n\r\nSo what is this anime about? To steal the words of others I say \"This is not an Isekai, this is Civilization The Anime\". And truly, the anime actually feels more like a civilization building game than an Isekai anime. Even past the civilization point Slime Datta Ken is surprisingly tame when it comes to the themes. Don't get me wrong, there is violence! But the theme and atmosphere of the anime is more or less very friendly and upbeat; something rare these days.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artstyle of Slime Datta Ken is very soft and light. The surrounding and background have a watercolor vibe to them. The characters also look pretty decent. Fighting animation was throughout the show really solid and sometimes even high quality. I don't remember the show dropping in quality at any point but I could have missed it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Openings and Endings were solid, the ending more than the Openings. As far as my personal taste goes both the second OP and ED were the better ones. BGM was also solid but nothing stuck with me. SFX were of course there but I don't remember anything worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are a lot of characters. A lot. Listing everyone is a bit tiring and most of them aren't worth even mentioning. The one and only one worth mentioning is the main character itself, Rimuru Tempest. Carried over from his past life Rimuru still has all his emotions, memories and self. Through these we learn Rimuru's personality. A fellow who likes peace and dislikes conficts and problems. All in all every character is fairly plain and easy constructed. Slime Datta Ken is not a deep anime do it does not need deep anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & verdict (of the main show): I'd say I overall really enjoyed the anime and it was a fun and cool ride. Slime is not the next big thing but it does what it does right. Being a nice more relaxed show is a good change for once. Now do I recommend it? Yes, I would say I recommend it as it is a nice show to watch and for what it does it's a good show. I give this anime an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOVA verdict: Nice finisher for the show but overall unimportant and only slighly funny. If you have the time you can enjoy this last last episode, otherwise you are not going to miss anything amazing or groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it for my review, I hope you liked it and I will see you in my next review!",

            "content": "Fall 2018 and winter 2019 feature a number of isekai(-ish) adaptations, like Goblin Slayer or Shield Hero, with a strong fan base behind them due to popular manga or light novels. Tensei Slime also belongs into this category, however this anime sets itself apart from the competition with one distinct feature \u2013 it is a damn good and entertaining adaptation. The studio even manged to sneak some memes into it.\r\nSCORE: Good - 7\r\nSTORY:\tEntertaining but repetitive.\r\nAs usual for the isekai genre our protagonist is granted a second chance in a fantasy world filled with magic, monsters and game-like systems, instead of eternal afterlife. The catch \u2013main hero is a blue blob, a slime. And this concept works, because there is no world apocalypse to stop or girl\u2019s heart to conquer, at least for now. This is basic escapism with focus on entertainment.\\n\r\nNarrative puts Rimaru in center of outcasts and follows his selfless task to create a peacefull community. This journey is defenitely a fun watch. There are several problems though: all the different story arcs have similar structure and become repetitive after a while: new faction is introduced -> initial conflicts arise -> big battle -> troublemakers are defeated, moderate parts join Slime-sama and get an upgrade. The show peaks midway during the orc invasion arc and cannot infuse its story with new ideas, tension or excitement afterwards. \\n\r\nPacing is like a boulder rolling down a hill. Early episodes can be considered as slow, but they do a great job at introducing the viewer to characters and world with its mechanics, while you crave for more when end creddits roll. As the story progresses, pacing becomes faster and faster; episodes in the second half turn into random events loosely hold together, not a cohesive story with a hook for more slimy content.\\n\r\nThe way characters are treated fuels this displeasure further. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: A one slime show.\\n\r\nSlime-sama is an OP character, he will solve every problem with ease, win every battle and befriend everyone, but does not necessary take the good karma option on every occasion. Blue blob just enjoys his newfound life and does whatever he wants. The show also manages to transfer his joy, optimism or euphory onto the viewer. As an escapism power fantasy projection, this character works exceptionally well and fulfills its purpose.\\n\r\nRimaru collects countless colorful followers. Each time a new group is introduced, those new characters will get a short backstory and a name to segregeta them from faceless redshirts. Fullstop. Expect no further development, as focus shifts with each new arc, older characters have to move to the background and remain frozen in the established master \u2013 subordinate relationship, thus there are no deeper character arcs or any development. Furthermore, this is a one man (slime) show, because everyone else is a support character and is defined through interactions with Rimuru. The show could use at least one character, who walks besides Rimaru, not behind him. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: I could not imagine a blue blob could look this good. \\n\r\nThis show looks good. Character models are detailed, colorful, interesting and stay on model for the entire run; backgrounds utilize a washed-up art style, but can express enough diversity, detail or create beatiful vistas and fit nicely into the slime world. \\n\r\nAnimations are crisp and enhance not only fights, but also mundane everyday scenes. Slime itself looks especially gorgeous with funny grimaces or little details, like dog ears and tail attachements when Rimaru transforms from wolf into a slime in ep2. Kudos to the animators. This is how you fill a seemingly expressionless character with charisma and offer an upgrde from paper onto blue screen, I am looking at you Edgelord Bones & Goblin Scrappypants. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Applause to all voice actors.\\n\r\nOP, ED as well as background music are nothing extraordinary, especially the later one is entirely unnoticeable. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, all the voice actors did a fantasic job and filled every character with soul and joy. It is obvious how much fun people had during recordings and this positive atmosphere is transferred directly into the characters and finally the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nTensei Slime is a prime example how a show can be, if everyone gives their best. Sadly, even the best production team cannot go beyound the boundaries set up by its source material.",

            "content": "It has definitely become a religious offering for every season to have \u201cTHAT\u201d one Isekai that will have a good percentage of the fandom's following no matter how trash it is, in the food industry, that would be where McDonald's ranks up with, something very familiar that's easy to get into with a very simple to grasp concept that remains very true to the \u201cmodern\u201d reception of Anime. Unfortunately, \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d matches up with everything mentioned above, however, as unexpected as it is, the trashy part couldn't be more wrong.\r\nOn the surface, \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d seems like your type ofIsekai where your virgin pervert dude is thrown into a cursed land, along with his magical weapon and a shallow cast of females that form his harem save the world and live happily ever after. \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d has so little in common with your average Isekai and so much more with a world-renowned RPG game with a Skyrim-like depth in both worldbuilding and event handling making every episode more of a save checkpoint that bit by bit get you closer to the end game filling you with a great sense of achievement at the end of your journey.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nTrust me, as generic and boring as it might strike you, it does get a whole lot better. Of course, every Isekai starts the same, the protagonist has to enter a new world after they either die or just give up on their world, sometimes it's just mandatory and doesn't give the said protagonist a chance to decide, but that's irrelevant to this.\\n\r\nYou have this relatable middle-aged dude, somewhat of a capable gentleman of the working class that's just fed u with how he's living, suddenly surrenders his life to save an acquaintance of his, next second he's in another world that screams of RPG, but this time, it's neither an attractive shallow handsome-head that gets all of them hoes neither a powerhouse badass edgy rascal that gets his victory on demand. He just gets reincarnated... as a... S-Slime. I swear I wasn't going for the pun.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot runs through speedy pacing that really does justice to its short self-contained arcs. There is a lot of action and also a balanced amount of dialogue that serves a great deed into building the world around the characters making them feel like an ant, something very insignificant against a much greater entity, but that doesn't limit from their influence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nIf Anime could get sick, one of those devastating plagues would be the lack of inconsistency visually speaking. Some of the fights, not, let's say, all of the fights look outstanding, almost breathtaking with smooth cartography and slick camera movement.\\n\r\nOn a general note, the show does have a noticeable almost warm visual effect layered on everything that makes everything look more greenish and natural that emphasized the medieval theme that houses the event of the story. The colors look bright and attractive while still easy to keep up with the action.\\n\r\nThe anatomy is one other thing I feel they've done right, there is something about it that just screams of RPG, everybody looks like a heavily customizable NPC from a Bethesda game.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nVoice acting wide, I can't really complain about anything while still can't find something to really praise that much, it felt decent, just above average at best, probably the ridiculous of high voices wasn't my cup of tea, but I really have to give it to the sound effects and the background soundtracks, oh, just so good, and you know how much cool abilities from magic to an ever more magical kind of magic, vocally simulating those can be a real challenge but the team behind this side of the show knew what they were doing, straight out of a quality AAA title.\\n\r\nI can spit it the way I have it on my mind, but it's something very satisfying that highlights those short but yet powerful fire burst sound effects.\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were really amazing as well, as you'd grown on them on your favorite RPG, the same was here, you could swear you've had countless hours of fun while watching and paying attention to them like you would do when playing a video game.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\\n\r\nI can't stand for the show and say it had anything revolutionary regarding its character cast if anything, that was a HUGE roster to keep track of. And I'm not kidding, a tremendous amount of new faces make it to the screen every arc, and no, they stay there until the last episode, with is one plus point for not neglecting any characters. Take some notes, Naruto.\\n\r\nIt feels really bad to not give off a slightly higher score on this pick, but I got to really take out my frustrations on some boring and badly written characters that are just there for the same of filling a character spot. Yes, talking about you, Milim, if that was how your correctly spelled and I'm not bothering to check, that's how much I care.\\n\r\nA wide selection of characters are just there as an image of what it's supposed to be a powerhouse, but having a shallow childish figure hold a great title of power and following while being easily swayed by a gram of honey, Nah, that sounds like a wasted potential on a stupid loli from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nYou can imagine the satisfaction I got after every achievement done by the protagonist, as he's narrating what he's going through, you really feel like the person with the controller at hand doing everything yourself, starting off basically from scratch, literally, just a piece of moving slime with no primitive senses or anything to making it into a badass ruler that can start blad thunderbolts with a rise of a finer, just how badass is that?\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.1/10):\\n\r\nI really, really recommend this pick and even dare to recommend it to people that are not into Isekai because it truly does offer a unique experience that a lot of other similar shows fail to deliver upon. It's got likable characters, pacing fast enough to keep the action good and the excitement high all the time, and of course, it's got a lot of hype surrounding it.",

That being said, the characters are rather shallow, also the behavior of the reborn protagonist doesn't really fit his previous life, but who cares? After a while the main theme becomes kind of repetitive, but is still enjoyable and it fits the \"healing\" genre. Also the final arc didn't really fit the previous parts - for some unexplained reason the author decided to completely change the aim of the protagonist and kind of cut away from all of the previousdevelopment, which is a let down, because it means there couldn't really be any grand ending, cliffhanger or anything similar. Manga ends here at this point.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 24-25:\\n\\n\r\nPutting opening, ending and 20 minutes of TV static would be more enjoyable then what they did. One looks like a sped up attempt to lure the viewer to the next series (because of the lack of anything of the sorts thanks to ending an arc at EP23 - probably the biggest mistake) and the EP25 other was replaced by OVA recap?",

            "content": "Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken, or from now on Slime Anime, started as your generic transferred into another world, but with a catch anime, like the dime a dozen other Isecai. This time the catch is that our MC becomes a slime of all things. Mmmokay.... Seems fair, I could watch this. \r\nAnd thankfully so, for the first 15 episodes as so I didn't regret watching it.\r\nThe MC has character, more than the average lone wolf teenager who just wants to be nice to everyone and everything works just fine for him...\r\nNah, our MC got his powers from a godly being, and has some stupidlybroken powers that can end all fights in 2 seconds if he wants... Wait this isn't where I wanted to go with this... Uhm...\\n\r\nYes, our MC has a broken ability as mentioned that lets him get stronger by each confrontation he passes. But in all honesty, this is not something that damages the show's enjoyment factor like some other titles in the genre. Why? Because again, the MC has character. You can relate to him. Or something like that...\\n\r\nThe first few episodes focuses on character and world building, which is nice, then concludes in a smaller fight sequence. Yay! Action. However, the show\u2019s most enjoyable part (in my humble, yet insignificant opinion) starts after these episodes, where it becomes some sort of Sims city, the anime, fantasy edition, where we get to see MC progressively build a community of all the characters that gets introduced one by one in the following episodes in a way where every character has its own place in the community, yet the older characters to which we get to love doesn\u2019t get forgotten, they are always in their place. THIS made me really like Slime anime. Each faction that gets integrated to this community has its own little arc, but the older ones never get in the shadow of the new members. (I\u2019m repeating myself, am I?) I also have to mention that there is one person, who similarly has her own small arch of integration who I dislike to a degree, due to her little pinky haired destructive nature that has no place in the story what so ever because her voice and looks and personality is annoying as heck and I hate her and I despise her and\u2026\u2026 ok, I\u2019m calm now\u2026\\n\r\nAnyway, the world building in this anime is really taught trough so for that only reason I recommend you, oh thy reader of my humble review, to watch Slime anime.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER\u2026. After the last \u201ccommunity building arch\u201d Slime anime becomes something that I would moderately describe as a waste of time. Remember that lovely community that we saw developing with craft and care, housing countless character that are enjoyable and lovable (except you pinky hair)?\\n\r\nYou better forget them, cuz you never see them again in this season. What we get is our MC wandering off to \u201cI don\u2019t care about this place\u201d kingdom because apparently there is some business there with some characters we never met, and probably not worth switching with THE ENTIRE SET OF CHARACTERS we get to know. Other than MC and his loyal companion doggo, nobody gets to do anything ever again from the old set. Remember when I said that the old characters were introduced in a way, one by one that the older ones don\u2019t get out shadowed? This is the complete opposite of it\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnd the problems are not just with the last episodes\u2026 \\n\r\nThere are huge problems with the pacing. Each ark has its own mini events. We get introduced to the problem, we get to meet the new characters, we get to know their backgrounds, and then we get to know about the impending doom approaching our beloved community. We think of a solution but the uncertainty is always lingering in the backgrounds not knowing if the city of the Slime god, all hail thy will gonna survive or going to be reduced to ashes and salt. Then\u2026 big baddie of the arch is defeated in half an episode\u2026 Really?\\n\r\nSooo\u2026. Art and sound is okay. Don\u2019t ask me about OP and ED because I skip them always\u2026 aaand with that should be it.\\n\\n\r\nTL.DR: Good characters, great first half, mehish second half, horrible pacing,\\n\r\nRecommend watching it.\\n",

            "content": "That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is not your average isekai. For further proof just read the name again. On first glance, a show where the main character is a slime doesn\u2019t sound all that interesting. I mean there is only so much a ball of gelatinous ooze can do. Yet this show somehow pulled it off and became one of the most beloved anime\u2019s of the year. \r\nOne thing I love about the story for Isekai Slime (I\u2019m too lazy to write out the whole name) is how our main character becomes a slime in the first place. The way the worldgrants him these powers makes sense based off the situation that he finds himself in in the first episode. Now that he\u2019s a slime he should be really weak, but once again because of how the story establishes the world, when our slime boy uses his form to become OP it makes sense. His greatest power however is the power of friendship and before you stop reading in disgust let me explain why it\u2019s the best thing to happen to this show. By our MC befriending everyone we get to watch the world grow, and see characters that we would normally despise come into their own. It\u2019s very refreshing to see a story truly value all of its characters rather than use them as fodder for our MC to show off. Instead our slime boy allows others to take the spotlight. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this show is pretty good. From what I could see, most of it was drawn in 2D with just a splash of cgi here and there but it never distracted me from what was going on. Opening and ending songs were kind of meh but that\u2019s just me. The one thing I disliked was how the show teases future events in the opening song. It\u2019s not that it spoils anything, but it can be frustrating to see events that are a long way off from happening. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a surprise for me. I didn\u2019t know watching an isekai about a slime could be so enjoyable and refreshing. So if you are looking for something different among the constant wave of isekai fanfare or are just looking for a wholesome feel-good fantasy then consider giving this a watch.",

Not many important detail skipped.\r\nThis series is not an intense action series, or Drama, so If you looking for an intense battle scene, or drama or romance I suggest look for something else. Tensura is more like a slice of life withbattle sometimes at least in Tensura S1\\n\\n\r\nAs such I like the character in Tensura very much especially the side character. Because their interaction and development is very amusing to watch. I enjoy my time watch this series just because it is fun, light and help me a lot to relax.\\n\\n\r\nAgain this is a very chill series with some world building, and heartwarming moment. It is not action anime, drama, romance, or something tense. There is no world to save at least for now, just a slime want to make a place to live happily with his friend. So do not take it seriously. In fact they never too tense. It is like you expect anime like non non biyori to be intense.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a slice of life series just to relax after working I suggest give this a chance.\\n",

            "content": "This show as a whole has been an absolute blast. Remembering back to when it was announced about a year ago now and I'd never even heard of it before to now being so immersed with the novels, manga, and anime is crazy to think about. I probably wasn't the biggest isekai person beforehand but slime, along with others, helped me be more open to them. This whole season has been a joy really. I've enjoyed pretty much all of it. \r\nRimuru and the cast were great with how fleshed out and diverse they all are. Rimuru being able to bring all different creatures togetherin an island of misfit toys kind of way was very endearing. From Gobta to Benimaru to Milim to Shion, loved em all. Not a too many characters I disliked. Seeing Rimuru grow his influence and footprint in the world has been really fun. I think that's what sums this show up best, Fun. Cause it's just plain old blast. A Saturday morning cartoons kind of feel to it. Goofy at times sure and the pacing goes up and down but just........fun. \\n\\n\r\nA good ole fantasy adventure which I can appreciate when it's done so well and with so much passion. I truly think that 8bit put their best into this. Adaptation flaws aside I believe it was done with passion just like the source. The action always looked sharp with all the big scale set pieces that happened. From a technical aspect it was really good. Big bright and welcoming. Music was great too. The\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is without doubt one of the best isekai out there. High on stakes and gravitas, no. But fun as hell and a good time, unquestionably. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSee you next year Rimuru!!!",

            "content": "I feel like sometimes we are scraping the bottom of the barrel for Isekai ideas...well that is if you only watched the first couple of episodes. Don't get me wrong, the whole genre feels really over saturated at this point but it is a really popular genre+. But you do get some that stand out from the heap and have some very intriguing aspects. So take this anime for example. Another standard fantasy isekai anime but the protagonist is instead a creature that is considered weak by fantasy standards. But then you realise that is not enough so you have to think of something. Thenyou have an idea, how about make it the anime equivalent of Civilisation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax and be friends with Ghandi because he has all of those nukes as a I present to you the anime review for That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWe begin with seeing a middle aged business man by the name of Satoru Mikami getting stabbed by a random assailant and is bleeding to death. With his friend by his side, he tells him that his final wish is for him to destroy his hard hard drive on the computer (clearly a man who has correctly prioritised his wishes). Instead of passing to the great beyond though, he finds himself reincarnated as a slime. Trying to figure out where he is, running into some colourful characters and given the name Rimuru Tempest. He sets out onto the new world and prepares to leave his mark on the world, whether intentional or not. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the first couple of episodes features a slime making conversation with a Tsundere dragon, you know you are in for something special here. And that is somewhat the case as the story goes on. The story feels like the it is split into different arcs as there always seem to be a new obstacle or threat that Rimuru has to overcome. Normally in different scenarios which is nice because sometimes you need to watch something more relaxing or something more intense and it seems to know when it wants to do a more relaxing arc or a more intense arc. Although, the more battle heavy arcs don't carry too much tension since the good guys are overpowered as f**k but it is always nice to live out a power fantasy, but that is just accepting that these guys and gals are strong. Is that a bad thing? Well the show gives us some reasons as to why some of these characters are strong or get stronger. Rimuru gains the powers of whatever he devours, so we him gain more power as he fights greater and greater threats. As for the rest of the cast, the power of the name is what gives them strength because they are given and identity rather than be some nameless monster. \\n\\n\r\nBut what this show does well is it takes what is good about an Isekai anime and builds on it. Discovering a new world, meeting unique people and creatures, gaining strength over time and becoming an important figurehead of the world. But Rimuru doesn't do it by gaining strength and power, he does it by building a society of monsters. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot of this story IMO is Rimuru is trying to help build a society for monsters to coexist together in harmony. What starts off as uniting a tribe of Goblins with a pack of Direwolves turns into a massive community consisting of Goblins, Direwolves, Trolls, Dwarves, Orcs, Lizardmen and Dryads and living in peace together, as well as making alliances and trade agreements with neighbouring kingdoms. Rimuru doesn't simply ask or has it fall on his shoulder, he has either earn, make deals or create scenarios where it can benefit both parties. It is nice to see Rimuru simply trying to reach out instead of simply giving it to them because would you immediately make a deal with a slime? The show plays on the stereotypes of typical fantasy monsters and makes sure that the monsters are treated as equals to the rest of society by earning their respect. That what this show does well, it makes Rimuru have to earn their respect, rather than just giving it to him. \\n\\n\r\nThe show narrative is enjoyable to watch...for the first half of this show. The second half is where I think momentum starts to slow down and we just get episodes that have moments but is just a load of meh. Not really exciting or emotional or tense or anything like that. While it does still have its comedy moments, the second half feels lacklustre. I put the blame on its weaker second sub plot that I will get into later on. Then it just ends, like that. Nothing to get me hyped for another season, it just ends and we're given two filler episodes to round out the show. Even the finale episode that ends the current story ends in a montage sequence for about half the episode. Talk about going out on a whimper. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRimuru Tempest is indeed the main character of this show and honestly, it is nice to see an overpowered character not get everything handed to him, or her, or it. Slimes don't have genders but since Rimuru was originally a male businessman, I'll just refer to it as a male. Okay so Rimuru is, like other Isekai protagonists, a vessel used to allow us to see the world that he (as well as us) does not know about. So how do you get around doing that? Well building a society of course. Being a slime obviously has its disadvantages as slimes are considered cannon fodder enemies by fantasy standards. So when a slime is the leader of a community of monsters, well then people are just going to get confused. So Rimuru has to earn the respect of the people he comes across in order to make sure he is not some average slime. Of course his overpowered status does help but he also uses his knowledge of a businessman and thinks with a level head to get out of scenarios unscathed and benefits him and the people that serve under him. For example, when you encounter a rather chirpy daemon girl with overwhelming power, what would you do? Would you do \\n\r\na) Face her in a one on one battle. \\n\r\nb) Send your subordinates after her. \\n\r\nc) Make peace with her. \\n\r\nd) Plead for mercy and serve her like a dog. \\n\r\nIf you answered any of those, you would not benefit the people you are protecting. Rimuru would rather do a bit of a) and a bit of c) so that Rimuru would get her attention but not go to far in order not to danger the lives he is protecting. He doesn't just recklessly charge in but instead assess the situation and tires to come up with a solution for any scenario. I respect that because he is thinking of the situation logically rather than just being reckless. It really does make him a great protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is vast and varied with various quirks and personalities and they are all endearing. Some fall into stereotypes but with a cast this big, I can forgive that. There are some standout obviously. Gabiru is a Lizardmen that is so full of himself as to being a great leader and great warrior that is just funny for him to get thwacked and gut punched when he totally deserves it. Millim who appears later in the series has a very nice chirpy personality and childlike wonder that acts as a wild card and a constant headache for Rimuru. Then there is Gobuta, who acts as the lovable underdog who wouldn't think would kick your ass until he does. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one character in this show however that I think the show underdeveloped and that's Shizue Izawa. Despite being a main driving force for Rimuru when going forward, her overall relevance to the plot and screen time feels small despite being supposed to be a major element to the plot. Her main relevance is to give Rimuru a human form and that's really it. The whole subplot about fulfilling her final wishes is rather underwhelming and rather tedious at times. It only really comes into the final episodes of the show where she is an important factor but I feel you could have some some small rewrites and you wouldn't see much of a change. Some people might not agree with me on this point but it was a nagging factor for me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nLets just say I'm not a big fan on the show's art style. It looks rather poor and does not look like a lot of effort was put into it. Particularly with the foresty areas where the backgrounds looked poorly drawn and was hastily put together. Some aspects and locations were slightly done better but honestly, it really does look primitive and I do not like it. Character designs are better in this regard and varied. Gobuta in particular is my favourite for its intentions. Gobuta design looks crappy compared to the others but I think that it was intentional because it hampers in that Gobuta is an underdog that doesn't look like he can kick your ass. So that is a nice touch. The animation itself fine. Sometimes the fight scenes can bring the best out of the animation but other times, it looks very meh, even cheap at times. So it can be inconsistent but it never really bothered me. Although I do like the expressions Rimuru makes which is nice since a slime doesn't really make facial expressions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack I would say does its job well. There always seems to be a soundtrack made for the scenario and I enjoyed it. While none particularity stand out, they definitely add to a scene. Whether it is a more calming scene, a sense of foreboding or a battle scene, there always seem to be a nice OST to compliment to a scene. \\n\\n\r\nI also particularly enjoyed the openings as well. Notice I said openings, so both of them are good IMO. \"Nameless story\" and \"Meguru Mono\" (which are both done Takuma Terashima) have good production values and does well at showing the cast and giving them a nice spotlight. Both vocal performances are also definitely good as well of the instrumentals matching the pace that the opening is trying to match. If I had to choose one, it would probably be the first one because the animation is top notch and something that the rest of the anime wishes to be like. The endings as well add are nice extensions to the openings as they act as nice closing sequences to the ending of each episode so I particularly enjoyed them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nSlime definitely has its quirks that make it an enjoyable Isekai anime. It does stumble in some area, mainly in animation and some areas in the character department, but does have the necessary niches that make Isekai anime enjoyable and then some. The way the story progresses, how Rimuru grows his reputation, the huge cast of characters that are enjoyable in their own right for the most part and having good openings. Even the second opening stands out in a winter season that is f***ing stacked with good anime openings. Yet the show does stumble in the its major subplot and kind of fizzles out in the end, leaving to a rather unsatisfying conclusion. It left me not hyped for Season 2 of this show whereas and ending that has to be continued for another season should get me hyped.  \\n\\n\r\nThe appeal in Slime however, is that it takes what is good about an Isekai anime and runs with it. The power fantasy, the unexplored world, the characters you meet along the way. They are all here. And since they are all aspects I enjoyed, that should make it a highly recommended anime right? Yes and No. Power fantasy is something that only some people will enjoy and some people will criticise it. Even though the show does a good job of explaining it, it probably won't persuade people.\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 7/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 6.9/10  Recommendation: Consider it",

            "content": "To be honest the amount of good reviews this anime has baffles me. It feels like an anime that was made for kids but ended up being marketed to the older fan base. I have a few but very major problems with this anime and here they are:\r\nMy first problem is with the story. The start is promising, the last word being \"Erase my Hard Drive\" was gold. But it takes a strange turn from there. I feel the story takes too many sharp turns to avoid confrontations because it would be a pain to resolve them. Like the part about punishing the orcs orthe absolute submissions of the wolves after their leader was killed. It's understandable why the indestructible slime has such an easy time trusting these people but there is little to no politics shown in areas where a political story line would thrive. Most moment that are supposed to be meaningful feel a little forced and therefore takes all meaning out of them. Fights for the most part are settled in the quickest way possible which usually leads to the other character submitting in fear (that seems to be intended for comedic effect but falls closer to the line of shameless), laughing as though they are some high and mighty being that approve of the little guy and are impressed by him and his potential to grow (of which we barely see any) or coming to the realization that they messed up big time and being defeated. There no sense of danger and every battle is just a wait until the MC takes on the main bad guy and defeats him, later finding some reason to forgive everyone involved in the incident as though nothing happened, a sentiment which is then also followed by everyone under his wing. Then comes the unconditional love of all creatures for a being who has named them. This is one aspect that is not further explored. The tension between characters is non existent and plagues the story, making it almost unbearable. Think about being in a room where everyone is supportive, happy, excited and jumpy but all the while giving the impression that it is all fake, that's how genuine a feeling you get when watching this anime\\n\\n\r\nNext the Characters. The development of characters is one of the laziest I have seen in anime. It's not Isekai wa Smartphone bad but not impressive nonetheless. It seems as though the character just have an epiphany about how great Slime-sama is and just fall in love with him. The goblins are perhaps the only ones with a justifiable reason as to why they trust him so much: they are a weak race that found a protector. But the other races seam to just trust him because why not. The only character with an extensive backstory is the hero who only appears for a short while and is then killed off to give the MC a body. Their undying loyalty to the slime leaves little to no wiggle room for moral dilemmas or story arcs of personal growth and redemption for the other characters.  It's as though they are on the same page about everything and have no thoughts of their own, one example being how the ogres choose to forgive the orcs after their entire clan was wiped out simply because the slime said so. The uniformity of their thoughts leaves a bad taste in my mouth because in any situation it is a given that people have different opinions, one of the reasons I don't like this show as much as others. The MC seems to be too good to be relatable with. There are no impending flaws in his character as shown by his almost infinite forgiveness and self sacrifice. He constantly makes moves that would make the people rely on him more and then seems surprised as to why that happens in the first place. There is only extreme bad and extreme good with the only in between being the extreme good being influenced by the extreme bad to do bad things.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you're not looking for something to get attached to and just want a casual watch then this anime is a good place to go. Otherwise I suggest skipping it.",

He makes some friends and they go on merry hijinks together and just have a good time. \r\nThe story in the first half of the series was great, but then I guess they didn't realize they only had 23 episodes to work with on the main protagonist. What I'm trying to say is the pacing ramped up near the end and I felt that. But besides that, the story was pretty great, made me tear up a couple times.\r\nArt isgreat to look at, I'd stare at the landscapes for days, honestly. But since this is an animation, there has to be good sound, right? Right. The sound mixes with the scenery pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were funny and interesting when they were the main focus of the story. Then they became background characters once their arcs were resolved, except for like maybe 3. Since the story is focused on slime dude, I guess they didn't want to take the spotlight away, or something.\\n\\n\r\nI really had fun watching this, it's one of the few Isekai anime I enjoy. Some of the arcs were funny, and some of them had me wondering what was gonna happen next. One of them made me cry. Just one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, isekai is still trash.

I found it mediocre at best, and often found myself not paying attention to the story. But 23 episodes in.. it kind of grew on to me. I kind of am looking forward for the next episodes now.\r\nSo, it starts off with a 37 year old man, who is perfectly \"content\" with his boring life going and meeting his junior. There's this weird murderer running around with a knife. While trying to save Jr. the man gets stabbed instead and his only dying wishis for his Hard disk to be wiped off completely. Anyway, he dies and the next thing we know, he's reincarnated as a slime in another world and is making friends with a dragon, killing various monsters and eating them to absorb their powers, ruling a town of goblins, also ruling direwolves, and a lot of other weird shit. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I like about this anime is that it does focus on world building and does not rush into a story line too fast (barring a few times, at least). \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are likeable (including Gabiru, yes). And the mc, Rimuru is actually really good, and not annoyingly so. Usually, a lot of do-good characters become a little annoying with their whole justice stance and lawful-good attitude, but Rimuru is still very likeable.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did not like about this anime was that it did not give time to the characters to grow on the viewers before making them disappear. And then they expected us viewers to feel something for them. \\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SKIP THIS NEXT LINE cough cough Shizu cough cough. I personally thought they should have given her more time, because I didn't really feel for her when she died or even after that. END OF SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nAlso, what's the deal with Veldora? He is mentioned in, like, every other episode. But he was actually present in only the first two episodes before Rimuru ate him. When will they find out how to get him out, and what is he going to do??",

Although the plot is quite simple, the adventure is interesting enough to keep your attention and always wanting to know what happens next. It is very feel good, lighthearted with a main character that is kind, altruistic, and helps others throughout, seeming to improve the lives of everyone he meets. It definitely has a lot of the feel of other anime in the isekai genre, but it seems much less intense than most and instead much more feel good. The action sequences are pretty average, but each of them are important to the development and seem worthwhile",

            "content": "I've written a review previously when I've first started watching the anime till episode 6.\r\nBut I just had to write another to update my point on why this anime received a 10/10 for me.\r\nMy first thoughts when I saw the trailer of the anime before it began airing was 'It's going to be another one of those *typical* Isekai animes...'\r\nI take that back. This is a gem among the Isekai animes.\r\nFirstly, I'd like to address the incongruous juxtaposition. How do I put it, well... The concept of the main character, a slime. It isn't exactly ironic nor oxymoronic nor paradoxical but you get the point.Using a slime as the main character and making the main character an overpowered character with seemingly limitless power is well, contradictory.\\n\\n\r\nWe normally see slimes in games or in anime as weak monsters. Taking a generally classified weak monster and turning it into an overpowered being surpassing even the reputably strongest of all time was a spark of creativity!\\n\\n\r\nIt allows many stories to be plotted, many paths and directions for the anime to develop. Naturally, people will underestimate the slime MC, Rimuru.\\n\\n\r\nThis allows for development and turn the anime into a pure Isekai masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also teaches us not to judge a book by it's cover.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there are many routes for Overpowered MC animes. Most tend to take the 'humble MC route' with the MC doing everything behind the scenes and no one recognizing the MC except a select few. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken(Slime for short) takes a similar route except that it adds in a few twists to allow it to not be one of those 'Typical Isekai Anime'.\\n\\n\r\n1. Slime doesn't have an MC who is the strongest being in the world, at least not at the beginning. The anime adds in a few fillers at the beginning to showcase Rimuru's starting ability. An ability that allows him to take other monster's abilities by devouring them. This ability allowed us to see how Rimuru turned from nothing to something. Since he only had that ability in the beginning he was pretty weak until he began to devour more and more opponents and became extremely strong.\\n\\n\r\n2. Slime's main character Rimuru is humble. Like alot of Isekai MCs, Rimuru doesn't want attention because less attention means less trouble. This is logical and boring therefore, the anime forcefully brings trouble to him. That way, Rimuru can develop himself, his abilities, his relationships and many more.\\n\\n\r\n3. Rimuru isn't the strongest. There are characters stronger than him. In fact there are many characters that can rival Rimuru but eventually Rimuru overcame them \\n\r\n(P.S He became the strongest in the end :P spoiled u)\\n\\n\r\nRimuru knows his place. If the opponent is someone beyond his level, he will use other methods to subdue his enemy be it bribery, sweet talking etc.\\n\r\nLike how he handled best girl Milim, loved it!\\n\\n\\n\r\n4. Rimuru is logical and wise/crafty. He respects all his opponents and friends and rarely looks down on anyone. This allows him to not underestimate his opponents and also devise strategies to minimize combat sometimes through sweet-talking. He tries to avoid fighting unless it is really necessary\\n\\n\r\n5. Like every other Isekai anime, we need cool fight scenes. And Slime accomplished that no problem. 8-bit's art was great, I have no complains and the fight scenes were epic, so were the character designs I loved all the characters very much, not to mention the goblins here. They look way better than Goblin Slayer especially since there are waifu candidates amongst the goblins themselves!\\n\\n\r\n6. The voice acting was exquisite, Rimuru since he was genderless also had a voice that somehow made me feel like he's half-man half-woman. Fits perfectly!\\n\r\nRimuru also always sounds very playful and cheerful yet sounding wise, like he's always thinking. When its time to get serious, Rimuru's voice doesn't got full salt and commanding. Afterall, who can follow orders from someone who's screaming and not calm? The writer knows a leader has to always think things through, be calm and handle situations with the best possible method.\\n\r\nOther character's voice also fit their personality very very well, for example Hakurou, the old man's voice also had a cool tune to it! The anime even took a new high when it somehow also fitted the character's faces. That's no easy fit!\\n\\n\r\nNot only voice acting, the sound effects were epic. The epic wind sound effects and blast sounds... Epic!\\n\\n\r\n7. Lastly, what I love about the anime is that Rimuru despite being humble he doesn't go fully unrecognized. Unlike Saitama, when Rimuru lets say, saves a town from an attack, there will at least be one or two people that recognize his help and be grateful towards him by  returning the favor by helping him out in other aspects. This eventually let for story development and allowed Rimuru to build his own town eventually through helping strangers and befriending them.\\n\\n\r\nBeing humble is nice but getting at least some recognition is nicer!\\n\r\nRimuru doesn't want attention so sometimes he disguises himself when he uses some of his powers to TRASH what seems like an impossible to defeat monster.\\n\\n\r\nLike when he saves a kingdom from being attacked using little to no effort. The kingdom is a human kingdom so the monster that attacked, let's say a dragon is an impossible-to-defeat monster to the humans while to Rimuru, it's like fighting ants. Being the humble MC that he is, he saves the kingdom in disguise.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that he still gets rewarded by certain people that saw through the disguise and are in his gratitude, helping him keep his anonymous identity whilst helping him out by returning the favor through other methods.\\n\\n\r\nI love that style the anime takes and its completely different from typical Isekai animes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, no character break. I know animes like Overlord that went to the evil MC side by season 2, all in the name of character development and there's nothing wrong with that.\\n\r\nBut I still like Rimuru's wise strategising, witty thinking, humorous personality and his humbleness. And till episode 12, it had only improved. He didn't change much except that he became more wise and understanding since he has since fought many battles, faced hardships and established many relationships. I love that about this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly and my overall opinion/conclusion. The supporting characters. In this anime, there are many characters and they all get featured multiple times each one playing a role to make story development starting from Tsundere Dragon Veldora which helped explain certain things later, Goblin Rigurd whom helped with the development of Rimuru's town, my waifu Shion that later became Rimuru's self proclaimed secretary and helped Rimuru along the way all the way till best girl and number one waifu Milim Nava that helped Rimuru protect his town, introduce Rimuru to other demon lords and also taught Rimuru some fighting techniques which was all in the name of TRUE development!\\n\\n\r\nThis was everything I wished for in an Isekai anime,\\n\\n\r\nThis was  That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime  .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSound - 10 (Milim so kawaiiiiiii)\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nOverall - 10",

And that\u2019s only because I\u2019m so baffled as to how this series has been getting so much praise above other Isekai. Every issue that the anime community has with Isekai all exist, in full force, within Slime.\r\nWhen this series first started I quite in enjoyed. Slimes are typically low leveled creatures in RPG games. My initial reaction to the title was that this would be a series about a man reincarnating into a fantasy world as one of the weakest creatures. Which would have been immensely interesting to see.\r\nHowever, whatwe received is an overpowered MC, with no flaws, and is barely breaking a sweat surviving in a new world.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first few episodes, despite the OP MC. They were very feel go and it was entertaining seeing the MC adjust to this world and meeting the creatures that inhabit it.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for this to get old though. Then you realize that the show has no conflict. Technically there is conflict within the story, but I say \u201cno conflict\u201d because MC solves every issue so effortlessly that it might as well not have been a problem to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI think the thing that annoys me the most is the fact that the main cast have no type of disagreements or grievances was Rimuru. Everyone just has overwhelming love for him and worships him. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s Slime Jesus.\\n\\n\r\nI guess people like the feel good, stress free nature of the series. But You can\u2019t keep a action series running with no tension or struggle between the heroes and villains. And it\u2019s not like the series exceeds in animation, art, and sound. It\u2019s all average on those fronts\\n",

It doesn't suffer from many common writing problems, but the author tries to do so much to introduce different parts of the world that there may be too much information to fit into a short amount of time, and that becomes apparent in the show.\r\nThis is the problem with many of the isekais that are nowadapted into shows - they were originally novels or some form of long, written literature and that is hard to convert into a video series without seriously cutting out content or spending an enormous amount of money and time.\\n\\n\r\nMany characters are presented, they get their time in the spotlight, and then more characters are introduced. While it isn't a terrible enjoyment, it leaves little room for development with existing characters outside of the main few.\\n\\n\r\nThis show, while quite good, will suffer what I would consider \"Isekai syndrome\" - In the efforts to introduce a vast new world, the writer gets caught up in the details and much of the time is just spent introducing new things instead of developing what is already there, and you can see that in the show, with each new character only making a short appearance.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who would like an example of developing what is already there, an older example would be KonoSuba. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I think TenSura is certainly good, it's not really groundbreaking in the genre. It's enjoyable, there's bits of humor, you can see Rimuru's character development, but it's not anything that's going to be the new standard for the genre. Don't let this dissuade you from watching the show however - it is still one of the better shows as of late.\\n",

            "content": "(Please note there are minor spoilers in this review)\r\nEmma Coats, a storyboard artist at Pixar listed 22 rules of storytelling on Twitter. Of those 22, one applies heavily to this anime:\r\n\"You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.\"\r\nI want you to keep this rule in mind until the very end of this review. \r\nReincarnated as a Slime hooked me in with a very interesting premise: the MC is reincarnated into a fantasy world as a slime (surprise, surprise). To me, this was interesting because you'd generally think that a slime is supposed to be the weakest creature in a fantasy setting, right?So how does MC manage to change anything in this world as such a laughable mob?\\n\\n\r\nHere's the catch: as a slime, the MC can absorb any ability/form of any creature he digests. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so that sounds a little OP at first, but I accepted it. Maybe there was some sort of drawback to this that the anime can throw in to really make you and MC think. And also, the opening DID immediately spoil that MC is going to get a human form anyways, basically making the idea that he'll struggle being stuck as a slime pointless... but I wanted to still give the show a fair chance.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the beginning, you see MC working hard to absorb whatever monsters and items he can in his initial setting and then using those new skills and items later on to assist others and himself. My initial reactions were the same as most of the other high-scoring reviewers of this show: it was cute to see everyone getting along because MC came by and started helping them with their problems. I had a grin and some good laughs along the way, too. \\n\\n\r\nI started thinking to myself: \"Wow! MC is a really good hero! He's fighting for peace and helping so many people! MC is a great hero! MC is... a perfect hero. MC is perfect, like how I wanna be.\"\\n\\n\r\nMC is perfect, like how I wanna be. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the biggest problem lies.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it was adorable to see MC being so successful at first despite his (supposedly) limited form, that feeling quickly began to die down as the episodes ticked away. While considering the failures to successes MC has faced, you begin to realize how unbalanced the scale is in favor of his successes. MC resolves conflicts with little to no struggle; you can literally see this with how his face seldom turns into concern especially in the later episodes when they're (supposedly) fighting a formidable foe. MC's plans almost always work, and if they don't, it's because someone else screwed up rather than his plan being flawed.\\n\\n\r\nThen, you begin to size up MC's relationships with other characters. NOBODY, other than the bad guys, has an issue with him. And if they do, they either get slapped silly out of a misunderstanding and end up bowing at his feet, or outright destroyed/humiliated. You even have certain female characters closely associated with MC fighting over his affection. Everybody loves MC, including one character who had his dad killed by him.\\n\\n\r\nMC isn't flawed as a slime. He's OVERPOWERED as one.\\n\\n\r\nMC is God incarnate; everyone bows to MC because he is capable of doing literally anything. Super strong bad guys? MC will take them out or convert them into good guys. Fatally injured good guys? MC will easily heal them back and even give them an upgrade if he hasn't already. \\n\\n\r\nThe last nail to the coffin for me came at the end of Episode 13, where the viewer is presented with a shot of MC flying with bat wings in the air as he's in his human form. This scene bothered me the most because it basically encapsulated the whole problem I was having with the show now. That initial interest about how MC will survive as a measly slime? Gone, because again, he's overpowered. He even has a human form now, so what is really lost with him being reincarnated as a slime? \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 14 hammered that nail down, with how MC disposed of a major foe. I won't spoil how, but this is all you need to know: there was little struggle, it wasn't a very long fight, and in the end, everything worked out for the MC and crew. I know there was one last episode of the season and there's probably more content coming afterwards. But by this point, I was done, and I doubt one more episode was somehow going to fix these issues.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't matter how good or bad you think the sound or animation is. The fact of the matter is, Reincarnated as a Slime is a power-fantasy. And that isn't a good thing for a show that sets itself up by making the MC seem like he's set in an impossible situation he has to work around. \\n\\n\r\nStill remember that quote I started this review with? Well, here it all comes, full circle.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes a character memorable to the most possible people is what method and how long it takes for the character to overcome an obstacle, be it a physical or emotional one. It isn't how much cool shit they can pull off while they're on-screen. It's the flaws of the character, how those flaws impact the relationships and situations the character is in, and how the character develops to fix those flaws (if he/she even fixes them at all by the end of the show/season). Reincarnated as a Slime's MC has none of that. He's already well set; he isn't scared of combat and whenever he has been so far, his fears were clearly misplaced as he's basically immortal by this point. And keep in mind, we're in SEASON ONE.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm judging this show too soon; maybe there is more to it that will show the MC's flaws and he'll really grow as a character. Maybe MC will face a serious challenge pushing his wits. But so far, I haven't seen any of that, not even in the art somehow. In my mind, the show has gone from: \"Oh jeez, I wonder how all the characters will get out of this!\" to \"I wonder when MC is gonna show up to quickly fix this problem?\" The stakes are too damn low and have been from the very beginning. And consequently, it creates a show with lost potential. \\n\\n\r\nReincarnated as a Slime isn't SAO done right. It's SAO, slime-boy edition (minus the gaming).\\n\\n\r\nInteresting original concept, poorly executed to keep any serious interest. \\n\\n\r\n5/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I would advise my friends who don't watch anime on weekly basis, even not at all, to see this anime and begin with this anime and take into consideration that this isekai is the absolute best isekai I have seen so far. \r\nStory score 9(even 9.75):\r\nThis story is very smooth and easy and is different from many isekai anime recently, the story reminds me of Overlord but it's more smooth and less messy butlike 2 episodes so far were a little bit dull but the rest of the anime ( so far) has a very good pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt score 10:\\n\r\nThe art is really good especially the part of the great sage ability whose animations are remarkably beautiful also all the abilities have very good animation and in general, the animations are really good throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound score 10:\\n\r\nThe opening song is really good and catchy I listened to it in loops for 1 week straight, when I think about this anime the opening song jumps to my mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter score 10:\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed throughout the anime and the characters, I think, is what makes this anime so different from other isekai where there is a protagonist who is totally overpowered just from spawning in the other world. The protagonist here learns the complexity and problems of the world and he isn't full of himself, he is aware of his problems and weak points even though he seems overpowered. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment score 10:\\n\r\nThis anime is very smooth, it has some clever jokes and funny moments, which is a thing that I also really love about this anime.",

The only problem i've had with the show overall is the use of repeating a joke from previous episodes making interactions with some characters very predictable. An example is there is one character who doesn't talk just grunts every time he's on screen then Rimuru yells maybe to himself I can't tellto have him talk every time, it was funny then got one ha now I want that character killed.  That is my only complaint.  I find the OP very well done it has a fun adventurous feel to it while showing off the characters and their skills.  The artwork is amazing, I also feel they give Rimuru good character development for such a powerful character.  overall an 8.75/10",

            "content": "*mild SPOILERS ahead*\r\nTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken or That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, is your typical Isekai anime/manga in the sense that it takes someone, and gives them an insane OP power in a new fantasy world. What makes Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken unique however, is the idea of building relationships with people that aren't wholly dependent on the main character. It is shown numerous times that the main sub characters can look after themselves, and as such their is no need for the main character to make a harem. However, if you are into that kind of thing, a harem(esq)notion does exist - but thankfully it isn't really explored. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also pretty interesting. It may not be unique - I grant you - but it is done in a thoughtful, and in a cunning way. Without spoiling too much Rimuru (the main character), has two main objectives. First, is to make and develop her country that she found. The second being is to look after the children that her friend was looking after. What is great about this is that the story takes its time into flushing out these two objectives, making long and satisfying arcs. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, their are some down sides (IMO). The first is that the fights aren't the best. Whenever I am reading the manga (and now watching the anime), I always feel that the fights are good but they could be better. The second is the animes art just isn't as good as the manga. This is to be expected, but after reading 45+ chapters, I feel that the art of the anime could have, and should have been a lot better. It's a nit pick, I know, but I feel that it is something that should be mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nOverall however, I highly recomened this show, but I implore you to read the manga, especially the short bonus stories, as they help build the world, and answer a lot of questions that I had when I was reading the manga.",

Just to put some problems in perspective i will compare it to another adaptation of a manga this season (I've read both and watched both) goblin slayer.\r\nIf we first take the anime in a vacuum, it an ok anime, one of those zainy shows you watch and keep coming back to even tho there is not much happening. \r\nThe characters don't get a lot development and a re very one note, theart style, and animation is quite average. Sound is mostly fine but in my opinion Rimuru's voice makes my ears bleed every time he opens his mouth and the opening gets pretty old pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\nNow the real problem i have with the anime is its pacing and this is where the comparing will start.\\n\r\nGoblin slayer adaptation has managed to cover assembling its core cast in episode 3 and moved the plot at enjoyable pace blasting through its material in a pace comprehensive to a new time watcher and very enjoyable for me.\\n\r\nIn the mean time Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is 9 episodes deep and still hasn't started the first main arc hasn't has barley just finished setting up the premise for the big story arc and probably wont reach the manga status quo of the \"village\" for at least the next few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion there was never enough material for a 24 season anime and doing a one piece on it and filing the anime with hidden filler like long shots and padded conversions just ruins it for me, but you might find more enjoyment in it if you binge watch it when it finished airing coz the story is fine getting little snipits of the story every week is just tedious.",

            "content": "Q: How do you piss off a room full edgelords and bring out their inner BS?\r\nA: Show them That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.\r\nIt saddens me that apparently a lot of anime viewers have come to only want shows where killing is the answer to everything, and an omnipresent threat of death is the only form of \"stakes\" that they think can exist in a fantasy story.\r\nI don't wanna get too preachy, but suffice it to say that if you're only drawn to anime for the reasons above, you won't enjoy this show. \r\nYes, it's true, this anime has a ridiculously overpowered protagonist.Yes, he uses healing potions to save his friends again and again. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting something gritty and dark, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD WATCH AN ISEKAI ANIME IN THE FIRST PLACE but ok look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nOk, but in all seriousness, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I think many of the criticisms I have seen of this show are not being honest with themselves. People are saying \"There's no stakes\". That's not true. There are very much things at risk in every episode we watch. We'll get to that in a moment\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe central argument Tensei Slime makes is as follows: If you're given vast powers, why wouldn't you use those to try and achieve world peace? If you're powerful enough that others would swear loyalty to you constantly, why not use that to build up society? \\n\\n\r\nAnd it turns out the way you do that isn't by killing everything in your path.\\n\\n\r\nWe see other characters explore this option, but Rimuru shuts it down.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who want more death and violence out of this show are missing that very point.\\n\\n\r\n\"But, hsteveh\" protests William Watcher, \"If there's no death and violence, what are the stakes, what's the conflict?\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, William. Don't you see? Rimuru isn't just trying to \"beat the bad guys\". Rimuru is facing down a much tougher challenge: trying to get entire communities of people to live together peacefully. The conflict often stems from character disagreements, and the mere possibility of violence and fighting. Rimuru is able to, very often, defuse these conflicts with little to minimum violence. I realize this can be a turnoff for some, but to say that it means there is no conflict or stakes is highly unfair. When Rimuru is approaching these situations, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WINNING. It's about if he'll be able to redeem that villian in time. Sometimes the answer is yes, sometimes it's no (see: the leader of the wolves), and very often it's \"well, sort of\". Our investment thus stems from Rimuru's pursuit of perfection, and the bonds that they form with the various creatures they come across. Will Rimuru be able to restrain Millim from impulse punching someone? Do we want Rimuru too? Will Gabiru learn to be less stupid? Is his father going to welcome him back? These types of questions keep us invested, rather than the soapy \"OMG WHOS GONNA DIE NEXT\" that 95% of shounens rely on. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, no, this isn't your garden variety Isekai or anime. But frankly, I like its refreshingly wholesome worldview. For once our Isekai protagonist is trying to help everyone else out and not just on a quest to get laid. For once people are acting mature and talking things out. And all of this is done while still preserving a sense of adventure. We meet fun new characters every week that are a delight to see on screen. \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention it's colorfully drawn, full of fluid, fun animation, and has some of the coolest sound effects ever in an anime? \\n\\n\\n\r\nHaters, BTFO. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime Review: Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\r\nOne of the best Isekai animes I've watched, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken, or as I like to call it, Tensei Slime, is not only an action packed anime, but also a feels anime. I must say that after watching Tensei Slime, my standard of good Isekais has risen and Isekai animes have a lot of pressure to impress me in the future!\r\nStory: As the title says, a man died and got reincarnated to a Slime. He meets a legendary dragon, and instantly becomes one of the most OP anime characters in existence. Along the way he meets countlesspeople: goblins, wolves, ogres, lizards, humans and other species of creatures and instantly gains their respect through his overwhelming power.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise it is a very interesting anime as each episode presents us with a different situation and because of that, very often we are left on cliffhangers, waiting for the next episode to see what will happen next. Pacing wise I find it alright it wasn't too slow nor was it too fast it had decent pacing. Of course I might have to read the manga in order to better comment on the pacing and story but anime wise, an excellent Isekai anime!\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is very detailed and very artistic. I love all the character animations and the fighting animation scenes were very well done in my opinion. \\n\r\nRating: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Excellent OPs and EDs they were all very catchy and great to listen to. Fight and special effect sounds were also impressive to say the least I loved hearing the explosion sounds everytime there was a fight,\\n\r\nRating: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I find that Tensei Slime shines in this category. Tensei Slime gives us detailed character development even for the minor characters and makes us fall in love with each and every character; their appearance,personality, strengths, weaknesses, character. The bond between the characters and the audience is very strong as Tensei Slime pulls no punches it shows us the ups and downs of each and every character. As for my favorite character in the series, it's none other than Rimuru! He's so hilarious and fun to watch! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tensei Slime is an extremely solid Isekai and one which I'd recommend to people who love the Isekai genre as It has all the elements a great Isekai needs: Action packed and suspenseful storyline, excellent fights, great animation and excellent character development! I can't wait for season 2 of Tensei Slime! In the meantime I might read the manga to see what the anime missed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 9.2/10",

It gave us a character death that have no significant impact and basically set up a chain reaction of other connected characters that is of the same quality. However, SAO actually gave us a fright after episode 4 while Slime bored us with expositions for stuff not worth thinking over.\r\nNow, onto a comparison with Log Horizon. LH did a better job at setting down a tone and pace while keeping the audience enraptured with its politics. It doesn't think of the audience as dumb monkeys and is more attachedwith its lores, expositions, and schemes while Slime constantly moved around stuff that have little to no impact at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the waifus? Yeah, they are there.",

            "content": "At its debut, this was yet another 'savior of isekai,' but why did this show just turn out OK?\r\nStory 4 -- This show started off giving the tried and true formula of isekai the same treatment MHA gave to shounen, crossing every t and dotting every i the way we all expected but just without the bloat. For the first 13 episodes, this held pretty true and I was treated to some clean and quick isekai. It was nothing special, but the story was moving quick and it was enjoyable to see how the slime wasn't taking himself too seriously. After the midpoint, the wholeshow started to fall apart. The literal rest of the show felt like filler and not G-8 filler. The stories may be important later on in the LN, but they had absolutely no weight in the current story. Not even my general like of Rimuru could pull me through these episodes with any amount of interest. Another episode with the second half of the show is that it devolves further into the harem tropes this show originally seemed to avoid. It gets to say it isn't a harem show with how the MC isn't interested in their advances, but the way the female characters fawn over him is just the usual. \\n\r\nArt 5 -- The character designs are fun, the action for the first half of the series is genuinely good, and the backgrounds are consistent. That said, whenever CG showed up, it was Overlord III levels of bad integration. The action in the second half of the show is also noticeably less interesting in both direction and animation. Characters move less for the entire second half of the show.\\n\r\nSound 5 -- The seiyuus give fine performances throughout the entire show. None were standout, but I could expect them to be pretty good every episode. The sound mixing and OST I can't even remember a week later. I don't think it was bad, but there is nothing to say about it.\\n\r\nCharacter 4 -- These characters all ended up feeling like NPCs out of a JRPG. If the characters were off screen, they could be presumed to no longer exist, since they are given nearly no characterization that is not directly relevant to how they can help our favorite slime. Only Gobta seems to get any development out of the entire supporting cast. Rimuru was fun for the first few episodes, but his shtick never changed and he turned into a one-note character. I neither know anything interesting about any of these characters nor do I want to.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4 -- This score would have been pretty good for the first half of the show, but towards the end I started dreading watching the next episode and only watched it after I had already gotten through \"Dororo\" and \"Mob Psycho 100 II.\" The only reason I finished this show was because I had some weird sense of obligation to finish what I started. I will not watch through this show again.\\n\r\nOverall 4 -- This show felt like two different shows which I would rate 6 and 3 respectively. This show was never amazing, but it had the potential to be fun the whole way through. Instead, I got bored of the show and was ready to drop it at any minute. If you want to watch just fun isekai, watch \"Drifters\" or \"Youjo Senki.\" This is not a show worth recommending.",

I whole-heartily enjoyed Slime as I thought it was different and unique. Its hard to explain why I enjoyed it so much but the Fantasy and kinda D&D feel I got from the show was there for me. The show begins with the Rimuru gathering our first major side characters and then builds off their stories and the world around them as well as reintroducing characters seen early on again later on throughout the show. For me one the showsoverall redeeming qualities was \"Great Sage\" as she gets some sass later on in the show and it provides some great comedic effect. All in all this show holds an almost D&D vibe for me as well as comedy.  Although it had a bumpy part in the second arc I hope to see more adventures of our one and only Slime.",

            "content": "Slime Isekai, which is what i'm going to call it because of it's long title, is going to do a lot of good things for folks who enjoy isekai. However it doesn't quite rise above it's genre. And that's both a good thing and a bad thing. \r\nHonestly i'd heard good things about this show before I even started watching it and I can definitely see why. If you enjoy isekai and want to see something a bit more character driven and slice of lifey, then this show will be right up your alley. But if you want to see the next great isekai, I'mnot sure this is the one for that. Let me go into detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is above average. Setup is your typical isekai that focuses more on it's world building than anything else. It expands naturally outwards and it feels like the next big step in the town building is the next big step in the plot too and it all flows together quite nicely. However, this is still an isekai, and thus it has an overpowered protagonist and increasingly powerful characters. Not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case it does unfortunately evaporate the tension in some of this show's more action oriented moments. There are times the show will try to convince you of a threat or that something is 'stronger' than the protagonist, but these moments unfortunately never stick as the protagonist will simply tank any hits and defeat the enemy usually in one or two big moves. It takes the bite out of the show when it tries to split it's focus between establishing the town and big arch villains waiting on the horizon. The overpowered nature does still come in useful in places, such as moments of diplomacy and particularly the teaching arc in the second half, but otherwise it drags things down quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is good. The animation on Rimaru's slime form in particular is consistently expressive and genuinely appealing. Most of the designs are nice, though i'm not a particular fan of turning the races into just demi humans after a certain point but that's just anime for you. Very few flubs and moments where it didn't work for me, but there was also nothing particularly outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a similar level of quality. I do at least remember the OP which is nice but otherwise few tracks stick in my head and most of it is serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the best thing about this show. Sure these aren't the deepest and most complex characters ever, but they are entertaining and fun to watch interact off of one another and it's truly the moments where the show shines. And it's not all fun and games, dramatic moments and sad character revelations work nicely with how they're built up. The focus on diplomacy over fighting lends itself well to this notion so we can tend to find out about villains and characters without them just being killed off. Rimaru himself remains pretty entertaining as a protagonist and besides his overpowered nature, is a hoot to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my issues, it was hard not to have a blast watching this show. I wouldn't consider myself someone who's head over heels with isekai shows but this one definitely scratches a lot of my sweet spots for some more classic fantasy anime. It's not quite as mystical and original as all else, but it still presents something truly fun that I was looking forward to week after week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show's great. It only just falls short of being truly excellent for me and for some, I can imagine what I had hangups with won't detract from their enjoyment. It definitely keeps a good standard for this kind of show and I hope more anime in future takes notes. It might not be perfect, but it's worth looking at for future reference.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't think of any puns for this review so, splat.",

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime sucks you in with the typical isekai fish-out-of-water beginning. The main character has to figure out what's going on, and the information unfolds out to the MC and to the viewer in a steady, enjoyable, drip. The animation also looks and sounds amazing.\r\nNow, the bad. The show markets itself as a shonen action-style anime, when really it is slice of life. Everything always works out, Rimiru is overpowered, and there is zero tension. Which isfine, except the show asks us to take the fighting serious. The MC is a boring blank slate without any interesting qualities. Lastly, Rimiru does not face enough opposition, and gains many allies in cheap ways (that's the most spoiler-free way I can put it). I would recommend the show if you have nothing better to watch, but honestly it's nothing special.",

            "content": "When it comes to isekai series, a lot of people despise the common tropes, and to be honest, I get why. A lot of them are wish fulfillment power fantasies where we get to see the main character win over and over without ever facing real challenge. And here we have another one in that vein. And yet..... I don't hate it? It's not perfect, and I can totally see others despising it as another example of that trope, but personally, I think throwing it in that bucket and leaving it behind is a tad unfair for one main reason, this is not a showthat expects you to engage with it seriously. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm not saying That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime is a comedy. It has some great comedic moments here and there, but if you're here for laughs, you'll get a few, but nowhere near enough to keep you coming back. What I mean by it doesn't expect you to take it seriously is it's not a show about massive character arcs or hyped battles, it's a show about building your community, helping others, and trying to make your life and the life of others better. It's the sort of show you tune into to just feel relaxed and good, rather mindless entertainment. And while the fact that that's all its trying to be means I can't say its any sort of revolutionary show or masterpiece, there's a place for that sort of show in my heart. I'd almost call it fantasy slice of life, although with a few more sudden dangers to everything that probably weren't necessary. \\n\\n\r\nPart of why I think it works is the characters, while not that complex, are engaging enough and likable. Rimuru steals the show and really, if he wasn't such a fun character to watch, the show wouldn't work at all. What makes him fun is in his slime form, he's wonderfully expressive and bouncy, and when he gets a human form, he still has a sort of swagger and confidence, while at the same time being equally prone to expressions of \"uhhhh, yeah, that was intentional.....\". Which is also a good way to describe his personality. Since he is so powerful and has so many looking up to him, he tries to maintain an air of being in control, but being privy to his inner monologues, it's quite obvious that half the time, he's lying through his teeth or bluffing to high heaven. No, this doesn't make him complex or really that multifaceted, but it makes him fun to watch. And while they aren't as important or interesting, the other characters work well enough in their various tropes both playing them straight or subverting expectations. The only ones I found annoying were the female Oni who fought over Rimiru which I felt was probably the most extreme moment of wish fulfillment in the series. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, let's talk about that aspect. This show definitely leans into the power fantasy to a pretty good extent, and while it's less the adolescent fantasy of having power and women fawning over you while being dark and brooding and more the middle-aged fantasy of being perpetually able to help others and being important, it is still a power fantasy. It does enough for me to keep it from feeling pandering or like it's sacrificing character to allow anyone to slot themselves into the main character (actually, I'd argue of everything this show is, letting you self-insert really isn't one of them) but it is still a fantasy. And in terms of criticisms, most every time it tries for a more serious action arc, it's not particularly interesting. The series is not equipped to set up real stakes for Rimiru, so every time it starts leading to an action moment, it can be flashy, but ultimately hollow. And sadly, it really tries to push this in the latter half. The Charybdis arc is the worst example of this. \\n\\n\r\nWhether you enjoy this series or not really is going to be a question of what you want. If you're looking for a serious story or intricate characters, look elsewhere, you won't find it here. If you want something fun and not serious, you'll probably be satisfied enough. The biggest problem is the show repeatedly tries to put on the airs of being a grand epic when it really isn't. This is the \"I've had a long day at work and want something to watch\" show. Which has it's place, but that place is not standing as one of the greatest shows ever.",

This show contains all sorts of cliche characters (the one who screams, the village idiot, the big tiddies girls..you name it, they're all there).\r\nThe only thing I like was the action fights , but the pacing felt a little off in the later episodes of the show.\r\nSo ultimalte story's concept was interesting but lacks in substance.\r\nHonestly,I've only seen the anime and will not bother reading the manga after this.",

            "content": "*This is a Spoiler-less review with my summarized feeling at the end*\r\n4X the anime\r\n  I wanna preface this review by saying: isekai is not really my cup of tea, so keep that in mind when taking my opinion into account. Like every other isekai I watched, Slime only peaked my interest because of the hype surrounding it on the community. That said here\u2019s what I think\r\n  Slime has a strong start, moving very quickly and leaving very little time for boredom on the viewer. On the first 10 or so episodes we are introduced to a huge cast of characters, that althoughvery shallow in personality, work very well as comedic supports to our hero. The problem comes when the story never stops moving at this pace, so what was good to setup and bring the viewer into the world, starts to actively harm it. Old characters never get their due development, newer character\u2019s gimmicks start to get very annoying (*cough* A certain demon lord girl *cough*) and arcs start and get solved in a matter of a couple of episodes. \\n\r\n  The very light and fun premise of the show never becomes something more and by the end of it is not even that well executed anymore, at least in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked \\n\r\n  Rimuru \u2013 Our protagonist is mostly interesting because of its approach of problems, always trying dialog first and forming alliances when possible. His upbeat nature is really captivating\\n\\n\r\n The animation \u2013 Mostly of this seasonal isekai are very poorly animated and just look to make a quick cash grab out of isekai fans. This show is not one of them. The animation quality and character design are both top notch and consistent throughout the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I have mixed feelings \\n\r\n The cast \u2013 while the initial cast is very fun, the jokes around the characters never change and become very stale the longer the show goes. The later introduced characters are less interesting at best and super annoying at worse \\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked \\n\r\n  Conflict solving \u2013 Everything comes very easy (this is not an understatement), there is very little tension in every possible SITUATION in this story. Literally every problem is solved with a very casual solution (that a lot of times just pops up) that while amusing and somewhat heartwarming at first gets old really fast. \\n\\n\r\n  The music \u2013 Very generic fantasy OST, nothing to write home about. The OP/EDs are all okay except the first OP which is at least a bit better\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show if \\n\r\n  - You want a very lighthearted isekai, where most of the fun is brought by the characters\\n\r\n  - You want to watch an OP (but not self-insert) protagonist solve problems by dialogue (well most of the times)\\n\r\n  - You want to watch a match of CIV with hacks \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch this show if \\n\r\n  - You don\u2019t like isekai, this is not the show that will change your opinion \\n",

Por\u00e9m essa hist\u00f3ria existe apenas para mostrar o quanto o Rimuro \u00e9 poderoso e n\u00e3o um desenvolvimento de hist\u00f3ria em si. Todos os personagens secund\u00e1rios importantes, como os ogros, goblins e etc. N\u00e3o tiveram um desenvolvimento desdo in\u00edcio e continuam n\u00e3o tendo mesmo j\u00e1 estando no ep 16. Eles s\u00f3 est\u00e3o ali pra servir de par\u00e2metro de poder para mostrar o quanto o Rimuro \u00e9 forte. Tirando um dos piores erros poss\u00edveis que essa hist\u00f3ria comete. A cada eps\u00f3dio acrecenta novas personagens, mas n\u00e3o d\u00e1 background satisfat\u00f3rio e nem desenvolvimento. Nofim vc tem v\u00e1rios personagens sem personalidade e apenas ocupando um slot de arqu\u00e9tipo. Outro erro mortal dessa s\u00e9rie \u00e9 o ritmo. N\u00e3o sei como \u00e9 no mang\u00e1, mas no anime \u00e9 p\u00e9ssimo. O Anime n\u00e3o teve um cl\u00edmax at\u00e9 agora. A luta contra os Orcs que deveria ser foda \u00e9 s\u00f3 um luta beeem parada e sem gra\u00e7a. Tirando o ritmo do pr\u00f3prio desenvolvimento, \u00e9 muito truncado. Da a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que o anime quer ir pra v\u00e1rios lados ao mesmo tempo, mas nunca atinge nenhum ponto. Enfim, dropado.\\n\\n\r\nBy Google translate\\n\\n\r\nI did not want to this, but I'll have to drop it. This story had everything to be perfect. But this story exists only to show how Rimuro is powerful and not a development of history itself. All important secondary characters such as ogres, goblins, and etc. They did not have a development from the beginning and they still do not have already been in the ep 16. They are only there to serve as a parameter of power to show how strong Rimuro is powerful. One of the worst possible mistakes this story makes. Each eps\u00f3dio adds new characters, but gives no satisfactory background or development. In the end you have several characters with no personality and just occupying an archetype slot. Another deadly mistake in this series paces. I do not know what it's like in the manga, but the anime sucks. Anime has not had a climax until now (ep 16). The fight against the Orcs that should be amazing but its  very sloow and boring. The development itself its very truncated. It gives the sensation that the anime wants to go to several sides at the same time, but never reaches any point.\\n\\n",

YES, he is OP (Just read the LN), his attitude was like that even before his death, so why change? It\u00b4s better that way. Than, getting to the first, big Crisis: He needed time to defeat his opponent. Second Crisis: He needed help because he wasn\u00b4t strong enough, so were is your so called \"OP\" element in that one? And we know, he isn\u00b4table to beat Milim, that will take A LOT of time until he IS able to. So there are at least 2 Characters which were more OP than Rimuru, he only looks strong because of the weaklings around him. And btw.: This is FICITION, Guys. Not the Real world. The fact of evolving after giving someone a Name is a great Idea. God, i hate it, when people looks 3 or 4 Episodes and try to let other think that they know everything they need.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the Topic:\\n\\n\r\nI\u00b4m very fond if the \"Isekai Genre\" because first: There aren\u00b4t many REAL Isekai Titles and second: revieving into another world sounds absolutely GLORIOUS. In this case, it might be a little bit oscure because of the fact that he revived as a slime. But the fact that you can\u00b4t bleed, can\u00b4t feeld pain and eat everything to learn about it or getting new Skills... it really Sounds Amazing. In fact, that\u00b4s the first Anime that made me buy the Manga-Version. Also: There aren\u00b4t many Animes with OP Characters like One Punch Man, so even tough Rimuru isn\u00b4t really OP but because of his, more or less, weaker companions, he looks like it. The fact that they stay by his side after evolving is something natural: eat or be eaten, literally. Monsters are simple: One joins one's patron, or even the \"mightiest\" in the forrest. In fact, if someone is able to get me stronger this instant like Rimuru only by evolving through giving other monsters a Name, i would stay by his side, too. Normal Logic, nothing more, nothing less. \"Repaying the favor\". It seems that even Monsters in Animes are more civilized than humans in the real world... :D The first Season is able to Impress, even with the Sound, i liked that sound of explosions and the Art of the most attacks. Even tough we were at the beginning of the Manga/LN/WN in this Anime, the Story was very good. I can REALLY recommend this Anime, but only if you watch it COMPLETELY and Understand it... not like a few others which seems to not Understand it :)",

            "content": "Well...\r\nThis ended up not living up to its full potential.\r\nThis anime is probably the best \"modern isekai\" or \"reincarnation isekai\" we have right now, but it has a problem - it has absolutely amazing first half that is pretty much on \"masterpiece\" level, and.... really disappointing second half, where things start going downhill. Really downhill. Stroeis and characters of the second half are no longer that interesting, story becomes dull, gritty/dark moments disappear, and even though the anime faitfhully portrays nearly everything that happened in manga during in first 12 episodes, in the next 12 episodes, it start.... rushing, skipping details (quite a lot ofthem), only to barely catch up with manga. I think they're preparing for the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is... disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\\n\r\nStory:6/10. It is 8/10 in 1st half, and 5/10 or 4/10 in the second. First 12 episodes are very interesting and are something I watched at the edge of my seat. The seond half of the season was very dull in comparison. It is partly fault of the source material, as the story arcs portrayed in first half of the season had more punch and higher quality overall.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10: Art is very good, especially in the beginning, before they start rushing the show. Things are animated with love, backgrounds are pretty, and animation si quite amazing, although they definitely cut some corners on action episodes. In he second half of the season, they start rushing, and quality goes down - there are more \"panning\" episodes, but it never becomes horrible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10: It is okay. Characters are likeable and voiced well, plus song isn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10: Well, to put it bluntly aside from amaizing secondary character in the first /second arc, majority of characters are quite dull, and they act more like story pieces or arton cutouts. Strictly defined role/personality, but little beyond that. No life-like personalities here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\" 6/10: I loved the 12 episodes, and slowly become disappointed in the show in the second half, as quality kept dropping down. It seems that this kind of development is fairly common among isekai mangas, where wrtier sometimes have cool ideas in the beginning, but once they've been played out doesn't really know what to do and can't create stories with the same kind of punch anymore. That's hte case with \"Slime\", I'm afraid. \\n\\n\r\nSo the bottom line is - I'd recommend to watch 1st half of the season. It is really really really amazing. Can't say the same about the second half, though....",

            "content": "Let's be honest, getting reincarnated in a fantasy RPG world is a played out and severely overused theme in Anime.  It's completely uncreative at this point, yet, studios keep going back to the SAO well because it's hard to come up with fresh new ideas in anime and as long as something is popular among audiences, they're going to ride it until the wheels fall off.  \r\nAnd so, we are introduced to yet another anime of this ilk in Tensura.  If you've seen any anime in this genre at all before, SAO, Log Horizon, Konosuba, etc... Then you've seen Tensura.  AndTensura brings all of the things that make those animes likable: Good action, a good comedy (Although Konosuba is far funnier) and an interesting and large crew.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Tensura has made its crew too large, too quickly, and so most characters are kind of just \"there\".  Even ones with really good potential to be epic characters like the Ogres, Gobuta and Millim.  The crew is so big, that outside of a handful of characters, most don't get any significant lines to really build themselves up after their particular arcs are over.  It's kind of frustrating, because I really like a lot of these characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe whole pace of the anime just moves too quickly for the viewer to become invested in anything as they should, so the anime feels like there's nothing at stake.  Especially since Rimuru is basically Saitama in terms of being OP.  Pretty much one move, three at most, and any threat is finished.   \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a really good foundation, and the introduction of Kuro seems like Rimuru may finally have a real challenge, but going into future seasons, Tensura would benefit greatly from slowing the pace down and building up some emotional investment from arc to arc.  It would also benefit from giving more time to the cast that it continues to introduce and integrate into Rimuru's city.  Allow the viewer to get to know one group of characters for a while, before introducing more and pushing them to the back burner.  Characters like Benimaru, Souei, Millim and Gobuta could benefit from more screen time, before you introduce Chloe, Kuro and the Queen of Spirits.  \\n\\n\r\nStill, Tensura is a fun anime to watch.  Smooth fight animations, some nice comedic moments, an entertaining cast, etc...  It's a not a bad anime at all.  It could just be better with more investment in the cast and introducing some kind of overarching serious threat that creates some kind of suspense in the anime.  As it stands now, no matter what Charbydis type create shows up, it'll be handled with ease and no sacrifice.  That drags the anime down.   \\n\\n\r\nHopefully it will improve going forward in these regards.",

            "content": "(This review contains spoilers)\r\nPersonally, i think that this anime is a really good one. Although being from the isekai genre, where the main character is op af or the weakest person with the most op ability and ends up beating everyone. However the main protagonist in this world. Rimuru Tempest, is no exception. Although he is overpowered in that world, he still wants to be friends with everyone, avoiding using his powers against others unless it is really necessary, creating a very interesting setting in the show. [Spoilers] . However, in my opinion, there is a real flaw in this anime where the story arcsafter the orc lord arc are compressed a lot. I personally thought the Orclord arc was a good arc but the following arcs like the one with charybdis, i felt the arc was so rushed. The worst part was that they tried to polish and hide this with fight scenes and dialogue. they also accelerate time in the world in the show by a lot but the fact still remains, a monster that is more powerful than the orclord got beaten in 1 episode. The next arc was was also rather rushed. It was the arc about Rimuru becoming a teacher and teaching a bunch of students. When i first watched the beginning of this arc. i felt a genuine interest in it and its potential. But as i watched the next three episodes which concluded the arc, there was no actual problem that happened and everything went as planned and the students problem with having too much magicules in them was solved in 3 episodes. This left me thinking \"wait, that's it?\" It was so upsetting that the anime was so good at the start but so rushed at the end. I'm guessing they tried to compress so many arcs into one season which is really unreasonable, considering how much of a reputation it built up in the first part. Honestly, i'm just upset that such a great show with such a great foundation just ruined itself after its hype died down. At the end of this, i feel you should still watch the anime the enjoy to journey of Rimuru, just don't be upset when the later story arcs disappoint you after being drawn in to their world of fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is strictly my opinion and it might vary with time,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler that was removed\\n\r\nMy favorite part was when i realized that the orc lord was actually a good person just resorting to evil ways to save his people from starvation even if he knows its wrong and chooses the bear the sins of everyone on his shoulder, causing me to feel genuine sorrow for him",

Maybe somebody's expectation was too high. Now I will write this short review as objective as possible.\r\nStory 9/10: The story is so interesting. There's no other Isekai anime that could attract everybody's attention as big as this. Just thinking it, you got reincarnated to the new world as a SLIME. Train your strength from nil. Build your own nation from nil. Fight against many creatures in the parallel world as many as you can imagine. \r\nPeoples complained that thestory is utter trash just because of the ending of the main story was so 'huh' and forgetting all the excitement of this anime that has been given before. I understand it, I feel the same either. But, I won't forget all the excitement of this anime. They adapt it well. I say it honestly.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I've no problem with that. Just good as it should be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: Our main protagonist is too powerful but interesting. Meanwhile, the other seems... lacks. The Development of the character is good. But, when they reach a point. The point that their story-telling is somehow fulfilled. They serve us another character while we still have attention with the previous one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Watch it and enjoy it! This anime is worth to watch. That's the conclusion.\\n",

For starters the skill visualisation at the start of the series really captured me. It really keeps you interested. The story itself has a good flow. They really aren't skipping out on the world building so viewers aren't getting confused on what is actually happening. I started reading the manga adaptation while waiting for the new episodes and I noticed how substantially different the storytelling is compared to the anime. I gotta say the anime has done a better job at retelling theplot making it more fluid. But the tempo of the story drastically changed after the orc lord arc ended in ep18/19. The diplomacy side of the story is removed completely due to the limit of episode. The story flow is still good but a lot of character growths are being scrapped and I had to deduct a point from that. Other than that this is a masterpiece of a isekai anime.",
