            "content": "\u201cEven if we're not confident that we'll win, even if others tell us we don't stand a chance, we must never tell ourselves that.\u201d\u2028-Daichi Sawamura \r\nIn today's anime age; a world filled with over-analyzations and deconstructions, it's always nice to see a series like Haikyuu come along as if to passively antagonize critics with its immense amount of hype. I've been quite guilty of it in the past, often thinking there was no other reason to watch a series than to critique how much it made you 'think'. But to all the fault-finding reviewers and critics out there (myself included), I have one thing tosay... just save your words for once. People aren\u2019t watching this anime to tirelessly dissect its story or characters on a philosophical level. Haikyuu is about having fun, comradery and the love of volleyball. The ultimate underdog story. That's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you told me a couple of years ago that an anime franchise involving high school sports would become one of my favorites in the medium, I probably would've laughed in your face. But I've come to realize that the quality of an anime goes beyond how it makes you think. How it makes you feel is just as important... because at the end of the day, most of us watch anime as a means to escape the repetition of everyday life and just enjoy ourselves. It transports us somewhere exciting, somewhere we normally don\u2019t experience ourselves. Anime should be fun, and Haikyuu is no exception to that. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu's third season could almost be viewed as an expansion pack to the main series, or as one reviewer put it, much like DLC for your favorite video game. This is a fair assessment given the truncated 10 episodes compared to the first two seasons of 26 episodes each. Karasuno finds themselves pitted against the powerhouse Shiratorizawa, in a 5 set match no one expects them to win. There is less character development overall, but more than enough action to make up for it. I\u2019d say this season emulates the intense tone produced by the last few episodes in season 2, my favorites of the entire series. The result is a nail-biting, pulse-pounding thrill ride to the match's epic conclusion. It's just what I needed to get me through a relatively lackluster fall season. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of story this season, due mostly to its shorter run time. Being in a 5 set match is unfamiliar territory for our favorite Karasuno team, which begins to show as the series progresses. Exhaustion starts to become a factor, and for the first time I can remember in Haikyuu, players begin to tire mentally and physically. This incorporates an important aspect of playing sports, making the characters that much more relatable to someone who\u2019s been there. We also see a culmination of the variety of new skills Karasuno\u2019s players have been practicing come to fruition when they matter the most. Whether from Nishinora\u2019s jump-setting or Tsukishima\u2019s read-blocking, each player plays a pivotal role in turning the tides at one or more points during the match. The writers of Haiykuu also continue their emphasis on the backgrounds of Karasuno\u2019s opponents throughout the match. It was a tad watered down from last season, and I would still have liked to see Ushijima\u2019s past elaborated on more. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the whole series up to this point is the sudden mental involvement displayed by none other than the deadpan Tsukishima. Normally Tsuki exhibits a personality as dynamic as a cardboard box, but shocks us all as he begins to become more engaged and driven to help out his team. He emulates the mentality that no one likes to lose, and I found myself actually cheering out loud for him when he blocked Ushijima for the first time. Another refreshing point to bring up about the cast is how passive a role Hinata and Kageyama actually play in this season. As the series progresses, the narrative shifts from the drive and determination of Hinata as an individual to the importance of teamwork and synergy. The result is truly powerful and I\u2019ve begun to really get attached to every member of Karasuno\u2019s team. \\n\\n\r\nObviously the hype in Haikyuu is beyond unreal, and the third season is the best example of this. Even the relatively stone-faced members of Shiratorizawa get wrapped up in the excitement. Anime has proven time and time again that you can breathe life and intensity into any subject matter. Some people may fault the series for its plethora of overreactions and such, but at this point the viewer should come to expect it based on the precedent laid out by Haikyuu\u2019s first two seasons. It\u2019s the necessary evil of sports anime, but one I have grown to forgive Haikyuu for because I love it the series that much. Even up until the last episode, the result of the match was unclear and allowed me to stay glued to my screen for the entire 10 episodes. Karasuno doesn\u2019t always win, and that vulnerability makes you cheer for them even harder when they do. \\n\\n\r\nIs it better than Season 2? Unfortunately, the abridged format coupled with less interesting characters cause it to fall short of the brilliance surrounding the second installment. Many of the training camp episodes from last season did more to add to the story than I realized, causing viewers to really bond with the opposing players that much more. Not to mention Oikawa being the character you wanted to cheer for but couldn\u2019t. Another aspect of the series I didn\u2019t find to be irritating until this point was the lack of family members from Karasuno\u2019s players being shown in the stands. Instead we are limited to a select few that are grouped together while the rest of the crowd seems to consist of the student body. From attending many high school sporting events in the past, it can be somewhat hard to fathom how the parents of these kids aren\u2019t even in the picture in their matches. A small complaint, but one I just don\u2019t understand. Maybe Furudate (creator) though Haikyuu had enough characters already! \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is still solid and the music is consistently upbeat and powerful. There are quite a few recycled tracks from the earlier seasons, which I actually found comforting more than stale for the series. The sound editing and effects are some of the best in the business, as Haikyuu delivers again with its realistic gymnasium sounds and crowd noises. The animation also seems like it received a significant upgrade from the show\u2019s debut season, rivaling other sports series like Ping Pong in its level of \u201cover-the-top-ness\u201d.. Granted, only having to edit together one setting for the entire season probably allowed the animation team to expand their skills in other, more intricate areas. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up this season in one sentence (as recommended by one of my MAL pals), Haikyuu S3 is \u201cA white-knuckled underdog story driving 100 mph over the speed limit, wearing a huge grin the entire time.\u201d It\u2019s a series best viewed in one binge-watching session rather than enjoyed week by week, and is only bested by it\u2019s previous installment. If you\u2019ve seen the first two seasons, you\u2019re already behind the curve by not picking this one up... it\u2019s a hell of a good time! Thanks for reading and be sure to look out for more of my Fall \u201816 reviews! \\n",

            "content": "Given the monumental amount of hype that Haikyuu seems to have within its own fan base, I hope that this review will not come across as more negative than I intended it to, so I would just like to start by saying that Haikyuu is for sure one of the better traditional sports anime I have seen, but even so it is still far from perfect.\r\nThis third season picks up right where the last one left off, throwing us right into the Spring Tournament regional finals between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. And that is pretty much the entirety of what this season is about as itis significantly shorter at merely 10 episodes, and all of that is spent on this single best-of-five finals. However, the shorter length also means that there is very little downtime, and thus pretty much every single episode of this season is action-packed and engaging, unlike the second season which spent its entire first half on nothing but lackluster training arcs, so I definitely consider this to be an improvement on paper.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit that generally speaking I am not really a fan of hot-blooded shounen series, nor am I particularly fond of sports outside of real life, so this definitely has an impact on my enjoyment of Haikyuu as well. In short, this anime is very predictable. It is one thing to be able to guess the eventual winner, but for example I should not be able to so easily say in which order the sets are going to be won by the respective sides, because it is all made to play out in the way which creates the maximum amount of hype for the viewers. It just... feels pretty fake. And even the rallies within the sets themselves are generally pretty predictable; the camera focuses especially on one player for a bit and lets you see things from his perspective, at which point you can rest assured that the next point or two is going to be decided by him. Eventually the other players will adapt to whatever strategy he is using and then break his streak, at which point the focus will shift to someone else where the same thing will play out. It feels like it is all following a script. That said, I do have to admit that even though it feels pretty unnatural, it is undoubtedly quite effective. Thanks to the stellar directing that Haikyuu has, it really manages to make every point feel important and engaging, and the amount of emotion stemming from the players is not to be underestimated. You can really feel how much this means to everyone and how badly they want to win, no matter the cost. However, that still does not change the fact that the progression of the actual sets is simply too clean and perfect, and feels like it is following too much of a rigid pattern rather than portray the chaos that volleyball so often becomes in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I should probably mention that I am by no means an expert on volleyball and my knowledge of it is limited to what I have learned in PE class and from watching it on TV. However, this also proves a point of mine even further because despite my lack of expertise on the subject matter, I still find that I legitimately know more about the sport than these players do a lot of the time. I feel like Haikyuu oftentimes treats me like an idiot. Why is it that these supposedly national level athletes are just now taught what certain basic positions and tactics like angle blocking are? That makes no sense at all. I mean yes, I realize that the mangaka wants to teach things to the readers/viewers who have little to no understanding of volleyball whatsoever, but could you not have done so in a way which does not straight-up lower the story's sense of realism? For example, you could have just thrown in some short non-canon tutorials for the sake of the audience without interfering with the plot progression at all. On top of that there are also a couple points which are just plain implausible, like that it is supposedly harder to play against left-handed players than right-handed ones. What kind of sense does that make? This is volleyball, not football. The ball reaches its destination in less than a second when spiking so there is absolutely no way the opposite spin direction would have time to curve the trajectory in any relevant way at all, and given how lightweight the ball is I do not see how the spin would make it any harder to pass or receive either.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really annoys me about this third season (which is a problem which actually did not exist in the prior seasons) is the complete lack of preparation from Karasuno prior to the finals. I mean think about it; Shiratorizawa is supposed to be the most famous team in the entire region for their age bracket, and they have won multiple big tournaments over the last few years already. On top of that they have a superstar ace player in Ushijima who seemingly everyone knows about. So why is it that Karasuno are seemingly learning who their opponents are during the actual finals itself? They should have tons and tons of easily accessible information about every single one of the starting players they're facing since ages ago, and should thus have been appropriately prepared for what was coming well ahead of time. Especially considering that this is a shounen series where pretty much every player has some super specific skillset like Ushijima's raw power spikes and Tendou's \"Guess Monster\" gimmick, rather than just being all-round solid players like you generally expect high-level players to be in real life. In other words coming up with hard counters should be much easier here than in reality as long as you know what you are dealing with ahead of time, which again, Karasuno really should have known. Like I can sort of understand the opposite scenario with how Shiratorizawa may have been confident enough in their victory to not really care about researching their opponents, and similarly Karasuno's matches in earlier rounds and tournaments have been against lesser opposition so I guess that excuse might somewhat apply there too, but for this finals, not so much. It is like taking a college exam without studying for it and just hoping that your raw talent will be enough for you to figure out the answers on the spot. Sure, maybe that will work out for you, but it still seems a hell of a lot smarter to just study ahead of time instead. The same logic applies for Karasuno in this tournament finals.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of skillsets, I also have to say that the aforementioned abilities in particular are pretty ridiculous. Does any professional volleyball player base their moves around trying to read their opponents' eye movements and similar like Tendou does? You think you have time to do something like that in a sport as fast-paced as volleyball? I highly doubt it. And as far as Ushijima goes, I find his ability to be really dumb. For one it is rather uncreative with how it is basically all power and very little strategy involved, but more importantly that kind of strength makes no sense at all. As briefly mentioned earlier, a volleyball is pretty lightweight, and even the most forceful spike can only generate so much kinetic energy as a result. So the fact that Ushijima's spikes could be so strong that they can just go straight through blocks is just ridiculous. There is no way that should happen. In summary, there are quite a lot of aspects of Haikyuu which are just plain unrealistic, which is ironic given that one of the common praises I keep seeing for the show is its supposed realism.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said though, I still consider Haikyuu to be a pretty good anime in general because despite its flaws, it is a lot of fun to watch nonetheless, and it is both addictive and engaging. The problems with it mostly lie with the details, but the more general aspects are all quite solid. For one, the production value is extremely good. I am not sure if I have ever seen a sports anime with as fluid animation as Haikyuu has, so Production I.G definitely deserves a large part of the credit for the show's success. And similarly, the soundtrack serves to both severely ramp up the level of intensity of the matches as well as enhance the emotional impact when need be, with all-round crisp and stellar timing. The characters are perhaps not utterly amazing in terms of writing but they have a lot of development, and discounting the part where they sometimes seem clueless to things they really should not be, they generally do feel quite believable and admirable. In this particular season I think it is especially Tsukishima who gets the most development as something that had been building up since almost the very start of the show ends up paying off in full, which was quite satisfying to see. Looking back at how he used to be, it almost feels like watching a completely different person by the end of this season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, before ending this I would just like to touch upon something concerning this anime's fan base which has always annoyed me and I did not know where else to put it. Time and time again I see people (especially those that have not actually seen it) label Haikyuu as \"homosexual volleyball\". In a sense this is understandable given the unbelievable amount of Haikyuu-themed male-on-male romance fan art and fanfics there are out there, often sexual in nature, so clearly in terms of how the fujoshi treat it this is not incorrect. However, the actual anime itself is not gay at all. It is not like Yuri on Ice which has blatant homoerotic tension shoved into your face pretty much every episode; Haikyuu has nothing of the sort. I have never seen the guys in this show stare deeply into each other's eyes, be bashful in each other's presence, end up in any compromising positions with each other or shown any signs of being interested in one another beyond mere friends and teammates. I may not be a volleyball player, but I did play football for many years so I can at least say that there is nothing remotely homosexual about simply playing in the same sports team as a bunch of other guys and passionately wanting to win together. So please stop trash talking Haikyuu for supposedly being yaoi-bait and avoiding it solely because of that, because it is not only a silly reason but also just plain incorrect. Blame a certain obsessive minority of the fan base if you so desire, but not the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the third season of Haikyuu is an overall solid addition to an already well-established franchise which for the most part maintains the same strengths and weaknesses as its prior seasons despite being less than half the length. It is also more straight to the point than ever before as there is significantly less fluff, and as a result every episode feels fast-paced (but not too fast) and important. And while I wish that it had done a couple things differently, as a whole it is nonetheless a very enjoyable anime which is definitely worth checking out. Not that I see why you would not watch this season as well if you have already invested enough time to get through 50 episodes of it previously. If you have seen and liked the first two seasons already, there really is no reason to not watch this one as well.",

If there is one idea this anime solidifies, it's, \u201cYou are only an amazing anime if you can create perfectly timed miracles!\u201d \r\nHaikyuu!!: Karasuno Koukou VS Shiratorizawa Gakuen Koukou is literally, as the synopsis on MAL states, an anime where the whole plot revolves around the over hyped game between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. This is the third installment in the Haikyuu!! franchise and I recommend you all to watch how a studio who lacks enough manga material to field a full 25 episode season, manages to show their over-hypedfans one match in 10 gruesome long episodes. Let\u2019s be honest, they know the fanbase would\u2019ve watched it regardless being padded with endless flashbacks to justify the \u201cmiracles\u201d during the game. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t any story to this anime. It\u2019s just an anime about one game. The difficulty lies in how can you make one game super interesting when you\u2019ve used up pretty much every possible curveball scenarios a team must overcome in the past two seasons. Simple, throw in Mr. Super Android Perfection, Ushijima, Wakatoshi, whose major difference is he can spike with his left hand. Did I mention, he is also mister Perfection? How will the mortal humans of Karasuno overcome this new hurdle? Maybe they will have to use their clich\u00e9 secret weapon aka the power of friendship, bonding, camaraderie. Top that with over use of flashbacks to justify why one player is able to block one single spike or net a point. Being the final game in the competition, there are 5 sets, so logically, viewers would think 2 episodes per set. WRONG. Another slider the studio throws at the viewer is they made one game over in the blink of few seconds and spends 4 episodes over another game. The pacing of the show is damaged tremendously by the amount of flashbacks explaining every little strategy  and over usage of slow-mos. We get it, you want the viewers to understand volleyball, but you have to stop dumbing it down so much, especially when it is the 3rd season. Nevertheless, you can legit create a drinking game out of the amount of times Mister Perfection is in the air trying to take a spike. Be warned though, Production IG is not responsible for your hospital bill. The best thing about the story is that they knew when to stop from pulling a Naruto level filler.\\n\\n\r\nIf an anime lacks story surely the characters would be memorable right? Wrong. Other than maybe one or two characters, no one else really went through any major growth or change. Heck the fans had more character growth than the players did during this game. The anime tries to stray away from the main characters, Hinata and Kageyama,  and focus on Tsukki and Mister Perfection (Ushijima). But the major refreshing character to come out of this anime is Tendou aka Guess Monster. It is really hard to attach yourself to any characters and it feels like if fans enjoyed a certain character prior to this season, they will closely identify with that character. It\u2019s good that every character pretty much gets similar screen time so it adheres to the concept of winning or losing as a team except for the bench players. Let\u2019s be real, why would both team\u2019s coach even put them in such a crucial game.  One major issue is that most players still lack the ability to jump serve this late into the competition.  Aside from the characters being pigeonholed into having yaoi moments for the fandom/fanfiction most of the characters will be easily forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nUp to this point, it might feel like why should we watch such an abysmal show that suffers greatly in story and character. Well if there is one thing Haikyuu!! franchise gets right time after time, it\u2019s their art and soundtrack. By utilizing hand drawn animation and bold vibrant colours, the studio is able to provide a rich realistic style of anime that is unique and memorable for the viewers. The animation stayed true throughout the series. Regardless, being a sports shounen anime where you will come across multiple players that pretty much look the same. It makes you wonder did the studio do it to make the major character stand out or the only way they know how to differentiate one character from the other is thick or thin eyebrows. Although the OP and ED song for this anime didn\u2019t really stand out like in previous seasons but keep in mind that OP/ED tends to be subjective. However, the background music was spot on during the games. They were able to create the necessary hype and cliff-hanger the show requires to further along the plot episode after episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, criticisms aside, Haikyuu!! 3 is a great sports anime whose primary goal is to showcase the epic David vs Goliath story of Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. They did execute that really well except they took two too many episodes to show it. Instead of stretching it to 10 episodes they could\u2019ve released a movie or make it a 6-7 episode short anime due to lack of manga material. Regardless, I would recommend watching the first two seasons prior to watching this anime and don\u2019t forget to binge this season. I had fun watching it, provided me great laughs and memories but tbh I wouldn\u2019t rewatch this particular season. Although the ending of the anime did promise another sequel and here\u2019s to hoping the next season will be far better than this season! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.

            "content": "The match point is finally here. You\u2019re the one to take the first step in securing the final point. You start your way to behind the serving line. Your whole body is warmed up, but somehow your hands are still ice-cold, initiated by the sheer thought of failing in this crucial moment. The pressure is immense, yet you still don\u2019t waste a thought on not giving your all. If you make that one more point you\u2019ll win the match. Just one more point and all your hard work will be rewarded. Amidst that thought, you toss the ball in the air and set off foryour final jump, not even thinking about not hitting it with full strength. \\n\r\nThese or similar thoughts almost everyone did have when playing competitively and funnily enough while watching Haikyuu (HQ) I got thrown back to similar memories of mine. Even though HQ is definitely a show which bends reality and pulls of moves which are not possible in real life, its' narrative is absolutely able to pull me back to when I was playing on the court during tournaments.\\n\\n\r\nThe third season of Haikyuu had really high expectations to fulfill for its fans since S2 did the utmost best to develop every single character of Karasuno appropriately and with reason. They were not afraid to show the slowly escalating fight between Hinata and Kageyama in its fullest, giving both of their points of view valid facts to understand them and I simply loved how they came on a common consensus in the following episodes. Season 2, for the most part, was rather laid-back, but when the long-awaited rematch with Seijoh happened in the last five episodes, the tension rose up significantly in just a couple of minutes. It was almost as if the tone of the series changed when they were to play their archrivals once again.\\n\\n\r\nThe mixture between high tension volleyball-matches, glorious development of a cast with numerous very likable characters and absolutely hilarious comedy has made me love the previous two seasons of Haikyuu. But, coming into Season 3 I was rather skeptical, since the title already stated, that they were only going to cover the final match against Shiratorizawa. Adding further insult to injury, it was only going to be 10 episodes long! My past-self was convinced, that no way in hell it would be as good as the previous seasons, furtherly negatively assured by the fact, that KnB\u2019s 10 episodes long final game was painfully over-stretched, no matter how I thought about it. Unsurprisingly, I was right from the get-go, that the successful mixture of the reasons why HQ is that great will be a little off-balance, however surprisingly it did not bug me in the slightest since season S3 was the ultimate embodiment of HYPE. The creators somehow managed to deliver the same tension Seijoh\u2019s rematch in S2 had over a total of ten episodes, adding more and more intensity from episode to episode, to finally explode in the final two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t lose words to the show\u2019s premise since everybody already knows of what this season is about, when watching the two previous ones. The first few episodes (essentially the first set) was not as enthralling as the ones to come since it both teams were testing the waters and each other\u2019s abilities at the beginning of the match. However, it quickly became better when the first set ended, getting more and more exciting to see, how Karasuno were facing every single hardship they were thrown at by the defending kings Shiratorizawa.\\n\r\nOne thing a lot of people criticized HQ for doing in the past, was for not showing the entirety of a match and rather picks crucial moments to show to the audience. While I can definitely see the problem a lot of people are having there (it did bug me in S1 as well), in S3 it would be absolute madness to show the more than half of every set, since it would just lead the series to become boring and the meaningful moments to feel anticlimactic. HQ\u2019s narration is perfectly adapted in explaining all the happenings, feelings and reasons why a team falls behind/catch up perfectly (usually explained by the coach or important and known members of the audience), so there is no need to show more than it is necessary. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I mentioned the lack of character development in S3 in comparison to its predecessor, it\u2019s not like they were skipping it entirely by any means. Characters of Shiratorizawa are introduced effectively during the match with flashbacks and chain of thoughts, making them feel almost as real and likable, as Karasuno\u2019s line-up. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the audiovisuals, the final season of HQ is an absolute blast. The production-values are constantly incredibly high, making it almost impossible to find any lazy artwork/animation in the entire series! Production I.G. did constantly pour more and more money into making Haikyuu as it was progressing, mostly due to the (maybe kind of unexpected) large audience and fanbase the series was developing. The art style is superb, the animation so fluent you\u2019d think it runs on 60 FPS+ and the directing is constantly top-notch as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs this season is only 10 episodes long, there\u2019s no second opening this time. However, that\u2019s no reason to be sad about since \u2018Hikari Are\u2019 is EASILY the best opening the series has up until this day, both music and animation-wise. The symbolism between \u2018the fight of the black crow and the white eagle\u2019 is omnipresent in the show and used magnificently in the opening as well, making use of a darker color-palette and an incredibly detailed art-quality. \\n\r\nThe OST of the series constantly delivers, no matter what situation it has to accompany with appropriately. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe third season of Haikyuu does not disappoint in any way, as some people maybe have expected it to. While it is a little inferior to S2 due to the lack of incredibly effective conflicts within the main team and glorious character development resulting of it, it tops all the thrills I got from the previous two seasons. S3 is adding more and more fuel from episode to episode, until it finally explodes into pure awesomeness and hype at the finale, which resulted in me jumping through the entire room because of how pumped up I was. It offers maybe four of the five best moments of the entire series and in combination with the high-quality audiovisuals and the feeling of absolute importance during the whole match, it earns a spot in my favourites as well. So if you\u2019re a fan of HQ already, go watch it right now, you probably have to marathon it anyways. And if you\u2019re not already\u2026GO WATCH THE FIRST TWO SEASONS!\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nArt (9/10), Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "Like many other people, I initially wasn't attracted to Haikyuu. Seeing clips and hearing about anime such as Free made me think that Haikyuu too would be another fanservice sports anime. I was surprised, however, to find that I immensely enjoyed Haikyuu. Haikyuu is by no means my favorite anime, but it is the anime that I have become the most attached to.\r\nStory: 8\r\nIf you've watched other sports anime such as Kuroko no Basket, the overall storyline is rather predictable, almost to the point where the anime becomes less enjoyable (as it lacks on that overall sense of surprise that is important in anime). Luckily,Haikyuu isn't about the overall story as much as it is about character development and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThey really went all out with the art this season. The action scenes' animation looks incredibly good. Furthermore, they incorporate a lot of interesting visual metaphors which I find appealing (ex. http://imgur.com/a/9Oh9z ). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Haikyuu is godlike. Voice actors are good. A lot of people complained that they didn't like Coach Ukai's new VA, but I think it's fine. (R.I.P Kazunari Tanaka).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are probably why so many people like Haikyuu. Haikyuu creates deep, interesting characters that have their own personality. Each set of members on a team will elicit feelings from the viewer. If you personally enjoy character development, Haikyuu has a lot of it, and I mean A LOT (ex. Tsukki).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI looked forward to watching this every week; so much so that I don't want to read the manga since I'm afraid it will lessen my enjoyment of the anime adaption. After the first season, I became unhealthily attached to the characters (save me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nYou might see the 8 I gave the story. But all that matters is my personal enjoyment so Haikyuu gets an easy 5/7 from me.",

            "content": "Susumu Mitsunaka turns out to be a type of director that the sports genre needs: a superfan and a Japanese pop culture savant. He\u2019s back with another highly anticipated sequel to the smash hit series adapted from Haruichi Furudate\u2019s manga. With its third instalment of Haikyuu!! it strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. It tells the harsh yet rewarding journey that the Karasuno High School volleyball team is taking in order to reach their goal of soaring the skies of the nationals! The team was formerly known as \u201ca fallen powerhouse, a crow that can\u2019t fly,\u201dhas finally arrived on the big stage of the Spring tournament\u2014the final where the incomparable Shiratorizawa Academy awaits them. This is Karasuno\u2019s greatest challenge yet and their adversary\u2019s ace, Wakatoshi Ushijima, the best player in the Miyagi Prefecture, standing in their way. Since this match is the third-year players last chance to qualify for nationals, Karasuno is determined more than ever and they have to apply everything they have learned thus far to attain victory.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever draws you to Haikyuu!! whether it be Shouyou Hinata\u2019s inspiring journey to follow in the footsteps of former Karasuno Ace \"Little Giant\", Tobio Kageyama\u2019s unyielding disposition, the sport's culture of encouragement and positivity, or a variety of characters with diverse personalities learning to see eye to eye with one another\u2014will not only persist until the finale, but increase in intensity. It never loses sight of what it is, a sports anime with a lot of heart and an uplifting message of team unity and friendship, whether its characters fail or succeed. Its an epic battle that cranks the adrenaline up to eleven, both teams pull out all the stops by taking risks like using new moves learnt in prior training camps in a real match for the first time in hopes of gaining the advantage\u2014playing past their limits to the point of exhaustion and muscle fatigue knowing that they have to do their own job in order for their teammates to fulfil their roles. There\u2019s lots of heroics on-display here since every moment is life-and-death and the tension is ratcheting up more and more with everyone\u2019s fate hanging in the balance on every point. \\n\\n\r\nHinata and Kageyama truly complete each other with the dynamic duo trying to prove their combination is as strong as Ushijima. The older players have also experienced growth. They have become more composed and reliable. Even those who were always on the sidelines have taken their place in the court during this season. A key highlight is that there was no character derailment and that was very important for this match. A criticism I have with shounen anime is that sometimes a series would show character derailment for the sake of character development. Tsukishima Kei and Yamaguchi Tadashi, the remaining freshman are a far cry from how they were in prior seasons. Here they have become quite capable players that their seniors can rely on. Tsukishima went through a much-needed development and the way it was executed was just masterful and it\u2019s a moment that steals the show, you have to see for yourself. Every player had a pivotal moment that changed the flow at one point or several times of the final. What stuck out to me the most the importance of team unity, not one crumbled under pressure, they picked each other up off the deck with their never-say-die attitude and pressed forward. During the match, we get flashbacks and monologues from the Shiratorizawa team and during the course of the match, Karasuno realizes that they\u2019re human. Cracks started to show, they do feel pressure and they do make mistakes. This makes them a lot more real as characters and relatable that at times you find yourself cheering for them.\\n\\n\r\nA strength that many series cannot acclaim for that Haikyuu!! can is how it manages to consistently maintain through each season the high quality in visuals and animation for the duration of its action sequences. Its definitely on the higher end of the spectrum and it\u2019s a standard that Production I.G have set for the industry and they are the leaders when it comes to digital animation techniques. They went a step further by utilizing every tool available to the medium to make the experience much grander and stunning. This is the same studio that gave you series like Attack on Titan and Psycho-Pass. Both opening and ending theme songs, Hikari Are and Mashi Mashi by Burnout Syndromes and they embody high levels of remembrance. The soundtrack is just amazing, they re-use some tracks from prior seasons and they play at the right time to get the blood boiling and hype the moment. Voice acting maintain its usual strong performances but sadly actor Tanaka Kazunari, who plays Keishin Ukai, passed away from a brain haemorrhage at just 49 years old. Ukai is a very important character in Haikyuu!! It\u2019s very heartbreaking to lose a talented seiyuu far too young. Hisao Egawa stepped in to replace the role and he did a fine job. I like to think of how well this season went, it was a fitting tribute to Kazunari, many thanks to his fine works and he will be missed.\\n\\n\r\nThis season of Haikyuu!! only contains 10 episodes but I think it\u2019s a fitting number given that it\u2019s about a final match for the Spring tournament. I recommend watching it all in one go as it would be a lot more of an enjoyable experience. It\u2019s a prime example of how great manga should be adapted\u2014consistently faithful while not limited by being so. It's such a joy to see how the characters were handled from the beginning, all the way to the current season. The pace at which the characters grow is perfect in a way where they don\u2019t catapult instantly from the bottom to the top\u2014you get to observe their development from a grassroots level, you witness their struggles, you see them fail and stumble along the way and what they have learned from it. You then see them apply those lessons through the effort they make in their training which gave birth to their newly found motivation and goals, you get to perceive the steps they took to achieve them. It really is the classic \u2018David versus Goliath\u2019 type of match that throws in some drama, high stakes and some curveballs before the climax. Karasuno were called the outcasts, the leftovers, they were given no chance. Will you? Against the odds, the flightless crows take to the skies for an electrifying showdown.\\n",

            "content": "(Review got removed because it was updated to completion ;-; gotta make the climb back)\r\nWell, pains me to say, but I\u2019m gonna be the wiener who has to tell everyone the flaws of Haikyuu! again.\r\nI\u2019m going to preface this review by saying that because I actually play volleyball, lots of the issues I have with the show are specific to someone who has knowledge of high-level high school volleyball, so because the vast majority of this fanbase doesn\u2019t know anything about volleyball outside of this show, you might not be as annoyed at certain things as I am. This is just one humble man\u2019s opinion.\r\nIwant to make clear that Haikyuu is not a bad show by any means, and in fact, I think it\u2019s better than the vast majority of sports anime. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t like shounen, which Haikyuu makes itself painfully obvious that it is. There\u2019s no subtlety, everything is tell, don\u2019t show. They try to teach you the sport of volleyball as you watch and act like you\u2019re 8 years old while doing so. They have to explain each and every little intricate rule, which ultimately makes the show less entertaining and harder to sit through, especially when you know everything they explain in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nObviously the animation for this show is fantastic, as expected. There is nothing to complain about from the art or sound departments, except for the fact that S2 had a better OP, but that\u2019s subjective ;) Soundtrack can\u2019t be expected to be incredible for a 10 episode series about literally one match, but the sound design and effects are spot-on as usual, so I don\u2019t think it really matters at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can truly say is a virtue of the show (aside from the gay undertones, those are always of quality) is that the atmosphere of the matches in Haikyuu are great. There\u2019s enough tension and stress without it causing the viewing experience to suffer, but it\u2019s also realistic enough to not just turn into a joke or feel like there are no consequences. The rivalries are quite plausible and well-developed (if a bit cheesy at times) and I love the camaraderie between members of different teams, it warms my heart.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like about Haikyuu is how nothing comes easy. You sometimes see in sports shows that if you just put training in, you can\u2019t lose. That\u2019s not the case at all, you have to have talent or your work means nothing. The players in Haikyuu all have to use their individual skillsets to better the team\u2019s chances at winning, and while it\u2019s not necessarily a revolutionary concept, it\u2019s executed well beyond mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other things I like about this show, these are just the ones I\u2019m best able to provide my unique opinion on rather than just the standard \u201ci like haikyuu beucase haikyuu has good plot and characters and hype!\u201d. If you want to know my opinion on anything, go ahead and ask me.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have to get to the things I don\u2019t enjoy about Haikyuu!\\n\\n\r\nThe main complaint I have is how stupidly overpowered Ushijima is. Even the players on the US youth national team aren\u2019t as unstoppable as him. That kind of power to just blast through blocks does not exist, his inability to be stopped, and the fact that he only hits hard (no variety) just grinds my gears. They also pretend like he\u2019s special for being left-handed as if no other players in Haikyuu! are lefties?\\n\\n\r\nI feel like that this show has reached a point where they\u2019ve run out of ways to make each match interesting and unique. In the last season there were so many matches played and there\u2019s only so much variation that can exist before it all begins to blend together. Their way of mending this problem was to add massive ass-pulls to add extra flavor such as the \u201cGuess Monster\u201d bit, the whole Shiratorizawa underdog setter thing, Tsukishima for no reason at all just becoming a blocking lord, the forced backstory for the third-years in episode 6, all the little annoying conversations under the net, and various other little quirks that feel forced and unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the games. They\u2019re too perfect and choreographed. Everything that happens is either pass, set kill, or bad pass, cover, free ball, other team passes, set, kill. There\u2019s no chaos, which is what makes volleyball such a unique sport, the unpredictability and sheer magnitude of sensory overload and things you have to pay attention to all at the same time. Now I understand that they can\u2019t animate all of this because that\u2019s just unreasonable, but it still makes it feel like Haikyuu! is doing the sport of volleyball a disservice because of it. The games don\u2019t feel smooth, they feel like a writer mapped them all out (which obviously still would\u2019ve happened if they DID feel random, just don\u2019t worry about it and hit that \u201cHelpful\u201d button below my review) and eliminated unpredictability. This could\u2019ve been helped by all the actions and transitions being sped up, but I recognize that you gotta fit 5 sets into 10 episodes so whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe final thing that made me want to poop my pants were some of the ridiculously basic things these players are just learning. I cannot believe in episode 2 they had to explain what the position \u201cOpposite\u201d was. Position names are quite literally the first thing you learn in volleyball and the opposite is just anyone who hits on the right side. Boggles my mind. Something else they mention is using the strategy of taking away angles to force them to hit to certain areas. That is also something you learn the very first time you learn how to block. Why does it take Tsukishima explaining every single move to his outside for them to just put up a competent block on their own? So frustrating how easy it should be, but Haikyuu! takes everything easy and makes it difficult. Yet again, I don\u2019t get how these national-level high school athletes don\u2019t understand this basic stuff.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really understand why everyone is so crazed with this season. Rank #6 overall is ridiculously high for a 10 episode show about a match of volleyball. In my opinion, it was worse than the previous 2 due to its lack of diversity and having to always take itself way too seriously. I\u2019m also fearful of what\u2019s to come. The ending was very predictable and with them going to nationals, it\u2019s going to be potentially annoying to have to see the writers try (and possibly fail) to come up with unique, engaging ways to present challenges posed by foreign teams. Is it going to be basically just the same thing as the last 2 seasons except with different characters? Who knows?\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! I\u2019m always open to feedback, so if you have some, feel free to hit up my profile.",

            "content": "I take it back, I take it all back. I originally wrote a review during the season where I was of the opinion that this season was lacking compared to the first two. Still good, but not as great story wise. Well I just watched the final episode and hours later I'm still an emotional wreck.\r\nIf you're a fan of Haikyuu!! (as I assume you are, since this is Season 3) don't get discouraged while watching this season. Originally, I had thought that since this season was one long game that the story was a bit lacking. That it may have been a mistake tomake the season solely focused on Shiratorizawa. But, my friends, I easily admit I was so wrong.  The build up that the entire season works towards... it's just epic. \\n\\n\r\nWatch it, and you'll understand what I mean.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy original review, just to show that I really was of the mind it was lacking: \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! is basically my favorite anime of all time, to reiterate on my review of the first season. To also reiterate sports anime aren't really my favorite genre,\\n\\n\r\n But even though I'm a huge fangirl I have to admit, this season isn't as great as the first two. I'd give it a 7.5 if I could. What's largely lacking is the story. Of course, since the season is less than half the number of episodes of each of the previous seasons it's going to not have room for as much development.  But it's still a little disappointing that it's literally just one long stretched out game. I've done something I've never done with Haikyuu before... and that was hope that a scene would hurry up and be over. Saddened me a bit. I do understand that they set it up as it is because they have to pace out the anime in accordance to where the manga is.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there's not really much to say that hasn't been said about Haikyuu!! already, excellent plot, excellent sound, excellent characters. The only flaw this time is the lack of story development/complexity. On one hand, I think they made a mistake and should have just waited to make season 3 a longer season, with this Shiratorizawa match + what is to come. On the other, I get that it's supposed to be THE match, the one that seasons 1 and 2 were building up towards, so melding it into a season with other plot points of Haikyuu!! would have sort of lessened it's importance and impact.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically it. It's an entire season spanning one match, so you can't really discuss much about it. What I can say as a fan is that despite the lack of story development, there is some nice character development among some familiar characters that make it really nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else random... I don't really get why people are continually criticizing it because it's not as realistic as real life volleyball. There is NO, literally NOT ONE SPORTS ANIME THAT IS REALISTIC. Insane, athletic moves that not even pros can pull off being performed by school kids? Weird, unrealistic moves that don't exactly exist in real life being performed by school kids? Plot points that put a twist/unexpected spin on the sports rules? WELCOME TO SPORTS ANIME. Kuroko no Basket, Ace of Diamonds, Major, Initial D, Free!, Yowamushi Pedal, Prince of Tennis, Days, etc. etc. etc. even Chihayafuru, a \"card sports\" anime: the moves are always unrealistic, the players are always better than the pros. However, Haikyuu!! is one of the few that actually make the unrealistic moves/power/skills on the more realistic side. It seems like a really weird thing to rate badly... just my opinion.",

            "content": "Story: In this third installment of Haikyuu, the anime continues to follow the events of the manga with no significant changes. This season centers on the finals arc against Shiratorizawa, a powerhouse school known for its tall, strong, and talented players and has consistently represented the Miyagi prefecture in the National Spring Tournament.\r\nArt and Sound: Even for those who keep up with the manga and therefore know everything that will happen in the anime, it's like you're discovering what happens in the match again for the first time. If there were any blocks, receives, or plays you read in the manga that made you cheerin excitement, it was made even better in the show with the use of slow-motion sequences for dramatic effect, and the imagery of crows and eagles as symbolism for Karasuno's strength in numbers, willpower, and determination. As always, the songs used in Haikyuu are positive and inspiring, like it's saying you can accomplish anything you put your mind to without it sounding trite. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Development is seen in secondary characters in big ways. Certain supporting characters get as much screen time as the main cast, showing backstories and idiosyncrasies to help develop the plot and give the show substance. This makes it hard for viewers to have just one favorite character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It'll be a damn shame to not read and watch Haikyuu. It's a roaring good time and can entertain any viewer even when they have a preference for other genres. \\n",

            "content": "Two words for this: HOLY SHIT\r\nSo, at first i thought this season was going to be boring and monotone, since it was only focused on one game, like ten episodes of the same game? WELL, not a so great premise, BUT i have to say this was the most exciting game i've ever seen in a sports anime! wow, honestly wow. They left me wanting more and more!.\r\nThis was a very intense season, to say the least. Every episode had me at the edge of my seat and there were so many epic moments, i got so excited trough the whole episode, i even feltlike i was part of the game. Awesome cliffhangers that left you impatient for the next episode so you guys can imagine that it was a torture for me to wait for the friday to come. A LOT of action, you could feel all of the emotion the characters were putting into it. I have to say i cried almost in every episode tbh.\\n\r\nI really hope they make a season 4 because i feel like a part of me just died today.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, beautiful animation, awesome movements, everything flows just right. The animation just helps to make everything more intense. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack. Oh my god what a beautiful and thrilling soundtrack, the op was the best op that haikyuu ever had, i really liked it. As i said the characters really transmitted a lot of emotions, so the seiyuus did a great job! especially Okamoto Nobuhiko (Nishinoya) and Miyu Irino (Sugawara) and everyone else obviously, but especially those two. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Ok now, for the thing i liked the most about this season, the characters evolved so so much, they changed a lot from season one, especially tsukki OH. MY. GOD. Tsukki was absolutely the star from this season. I know that in the first two seasons he seems like an asshole who is tired of everyone's bullshit but if you didn't liked him in the past two seasons, i'm sure now you're going to love him. Actually, i'm thinking about putting him into my favorite characters, yeah, that cool he was in this season. As for everyone else they changed so much, they learned a lot and you'll see it trough this whole match, and not only they changed individuallyl but also as a whole team, they became stronger and know about their weakness and strenghts, they became a great team. (ok i'm so proud rn)\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Shiratorizawa, the thing with haikyuu is that even when you cheer for Karasuno you can't hate the team they are playing against, because the fucking creators of haikyuu decided to make every single oponent very interesting characters, IN EVERY GAME. So, i was obviously cheering for Karasuno but i really liked the Shiratorizawa members, they were all quirky and cute their own way, and as always it was impossible to hate them, so that was what made this match so awesome. \\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, well, i think it was pretty obvious how much i enjoyed this season so 10/10 would recommend, and not only this season, i would recommend the whole haikyuu series everytime! It's a show everyone can enjoy. This season was awesome and idk if i would say this was my favorite one, because i think season 2 still takes the spot but absolutely this anime didn't disappointed me, not even a bit.",

They was very amazing. Don't forgetten the scene with Iwaizumi and Oikawa megane. Aww They are very perfect together.\r\nThe anime style is unique and very well made, you can see the mark of the mangaka on each character despite the fact that they are all very different. The soundtrack looks is very good. Every scene has a song which fits perfectly. Each track is able to get us in the mood for the specificmoment, being it sad, funny or exciting. We get goosebumps on every game and we almost cry with the flashbacks. The animation studio is godlike and each movement flows like magic on the screen. Haikyuu!! is also funny and is full of \"chill out\" moments that make us smile. The background stories, the side characters talking on the bench, everything is just amazing to watch. One of the best shows ever, it never gets boring.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of sports anime.. At least it was what i thought. I was really skeptical when i began to see Haikyuu, but now, i'm very glad i watched it. It's like if a hidden passion for sports anime has awakened inside me, and Haikyuu is in the top of it. I don't know if this third season is the best; it's actually hard to choose just one season; to me, each one of them has its qualities, and they're equally outstanding.\r\nIn terms of story, this third season is a direct continuation from the second, so the story mustn't be judged alone,but as a whole, and it's great. Especially the unexpected ending of it, the last few seconds of the episode 10, which opens a new arc to the series, and i'm very anxious to see it, praying for the confirmation of a new season.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say about the art. I think that even the ones that hate Haikyuu consider the art excellent. There is a very fluid animation, varying with many different styles to suit the different sensations the moments shall pass to the person watching it. Yes, it's hard to describe... Just watch it!!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another aspect that i haven't much to talk. It's also outstanding. In both types of soundtracks, dramatic and exciting, Haikyuu stands out. Even though in this third season i missed some of my favorites musics from second season, like Confrontation with the King, they present us with other great ones; and the complete absence, believe me, of any sounds, in some moments, is the best thing they ever made.\\n\\n\r\nTo end this review, Haikyuu has one of the best character development that i have ever seen. All of the main characters and even most of the supporting ones have their importance. It's hard to find a character that you'd say ''I hate this one\", and, actually, the only one that i had this feeling in the first two seasons became the best of this third season, so, yeah, Mr Furudate, the author, likes to play with our feelings.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Haikyuu is one of the best animes i have ever seen and i recommend it to every anime fan. And to the ones that love sports anime, you MUST watch it!!!\\n\\n\r\nStory (9); Art (10); Sound (10); Character (10); Enjoyment (10);\\n\r\nOverall (10).",

            "content": "This season of Haikyuu was consistent in terms of the qualities Haikyuu has presented so far.\r\nBut I'd also like to note that due to its length and enviroments being pretty much stuck in one place due to this season consisting of a really long match, this season of Haikyuu will feel more like a long high budget OVA than a new season. It is a continuation of where it has left off previously, with the finals between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa, the match taking the entire length of this season. There's no new story elements, and the character development that the characters got is now presentedin how the characters evolved, especially a specific character. And just like the other matches of Haikyuu, it focuses on presenting the opponents as well, with the series taking time to explain the motivation and strengths of most key characters in the team. The third season is pretty much the culmination of the character development the characters went through, as well as the presentation of the team of Shiratorizawa, and that's pretty much why the series is so long, and also why it feels like an OVA. It doesn't serve anything new or unexpected, but presents the facets of the series that its fans enjoyed, which is what I think the ideal OVA should be. And as a result of such I consider this season to be good, because it seems well aware of what works in well in Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nThe match itself is fun, it presents Karasuno's versatility and willingness to try new things against a team that has honed their skills in a strong and consistent style to overpower their opponents. While this may make Shiratorizawa sound like a boring team, since this means that mostly Karasuno's players will try to make interesting outlandish plays, Shiratorizawa's team players all have different skills and capabilities, and its the presentation of those skills that is the entertainment value coming from that team, as the team also values individual talent and the ability to score, over necesarily having strong teamplay. So you'll have a player who's a very strong spiker, one who's a very strong blocker, and other such examples.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of drama, I still think Haikyuu is a tad ridiculous, but it didn't really have the opportunity to be overlydramatic this season, because its main focus was a more subdued character in terms of presenting his development and that behaviour helping in relieving a bit of the overcompetitiveness that kinda bothers me in Haikyuu. The overlycompetitive nature of Haikyuu is mostly an issue of the former seasons, so I won't go on talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is consistent and looks as good as it always did, but I assume the fact that they didn't really animate any other locations than two places is due to budget constraints. However, the animation didn't go on a downwards spiral in terms of quality, it's just as fluid and detailed as always. The OST from what I heard was recycled, so there shouldn't be any changes that should unnerve you. Even if there were changes and I'm wrong, I couldn't notice it, and as such, the OST is at least very similar in style and there shouldn't be any problem caused since it's the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nTo end things, I still think its likely that if you enjoyed Haikyuu, you will enjoy this season, and if you didn't, this season won't change your mind. I don't believe that Haikyuu has either risen or declined in quality, and the reason it is well received is because its fans are being delivered the things it has had set up and the things it has prepared it for. Which any good series should know how to do and Haikyuu did. Just be aware of how much you've enjoyed the series so far before starting this season.",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! Season 3\r\nThe cherry on the cake. The top of the iceberg. The worthy ending of a spectecular show (for now). Haikyuu!! is a great show overall, with fluent animations - and even those are getting better from season to season and in the biggest moments even excel that, great and deep characters, a lot of hype and action and PURE enjoyment!\r\nI don't want to go into too much detail into why this show is the greatest sports anime of them all so far, but there is actually nothing they do horribly wrong. Every other sports anime so far had some flaws somewhere, and ifit wasn't for anything really important, it were the animations (example Hajime no Ippo) which hold them back from being the best of all time. Haikyuu!! just does all this right and puts a lot of emotions into it aswell. On top of that, it has one of the best anime OST there is on this planet, and i really can't say this enough. The overall soundtracks got re-used a lot during the show, but everyone .. each of this soundtracks was and is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe First Season was the introduction, how i like to call it, to the show, characters and the sport. But also to the story telling and character development from this show. You started to like the characters, love the way it's told and the way the matches are presented. At the same time, all this was genuinely well done. 9/10 for the First Season.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second Season was the build up. It was the continuation of the rivalry told in Season 1 and it builded up the characters and hype even more. We had a great training proccess, not only in abilities but also character development and growth. We got a lot of new and nice characters and even more rivalries. 9,5/10 for the really unique Second Season.\\n\\n\r\nThe Third Season was the Final. The continuation of the Second Season, right where it left off. But not only that, it really brought up all the emotions and the character growth we got to see in some moments the two seasons before. This third season really shows, how the creators of this manga & show did a god damn amazing job at pacing this and yet having a lot of character depth, so you could feel for the characters. The ending of this season itself was just a perfect way to end it in a typical Haikyuu!! style and to fulfill all the satisfactions the fans had. 10/10 for the worthy Finale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as i said earlier, there is very little Haikyuu!! does wrong, and the only reasons i can see for people to not like this show is the dislike against Sports anime or against the sport Volleyball. Any sports anime fan's heart will burn hot and melt at the end of this show. I really can't say enough, how amazing this anime is and i am so fking glad and proud of it being so high on the ratings. It REALLY deserves that! All Hail Haikyuu!! <3",

            "content": "When I think about Haikyuu!! season 3, one thing comes to mind \r\nDISAPPOINTMENT \r\nFor me at least as an avid fan of Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 what made Haikyuu!! so special was the concept of a human/humans overcoming unrealistic odds without unrealistic things happening (As in Haikyuu!! was grounded in realism). Though the story did not have much to it and the pacing was off at times, whatever was done was usually done fairly well.\r\nThe characters were 2 dimensional and didn't have much to them other then their 1 or 2 major qualities, but this did not bother me much (Since actually depicting humanbehavior precisely in any form of audio visual content is near impossible).\\n\r\nThe art was quite unique and the animation was well done (Relative to some of the animation I've seen in some of the other sports anime) (Not to mention the 2nd opening of season 2 and ending 2 of Season 1). The soundtrack also almost perfectly fit the moments that displayed on screen. With all this Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 managed to create its own environment and sense of feel that got you uplifted and hyped.\\n\r\nThis is what was there in Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the topic at hand Haikyuu!! Season 3:\\n\r\nBy god why did they do this.\\n\r\nThe pacing is horrible (By horrible I mean HORRIBLE). The soundtrack has degraded. Nothing spacial in the OP and ED. Humor has become silly and vague. \\n\r\nMr. Perfect Shiratorizawa has appeared and can do anything (Realism goes to hell). The focus has shifted from the MC (Hinata and Kageyama) and whatever story Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 had has gone to hell.\\n\r\nNote: Animation is still great.(If not better then season 1 and 2)\\n\\n\r\nBut other then the above reasons why disappointment comes to mind when I think of Haikyuu!! season 3 is because I think that Haikyuu!! has lost something special that it had.\\n\r\nI think that that whenever good audio visual content is produced it has its mood or environment and this sense of emotion that it brings into you when you experience it and this has been completely changed and to a great extent Haikyuu!! season 3 has lost what Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 had. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all this I enjoyed Haikyuu!! season 3(Though not more then season 1 and 2) and think that it was one of the better anime of the season but I just feel that Production IG could have done a better job(I understand that some of the points I have made are due to the fact that the anime was only ten episodes and focused only on one match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa but I still feel it's execution was lacking greatly).\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone looking to watch anime:\\n\r\nYES\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone who has seen Season 1 and 2 of Haikyuu!!:\\n\r\nNO\\n\\n\r\nAs of now all I am doing is waiting for Season 4 of Haikyuu!!(Hoping that it will bring back what Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 had.)",

            "content": "Finally the long-awaited match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa is here. Besides the fact that the title is basically a spoiler for those who aren\u2019t caught up to the series, it represents what this season basically is about Karasuno and Shiratorizawa competing to become Miyagi Prefecture's Representative for the Spring High National Playoffs. What was originally teased as the start of the second season finally gets put into play in this short, but fast-paced third season. After the Karasuno vs Aobajousai match at the end of the second season, Karasuno vs Shiratorizawa has a lot to accomplish if it wants to live up to the titleof being the most intense match yet. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nSports anime tend to work on a simplistic story, and they basically run on its sport, characters and their interactions. Haikyuu was the same in the first two seasons and the same goes for the third one. As a matter of fact, this season has the least amount of plot compared to any other season since this is just one match. However, it\u2019s the tiny moments that build up this match into being something much special. The season continues off from the end of the last season after Karasuno won against Aobajousai to compete against Shiratorizawa for the title of representative for the Spring High Nationals. Then starts a long, but fast-paced 10-episode match between the two teams. Though whether the results are predictable or not really depends on what you expect Karasuno\u2019s trend to be. And even if it does feel predictable, there\u2019s so much going on during these matches that it\u2019s hard to feel disinterested about what\u2019s going on. \\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThis season of Haikyuu basically has the same style and directing the previous seasons had. It has it sense of style, one that is similar to most team sports anime. Despite the fact that this season is just a match and there\u2019s no breather moment in this season, there\u2019s still that trademark Haikyuu humor mixed in the seriousness. Even though this is a much shorter season, it has the highest chapters adapted per episode rate compared to the previous seasons, therefore the season feels like it\u2019s always going somewhere. Even though 10 episodes may seem too much for one match, Karasuno vs Shiratorizawa is actually a 5-set match instead of the usual 3 sets. And as a matter of a fact, maybe more episodes would\u2019ve been a little better. After all, the third set basically takes place in a couple of minutes. Haikyuu has always set a standard for consistent production values in not just sports anime, but in anime in general. This season manages to be the best-looking season, and that says a lot. This match manages to be thrilling throughout at the slight bits of flashbacks that are scattered throughout the match adds to the buildup and characters.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nJust like most sports anime, Haikyuu has always been about the characters more than anything. Without a compelling cast of characters, it\u2019s hard to feel interested in a sports anime since they tend to rely less on its story. And Haikyuu was able to prove that with its previous two seasons. This season features the same likable characters you know and love, while introducing a lot of new characters from the Shiratorizawa side. The two main characters of the series, Hinata and Kageyama, are put into good use in this season and has plenty of moments to shine. However, they don\u2019t overshadow their fellow teammates as almost everyone gets a time to shine in this match. Some Karasuno characters get a lot of character development they were originally lacking, especially Tsukishima. Tsukishima was always a cool and enjoyable character, but nothing really made him feel that complex\u2026 well, until this match happened. This season managed to show how he feels about volleyball as a sport and how much dedication can come from him. All of the other characters like Nishinoya, Sawamura and Sugawara are all put into good use too. However, the Shiratorizawa characters feel slightly blander compared to Karasuno\u2019s other rivals, but they still manage to be an interesting team. The star of the team, Ushijima, manages to be what people were expected from him, but unfortunately nothing more. Though the series manages to show his sudden dedication for the match fairly well, it never gives any reason to why we should care about him. Slight bits of his past and childhood helped, but not enough. Another well focused character, Tendou, manages to be a lot more enjoyable, and managed to be the most interesting Shiratorizawa player. His derpy expressions and cocky attitude makes him the most unique character of the series. However, the series tries its best to play the sympathetic card for him, but it felt ineffective. All of the other characters do a good job in contributing to the series.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nHaikyuu\u2019s third season manages to keep its art consistent throughout, even more so than the previous seasons. With the previous seasons, the art always looked good, but during matches it looked ever better. This season is basically just a match, so therefore the entire season ends up looking gorgeous beginning to end. And considering the fact that this season was only 10 episodes, it was probably a lot easier for the animating staff to keep things a lot more consistent. The art in the manga has a rough and stylish feel too it, but also it can look very messy at times. The anime manages to get rid of the messiness, but also maintains the style of the manga. Whether it be the character models, or their reflections on the floor, everything manages to look very pretty. \\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nFor a sports anime, it\u2019s very important for the animation quality to be top-notch since the matches are one of the biggest selling point and if they don\u2019t end up looking good, it can feel very distracting. There have been many cases of where a sports anime was done with little effort, so the matches can end up looking like slideshows with just still pictures (I\u2019m looking at you, Days), or things can look a little crude. With its first two season, Haikyuu not only proved that it\u2019s not only one of the most beautifully animated sports anime, but one of the best-looking anime in general. And with this season\u2019s length, the studio was able to keep the animation quality top-notch and very consistent. The character movements are fluid and the way the camera moves during matches looks amazing. There\u2019s one particular moment near the end of the series where the camera rotates around the court while Karasuno does a synchronized attack, and it\u2019s clear that Production I.G has way too much time on their hands and way too much effort to spend. \\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nFor the most part, all of the seiyuu from the first and second seasons come back to reprise their roles. Just like as before Murase Ayumu and Ishikawa Kaito does a great job as the energetic Hinata and the levelheaded Kageyama. The rest of the Karasuno characters\u2019 seiyuu do a great job as usual too. Uchiyama Kouki in particular did a great job as Tsukishima, especially since his character plays a bigger role than before. The Shiratorizawa characters\u2019 seiyuu also do a very good job too. Takeuchi Ryouta does a good job as the deep-voiced Ushijima. Kimura Subaru (who\u2019s surprisingly half-German and looks very western) does a fantastic job as the quirky Tendou and hopefully he gets more holes after this. One thing to note is that Ukai\u2019s seiyuu, Tanaka Kazunari, passed away not too long ago (may he rest in peace) and his role as Ukai was replaced Egawa Hisao starting from the ninth episode. Tanaka did a great job during his final moments as Ukai, and his final line from the series is a very powerful one for sure. Egawa sounds quite different, but he\u2019s not decent. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nJust like the previous seasons, this season of Haikyuu manages to have an outstanding soundtrack that complements its content. The OP, \u201cHikari Are\u201d managed to be my personal favorite opening for Haikyuu, even though this opening is much different from the previous ones. Unlike the older openings, especially the ones that were done by SPYAIR, where it was more hype-inducing and fast-paced, this season\u2019s opening is more in a slower tone and has a more \u201cput-all-you-got\u201d motivational feel to it. And the lyrics are really good for it too. NICO Touches the Walls returns to do another ED, \u201cMashi Mashi\u201d, and it\u2019s pretty good. It has an upbeat feel to it and it\u2019s quite fun to listen too. It\u2019s was used well at the end of the last episode. As for the background music\u2026 it\u2019s incredible. Anything Hayashi Yuuki composes ends up being amazing. Just like the OST for the first two seasons, this seasons manages to use its music into creating more buildup and increase the tension and hype during the match. Some of the tracks are the same as the previous seasons and there\u2019s some noticeable new ones.\\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAs a Haikyuu fan myself, this match has been immensely enjoyable from beginning to end. Despite the fact that Shiratorizawa isn\u2019t as interesting of an opponent as Aobajousai, their strength manages to make the match feel more intense and become this most thrilling match from the series so far, and it\u2019s much less predictable than Karasuno and Aobajousai\u2019s rematch. And as someone who really liked Tsukishima\u2019s character, it was really nice to see that he\u2019s more complex than he seems. And with the much faster pacing, things manage to feel more thrilling than its original source. Supported by fantastic production values and top-notch music, Haikyuu manages to hit all the right notes in making a successful sports series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this short, but fast-paced season of Haikyuu manages to do everything you would come to expect from this series. With more character development for the Karasuno team, Haikyuu manages to prove that they can do more with their characters and shows what potential these characters have. This season manages to have fantastic production values, even by Haikyuu\u2019s standards. Although, the characters in the Shiratorizawa team isn\u2019t as complex or likable as people were hoping, but they manage to be a strong competitor for Karasuno and they add to the tension. For those who haven\u2019t started this series yet, you owe it to yourself to watch this series. If you\u2019re wondering if Haikyuu is fujoshi-pandering or doesn\u2019t have anything to it other than its sport, rest-assured, it\u2019s nothing like that. And for those who liked the previous seasons, there\u2019s no need for me to recommend this season to you since you\u2019ve probably already watched it. \\n\\n\r\n+ A fantastic match that tops every match preceding it. \\n\r\n+ 10 episodes of non-stop, fast-paced fun with a lot of tension used to build-up moments.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding production values that remain consistent until the very end.\\n\r\n+ Fantastic soundtrack that is used to add tension and hype to the match.\\n\r\n+ The Karasuno characters get good development, especially Tsukishima, as he gets fleshed out well. \\n\r\n- Despite them being a strong competitor, the Shiratorizawa characters aren\u2019t as likable as Karasuno\u2019s previous rivals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4/10",

            "content": "STORY: This is basically the moment where we all have been waiting for. In this season, two teams faced off against each other out of 5 sets. We can see the intensity and skills that both teams bring to the court. We can also see most of the characters that have made their appearances from the previous season. The anime emphasizes on the moves of the volleyball players (especially spikes and overhand serves). Both teams are being savages towards each during the matches\u2026 I find it to be amusing and hilarious (especially when its coming from Karasuno). The essence of what Haikyuu represents is stillbeing maintained in this season.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Still an awesome anime to watch. In all honesty, I'm surprised that this season has 10 episodes and not 12 (like the previous seasons). -- I'm not sure why they decided to go on that route. Overall, I still love what I am seeing with the matches. Win or lose -- Karasuno is an amazing team and I'm happy that we get to grow with them.",

            "content": "\u201cEven if we're not confident that we'll win, even if others tell us we don't stand a chance, we must never tell ourselves that.\u201d\u2028-Daichi Sawamura \r\nIn today's anime age; a world filled with over-analyzations and deconstructions, it's always nice to see a series like Haikyuu come along as if to passively antagonize critics with its immense amount of hype. I've been quite guilty of it in the past, often thinking there was no other reason to watch a series than to critique how much it made you 'think'. But to all the fault-finding reviewers and critics out there (myself included), I have one thing tosay... just save your words for once. People aren\u2019t watching this anime to tirelessly dissect its story or characters on a philosophical level. Haikyuu is about having fun, comradery and the love of volleyball. The ultimate underdog story. That's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you told me a couple of years ago that an anime franchise involving high school sports would become one of my favorites in the medium, I probably would've laughed in your face. But I've come to realize that the quality of an anime goes beyond how it makes you think. How it makes you feel is just as important... because at the end of the day, most of us watch anime as a means to escape the repetition of everyday life and just enjoy ourselves. It transports us somewhere exciting, somewhere we normally don\u2019t experience ourselves. Anime should be fun, and Haikyuu is no exception to that. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu's third season could almost be viewed as an expansion pack to the main series, or as one reviewer put it, much like DLC for your favorite video game. This is a fair assessment given the truncated 10 episodes compared to the first two seasons of 26 episodes each. Karasuno finds themselves pitted against the powerhouse Shiratorizawa, in a 5 set match no one expects them to win. There is less character development overall, but more than enough action to make up for it. I\u2019d say this season emulates the intense tone produced by the last few episodes in season 2, my favorites of the entire series. The result is a nail-biting, pulse-pounding thrill ride to the match's epic conclusion. It's just what I needed to get me through a relatively lackluster fall season. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of story this season, due mostly to its shorter run time. Being in a 5 set match is unfamiliar territory for our favorite Karasuno team, which begins to show as the series progresses. Exhaustion starts to become a factor, and for the first time I can remember in Haikyuu, players begin to tire mentally and physically. This incorporates an important aspect of playing sports, making the characters that much more relatable to someone who\u2019s been there. We also see a culmination of the variety of new skills Karasuno\u2019s players have been practicing come to fruition when they matter the most. Whether from Nishinora\u2019s jump-setting or Tsukishima\u2019s read-blocking, each player plays a pivotal role in turning the tides at one or more points during the match. The writers of Haiykuu also continue their emphasis on the backgrounds of Karasuno\u2019s opponents throughout the match. It was a tad watered down from last season, and I would still have liked to see Ushijima\u2019s past elaborated on more. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the whole series up to this point is the sudden mental involvement displayed by none other than the deadpan Tsukishima. Normally Tsuki exhibits a personality as dynamic as a cardboard box, but shocks us all as he begins to become more engaged and driven to help out his team. He emulates the mentality that no one likes to lose, and I found myself actually cheering out loud for him when he blocked Ushijima for the first time. Another refreshing point to bring up about the cast is how passive a role Hinata and Kageyama actually play in this season. As the series progresses, the narrative shifts from the drive and determination of Hinata as an individual to the importance of teamwork and synergy. The result is truly powerful and I\u2019ve begun to really get attached to every member of Karasuno\u2019s team. \\n\\n\r\nObviously the hype in Haikyuu is beyond unreal, and the third season is the best example of this. Even the relatively stone-faced members of Shiratorizawa get wrapped up in the excitement. Anime has proven time and time again that you can breathe life and intensity into any subject matter. Some people may fault the series for its plethora of overreactions and such, but at this point the viewer should come to expect it based on the precedent laid out by Haikyuu\u2019s first two seasons. It\u2019s the necessary evil of sports anime, but one I have grown to forgive Haikyuu for because I love it the series that much. Even up until the last episode, the result of the match was unclear and allowed me to stay glued to my screen for the entire 10 episodes. Karasuno doesn\u2019t always win, and that vulnerability makes you cheer for them even harder when they do. \\n\\n\r\nIs it better than Season 2? Unfortunately, the abridged format coupled with less interesting characters cause it to fall short of the brilliance surrounding the second installment. Many of the training camp episodes from last season did more to add to the story than I realized, causing viewers to really bond with the opposing players that much more. Not to mention Oikawa being the character you wanted to cheer for but couldn\u2019t. Another aspect of the series I didn\u2019t find to be irritating until this point was the lack of family members from Karasuno\u2019s players being shown in the stands. Instead we are limited to a select few that are grouped together while the rest of the crowd seems to consist of the student body. From attending many high school sporting events in the past, it can be somewhat hard to fathom how the parents of these kids aren\u2019t even in the picture in their matches. A small complaint, but one I just don\u2019t understand. Maybe Furudate (creator) though Haikyuu had enough characters already! \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is still solid and the music is consistently upbeat and powerful. There are quite a few recycled tracks from the earlier seasons, which I actually found comforting more than stale for the series. The sound editing and effects are some of the best in the business, as Haikyuu delivers again with its realistic gymnasium sounds and crowd noises. The animation also seems like it received a significant upgrade from the show\u2019s debut season, rivaling other sports series like Ping Pong in its level of \u201cover-the-top-ness\u201d.. Granted, only having to edit together one setting for the entire season probably allowed the animation team to expand their skills in other, more intricate areas. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up this season in one sentence (as recommended by one of my MAL pals), Haikyuu S3 is \u201cA white-knuckled underdog story driving 100 mph over the speed limit, wearing a huge grin the entire time.\u201d It\u2019s a series best viewed in one binge-watching session rather than enjoyed week by week, and is only bested by it\u2019s previous installment. If you\u2019ve seen the first two seasons, you\u2019re already behind the curve by not picking this one up... it\u2019s a hell of a good time! Thanks for reading and be sure to look out for more of my Fall \u201816 reviews! \\n",

            "content": "Given the monumental amount of hype that Haikyuu seems to have within its own fan base, I hope that this review will not come across as more negative than I intended it to, so I would just like to start by saying that Haikyuu is for sure one of the better traditional sports anime I have seen, but even so it is still far from perfect.\r\nThis third season picks up right where the last one left off, throwing us right into the Spring Tournament regional finals between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. And that is pretty much the entirety of what this season is about as itis significantly shorter at merely 10 episodes, and all of that is spent on this single best-of-five finals. However, the shorter length also means that there is very little downtime, and thus pretty much every single episode of this season is action-packed and engaging, unlike the second season which spent its entire first half on nothing but lackluster training arcs, so I definitely consider this to be an improvement on paper.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit that generally speaking I am not really a fan of hot-blooded shounen series, nor am I particularly fond of sports outside of real life, so this definitely has an impact on my enjoyment of Haikyuu as well. In short, this anime is very predictable. It is one thing to be able to guess the eventual winner, but for example I should not be able to so easily say in which order the sets are going to be won by the respective sides, because it is all made to play out in the way which creates the maximum amount of hype for the viewers. It just... feels pretty fake. And even the rallies within the sets themselves are generally pretty predictable; the camera focuses especially on one player for a bit and lets you see things from his perspective, at which point you can rest assured that the next point or two is going to be decided by him. Eventually the other players will adapt to whatever strategy he is using and then break his streak, at which point the focus will shift to someone else where the same thing will play out. It feels like it is all following a script. That said, I do have to admit that even though it feels pretty unnatural, it is undoubtedly quite effective. Thanks to the stellar directing that Haikyuu has, it really manages to make every point feel important and engaging, and the amount of emotion stemming from the players is not to be underestimated. You can really feel how much this means to everyone and how badly they want to win, no matter the cost. However, that still does not change the fact that the progression of the actual sets is simply too clean and perfect, and feels like it is following too much of a rigid pattern rather than portray the chaos that volleyball so often becomes in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I should probably mention that I am by no means an expert on volleyball and my knowledge of it is limited to what I have learned in PE class and from watching it on TV. However, this also proves a point of mine even further because despite my lack of expertise on the subject matter, I still find that I legitimately know more about the sport than these players do a lot of the time. I feel like Haikyuu oftentimes treats me like an idiot. Why is it that these supposedly national level athletes are just now taught what certain basic positions and tactics like angle blocking are? That makes no sense at all. I mean yes, I realize that the mangaka wants to teach things to the readers/viewers who have little to no understanding of volleyball whatsoever, but could you not have done so in a way which does not straight-up lower the story's sense of realism? For example, you could have just thrown in some short non-canon tutorials for the sake of the audience without interfering with the plot progression at all. On top of that there are also a couple points which are just plain implausible, like that it is supposedly harder to play against left-handed players than right-handed ones. What kind of sense does that make? This is volleyball, not football. The ball reaches its destination in less than a second when spiking so there is absolutely no way the opposite spin direction would have time to curve the trajectory in any relevant way at all, and given how lightweight the ball is I do not see how the spin would make it any harder to pass or receive either.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really annoys me about this third season (which is a problem which actually did not exist in the prior seasons) is the complete lack of preparation from Karasuno prior to the finals. I mean think about it; Shiratorizawa is supposed to be the most famous team in the entire region for their age bracket, and they have won multiple big tournaments over the last few years already. On top of that they have a superstar ace player in Ushijima who seemingly everyone knows about. So why is it that Karasuno are seemingly learning who their opponents are during the actual finals itself? They should have tons and tons of easily accessible information about every single one of the starting players they're facing since ages ago, and should thus have been appropriately prepared for what was coming well ahead of time. Especially considering that this is a shounen series where pretty much every player has some super specific skillset like Ushijima's raw power spikes and Tendou's \"Guess Monster\" gimmick, rather than just being all-round solid players like you generally expect high-level players to be in real life. In other words coming up with hard counters should be much easier here than in reality as long as you know what you are dealing with ahead of time, which again, Karasuno really should have known. Like I can sort of understand the opposite scenario with how Shiratorizawa may have been confident enough in their victory to not really care about researching their opponents, and similarly Karasuno's matches in earlier rounds and tournaments have been against lesser opposition so I guess that excuse might somewhat apply there too, but for this finals, not so much. It is like taking a college exam without studying for it and just hoping that your raw talent will be enough for you to figure out the answers on the spot. Sure, maybe that will work out for you, but it still seems a hell of a lot smarter to just study ahead of time instead. The same logic applies for Karasuno in this tournament finals.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of skillsets, I also have to say that the aforementioned abilities in particular are pretty ridiculous. Does any professional volleyball player base their moves around trying to read their opponents' eye movements and similar like Tendou does? You think you have time to do something like that in a sport as fast-paced as volleyball? I highly doubt it. And as far as Ushijima goes, I find his ability to be really dumb. For one it is rather uncreative with how it is basically all power and very little strategy involved, but more importantly that kind of strength makes no sense at all. As briefly mentioned earlier, a volleyball is pretty lightweight, and even the most forceful spike can only generate so much kinetic energy as a result. So the fact that Ushijima's spikes could be so strong that they can just go straight through blocks is just ridiculous. There is no way that should happen. In summary, there are quite a lot of aspects of Haikyuu which are just plain unrealistic, which is ironic given that one of the common praises I keep seeing for the show is its supposed realism.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said though, I still consider Haikyuu to be a pretty good anime in general because despite its flaws, it is a lot of fun to watch nonetheless, and it is both addictive and engaging. The problems with it mostly lie with the details, but the more general aspects are all quite solid. For one, the production value is extremely good. I am not sure if I have ever seen a sports anime with as fluid animation as Haikyuu has, so Production I.G definitely deserves a large part of the credit for the show's success. And similarly, the soundtrack serves to both severely ramp up the level of intensity of the matches as well as enhance the emotional impact when need be, with all-round crisp and stellar timing. The characters are perhaps not utterly amazing in terms of writing but they have a lot of development, and discounting the part where they sometimes seem clueless to things they really should not be, they generally do feel quite believable and admirable. In this particular season I think it is especially Tsukishima who gets the most development as something that had been building up since almost the very start of the show ends up paying off in full, which was quite satisfying to see. Looking back at how he used to be, it almost feels like watching a completely different person by the end of this season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, before ending this I would just like to touch upon something concerning this anime's fan base which has always annoyed me and I did not know where else to put it. Time and time again I see people (especially those that have not actually seen it) label Haikyuu as \"homosexual volleyball\". In a sense this is understandable given the unbelievable amount of Haikyuu-themed male-on-male romance fan art and fanfics there are out there, often sexual in nature, so clearly in terms of how the fujoshi treat it this is not incorrect. However, the actual anime itself is not gay at all. It is not like Yuri on Ice which has blatant homoerotic tension shoved into your face pretty much every episode; Haikyuu has nothing of the sort. I have never seen the guys in this show stare deeply into each other's eyes, be bashful in each other's presence, end up in any compromising positions with each other or shown any signs of being interested in one another beyond mere friends and teammates. I may not be a volleyball player, but I did play football for many years so I can at least say that there is nothing remotely homosexual about simply playing in the same sports team as a bunch of other guys and passionately wanting to win together. So please stop trash talking Haikyuu for supposedly being yaoi-bait and avoiding it solely because of that, because it is not only a silly reason but also just plain incorrect. Blame a certain obsessive minority of the fan base if you so desire, but not the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the third season of Haikyuu is an overall solid addition to an already well-established franchise which for the most part maintains the same strengths and weaknesses as its prior seasons despite being less than half the length. It is also more straight to the point than ever before as there is significantly less fluff, and as a result every episode feels fast-paced (but not too fast) and important. And while I wish that it had done a couple things differently, as a whole it is nonetheless a very enjoyable anime which is definitely worth checking out. Not that I see why you would not watch this season as well if you have already invested enough time to get through 50 episodes of it previously. If you have seen and liked the first two seasons already, there really is no reason to not watch this one as well.",

            "content": "\u201cYou are only an amazing ace if you can create a miracle.\u201d \r\nScratch that cheesy quote! If there is one idea this anime solidifies, it's, \u201cYou are only an amazing anime if you can create perfectly timed miracles!\u201d \r\nHaikyuu!!: Karasuno Koukou VS Shiratorizawa Gakuen Koukou is literally, as the synopsis on MAL states, an anime where the whole plot revolves around the over hyped game between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. This is the third installment in the Haikyuu!! franchise and I recommend you all to watch how a studio who lacks enough manga material to field a full 25 episode season, manages to show their over-hypedfans one match in 10 gruesome long episodes. Let\u2019s be honest, they know the fanbase would\u2019ve watched it regardless being padded with endless flashbacks to justify the \u201cmiracles\u201d during the game. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t any story to this anime. It\u2019s just an anime about one game. The difficulty lies in how can you make one game super interesting when you\u2019ve used up pretty much every possible curveball scenarios a team must overcome in the past two seasons. Simple, throw in Mr. Super Android Perfection, Ushijima, Wakatoshi, whose major difference is he can spike with his left hand. Did I mention, he is also mister Perfection? How will the mortal humans of Karasuno overcome this new hurdle? Maybe they will have to use their clich\u00e9 secret weapon aka the power of friendship, bonding, camaraderie. Top that with over use of flashbacks to justify why one player is able to block one single spike or net a point. Being the final game in the competition, there are 5 sets, so logically, viewers would think 2 episodes per set. WRONG. Another slider the studio throws at the viewer is they made one game over in the blink of few seconds and spends 4 episodes over another game. The pacing of the show is damaged tremendously by the amount of flashbacks explaining every little strategy  and over usage of slow-mos. We get it, you want the viewers to understand volleyball, but you have to stop dumbing it down so much, especially when it is the 3rd season. Nevertheless, you can legit create a drinking game out of the amount of times Mister Perfection is in the air trying to take a spike. Be warned though, Production IG is not responsible for your hospital bill. The best thing about the story is that they knew when to stop from pulling a Naruto level filler.\\n\\n\r\nIf an anime lacks story surely the characters would be memorable right? Wrong. Other than maybe one or two characters, no one else really went through any major growth or change. Heck the fans had more character growth than the players did during this game. The anime tries to stray away from the main characters, Hinata and Kageyama,  and focus on Tsukki and Mister Perfection (Ushijima). But the major refreshing character to come out of this anime is Tendou aka Guess Monster. It is really hard to attach yourself to any characters and it feels like if fans enjoyed a certain character prior to this season, they will closely identify with that character. It\u2019s good that every character pretty much gets similar screen time so it adheres to the concept of winning or losing as a team except for the bench players. Let\u2019s be real, why would both team\u2019s coach even put them in such a crucial game.  One major issue is that most players still lack the ability to jump serve this late into the competition.  Aside from the characters being pigeonholed into having yaoi moments for the fandom/fanfiction most of the characters will be easily forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nUp to this point, it might feel like why should we watch such an abysmal show that suffers greatly in story and character. Well if there is one thing Haikyuu!! franchise gets right time after time, it\u2019s their art and soundtrack. By utilizing hand drawn animation and bold vibrant colours, the studio is able to provide a rich realistic style of anime that is unique and memorable for the viewers. The animation stayed true throughout the series. Regardless, being a sports shounen anime where you will come across multiple players that pretty much look the same. It makes you wonder did the studio do it to make the major character stand out or the only way they know how to differentiate one character from the other is thick or thin eyebrows. Although the OP and ED song for this anime didn\u2019t really stand out like in previous seasons but keep in mind that OP/ED tends to be subjective. However, the background music was spot on during the games. They were able to create the necessary hype and cliff-hanger the show requires to further along the plot episode after episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, criticisms aside, Haikyuu!! 3 is a great sports anime whose primary goal is to showcase the epic David vs Goliath story of Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. They did execute that really well except they took two too many episodes to show it. Instead of stretching it to 10 episodes they could\u2019ve released a movie or make it a 6-7 episode short anime due to lack of manga material. Regardless, I would recommend watching the first two seasons prior to watching this anime and don\u2019t forget to binge this season. I had fun watching it, provided me great laughs and memories but tbh I wouldn\u2019t rewatch this particular season. Although the ending of the anime did promise another sequel and here\u2019s to hoping the next season will be far better than this season! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.

            "content": "The match point is finally here. You\u2019re the one to take the first step in securing the final point. You start your way to behind the serving line. Your whole body is warmed up, but somehow your hands are still ice-cold, initiated by the sheer thought of failing in this crucial moment. The pressure is immense, yet you still don\u2019t waste a thought on not giving your all. If you make that one more point you\u2019ll win the match. Just one more point and all your hard work will be rewarded. Amidst that thought, you toss the ball in the air and set off foryour final jump, not even thinking about not hitting it with full strength. \\n\r\nThese or similar thoughts almost everyone did have when playing competitively and funnily enough while watching Haikyuu (HQ) I got thrown back to similar memories of mine. Even though HQ is definitely a show which bends reality and pulls of moves which are not possible in real life, its' narrative is absolutely able to pull me back to when I was playing on the court during tournaments.\\n\\n\r\nThe third season of Haikyuu had really high expectations to fulfill for its fans since S2 did the utmost best to develop every single character of Karasuno appropriately and with reason. They were not afraid to show the slowly escalating fight between Hinata and Kageyama in its fullest, giving both of their points of view valid facts to understand them and I simply loved how they came on a common consensus in the following episodes. Season 2, for the most part, was rather laid-back, but when the long-awaited rematch with Seijoh happened in the last five episodes, the tension rose up significantly in just a couple of minutes. It was almost as if the tone of the series changed when they were to play their archrivals once again.\\n\\n\r\nThe mixture between high tension volleyball-matches, glorious development of a cast with numerous very likable characters and absolutely hilarious comedy has made me love the previous two seasons of Haikyuu. But, coming into Season 3 I was rather skeptical, since the title already stated, that they were only going to cover the final match against Shiratorizawa. Adding further insult to injury, it was only going to be 10 episodes long! My past-self was convinced, that no way in hell it would be as good as the previous seasons, furtherly negatively assured by the fact, that KnB\u2019s 10 episodes long final game was painfully over-stretched, no matter how I thought about it. Unsurprisingly, I was right from the get-go, that the successful mixture of the reasons why HQ is that great will be a little off-balance, however surprisingly it did not bug me in the slightest since season S3 was the ultimate embodiment of HYPE. The creators somehow managed to deliver the same tension Seijoh\u2019s rematch in S2 had over a total of ten episodes, adding more and more intensity from episode to episode, to finally explode in the final two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t lose words to the show\u2019s premise since everybody already knows of what this season is about, when watching the two previous ones. The first few episodes (essentially the first set) was not as enthralling as the ones to come since it both teams were testing the waters and each other\u2019s abilities at the beginning of the match. However, it quickly became better when the first set ended, getting more and more exciting to see, how Karasuno were facing every single hardship they were thrown at by the defending kings Shiratorizawa.\\n\r\nOne thing a lot of people criticized HQ for doing in the past, was for not showing the entirety of a match and rather picks crucial moments to show to the audience. While I can definitely see the problem a lot of people are having there (it did bug me in S1 as well), in S3 it would be absolute madness to show the more than half of every set, since it would just lead the series to become boring and the meaningful moments to feel anticlimactic. HQ\u2019s narration is perfectly adapted in explaining all the happenings, feelings and reasons why a team falls behind/catch up perfectly (usually explained by the coach or important and known members of the audience), so there is no need to show more than it is necessary. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I mentioned the lack of character development in S3 in comparison to its predecessor, it\u2019s not like they were skipping it entirely by any means. Characters of Shiratorizawa are introduced effectively during the match with flashbacks and chain of thoughts, making them feel almost as real and likable, as Karasuno\u2019s line-up. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the audiovisuals, the final season of HQ is an absolute blast. The production-values are constantly incredibly high, making it almost impossible to find any lazy artwork/animation in the entire series! Production I.G. did constantly pour more and more money into making Haikyuu as it was progressing, mostly due to the (maybe kind of unexpected) large audience and fanbase the series was developing. The art style is superb, the animation so fluent you\u2019d think it runs on 60 FPS+ and the directing is constantly top-notch as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs this season is only 10 episodes long, there\u2019s no second opening this time. However, that\u2019s no reason to be sad about since \u2018Hikari Are\u2019 is EASILY the best opening the series has up until this day, both music and animation-wise. The symbolism between \u2018the fight of the black crow and the white eagle\u2019 is omnipresent in the show and used magnificently in the opening as well, making use of a darker color-palette and an incredibly detailed art-quality. \\n\r\nThe OST of the series constantly delivers, no matter what situation it has to accompany with appropriately. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe third season of Haikyuu does not disappoint in any way, as some people maybe have expected it to. While it is a little inferior to S2 due to the lack of incredibly effective conflicts within the main team and glorious character development resulting of it, it tops all the thrills I got from the previous two seasons. S3 is adding more and more fuel from episode to episode, until it finally explodes into pure awesomeness and hype at the finale, which resulted in me jumping through the entire room because of how pumped up I was. It offers maybe four of the five best moments of the entire series and in combination with the high-quality audiovisuals and the feeling of absolute importance during the whole match, it earns a spot in my favourites as well. So if you\u2019re a fan of HQ already, go watch it right now, you probably have to marathon it anyways. And if you\u2019re not already\u2026GO WATCH THE FIRST TWO SEASONS!\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nArt (9/10), Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "Like many other people, I initially wasn't attracted to Haikyuu. Seeing clips and hearing about anime such as Free made me think that Haikyuu too would be another fanservice sports anime. I was surprised, however, to find that I immensely enjoyed Haikyuu. Haikyuu is by no means my favorite anime, but it is the anime that I have become the most attached to.\r\nStory: 8\r\nIf you've watched other sports anime such as Kuroko no Basket, the overall storyline is rather predictable, almost to the point where the anime becomes less enjoyable (as it lacks on that overall sense of surprise that is important in anime). Luckily,Haikyuu isn't about the overall story as much as it is about character development and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThey really went all out with the art this season. The action scenes' animation looks incredibly good. Furthermore, they incorporate a lot of interesting visual metaphors which I find appealing (ex. http://imgur.com/a/9Oh9z ). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Haikyuu is godlike. Voice actors are good. A lot of people complained that they didn't like Coach Ukai's new VA, but I think it's fine. (R.I.P Kazunari Tanaka).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are probably why so many people like Haikyuu. Haikyuu creates deep, interesting characters that have their own personality. Each set of members on a team will elicit feelings from the viewer. If you personally enjoy character development, Haikyuu has a lot of it, and I mean A LOT (ex. Tsukki).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI looked forward to watching this every week; so much so that I don't want to read the manga since I'm afraid it will lessen my enjoyment of the anime adaption. After the first season, I became unhealthily attached to the characters (save me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nYou might see the 8 I gave the story. But all that matters is my personal enjoyment so Haikyuu gets an easy 5/7 from me.",

            "content": "Susumu Mitsunaka turns out to be a type of director that the sports genre needs: a superfan and a Japanese pop culture savant. He\u2019s back with another highly anticipated sequel to the smash hit series adapted from Haruichi Furudate\u2019s manga. With its third instalment of Haikyuu!! it strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. It tells the harsh yet rewarding journey that the Karasuno High School volleyball team is taking in order to reach their goal of soaring the skies of the nationals! The team was formerly known as \u201ca fallen powerhouse, a crow that can\u2019t fly,\u201dhas finally arrived on the big stage of the Spring tournament\u2014the final where the incomparable Shiratorizawa Academy awaits them. This is Karasuno\u2019s greatest challenge yet and their adversary\u2019s ace, Wakatoshi Ushijima, the best player in the Miyagi Prefecture, standing in their way. Since this match is the third-year players last chance to qualify for nationals, Karasuno is determined more than ever and they have to apply everything they have learned thus far to attain victory.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever draws you to Haikyuu!! whether it be Shouyou Hinata\u2019s inspiring journey to follow in the footsteps of former Karasuno Ace \"Little Giant\", Tobio Kageyama\u2019s unyielding disposition, the sport's culture of encouragement and positivity, or a variety of characters with diverse personalities learning to see eye to eye with one another\u2014will not only persist until the finale, but increase in intensity. It never loses sight of what it is, a sports anime with a lot of heart and an uplifting message of team unity and friendship, whether its characters fail or succeed. Its an epic battle that cranks the adrenaline up to eleven, both teams pull out all the stops by taking risks like using new moves learnt in prior training camps in a real match for the first time in hopes of gaining the advantage\u2014playing past their limits to the point of exhaustion and muscle fatigue knowing that they have to do their own job in order for their teammates to fulfil their roles. There\u2019s lots of heroics on-display here since every moment is life-and-death and the tension is ratcheting up more and more with everyone\u2019s fate hanging in the balance on every point. \\n\\n\r\nHinata and Kageyama truly complete each other with the dynamic duo trying to prove their combination is as strong as Ushijima. The older players have also experienced growth. They have become more composed and reliable. Even those who were always on the sidelines have taken their place in the court during this season. A key highlight is that there was no character derailment and that was very important for this match. A criticism I have with shounen anime is that sometimes a series would show character derailment for the sake of character development. Tsukishima Kei and Yamaguchi Tadashi, the remaining freshman are a far cry from how they were in prior seasons. Here they have become quite capable players that their seniors can rely on. Tsukishima went through a much-needed development and the way it was executed was just masterful and it\u2019s a moment that steals the show, you have to see for yourself. Every player had a pivotal moment that changed the flow at one point or several times of the final. What stuck out to me the most the importance of team unity, not one crumbled under pressure, they picked each other up off the deck with their never-say-die attitude and pressed forward. During the match, we get flashbacks and monologues from the Shiratorizawa team and during the course of the match, Karasuno realizes that they\u2019re human. Cracks started to show, they do feel pressure and they do make mistakes. This makes them a lot more real as characters and relatable that at times you find yourself cheering for them.\\n\\n\r\nA strength that many series cannot acclaim for that Haikyuu!! can is how it manages to consistently maintain through each season the high quality in visuals and animation for the duration of its action sequences. Its definitely on the higher end of the spectrum and it\u2019s a standard that Production I.G have set for the industry and they are the leaders when it comes to digital animation techniques. They went a step further by utilizing every tool available to the medium to make the experience much grander and stunning. This is the same studio that gave you series like Attack on Titan and Psycho-Pass. Both opening and ending theme songs, Hikari Are and Mashi Mashi by Burnout Syndromes and they embody high levels of remembrance. The soundtrack is just amazing, they re-use some tracks from prior seasons and they play at the right time to get the blood boiling and hype the moment. Voice acting maintain its usual strong performances but sadly actor Tanaka Kazunari, who plays Keishin Ukai, passed away from a brain haemorrhage at just 49 years old. Ukai is a very important character in Haikyuu!! It\u2019s very heartbreaking to lose a talented seiyuu far too young. Hisao Egawa stepped in to replace the role and he did a fine job. I like to think of how well this season went, it was a fitting tribute to Kazunari, many thanks to his fine works and he will be missed.\\n\\n\r\nThis season of Haikyuu!! only contains 10 episodes but I think it\u2019s a fitting number given that it\u2019s about a final match for the Spring tournament. I recommend watching it all in one go as it would be a lot more of an enjoyable experience. It\u2019s a prime example of how great manga should be adapted\u2014consistently faithful while not limited by being so. It's such a joy to see how the characters were handled from the beginning, all the way to the current season. The pace at which the characters grow is perfect in a way where they don\u2019t catapult instantly from the bottom to the top\u2014you get to observe their development from a grassroots level, you witness their struggles, you see them fail and stumble along the way and what they have learned from it. You then see them apply those lessons through the effort they make in their training which gave birth to their newly found motivation and goals, you get to perceive the steps they took to achieve them. It really is the classic \u2018David versus Goliath\u2019 type of match that throws in some drama, high stakes and some curveballs before the climax. Karasuno were called the outcasts, the leftovers, they were given no chance. Will you? Against the odds, the flightless crows take to the skies for an electrifying showdown.\\n",

            "content": "(Review got removed because it was updated to completion ;-; gotta make the climb back)\r\nWell, pains me to say, but I\u2019m gonna be the wiener who has to tell everyone the flaws of Haikyuu! again.\r\nI\u2019m going to preface this review by saying that because I actually play volleyball, lots of the issues I have with the show are specific to someone who has knowledge of high-level high school volleyball, so because the vast majority of this fanbase doesn\u2019t know anything about volleyball outside of this show, you might not be as annoyed at certain things as I am. This is just one humble man\u2019s opinion.\r\nIwant to make clear that Haikyuu is not a bad show by any means, and in fact, I think it\u2019s better than the vast majority of sports anime. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t like shounen, which Haikyuu makes itself painfully obvious that it is. There\u2019s no subtlety, everything is tell, don\u2019t show. They try to teach you the sport of volleyball as you watch and act like you\u2019re 8 years old while doing so. They have to explain each and every little intricate rule, which ultimately makes the show less entertaining and harder to sit through, especially when you know everything they explain in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nObviously the animation for this show is fantastic, as expected. There is nothing to complain about from the art or sound departments, except for the fact that S2 had a better OP, but that\u2019s subjective ;) Soundtrack can\u2019t be expected to be incredible for a 10 episode series about literally one match, but the sound design and effects are spot-on as usual, so I don\u2019t think it really matters at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can truly say is a virtue of the show (aside from the gay undertones, those are always of quality) is that the atmosphere of the matches in Haikyuu are great. There\u2019s enough tension and stress without it causing the viewing experience to suffer, but it\u2019s also realistic enough to not just turn into a joke or feel like there are no consequences. The rivalries are quite plausible and well-developed (if a bit cheesy at times) and I love the camaraderie between members of different teams, it warms my heart.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like about Haikyuu is how nothing comes easy. You sometimes see in sports shows that if you just put training in, you can\u2019t lose. That\u2019s not the case at all, you have to have talent or your work means nothing. The players in Haikyuu all have to use their individual skillsets to better the team\u2019s chances at winning, and while it\u2019s not necessarily a revolutionary concept, it\u2019s executed well beyond mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other things I like about this show, these are just the ones I\u2019m best able to provide my unique opinion on rather than just the standard \u201ci like haikyuu beucase haikyuu has good plot and characters and hype!\u201d. If you want to know my opinion on anything, go ahead and ask me.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have to get to the things I don\u2019t enjoy about Haikyuu!\\n\\n\r\nThe main complaint I have is how stupidly overpowered Ushijima is. Even the players on the US youth national team aren\u2019t as unstoppable as him. That kind of power to just blast through blocks does not exist, his inability to be stopped, and the fact that he only hits hard (no variety) just grinds my gears. They also pretend like he\u2019s special for being left-handed as if no other players in Haikyuu! are lefties?\\n\\n\r\nI feel like that this show has reached a point where they\u2019ve run out of ways to make each match interesting and unique. In the last season there were so many matches played and there\u2019s only so much variation that can exist before it all begins to blend together. Their way of mending this problem was to add massive ass-pulls to add extra flavor such as the \u201cGuess Monster\u201d bit, the whole Shiratorizawa underdog setter thing, Tsukishima for no reason at all just becoming a blocking lord, the forced backstory for the third-years in episode 6, all the little annoying conversations under the net, and various other little quirks that feel forced and unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the games. They\u2019re too perfect and choreographed. Everything that happens is either pass, set kill, or bad pass, cover, free ball, other team passes, set, kill. There\u2019s no chaos, which is what makes volleyball such a unique sport, the unpredictability and sheer magnitude of sensory overload and things you have to pay attention to all at the same time. Now I understand that they can\u2019t animate all of this because that\u2019s just unreasonable, but it still makes it feel like Haikyuu! is doing the sport of volleyball a disservice because of it. The games don\u2019t feel smooth, they feel like a writer mapped them all out (which obviously still would\u2019ve happened if they DID feel random, just don\u2019t worry about it and hit that \u201cHelpful\u201d button below my review) and eliminated unpredictability. This could\u2019ve been helped by all the actions and transitions being sped up, but I recognize that you gotta fit 5 sets into 10 episodes so whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe final thing that made me want to poop my pants were some of the ridiculously basic things these players are just learning. I cannot believe in episode 2 they had to explain what the position \u201cOpposite\u201d was. Position names are quite literally the first thing you learn in volleyball and the opposite is just anyone who hits on the right side. Boggles my mind. Something else they mention is using the strategy of taking away angles to force them to hit to certain areas. That is also something you learn the very first time you learn how to block. Why does it take Tsukishima explaining every single move to his outside for them to just put up a competent block on their own? So frustrating how easy it should be, but Haikyuu! takes everything easy and makes it difficult. Yet again, I don\u2019t get how these national-level high school athletes don\u2019t understand this basic stuff.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really understand why everyone is so crazed with this season. Rank #6 overall is ridiculously high for a 10 episode show about a match of volleyball. In my opinion, it was worse than the previous 2 due to its lack of diversity and having to always take itself way too seriously. I\u2019m also fearful of what\u2019s to come. The ending was very predictable and with them going to nationals, it\u2019s going to be potentially annoying to have to see the writers try (and possibly fail) to come up with unique, engaging ways to present challenges posed by foreign teams. Is it going to be basically just the same thing as the last 2 seasons except with different characters? Who knows?\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! I\u2019m always open to feedback, so if you have some, feel free to hit up my profile.",

            "content": "I take it back, I take it all back. I originally wrote a review during the season where I was of the opinion that this season was lacking compared to the first two. Still good, but not as great story wise. Well I just watched the final episode and hours later I'm still an emotional wreck.\r\nIf you're a fan of Haikyuu!! (as I assume you are, since this is Season 3) don't get discouraged while watching this season. Originally, I had thought that since this season was one long game that the story was a bit lacking. That it may have been a mistake tomake the season solely focused on Shiratorizawa. But, my friends, I easily admit I was so wrong.  The build up that the entire season works towards... it's just epic. \\n\\n\r\nWatch it, and you'll understand what I mean.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy original review, just to show that I really was of the mind it was lacking: \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! is basically my favorite anime of all time, to reiterate on my review of the first season. To also reiterate sports anime aren't really my favorite genre,\\n\\n\r\n But even though I'm a huge fangirl I have to admit, this season isn't as great as the first two. I'd give it a 7.5 if I could. What's largely lacking is the story. Of course, since the season is less than half the number of episodes of each of the previous seasons it's going to not have room for as much development.  But it's still a little disappointing that it's literally just one long stretched out game. I've done something I've never done with Haikyuu before... and that was hope that a scene would hurry up and be over. Saddened me a bit. I do understand that they set it up as it is because they have to pace out the anime in accordance to where the manga is.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there's not really much to say that hasn't been said about Haikyuu!! already, excellent plot, excellent sound, excellent characters. The only flaw this time is the lack of story development/complexity. On one hand, I think they made a mistake and should have just waited to make season 3 a longer season, with this Shiratorizawa match + what is to come. On the other, I get that it's supposed to be THE match, the one that seasons 1 and 2 were building up towards, so melding it into a season with other plot points of Haikyuu!! would have sort of lessened it's importance and impact.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically it. It's an entire season spanning one match, so you can't really discuss much about it. What I can say as a fan is that despite the lack of story development, there is some nice character development among some familiar characters that make it really nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else random... I don't really get why people are continually criticizing it because it's not as realistic as real life volleyball. There is NO, literally NOT ONE SPORTS ANIME THAT IS REALISTIC. Insane, athletic moves that not even pros can pull off being performed by school kids? Weird, unrealistic moves that don't exactly exist in real life being performed by school kids? Plot points that put a twist/unexpected spin on the sports rules? WELCOME TO SPORTS ANIME. Kuroko no Basket, Ace of Diamonds, Major, Initial D, Free!, Yowamushi Pedal, Prince of Tennis, Days, etc. etc. etc. even Chihayafuru, a \"card sports\" anime: the moves are always unrealistic, the players are always better than the pros. However, Haikyuu!! is one of the few that actually make the unrealistic moves/power/skills on the more realistic side. It seems like a really weird thing to rate badly... just my opinion.",

            "content": "Story: In this third installment of Haikyuu, the anime continues to follow the events of the manga with no significant changes. This season centers on the finals arc against Shiratorizawa, a powerhouse school known for its tall, strong, and talented players and has consistently represented the Miyagi prefecture in the National Spring Tournament.\r\nArt and Sound: Even for those who keep up with the manga and therefore know everything that will happen in the anime, it's like you're discovering what happens in the match again for the first time. If there were any blocks, receives, or plays you read in the manga that made you cheerin excitement, it was made even better in the show with the use of slow-motion sequences for dramatic effect, and the imagery of crows and eagles as symbolism for Karasuno's strength in numbers, willpower, and determination. As always, the songs used in Haikyuu are positive and inspiring, like it's saying you can accomplish anything you put your mind to without it sounding trite. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Development is seen in secondary characters in big ways. Certain supporting characters get as much screen time as the main cast, showing backstories and idiosyncrasies to help develop the plot and give the show substance. This makes it hard for viewers to have just one favorite character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It'll be a damn shame to not read and watch Haikyuu. It's a roaring good time and can entertain any viewer even when they have a preference for other genres. \\n",

            "content": "Two words for this: HOLY SHIT\r\nSo, at first i thought this season was going to be boring and monotone, since it was only focused on one game, like ten episodes of the same game? WELL, not a so great premise, BUT i have to say this was the most exciting game i've ever seen in a sports anime! wow, honestly wow. They left me wanting more and more!.\r\nThis was a very intense season, to say the least. Every episode had me at the edge of my seat and there were so many epic moments, i got so excited trough the whole episode, i even feltlike i was part of the game. Awesome cliffhangers that left you impatient for the next episode so you guys can imagine that it was a torture for me to wait for the friday to come. A LOT of action, you could feel all of the emotion the characters were putting into it. I have to say i cried almost in every episode tbh.\\n\r\nI really hope they make a season 4 because i feel like a part of me just died today.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, beautiful animation, awesome movements, everything flows just right. The animation just helps to make everything more intense. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack. Oh my god what a beautiful and thrilling soundtrack, the op was the best op that haikyuu ever had, i really liked it. As i said the characters really transmitted a lot of emotions, so the seiyuus did a great job! especially Okamoto Nobuhiko (Nishinoya) and Miyu Irino (Sugawara) and everyone else obviously, but especially those two. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Ok now, for the thing i liked the most about this season, the characters evolved so so much, they changed a lot from season one, especially tsukki OH. MY. GOD. Tsukki was absolutely the star from this season. I know that in the first two seasons he seems like an asshole who is tired of everyone's bullshit but if you didn't liked him in the past two seasons, i'm sure now you're going to love him. Actually, i'm thinking about putting him into my favorite characters, yeah, that cool he was in this season. As for everyone else they changed so much, they learned a lot and you'll see it trough this whole match, and not only they changed individuallyl but also as a whole team, they became stronger and know about their weakness and strenghts, they became a great team. (ok i'm so proud rn)\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Shiratorizawa, the thing with haikyuu is that even when you cheer for Karasuno you can't hate the team they are playing against, because the fucking creators of haikyuu decided to make every single oponent very interesting characters, IN EVERY GAME. So, i was obviously cheering for Karasuno but i really liked the Shiratorizawa members, they were all quirky and cute their own way, and as always it was impossible to hate them, so that was what made this match so awesome. \\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, well, i think it was pretty obvious how much i enjoyed this season so 10/10 would recommend, and not only this season, i would recommend the whole haikyuu series everytime! It's a show everyone can enjoy. This season was awesome and idk if i would say this was my favorite one, because i think season 2 still takes the spot but absolutely this anime didn't disappointed me, not even a bit.",

They was very amazing. Don't forgetten the scene with Iwaizumi and Oikawa megane. Aww They are very perfect together.\r\nThe anime style is unique and very well made, you can see the mark of the mangaka on each character despite the fact that they are all very different. The soundtrack looks is very good. Every scene has a song which fits perfectly. Each track is able to get us in the mood for the specificmoment, being it sad, funny or exciting. We get goosebumps on every game and we almost cry with the flashbacks. The animation studio is godlike and each movement flows like magic on the screen. Haikyuu!! is also funny and is full of \"chill out\" moments that make us smile. The background stories, the side characters talking on the bench, everything is just amazing to watch. One of the best shows ever, it never gets boring.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of sports anime.. At least it was what i thought. I was really skeptical when i began to see Haikyuu, but now, i'm very glad i watched it. It's like if a hidden passion for sports anime has awakened inside me, and Haikyuu is in the top of it. I don't know if this third season is the best; it's actually hard to choose just one season; to me, each one of them has its qualities, and they're equally outstanding.\r\nIn terms of story, this third season is a direct continuation from the second, so the story mustn't be judged alone,but as a whole, and it's great. Especially the unexpected ending of it, the last few seconds of the episode 10, which opens a new arc to the series, and i'm very anxious to see it, praying for the confirmation of a new season.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say about the art. I think that even the ones that hate Haikyuu consider the art excellent. There is a very fluid animation, varying with many different styles to suit the different sensations the moments shall pass to the person watching it. Yes, it's hard to describe... Just watch it!!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another aspect that i haven't much to talk. It's also outstanding. In both types of soundtracks, dramatic and exciting, Haikyuu stands out. Even though in this third season i missed some of my favorites musics from second season, like Confrontation with the King, they present us with other great ones; and the complete absence, believe me, of any sounds, in some moments, is the best thing they ever made.\\n\\n\r\nTo end this review, Haikyuu has one of the best character development that i have ever seen. All of the main characters and even most of the supporting ones have their importance. It's hard to find a character that you'd say ''I hate this one\", and, actually, the only one that i had this feeling in the first two seasons became the best of this third season, so, yeah, Mr Furudate, the author, likes to play with our feelings.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Haikyuu is one of the best animes i have ever seen and i recommend it to every anime fan. And to the ones that love sports anime, you MUST watch it!!!\\n\\n\r\nStory (9); Art (10); Sound (10); Character (10); Enjoyment (10);\\n\r\nOverall (10).",

            "content": "This season of Haikyuu was consistent in terms of the qualities Haikyuu has presented so far.\r\nBut I'd also like to note that due to its length and enviroments being pretty much stuck in one place due to this season consisting of a really long match, this season of Haikyuu will feel more like a long high budget OVA than a new season. It is a continuation of where it has left off previously, with the finals between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa, the match taking the entire length of this season. There's no new story elements, and the character development that the characters got is now presentedin how the characters evolved, especially a specific character. And just like the other matches of Haikyuu, it focuses on presenting the opponents as well, with the series taking time to explain the motivation and strengths of most key characters in the team. The third season is pretty much the culmination of the character development the characters went through, as well as the presentation of the team of Shiratorizawa, and that's pretty much why the series is so long, and also why it feels like an OVA. It doesn't serve anything new or unexpected, but presents the facets of the series that its fans enjoyed, which is what I think the ideal OVA should be. And as a result of such I consider this season to be good, because it seems well aware of what works in well in Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nThe match itself is fun, it presents Karasuno's versatility and willingness to try new things against a team that has honed their skills in a strong and consistent style to overpower their opponents. While this may make Shiratorizawa sound like a boring team, since this means that mostly Karasuno's players will try to make interesting outlandish plays, Shiratorizawa's team players all have different skills and capabilities, and its the presentation of those skills that is the entertainment value coming from that team, as the team also values individual talent and the ability to score, over necesarily having strong teamplay. So you'll have a player who's a very strong spiker, one who's a very strong blocker, and other such examples.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of drama, I still think Haikyuu is a tad ridiculous, but it didn't really have the opportunity to be overlydramatic this season, because its main focus was a more subdued character in terms of presenting his development and that behaviour helping in relieving a bit of the overcompetitiveness that kinda bothers me in Haikyuu. The overlycompetitive nature of Haikyuu is mostly an issue of the former seasons, so I won't go on talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is consistent and looks as good as it always did, but I assume the fact that they didn't really animate any other locations than two places is due to budget constraints. However, the animation didn't go on a downwards spiral in terms of quality, it's just as fluid and detailed as always. The OST from what I heard was recycled, so there shouldn't be any changes that should unnerve you. Even if there were changes and I'm wrong, I couldn't notice it, and as such, the OST is at least very similar in style and there shouldn't be any problem caused since it's the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nTo end things, I still think its likely that if you enjoyed Haikyuu, you will enjoy this season, and if you didn't, this season won't change your mind. I don't believe that Haikyuu has either risen or declined in quality, and the reason it is well received is because its fans are being delivered the things it has had set up and the things it has prepared it for. Which any good series should know how to do and Haikyuu did. Just be aware of how much you've enjoyed the series so far before starting this season.",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! Season 3\r\nThe cherry on the cake. The top of the iceberg. The worthy ending of a spectecular show (for now). Haikyuu!! is a great show overall, with fluent animations - and even those are getting better from season to season and in the biggest moments even excel that, great and deep characters, a lot of hype and action and PURE enjoyment!\r\nI don't want to go into too much detail into why this show is the greatest sports anime of them all so far, but there is actually nothing they do horribly wrong. Every other sports anime so far had some flaws somewhere, and ifit wasn't for anything really important, it were the animations (example Hajime no Ippo) which hold them back from being the best of all time. Haikyuu!! just does all this right and puts a lot of emotions into it aswell. On top of that, it has one of the best anime OST there is on this planet, and i really can't say this enough. The overall soundtracks got re-used a lot during the show, but everyone .. each of this soundtracks was and is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe First Season was the introduction, how i like to call it, to the show, characters and the sport. But also to the story telling and character development from this show. You started to like the characters, love the way it's told and the way the matches are presented. At the same time, all this was genuinely well done. 9/10 for the First Season.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second Season was the build up. It was the continuation of the rivalry told in Season 1 and it builded up the characters and hype even more. We had a great training proccess, not only in abilities but also character development and growth. We got a lot of new and nice characters and even more rivalries. 9,5/10 for the really unique Second Season.\\n\\n\r\nThe Third Season was the Final. The continuation of the Second Season, right where it left off. But not only that, it really brought up all the emotions and the character growth we got to see in some moments the two seasons before. This third season really shows, how the creators of this manga & show did a god damn amazing job at pacing this and yet having a lot of character depth, so you could feel for the characters. The ending of this season itself was just a perfect way to end it in a typical Haikyuu!! style and to fulfill all the satisfactions the fans had. 10/10 for the worthy Finale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as i said earlier, there is very little Haikyuu!! does wrong, and the only reasons i can see for people to not like this show is the dislike against Sports anime or against the sport Volleyball. Any sports anime fan's heart will burn hot and melt at the end of this show. I really can't say enough, how amazing this anime is and i am so fking glad and proud of it being so high on the ratings. It REALLY deserves that! All Hail Haikyuu!! <3",

            "content": "When I think about Haikyuu!! season 3, one thing comes to mind \r\nDISAPPOINTMENT \r\nFor me at least as an avid fan of Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 what made Haikyuu!! so special was the concept of a human/humans overcoming unrealistic odds without unrealistic things happening (As in Haikyuu!! was grounded in realism). Though the story did not have much to it and the pacing was off at times, whatever was done was usually done fairly well.\r\nThe characters were 2 dimensional and didn't have much to them other then their 1 or 2 major qualities, but this did not bother me much (Since actually depicting humanbehavior precisely in any form of audio visual content is near impossible).\\n\r\nThe art was quite unique and the animation was well done (Relative to some of the animation I've seen in some of the other sports anime) (Not to mention the 2nd opening of season 2 and ending 2 of Season 1). The soundtrack also almost perfectly fit the moments that displayed on screen. With all this Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 managed to create its own environment and sense of feel that got you uplifted and hyped.\\n\r\nThis is what was there in Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the topic at hand Haikyuu!! Season 3:\\n\r\nBy god why did they do this.\\n\r\nThe pacing is horrible (By horrible I mean HORRIBLE). The soundtrack has degraded. Nothing spacial in the OP and ED. Humor has become silly and vague. \\n\r\nMr. Perfect Shiratorizawa has appeared and can do anything (Realism goes to hell). The focus has shifted from the MC (Hinata and Kageyama) and whatever story Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 had has gone to hell.\\n\r\nNote: Animation is still great.(If not better then season 1 and 2)\\n\\n\r\nBut other then the above reasons why disappointment comes to mind when I think of Haikyuu!! season 3 is because I think that Haikyuu!! has lost something special that it had.\\n\r\nI think that that whenever good audio visual content is produced it has its mood or environment and this sense of emotion that it brings into you when you experience it and this has been completely changed and to a great extent Haikyuu!! season 3 has lost what Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 had. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all this I enjoyed Haikyuu!! season 3(Though not more then season 1 and 2) and think that it was one of the better anime of the season but I just feel that Production IG could have done a better job(I understand that some of the points I have made are due to the fact that the anime was only ten episodes and focused only on one match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa but I still feel it's execution was lacking greatly).\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone looking to watch anime:\\n\r\nYES\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone who has seen Season 1 and 2 of Haikyuu!!:\\n\r\nNO\\n\\n\r\nAs of now all I am doing is waiting for Season 4 of Haikyuu!!(Hoping that it will bring back what Haikyuu!! season 1 and 2 had.)",

            "content": "Finally the long-awaited match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa is here. Besides the fact that the title is basically a spoiler for those who aren\u2019t caught up to the series, it represents what this season basically is about Karasuno and Shiratorizawa competing to become Miyagi Prefecture's Representative for the Spring High National Playoffs. What was originally teased as the start of the second season finally gets put into play in this short, but fast-paced third season. After the Karasuno vs Aobajousai match at the end of the second season, Karasuno vs Shiratorizawa has a lot to accomplish if it wants to live up to the titleof being the most intense match yet. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nSports anime tend to work on a simplistic story, and they basically run on its sport, characters and their interactions. Haikyuu was the same in the first two seasons and the same goes for the third one. As a matter of fact, this season has the least amount of plot compared to any other season since this is just one match. However, it\u2019s the tiny moments that build up this match into being something much special. The season continues off from the end of the last season after Karasuno won against Aobajousai to compete against Shiratorizawa for the title of representative for the Spring High Nationals. Then starts a long, but fast-paced 10-episode match between the two teams. Though whether the results are predictable or not really depends on what you expect Karasuno\u2019s trend to be. And even if it does feel predictable, there\u2019s so much going on during these matches that it\u2019s hard to feel disinterested about what\u2019s going on. \\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThis season of Haikyuu basically has the same style and directing the previous seasons had. It has it sense of style, one that is similar to most team sports anime. Despite the fact that this season is just a match and there\u2019s no breather moment in this season, there\u2019s still that trademark Haikyuu humor mixed in the seriousness. Even though this is a much shorter season, it has the highest chapters adapted per episode rate compared to the previous seasons, therefore the season feels like it\u2019s always going somewhere. Even though 10 episodes may seem too much for one match, Karasuno vs Shiratorizawa is actually a 5-set match instead of the usual 3 sets. And as a matter of a fact, maybe more episodes would\u2019ve been a little better. After all, the third set basically takes place in a couple of minutes. Haikyuu has always set a standard for consistent production values in not just sports anime, but in anime in general. This season manages to be the best-looking season, and that says a lot. This match manages to be thrilling throughout at the slight bits of flashbacks that are scattered throughout the match adds to the buildup and characters.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nJust like most sports anime, Haikyuu has always been about the characters more than anything. Without a compelling cast of characters, it\u2019s hard to feel interested in a sports anime since they tend to rely less on its story. And Haikyuu was able to prove that with its previous two seasons. This season features the same likable characters you know and love, while introducing a lot of new characters from the Shiratorizawa side. The two main characters of the series, Hinata and Kageyama, are put into good use in this season and has plenty of moments to shine. However, they don\u2019t overshadow their fellow teammates as almost everyone gets a time to shine in this match. Some Karasuno characters get a lot of character development they were originally lacking, especially Tsukishima. Tsukishima was always a cool and enjoyable character, but nothing really made him feel that complex\u2026 well, until this match happened. This season managed to show how he feels about volleyball as a sport and how much dedication can come from him. All of the other characters like Nishinoya, Sawamura and Sugawara are all put into good use too. However, the Shiratorizawa characters feel slightly blander compared to Karasuno\u2019s other rivals, but they still manage to be an interesting team. The star of the team, Ushijima, manages to be what people were expected from him, but unfortunately nothing more. Though the series manages to show his sudden dedication for the match fairly well, it never gives any reason to why we should care about him. Slight bits of his past and childhood helped, but not enough. Another well focused character, Tendou, manages to be a lot more enjoyable, and managed to be the most interesting Shiratorizawa player. His derpy expressions and cocky attitude makes him the most unique character of the series. However, the series tries its best to play the sympathetic card for him, but it felt ineffective. All of the other characters do a good job in contributing to the series.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nHaikyuu\u2019s third season manages to keep its art consistent throughout, even more so than the previous seasons. With the previous seasons, the art always looked good, but during matches it looked ever better. This season is basically just a match, so therefore the entire season ends up looking gorgeous beginning to end. And considering the fact that this season was only 10 episodes, it was probably a lot easier for the animating staff to keep things a lot more consistent. The art in the manga has a rough and stylish feel too it, but also it can look very messy at times. The anime manages to get rid of the messiness, but also maintains the style of the manga. Whether it be the character models, or their reflections on the floor, everything manages to look very pretty. \\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nFor a sports anime, it\u2019s very important for the animation quality to be top-notch since the matches are one of the biggest selling point and if they don\u2019t end up looking good, it can feel very distracting. There have been many cases of where a sports anime was done with little effort, so the matches can end up looking like slideshows with just still pictures (I\u2019m looking at you, Days), or things can look a little crude. With its first two season, Haikyuu not only proved that it\u2019s not only one of the most beautifully animated sports anime, but one of the best-looking anime in general. And with this season\u2019s length, the studio was able to keep the animation quality top-notch and very consistent. The character movements are fluid and the way the camera moves during matches looks amazing. There\u2019s one particular moment near the end of the series where the camera rotates around the court while Karasuno does a synchronized attack, and it\u2019s clear that Production I.G has way too much time on their hands and way too much effort to spend. \\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nFor the most part, all of the seiyuu from the first and second seasons come back to reprise their roles. Just like as before Murase Ayumu and Ishikawa Kaito does a great job as the energetic Hinata and the levelheaded Kageyama. The rest of the Karasuno characters\u2019 seiyuu do a great job as usual too. Uchiyama Kouki in particular did a great job as Tsukishima, especially since his character plays a bigger role than before. The Shiratorizawa characters\u2019 seiyuu also do a very good job too. Takeuchi Ryouta does a good job as the deep-voiced Ushijima. Kimura Subaru (who\u2019s surprisingly half-German and looks very western) does a fantastic job as the quirky Tendou and hopefully he gets more holes after this. One thing to note is that Ukai\u2019s seiyuu, Tanaka Kazunari, passed away not too long ago (may he rest in peace) and his role as Ukai was replaced Egawa Hisao starting from the ninth episode. Tanaka did a great job during his final moments as Ukai, and his final line from the series is a very powerful one for sure. Egawa sounds quite different, but he\u2019s not decent. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nJust like the previous seasons, this season of Haikyuu manages to have an outstanding soundtrack that complements its content. The OP, \u201cHikari Are\u201d managed to be my personal favorite opening for Haikyuu, even though this opening is much different from the previous ones. Unlike the older openings, especially the ones that were done by SPYAIR, where it was more hype-inducing and fast-paced, this season\u2019s opening is more in a slower tone and has a more \u201cput-all-you-got\u201d motivational feel to it. And the lyrics are really good for it too. NICO Touches the Walls returns to do another ED, \u201cMashi Mashi\u201d, and it\u2019s pretty good. It has an upbeat feel to it and it\u2019s quite fun to listen too. It\u2019s was used well at the end of the last episode. As for the background music\u2026 it\u2019s incredible. Anything Hayashi Yuuki composes ends up being amazing. Just like the OST for the first two seasons, this seasons manages to use its music into creating more buildup and increase the tension and hype during the match. Some of the tracks are the same as the previous seasons and there\u2019s some noticeable new ones.\\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAs a Haikyuu fan myself, this match has been immensely enjoyable from beginning to end. Despite the fact that Shiratorizawa isn\u2019t as interesting of an opponent as Aobajousai, their strength manages to make the match feel more intense and become this most thrilling match from the series so far, and it\u2019s much less predictable than Karasuno and Aobajousai\u2019s rematch. And as someone who really liked Tsukishima\u2019s character, it was really nice to see that he\u2019s more complex than he seems. And with the much faster pacing, things manage to feel more thrilling than its original source. Supported by fantastic production values and top-notch music, Haikyuu manages to hit all the right notes in making a successful sports series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this short, but fast-paced season of Haikyuu manages to do everything you would come to expect from this series. With more character development for the Karasuno team, Haikyuu manages to prove that they can do more with their characters and shows what potential these characters have. This season manages to have fantastic production values, even by Haikyuu\u2019s standards. Although, the characters in the Shiratorizawa team isn\u2019t as complex or likable as people were hoping, but they manage to be a strong competitor for Karasuno and they add to the tension. For those who haven\u2019t started this series yet, you owe it to yourself to watch this series. If you\u2019re wondering if Haikyuu is fujoshi-pandering or doesn\u2019t have anything to it other than its sport, rest-assured, it\u2019s nothing like that. And for those who liked the previous seasons, there\u2019s no need for me to recommend this season to you since you\u2019ve probably already watched it. \\n\\n\r\n+ A fantastic match that tops every match preceding it. \\n\r\n+ 10 episodes of non-stop, fast-paced fun with a lot of tension used to build-up moments.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding production values that remain consistent until the very end.\\n\r\n+ Fantastic soundtrack that is used to add tension and hype to the match.\\n\r\n+ The Karasuno characters get good development, especially Tsukishima, as he gets fleshed out well. \\n\r\n- Despite them being a strong competitor, the Shiratorizawa characters aren\u2019t as likable as Karasuno\u2019s previous rivals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4/10",

            "content": "STORY: This is basically the moment where we all have been waiting for. In this season, two teams faced off against each other out of 5 sets. We can see the intensity and skills that both teams bring to the court. We can also see most of the characters that have made their appearances from the previous season. The anime emphasizes on the moves of the volleyball players (especially spikes and overhand serves). Both teams are being savages towards each during the matches\u2026 I find it to be amusing and hilarious (especially when its coming from Karasuno). The essence of what Haikyuu represents is stillbeing maintained in this season.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Still an awesome anime to watch. In all honesty, I'm surprised that this season has 10 episodes and not 12 (like the previous seasons). -- I'm not sure why they decided to go on that route. Overall, I still love what I am seeing with the matches. Win or lose -- Karasuno is an amazing team and I'm happy that we get to grow with them.",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! Season 3 is one of the most widely anticipated anime of Fall 2016. This season covers a 5-set match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa. The good news is that it is only 10 episodes long and can be easily finished within a few days. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nHaikyuu!! Season 3 is rather different from the previous 2 seasons, in the sense that it does not focus on the duo, Hinata and Kageyama. Instead, the star of the show is Tsukishima Kei, one of Karasuno's middle-blockers. What I like about the story is that the rivalries are well played out and despite that the match was rather predictable(no spoilers), the characters show that nothing comes easy and there is no one team which overpowers the other totally. This season is filled with emotions and epic moments, which is another strong point. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the plot has quite a few weaknesses. I didn't like how Ushijima was stupidly overpowered. The show emphasized very strongly on his spiking skills and the fact that he was left-handed, which is something I don't get because I am sure that he is not the only left-handed spiker in Haikyuu!! Also, this season has too much explaining, which is a typical fault in many sports anime. I understand that there should be explanations for the volleyball techniques but the explanations are over-done. It is better to show more and tell less. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is consistent and is fluid, as expected of Production I.G., the studio which produced Kuroko no Basuke and Shingeki no Kyojin. The art for the opening and ending were excellent.  \\n\\n\r\nI liked how the studio uses metaphors to show the team''s feelings and challenges. For example, the scene in the opening where the Karasuno team is in front of a mountain which morphs into an eagle (representing Shiratorizawa) depicts the challenges the team faces. The lighting is darker in this season, compared to the other seasons. This increases the intensity of the matches. Kudos to the animators!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending tracks are recycled and have the same theme as the OSTs from previous seasons. Voice-acting is on point in general and the voice-actors did a great job in expressing the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I've emphasiised in the 'Story' section, Kageyama and Hinata do not receive a lot of development in this season. Tsukishima Kei's character development is one of the highlights of this season. From a disinterested player, he had changed into one of the star players who is determined to fight with the team till the end. His character development is indeed impressive and flows nicely over the 10 episodes. Tsukki, you're the real MVP of the season. \\n\\n\r\nShiratorizawa's introduction is effectively and they are great opponents. The Shiratorizawa team is memorable, especially Tendo Satori the 'Guess Monster'. Overall, the team is not stupidly overpowered, maybe except for Ushijima. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFull of intense action and episodes that leave the viewer hanging, it is no wonder that Haikyuu!! Season 3 is currently the top sports anime on MyAnimeList. I had enjoyed this season very much and every episode had left me hanging on my seat and wanting more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! Season 3 wasn't a disappointment and I had certainly enjoyed it. I am looking forward to Season 4, which should be coming out next year. I would highly recommend this to every sports anime fan. However, I would encourage you to watch the previous seasons to get a grasp of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review and I hope you have a nice day!",

            "content": "I recently re-watched all 3 seasons of haikyuu after a year, and i was caught off guard. This anime is so intense that it kept me hyped even if i knew who'll win a match. But lets get to the point and review this season from scratch.\r\nWhen i was about to watch haikyuu karasuno vs shiratorizawa for the first time i was hyped and worried. Hyped because there'll be another season for this fantastic, full of emotions sport anime, and worried because it'll be only 10 ep. long. It really did throw me off from the third season, i watched 2 ep and then ithrew it back for another time. I came back to it when they relased last episode and boy...i started to regret that i didnt watch it earlier.\\n\\n\r\nStory line is that one thing that worried me- its focused on only two teams(including Karasuno) and Shiratorizawa didnt look as interesting as Seijoh. Good thing Haikyuu is doing a great job in narrating and introducing us to new characters from different clubs, as every other team i started to like Shiratorizawa and their game style. Overall its just a normal sports anime story, and thats why i give it a 5/10 note\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks fantastic, even better than other seasons. They had only 10 episodes to work up with, so they could take their time in politing it. Looks dynamic, fast and smooth. Volleyball in its finest form, thats all I need! 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good and intense as always, its really keeping up with all the action on the screen and it gives more tensity when to the cool plays. The opening song was good too, i've got nothing to point up on this side. The voice actors are good as always, too bad Ukai's VA died and he didnt lent his voice in last 2 episodes. Still, VA are doing great job in this series, thats why im giving it 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are relatable and likeable as always. The introducions, their stories, their reasons why they play volleyball, evolutions of our old pals from karasuno that we all know. Everything is perfect here when it comes to character development, and thats why i must give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI feeled so much emotions both the first time i watched it and the secound one. Hype, happiness, sadness, stress...I cant even fully describe it. You just need to watch it and see by yourself. I feel like from the middle it was even more intense than both Karasuno vs Seijoh matches(even though i love them), but maybe thats just me. Well earned 10/10 here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a great series that you should definetly watch right after season 2. Trust me, You won't be dissapointed, The best season for one of the best anime's out there. Get ready for the feels and have fun!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9/10",

            "content": "STORY - 7\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 8\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nThe bar is set higher than ever before in the confrontation of the two great avians. A continuous match of rallies against the greatest opponent Karasuno had yet to face is here, with the third season of the thrilling volleyball anime called Haikyuu!!.\r\nIt's the showdown between the Eagles vs the Crows, the anticipated final to determine who will continue to the national tournament. And the fact that it was the long-awaited match slightly disappointed me with a sole reason that was present in the previous season. It's a bit different but what I'm signifying wasthe loss of suspense from the flashbacks. Though the number of unnecessary flashbacks weren't tormenting, the fact that this season is only 10 episodes long placed a drawback in the use of flashbacks, making the ratio bigger than it used to be. A few of the episodes felt dragged and less exciting because of it which isn't what a match should offer to the viewers. However, this was greatly improved as the season comes to a near end. Other than all that, each set were still generally entertaining to watch, packed with all kinds of volleyball plays with the intent of scoring points. They also contained backstories that balanced out a couple of players: new ones and particularly with the usually bland Tsukishima who should be the MVP of Season 3. His development went through a significant change that was just awe-inspiring to see happening. As for the rest of the characters, nothing much really changed except for their foreground chances to show off their newly developed skills or abilities to adapt to the match. Their goofiness was still there, serving as a brief relaxation in each episode and those were still entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G maintained their incredible manga-styled art all the way through this season, and improvements can even be noticed in some parts. The natural quality from the animation didn't break off the high frequency of movements in the court. Motions of the ball and players were easy to follow, as well as being able to grasp the power and skills behind each hit of the ball. These qualities achieved action, the sense of never-ending energy that slowly fatigued the characters. Although the OSTs seemed to be pretty average during the first half, they still had the charms you get from the previous seasons. Many of the scenes worked wonderfully well with the composition, especially during the last couple of episodes. At this late point, the accompanying soundtracks became a flawless partner for the tension, strengthening the exciting atmosphere that's both addicting and stimulating. The players' emotions was in check with the voices brought out by the VAs. All the encouragements or tenacity to win can be felt, making you feel like you were part of the team and want to win too. And an extra but I also loved the symbolic approach of birds in the opening. The nightly color choices was a splendid pick to represent Karasuno's upcoming battle. And the music by BURNOUT SYNDROMES helped set the uplifting presence of the underdog going through a change of strength to become a powerhouse team once again.\\n\\n\r\nPitting their exhaustion and determination to win in this exciting match of endurance is what one should expect for this season. Of course there were flaws that came with it, mainly with flashbacks, but Season 3 was a great example of the hype embodiment that a volleyball anime like Haikyuu!! can achieve.",

            "content": "This will include my opinion of the entire show, and will not contain spoilers. \r\nNow, I wouldn't call myself a big sports anime or even shounen anime fan, mainly because I haven't seen very many that have left a strong impression on me, so initially I didn't even plan on watching Haikyuu!!, because I couldn't imagine why I would ever care about volleyball, and when I did pick it up, it was with little to no expectations. However, along way, somehow this became one of my favourite anime of all time. \r\nStory 10/10: I am giving this rating purely because I'm not bothered by weaker/lessinteresting storylines, and while this anime certainly doesn't have the most unique premise, its execution is absolutely brilliant. I would also applaud its use of flashbacks, which isn't excessive but enough to give the characters more nuance and to make you feel things. In my opinion it also manages to stay quite realistic, compared to other anime, and it has taught me a lot about volleyball, as well as made me interested in it, so that's an accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art isn't perfect in the first season, a fact that becomes more and more apparent after having rewatched the entire show multiple times, but it doesn't really have any glaring issues, especially in the later episodes, and it manages to get so much better while still staying consistent. The openings really shine in the animation department. But what gets me most about Haikyuu's animation is the attention to details, sometimes I'll catch myself just marvelling at the characters' eyes, at the way their muscles are drawn, at the various slow motion scenes, at the ball's movement and speed; even the court floor catches my eyes at tiimes. This art and animation style just really works for me, and for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The voice acting is incredible, as can be expected, I do not have a single complaint when it comes to that department (Shoutout to Hinata's voice actor for the noises). The music is also amazing; it took me some time to warm up to some songs, but having watched it so many times I now appreciate every single second of the soundtrack. Their use of various \\n\r\nsound effects such as squeaking shoes is also very nice, they really contribute at setting the mood before a match.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Haikyuu!! is very interesting in that it presents to you this cast of characters, and initially they're very easy to categorize into well-known stereotypes, so you think you know exactly what to expect from them. But then this anime goes and gives them a backstory, a personality, development, sometimes it manages to develop three background characters in four minutes. Sure, there are certain characters who absolutely do not get as much screen time as they should, but this is a fault in the manga as well, and Tsukishima's character development makes up for any complaints I'd have about anything. So there's that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: When I watched the first episode, I was into it but I wasn't super hooked, so I committed myself to watching about one episode per week. Then I got to episode five and I found myself binge-watching the entire thing in a week. Then I rewatched it the very moment I finished episode 60. So far, I have watched it in full around 20 times, but that doesn't include all the hours I've spent watching  and rewatching various funny moments and match moments compilations on youtube. For me, what really shows how enjoyable it is, is its rewatchability, which seems to be incredibly high, as I keep being drawn to it, because I keep noticing new things, and the more I think about it, the more I appreciate how much there is to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I can't say that I've seen oh so many animes, but this one has left a more lasting impression on me than any other. I would not recommend it to everyone, because obviously, but I would certainly recommend it to people who enjoy good animation, amazing music, incredible, complex characters, and just an overall very enjoyable anime that might teach you a thing or two about volleyball.",

The first two seasons builds up the emotions you will need for this third season. \r\nStory: The boys of Karasuno, which we have come to love and respect, are finally going up against the Shiratorizawa giants. Typical David vs Goliath.\r\nArt: Fantastic\r\nSound: Same\r\nCharacter: Now this is the big one. Through the previous seasons we have got to know each of the Karasuno boys through background stories. But some how they were able to further the character development even further. Without giving any spoilers,all am going to say is that Tsukishima had me in tears. Yes the nonchalant A-hole will have you in your feelings. That's how amazing the character development is.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 I have rewatched this season about 3-4 times and always cry my eyes out at the end. This anime has an uncanny ability to draw you in, you begin to feel like part of the team; their victory is your victory and their pain is your pain.\\n\r\nOverall: I give this a 10 as well because even though I am not a huge sport anime fan, this one has pulled every string I have available in my heart. I cannot wait for the next season.",

Unlike other sport anime, you don't really have one OP major character (aside Ushijima, but he is the antagonist), everything they do seems doable,they all have their flaws, their speciality, and it makes everything more epic as you follow a realistic team ! Epicness is really the key word here, and this season is the most epic you will see. The fact that it is just one game might seem stupid, but there's no stretching no particularly useless flashbacks, everything makes sense and just ascends to the skies.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are both amazing, the art is the best of the season, and both OP and END were my favorites of the 3 seasons. I don't usually watch them but here I never missed one. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are amazing. They all get screentime, Hinata is not the center of the picture here, they all haves doubts, goals and they all go through challenges to become stronger. You'll have your favorite character (Kuroo here), without really hating one, as they are all relevant to the story.\\n\\n\r\nWatch. This. Show.",

There were definitely cut scenes in which certain positions (e.g. Nishinoya/Daichi's receives, synchronized attacks) were reused that were slightly bothersome but didn't significantly detract from the series as a whole. \r\nThe sound again, althoughwas nothing extraordinary, did it's job (Just like everything else in the anime). Catchy opening songs, gripping background music in order to capture the heat of the moment really set me in the right mood whenever I immersed myself in a really clutch match. \\n\\n\r\nWhat made Haikyuu!! so special and dear and near to my heart were its CHARACTERS. Every single one is dimensional, wholesome, SO likable, and most importantly -- human beings. They all had strengths, flaws, and interestingly personalities that made them a family that gave and took from one another. Their interactions, growths, and spirits were probably even more interesting to watch than the actual volleyball matches themselves. Rarely do you see a cast of amazingly well-developed characters that not only change and grow into completely different people than who they were at the beginning of the series, but also a cast that shares such a strong and intoxicating chemistry. \\n\r\nThat was what made the show so enjoyable to me.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't like shounen/sports anime, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give Haikyuu!! a shot.",

Not only the members of Karasuno had grown past this game, but the opposing team, Shiratorizawa did also. The individuality and the strengths and weaknesses of each characters were well planned and written. \r\nComing from a person who usually skips OP and ED, this is one of the few animes I actually thoroughly enjoyed it (especially the ending). \r\nAnother reason why I like this season was because of its pacing. Yes, it did skip over one of the sets - not entirely sure if itwas the same in the manga - but it didn't feel rushed, which a lot of animes tend to do.\\n\r\nI genuinely hope that there will be a fourth season - I'll be looking forward for it.",

Every season of Haikyuu feels elevated with tension only to step out even higher. I thought Tsukki got good character development the 2nd  season, but season three ripped him into a new person. Yeah he's still our blunt teaser, but he was set up to go further. \r\nHaikyuu still makes me pleased with its wonderful writing, it's easy to tell the creator and staff love this series. \r\nEspecially with the visual metaphors found throughout, and the moment when just the right musickicks in. The animation is still perfect production I.G loves sports. Some of the times the key animation, can get a little bit old seeing it repeatedly. But I actually think they did a well job switching it up more this season, that may just be because this season was shorter. \\n\r\nHaikyuu also shines brighter with their composer Y\u00fbki Hayashi, this man adds because there's so much more to add. Composing new wonderful insert songs, even with the already great ones standing. Even if it's just changing the instrument, for a refreshing version. That's when you know you've got someone talented. \\n\r\n[Spoilers] \u2800\u2800Karasuno gets me so emotionally attached, I'm glad they won. I would've been balling, I was even tearing up in joy. Haikyuu is a series that makes me laugh out loud and cry in public. If that's not telling you how much I love this series I don't know what else will. :) Yes go watch it of course it's one of the best sports anime, and super easy to get into.",

You would probably think that after watching a few rounds of volleyball in Haikyuu you will be bored. Well it is absolutely the opposite. Haikyuu makes you feel what the characters feel and makes you get excited for only a volleyball match in anime. \r\nStory: 9 \r\nThe basic story is not all that special and that makes it pretty simple to people who dont like a complicatedway of thinking. However a lot of thingshappen in the series which have another meaning. This serie shows you humor, friendship, tension and a slice of life for the simplistic thinkers, but the serie also contains a lot of strategy and symbolism. If you put all those elements together you get Haikyuu!! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWell done!!! The person who did the art must have a good brain because it is hard to make a ball move in such ways. Also the dramatic moments and the openings were of a high quality. My favorite openings are 3 and 5 :')\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice actors are really good. They give a realistic expression of the emotions and reactions of the characters. \\n\r\nAlso the soundtrack and opening music of the whole series deserve large credits and compliments for their quality and perfect fit with the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nHaikyuu contains a hell lot of characters. The beautiful thing is that they all have a lot of personality traits which make them special. Not only do you get a bond with the main characters, but also with the supporting characters, enemies and friends of the main characters. It will surprise you how easy you will remember all their names.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe combination of all the qualities make one masterpiece, Haikyuu.\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed Haikyuu and recommend it to every type of otaku. \\n",

In short, this review is a contradiction of most reviews saying that everything about this series is over hyped.\r\nFirst of all, the whole anime is outsatanding. Not only did it give you the hype that goes with actually playing the game but also gave you characters you can connect with and understand. Most anime these days focus so much on one or two main characters that you won't be able to appreciate the side characters. This anime breaks that cliche and gives you non-disposableside characters that actually have purpose.\\n\\n\r\nYou're still here? You're still not satisfied with what I said? Then let's continue. This series stands alone, and deserves to stand alone, among the three series. It's simply because it is all about the fruition of the hard work and training Karasuno made in the last two seasons that makes this single 10 episode game worth watching. Just like when you get to the finish line and look back at how far you've ran you can look at the people proudly and can punch your fist up and shout \"YEAAAAAAH~!\" That is not over hyped, it is only natural to stuff all the excitement you can put in this series because it's suppose to be the finale of the Karasuno struggle (aside from making nationals, Shiratorizawa is a natural obstacle they must overcome to in a sense they're like the mini boss).",

            "content": "Haikyuu is one of those series that have both their good points, as well as their bad points, but can still entertain you significantly, nonetheless. Kind of similar to one's \"guilty pleasure\" series, just with the good points being obvious.\r\nThe third season of \"Haikyuu!!\", practically one match, is as simple as the one before, and the one before that one. Pretty straightforward: If you enjoyed one season, you will enjoy the rest. If you didn't enjoy one season, you won't enjoy the rest either. It's that kind of series.\r\nNow, to get more in depth, while the story itself really isn't anything special; the rest makesup for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art really screams that it's both a shounen, and a sports series. Very much like \"Kuroko no Basuke\", as it is made by the same studio.\\n\r\nPersonally, I was slightly turned off when the first episode started and I saw this well-animated and beautiful opening, but when the actual show started the art was exactly the same as the second season. A little more detailed art like in the opening would really get the show a few extra points from me. \\n\\n\r\nThe music, and overall the sound, isn't anything mind-blowing; the OST really fits in with the important moments, the sounds during the match (like the cheering, the squeaking of the shoes, the ball hitting the players' hands, etc.) are as you'd normally expect, and the OP is quite catchy if I say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, remember when I mentioned the story I said that the rest makes up for it? I mostly meant the characters and their development. I don't think there's anyone who won't like at least one character from the show. They develop nicely, at a good pace, and have non-obnoxious personalities which viewers can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the very beginning, Haikyuu is one of those series where even though you can see their bad aspects, you still enjoy them. \\n\r\nTo give an example, take how even though most characters skyrocket the show's realism, that quicky comes to naught once they show their lack of basic newcomer knowledge even though they're on a national level for the sake of explaining every little thing to the audience. Or should I point out how almost all these different players have such overpowered, but meaningless to the actual sport, abilities just to catch the eye of the viewer who's there for the appearance, and not for the actual plot. I don't need to give examples, do I?\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I still enjoyed the show quite a bit, and if you liked the 2 previous seasons, you'll like this one as well!",

            "content": "Entering into the third installment of the franchise I say this one is the \"climax\" that is meant for the first and second seasons. I realize that nationals is the real goal Karasuno is striving for, but given how everything has played out in the first two seasons, Karasuno Vs. Shiratorizawa can most certainly be viewed as such.\r\nYou have two schools, both of which focus heavily on offense in their own way and who's play styles really live up to their names respectively. Karasuno is more rough and tumble so to say, adjusting on the go. Then there's Shiratorizawa, the brute force that they employwith just a hint of elegance here and there. \\n\\n\r\nI might be way in the minority with the \"elegant\" term here but I truly believe that raw power in some instances does look elegant. Whether it was a handful of Ushijima's power spikes or a few instances of Tendou's defensive impact. Both caused pretty much the same type of trauma to Karasuno despite them being on opposite sides of the coin.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on those two, lets be honest here... Ushijima, and Tendou are very easy to dislike. I myself don't particularly like them, but after seeing a few things during this season I don't exactly dislike them either. I think that means they play their roles exceptionally well.\\n\\n\r\nTouching on a few more characters this season, Everyone on Karasuno has improved in their own ways since the start of the franchise, but I wanna say that I myself completely forgot the fact that Hinata is actually still a super novice in volleyball somewhere in the second season, until that is, a few select things happened during the course of this season. Don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thiing. Lastly, Kageyama...He really has come a long way in the areas hes changed and I think it's easy to overlook that given he was so experienced in the gym and is always thrown the title of \"genius\"\\n\\n\r\nI'll close the review with this... I like the way the franchise is moving. However, there will always be a part of my soul that wants to see an alternate ending to season two where Aoba Jousai moves on to face Shiratorizawa instead of Karasuno. It might not happen but I really hope somewhere in the future a movie or an OVA is released letting us see that alternative play out. The reason for that, as silly as this may sound, is simply because the intensity of the rivalry that Oikawa and Iwazumi portray hits my soul...\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\\n\r\nNo idea if this was the right translation but it was the way the sub group wrote it so ill use it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Don't you dare look down! Volleyball... Is a sport where you're always looking up!\"\\n\\n\r\nI really think the circumstances that lead to the line plus the tone he delivered it, along with a couple other things made this one of the most epic ways someone could leave something. When the next episode aired I was so confused and immediately did a little digging to found out what happened. Needless to say I was very sad. May you rest in peace good sir.",

The culmination of all of Karasuno's efforts thus far. \r\nWe have seen them fall and rise and fall again. This season shows them reaching the pinnacle of the story they have set up thus far. This season proves to be the most powerful of them all. All episodes focus on this one match, while there are glimpses to discussions and moments leading up to this much anticipated match, we are thrown fully into this 5 set match and we seethe rise and fall and rise again of Karasuno as they face off against the powerhouse that is Shiratorizawa and the monster they have on their side that is Ushiwaka. \\n\\n\r\nThis season at its best is exactly the story Haikyuu has been threading and weaving thus far. The outcasts, the underdogs, who have been looked down upon for so long finally rise to the top. We get to see the determination and grit karasuno has to display to overcome just how good the other team. We also get to see the Karasuno players rise to new levels they weren't previously capable of before hand. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is the ultimate testament that most battles are won through the efforts of the whole team, no matter how good one or two might be. It's the ultimate display of volleyball and to be frank, life philosophies. \\n\\n\r\nI think I shed a few tears over the course of this season. I replayed Tsukishima's triumph well over 10 times. I relished in the sheer dominance that comes from Ushiwaka and his counterparts that seem to be OP at first glance. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is great because although it is a part of the greater narrative, it almost exists as a single series separated from the rest.

            "content": "So despite the relatively negative comments on the front page the lowest rating is still a 6 lol..... \r\nI don't know about anybody else but most sports anime are extremely tedious and hold your hand teaching you the basics of the sport over the course of its running, however, Haikyuu is exactly the same! Wait what, exactly the same, but aren't your writing your first review ever on this anime that you think is boring? Yes I am because while it is exactly the same, it is simply better and here is why~~~~~~\r\nStory:9 The majority of the 10 episodes take place over the course ofone game of volleyball, between shiratorizawa and karasuno high. That would in and of itself make it seem very boring right? Well it's simply not. There was not a single time I sat there and said man I wish they would speed this up. That's incredible! The pacing was the greatest anime pacing I have seen, possibly, ever. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8 The characters in Haikyuu are fairly interesting with their quarks and ideals/goals but the actual animated design of the characters leaves so much to be desired, oftentimes having some characters differentiated by a hair style while having everything else be the same. This would immediately put this score to at maximum a 6 for me as it shows to some effect, laziness in character design. But the reason I toss my usual critique aside is because while we have our usual crew who is awesome, we add in shiratorizawa. While half of shiratorizawa's team is relatively unimpressive as far as character design goes, shirabu and satori ARE AMAZING. I was not expecting how much I would like these two, especially satori!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:10 I'll combine these two categories together because they combine to make Haikyuu what it is. The Art and Sound is immersive and is what makes this anime better than everything else. Most sports anime have quarky and spastic characters, but adding on to these characters and their teams is amazing sound mixed in with the fantastic art during the matches makes this hands down the best representation of a sport in this medium.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 if you couldn't tell this is one of my favorites of all time\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 This will go down in my list alongside cowboy bebop, yu yu hakuxho and hunterxhunter as anime art.",

By itself, this season might not have as much diversity, as all 10 episodes are one game, but to me it truly felt like the cap to all the buildup from the other 2 seasons.  The one match really deserved all 10 episodes after all the build-up.  \r\nIt was tiring though, there was not a single break.  The anime was intense all the way through and I kinda have a headache from lack of sleep and tensing up from stress.\r\nBut, since itis all one tense match without much development beforehand, I think it is best to watch soon after the first two seasons and get the character and story development to carry over.",

The story focuses on the deep passion in the main characters' hearts and how they struggle to make it a reality,which is beautifully felt throughout the series. You can feel the tension one feels while his/her favourite team faces a stronger team. The enjoyment becomes much more if you haven't read the manga. For the sounds,I think they successfully give the sense of thrill and tension and 'do or die' sensation that you feel in a match. Anyone who loves sports will love it.

I felt this emotion a few times, but the whole season made me feel that tension. It was like i could explode at any time lol. Since the whole season captures one single game, the episodes start and end in tense moments basically, andthat's why it makes you feel that way. i'm really glad i got to see haikyuu and i hope the 4 season is as great as the other ones!",

The story is nothing new and very common story gets a 5.\r\nNow for the art & sound, not bad but not great somewhere in the middle the art & sound gets a 7.

            "content": "Instead of actually making a third season to the pretty popular sports anime Haikyuu!!, the producers thought it would be good idea to do a sort of mini season that will show this particular match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa (this is not a spoiler it's in the title). At first this didn't seem like a bad idea. The fans will get what they want earlier and the studio probably will make more profit out of this than waiting a year to make the third season. I also didn't mind until I saw the amount of episodes this season would get. Upon that discovery I wouldonly expect the worst...... and that''s what I actually got. Let me explain why.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the problems of this season let me give you my opinion on season 1 and 2. I don't think that Haikyuu!! is amazing or anything. It's a by the books sports anime with flat and uninteresting characters and a barebones underdog narrative. The only thing that kept it from being annoying were the matches. They are fun to watch and things that happen are exciting enough to keep me entertained even if they had frequent pacing issues. But all that 'hype' didn't justify everything else. That's a very short summary of my opinion on season 1 and 2 of Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that out of the way let's talk about season 3 of Haikyuu!! So Haikyuu season 3 is basically just one volleybal match in the course of 10 episodes between Karasuno (the team you are supposed to root for) and Shiratorizawa. And yes the match is 10 episodes long. And keep in mind that most of the important matches in haikyuu are roughly 4-6 episodes long. So you know what that means. Desperately stretching the running time so it will meet the ten episode mark. Because of this the anime felt like a chore to watch through.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in Haikyuu!! has never been that great. Sometimes it could be confusing to see what the standings were between the teams because there are not a lot of opportunities to cut to them. And somehow this season managed to mess that even more up by constantly slowing down the match for extra running time.  This was done by using unnecessary flashbacks, constantly cutting to the coaches or the crowd who'll fill up screen time for the next three minutes (you're going to see that clich\u00e9 a lot). They also achieve this by having some filler. One particular character gets a lot more screentime than the rest of his teammates. And apparently he didn't get that screen time in the manga (that's what I've heard correct me if I'm wrong). Even though a lot of people liked it, I've felt like it was something that should've been done at the end of season 2 at best. It would've worked with Aoba Jousai because they're technically their rivals not with Shiratorizawa because they were just a powerhouse that they needed to defeat and not their long life rivals (even though the anime acted like they were).\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Shiratorizawa that's another bad thing of this season. Shiratorizawa was very very bland and boring. They're your stereotypical bad guy team who think that the underdogs are not worthy of their time, but when they actually start playing they suddenly realise that the underdogs are good etc etc. I won't say that the opposing teams in Haikyuu!! are very rich and deep in character because that's basically not true. However there was something which made each team at the very least acceptable and not annoying to watch. Every team who faced Karasuno never thought little of them. Yes they mocked Hinata sometimes but the team as a whole were taken serious as soon as the match started. Even their rival, Aoba Jousai, did this. And the fact that Shiratorizawa is your stereotypical bad guy made this match more annoying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about animation quality. The redeeming quality of the anime for probably most people. And even though the animation is very good, I mean the animations themselves are very nicely done with great details and the 3d environments was well used and were not distracting. However I do want to note that a lot of earlier used shots are reused in the anime. And some of them can be forgiven, but some of the more impressive shots were repeated which takes away the magic that those shots gave when you first saw them. It seems very desperate to lower the production costs. And this is a problem that seasons 1 and 2 also have. But because this season is so unnecessarily long this stuff stands out more than usual. Not to mention that in a lot of flashbacks older shots from previous seasons were used too.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Haikyuu!! is nothing special. It's your average sports anime music. There is nothing wrong with it but it's also not the most amazing soundtrack you'll ever hear.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is haikyuu season 3? I would say it's a huge disappointment and could potentially be bad for the industry if this is accepted by a large amount of people. I won't say that I completely hated it. There were some moments that I did enjoy. And the animation quality is still good even though a lot of animations were repeated a lot. But those few moments that I enjoyed won't justify everything wrong with this season of Haikyuu!! And in my honest opinion it deserves a low score. Hype can't fix something like this. And if you somehow managed to read through all of this stuff and not looked at the score I have given this season and immediately hate me and disagree with me, well congrats.\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend Haikyuu!!: Karasuno Koukou VS Shiratorizawa Gakuen Koukou to your average anime fan. If you want to watch the Haikyuu!! series I would say watch season 1 and 2 and read some spoilers online so that you would avoid this and wait for the real season 3. The only people that would probably like this are die hard haikyuu fans.\\n\\n\\n",

At this point in the anime, most viewers are rather genre-savvy and so they know what to expect: Karasuno wins at the end despite having to Struggle throughout the match, with tons offlashbacks for several characters. While this isn't quite as bad as it could have been, it's still a shame that it's /this/ predictable. I understand that the target demographic probably doesn't care that much, but I think HQ!! would really benefit from adding more to its rather bare-bones plot formula. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it still does certain parts of the formula well. The series of rallies and innovative plays are still heart-pounding fun (at least, presented as such), and the plot twists can be rather intriguing even if predictable. The VERY ending, however, is a nice twist which provides a great hook for a reinvented S4.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 8]\\n\\n\r\nArt's the same here too: No decrease in quality (crisp and warm colour palette, solid and memorable character designs, detailed backgrounds), but no increase too. Animations are still being re-used, but I think it's starting to become less frequent since I noticed a few more new ones have been added; There's also the fact that there are only so many things you can animate for a volleyball match, so I'm a bit more lenient now.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 9]\\n\\n\r\nSame deal for SFX here (not much changing here and it all sounds good for their purpose), but the voice acting and soundtrack got even Stronger! The seiyuus did a splendid job bringing out as much emotion as possible with the script given (ESPECIALLY Tsukishima's and Sugawara's), and the soundtrack has once again expanded in its collection of great alt/indie songs. The OP and ED are rather stellar too, with the OP truly giving off the 'one more to go' feel and the ED being a cutesy acoustic piece.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 8]\\n\\n\r\nSince the cast was smaller, I noticed that there was definitely a stronger focus on characters this time. While some characters /AGAIN/ fall into the trap of being rather underdeveloped (most of Shiratorizawa, some people on the Karasuno side), others receive some back story (Ushijima and Satori) or have their character arcs reach a certain point of 'fruition' (Tsukishima, the Karasuno third-years). The melodrama is much more warranted this time since this match leads to a spot in the NATIONAL High School Volleyball Tournament, so for once I don't feel the need to mock it. It was probably better than the last season in this area, but I still would have liked to see more characters having their motives and such explored. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 9/8]\\n\\n\r\nI'm a fan of Haikyuu!!, so naturally I enjoyed this as much as the previous seasons and still recommend it to fellow HQ!! fans. However, the flaws here are more apparent than before, so hopefully Production I.G. will rectify this for when they produce S4.\\n",

            "content": "Overall rating: 8.5\r\nI thought long and hard about how I should rate the third season of Haikyuu!! but just couldn't settle for a whole number so 8.5 it is!\r\nOn one hand the plot is very simple, just one match covering all of the 10 episodes so story-wise I do feel like there is a limit to how good it can get. On the other hand it was quite well-executed, even though the flashbacks/backstories didn't delve deep enough to get me, they did provide solid foundation for character developments.\r\nI wasn't an avid fan of Haikyuu!! to start with even after finishing the first two seasons inless than three days, but I enjoyed season 3 the most, and felt most connected to the characters after 50 episodes of getting to know them. What I really like about Haikyuu!! is that it doesn't emphasize too heavily on Hinata but gives the spotlight to almost all of the cast across the episodes. This season's MVP is most definitely Kei (for me anyway) but the others had their fair share of moments too, and character interactions were brought out well. But with Shiratorizawa I was constantly underwhelmed by Ushijima's character, there were other moments that could be cut out to add more development for Ushijima, since he was so hyped up to be the 'last boss' Karasuno had to defeat before making it to the Nationals. Nothing to eye-catching about him to me, not very relatable, so as a main antagonist I couldn't feel anything about him. The same goes for the rest of Shiratorizawa, actually, with the exception of Tendo. Also, IMO as a character who's relevance is probably only next to Hinata, Kageyama also seems to be missing important character development ever since the first season, or it could be just that I'm biased since he's my favourite character along with Tsukishima. \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, there were awesome small moments between the cast, I enjoyed the plays so much that I didn't want the match to end, and they actually got me to scream internally ohmygod Tsukishima is so hot during the last two episodes (repeatedly) so enjoyment 9.8/10. Solid season, can't wait to pick up the manga and see what happens with them.",

            "content": "Note: This is a short review of the whole series.\r\nIf somebody were to ask me what is the most important aspect of a show I'd say it's the characters. If asked why, I'd give as an example Haikyuu!!\r\nThe story of a bunch of high school kids playing volleyball sounds boring and uninteresting- and it really is. However, why do I love this show so much? Because of the characters. Once you really start caring about them, everything they feel- you feel it too. Their passion, their insecurities, their sadness and, of course, their happiness. And everything that is important to them- is important to youas well. Yes, this show is about a bunch of high school boys playing volleyball- but, trust me, you\u2019re going to feel every second of the volleyball games like you\u2019re the one who poured all his/her passion it.\\n\r\nYou are probably curious to find out why am I saying the characters are so great- what\u2019s so special about them? Well, couldn\u2019t really say it\u2019s something special- it\u2019s their relatability, personalities and the way they are portrayed. Each and every individual has one trait which makes them likeable: Hinata\u2019s undying love and passion for a sport in which he has a major disadvantage- and his overflowing ambition to become great despite his shortcomings, Kageyama\u2019s willingness to change his rough personality in order to fit in better with the team, Nishinoya\u2019s amazing enthusiasm, team spirit and willingness to not give up, Daichi\u2019s amazing leadership which keeps the team together - and the list could go on.\\n\r\nI also mentioned how incredibly relatable these characters are. In Haikyuu!!, there\u2019s always this feeling that the characters are starting from the bottom- that they are in no way great but they are working their hardest, doing their best and are feeling the same nervousness a normal person would feel if they were in their situation. I love how they put a lot of focus on some character\u2019s lack of self confidence (which for me personally is as relatable as possible), on their fear of losing, on the pressure of living up to their own expectations and on the disappointment in themselves when they make a mistake. In Haikyuu!!, you always have your fingers crossed for the characters to succeed the techniques they plan on doing cuz you saw how hard they worked and how much they want wish to able to do them. However, you do seem them fail a lot. And when they succceed- it makes you feel so damn happy and proud.\\n\r\nYes, Haikyuu!! is by no means a dark or serious show- it\u2019s a light-hearted, at times funny and endearing story that will have you feeling happy, excited and sometimes nervos thanks to our loveable characters.\\n\r\nEnding note: this was my first ever review- hope it wasn't too bad.\\n",
