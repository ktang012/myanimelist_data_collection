            "content": "Times are hard, and in these days of global economic crisis and recession more and more people have joined the hunt to find the best bargains. As with anything in life though, experience is what counts, and veterans in the ways of saving money will usually have the upper hand in the war of the aisles. While there are a few young hotshots who have a natural talent for finding a store's bargain products, the truth is that wherever there are discounted groceries, there will undoubtedly be kings and queens who rule over them.\r\nNow it may sound as though that whole paragraph is nothing morethan a flowery representation of Ben-Tou, Asuara's light novel series (and its anime and manga adaptations), about Satou You, a highschool student who unwittingly becomes embroiled in an all-out brawl between people wanting half-price ready meals, but that's actually incorrect. Surprisingly, it's more akin to the reality of discount shopping than most people think, but while there's generally a lot of shoving, actual combat is ... uncommon.\\n\\n\r\nBen-Tou has a relatively simple storyline that isn't encumbered with complex philosophical questions or existential uncertainties. The plot is straightforward, but very typically shounen in its repetitiveness and predictability, which may explain why there are attempts towards the end of the series to add a layer of depth to the narrative. Unfortunately it doesn't really work as the show spends too much time trying to be funny, justifying all out brawls in grocery stores (which never seem to attract the attention of the police), and servicing hormone crazed teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad thing is that Ben-Tou has potential as a concept, but when it comes to execution the author, and then everyone else, seem to have left their artistic sensibilities by the wayside. There are some genuinely good flashes of inspiration in the narrative that come about because of the fact that each territory is \"ruled\" by the strongest fighter (or \"wolf\"), in that area. Sadly these sparks of inspiration never really amount to anything, and the anime becomes little more than a parade of characters, brawls, inane comedy and pointless fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is supposed to be an action anime, one would assume that the emphasis would be on making the combat scenes look good, but unfortunately that isn't the case. The characters are decent enough, but the reliance on stereotypes can make some viewers think that the designers lacked imagination. In addition to that, the settings for many of the show's fight scenes are grocery stores, so it's remarkable that the post-battle shop floors remain unscathed. The animation quality is fairly reasonable, but it's not up to the standard that David Production are capable of (they made Tatakau Shisho: The Book of Bantorra), and the series can sometimes look like a rush job (which may explain the unusual postures and the odd jumps and glitches).\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence features the song \"Live for Life: \u014ckamitachi no Yoru\" by Manami, an upbeat rock song set against a backdrop of character introductions, action and fanservice that make a surprisingly accurate presentation of the show's content. There's also an additional introduction for episode four that focuses on Shaga Ayame while \"Treasure\" by Kato Emiri plays out in the background. The melodic ballad used for the ending theme, \"Egao no Housoku\" by Ise Mariya, serves as a nice counterpoint to each episode, and the rather placid sequence fits well with the idea that it's a post-battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the music, although the series is well served in the variety of pieces on offer, the usage of particular tracks can seem a little repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nBen-Tou likes to wear its shounen heart on its sleeve, so the dialogue is filled with juvenile sentiment and lots of shouting. Like almost every other action/harem/comedy/fanservice anime out there, the script is a little too reliant on familiarity with the genre, but within that there are a few decent little deviations from the norm (mainly about fighting for discounted food). Unfortunately the acting is pretty much what one would expect from this type of show - lots of effort and not much actual skill, but maybe that's to be expected. The four leads have little experience with serious roles, which isn't an indictment of their abilities, but rather an observation about the anime industry's propensity for churning out mediocre titles that cater to the minority of fans.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, stop wasting talent. It's too hard to come by.\\n\\n\r\nIn true shounen fashion the characters are about as one-dimensional as they come, and there's very little in the way of refinement throughout the series. That said, the main focus of the story isn't to develop each person, but rather to put them in situations where the warrior mentality can be prominently displayed. Unfortunately it doesn't work out that way as Ben-Tou is a veritable who's who of stereotypes, and pretty much every trait and personality associated with genre are on display, especially the wishy-washy lead male - Satou You. The problem is that viewers may become too familiar with a character's behaviour outside of combat, so watching them fight can often raise several questions, the main one being why does someone who is supposedly capable keep getting slapped around by Shiraume Ume.\\n\\n\r\nLike many harem lead males, Satou You seems to be a bit of a masochist.\\n\\n\r\nAs a concept, Ben-Tou has some merit, but somewhere along the way a decision was made to try and appeal to a specific fanbase, and that's what ultimately lets the show down. The addition of multiple love-interests, inane comedy, innuendo and fanservice seem tacky at best, and can often feel more like hasty additions to the plot. Although there is some entertainment value in the series, this is mainly due to the fact that audiences can watch this as though it was a half-decent action movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is that Ben-Tou could have held up a mirror to the real-life tribulations of discount shopping, but sadly the show fails to realise its potential because it tries too hard to jump on the harem/comedy bandwagon, and this gets in the way of it being a true parody.",

            "content": "Ben-To is philosophy. Ben-To is art. Ben-To is everything, but bad for your health.\r\nHow does a show deliver such greatness that cannot be matched by other action shows? The answer is simple: Ben-To knows its place as an over-the-top parody work. Most shows suffer from being blatant copies of each other and turn bland by the time the second episode pops up. However, every single episode of Ben-To is simmered, well-roasted, and served with refreshments.\r\nThe show\u2019s main appeal is its dramatic fighting sequences and Production David does well. Do not fear the \u201cabsurd\u201d premise. In shopping malls, it is a well-known fact that discounted goodsare pretty much fought over; Ben-To just takes it into account and increases the fighting factor. The ridiculous over-the-top action scenes are rendered and always intense; not even a typical pool episode can hinder the awesomeness of punching people\u2019s stomachs for the sake of an unagi don bento. Speed lines are used graciously and the action can be seen easily due to the presentation it is drawn, the OP being a great example.\\n\\n\r\nDo not also be let down by the huge amount of cliches and archetypes; this is a parody of action shows. You have the Rei Ayanami clone, the perverted ordinary high school student, a perverted girl, and more. However, what Ben-To does is something spectacular: it plays with the tropes and archetypes and puts it into the most awesome setting of all, a supermarket. There is a lot of interesting twists into an archetype, trope, and setting that is admirable in creative standards; it is very rare to see a work so understanding and playful of its tropes and Ben-To does it well.\\n\\n\r\nYet, this work is tainted by the huge amount of fanservice. Most of the characters are females with noticeable cleavage and this can be distracting and sexist to many. I have trouble liking Oshiroi\u2019s character sometimes as all she does is make sexual innuendos. It is problematic that the action clashes with the fanservice in many times.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs are beautifully animated and highlight the show\u2019s distinctive features. \"Live for Life\" is a catchy, irresistible theme song that I hum every time I remember Ben-To. The background music is pretty wacky and cool at times, showing the effort done in the sound department. All of the seiyuus sound about right, though there isn\u2019t anyone who did a spectacular job.\\n\\n\r\nThe reasons that you may not watch this show become the reason you will watch the show. Its ingredient list can be skeptical at first, but it is godly. The show is more addictive than Dr. Pepper and tastier than Kettle potato chips.\\n\\n\r\nWhy are you waiting in line at the restaurant? Go to your nearest supermarket today and grab a bento.\\n\\n\r\nItadakimasu!",

XD and I like how these is a whole system of ranks and special names for the top fighters.(Great 9)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art isn't \"OMG look at the animacion\" but ain't bad either,all the characters faces and eyes are in the right places,you can't complain about it becuase it's better then average with all these lazy animators nowadays,it looks good in high quality on the TV.(Great 9)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is cool while the ending song is a nice slow one and the backgorund music when there fighting is a up beat song that is just the right one for the mood of the anime.(Great 9)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe reason I picked up this anime was because one of the main girl characters Sen Yarizui(aka the Ice witch) caught my eye and that rarely happerns with me,she's cute and unique looking and I also liked the look of Yuu Kaneshiro(the wizard),so far there isn't a character I don't like.(Outstanding 10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't even understand why I enjoy this anime so much but I can't help smiling and getting exicted rooting for the characters! Very very funny and I don't get bored at all witch is something to say for me.(Outstanding 10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nVery enjoyable :D (9 Great)\\n\\n\r\nAdd this to you MAL list now and don't miss out on the laughter and enjoyment of this anime!

            "content": "It's like Fight Club with Lunchables.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nBut there isn't a whole lot to spoil here.  When I first saw this series on the coming-season chart, I laughed at the ridiculous premise.  Just read the description!  Teams of high school students fighting over discounted groceries, all while following some sort of highly regarded honor code?  \"This show has to be absolutely mindless,\" I thought.  It is.  But that's okay, because Ben-To is completely self-aware.  It knows you didn't come here for the plot.  You came to be entertained.  And you shall beentertained.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, the story is an absolute trainwreck.  To put it briefly, at certain time in a certain convenience store, a special sticker is placed on food to mark it as discounted.  Logically, there are dozens of people, waiting like vultures, to swoop in and beat each other senseless to save a few yen (sounds a bit like Black Friday, but I digress).  There are leaders in these battles, such as Sen \"Ice Witch\" Yarizui, the president of the \"Half-Price Food Lover's Club\" that You Satou, the MC, happens to join.  These leaders battle it out, claiming the sticker as a  trophy of their victory. Those who fight with honor and abide by the rules of bento brawling are given the title of \"Wolves.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is about as bad as a story can get.  The reason it gets an \"average\" 5 is because it is able to build a complex system around this idiotic premise, a system which happens to be interesting and funny at the same time.  The customs, titles, everything about it has been thought out to an unnecessary level of detail.  Really, this is as much a comedy as it is an action series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBen-to is surprisingly well animated.  The fight scenes are choreographed well, and there is a large variety of character models which each get their own style.  There is a significant amount of blatant fanservice, if you're into that kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has a pretty bad sound track consisting of several background convenience store songs and corny action music.  I have no complaints about the voice cast.  I don't put much weight into this category anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like cheeesy, over the top characters, you came to the right place.  While the main character resembles Harem Protagonist #652, nearly every other character is highly entertaining (if shallow).  You have the cold, calculating Ice Queen, the formidable \"Kyou\" sisters, the incredibly violent lesbian Ume who is constantly after Hana, who only joined the Half-Price Food Lover's Club because she wanted material for her yaoi muscleman fanfics.  Lastly we have Shaga, who is one of the main fanservice magnets, and while the other girls were by no means left constantly covered, I felt she was the main source of the series' tissue material.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLet me compare Ben-to to junk food.  It's bad for you, has no real value, and you know deep down you shouldn't like it.  However, that never stopped me from loving every bite of this anime.  If you can sit down and turn off your brain for a bit, I promise it will leave a smile on your drooling, vegetative face.\\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nMy brain is too numb for thoughts, but I will leave you with a quote.  \"To the winners go glory and half-priced bento! \u2014 Ayame Shaga\"\\n",

The story follows a monetary poor You Satou, who one day was discovered beaten inside a supermarket and sees a mysterious girl outside the supermarket this is where you say, i want to know what happened, heis followed in the morning by a girl called Hana who encourage him to go to the supermarket again, and he is beaten again by The Ice Witch, she invites them to join the Half Priced Food Lovers Club (where she is the only member and president) to teach them how to get Half Priced Ben-to by fighting their way against other fighters.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThis was well animated and even good in the fight scenes, and the different compelling characters were well detailed and the background art of everything was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack on this was outstanding, i personally love it and the background music on the fight scenes was great, i wanted to hear it everytime; The VA is great, i really enjoyed the music presented in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThere is a variety of Characters that were great and they all have a back story but i don't have a favorite, if i have to choose, it would be Sen Yarizui the ''Ice Witch'', but the 4 Main Characters were amazing they were unique and really hilarious even the support characters were unique and rememberable and the twins were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nBen-to is enjoyable for the comedy, the sound, the characters, and the action, i really love Ben-to and i wanted to see more and more, and i wanted to see more about Sen.",

            "content": "The Ice Witch,the Beauty by the Lake...These nicknames at the start of opening theme along with the upbeat song itself got me quite interested.The name was awkward in itsellf but what the anime turned out to be didn't make me regret watching it.The story is quirky enough to amaze you and at times it becomes hilarious.On the other hand,it puts forward a story that you can relate to,something that is relevant morally,an idealistic view-that you have to fight for your own food to aquire it and in that way,you can realiseits true flavour and worth.Bento has a central theme-food is precious and we should realise its worth and not just mindlessly eat it but appreciate the effort of so many other people that has gone into bringing it to us finally.Thus,the meals that we eat everyday shouldn't be taken for granted but rather treated as a precious commodity.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with us being introduced to an ever-lazy protagonist Satou who does as much as he absolutely has to everyday.On a certain high-school night,when he goes to the supermarket to buy some cheap food suiting his limited allowance,that he first witnesses and gets dragged into a Bento fight and gets beat up awfully by an unknown girl who later turns out to be a senior at the same high-school as his and is the famed Western Wolf,'The Ice Witch'.\\n\\n\r\nHungry and testosterone-fuelled youngsters who fight it out with all their might to get their hands on the exclusive half-priced bentos that are made available in the supermarkets after a certain fixed time at night is what the anime is about.But it not only the food that they are after but also Honour.Warriors of such kind aquire 'nom de guerres',i.e,Honorary titles that are given to those fighters of the Wolf grade.The beauty of the nom de guerre concept is quite fulfilling.The titles of the characters build up an atmosphere of excitement.Then there are pigs,dogs,boars and other types of fighters depending on their style of fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle-sequences are very good and smooth and you can feel the quality of animation at its best.They are very enjoyable and relatable.The music that plays in the background when battles happen gets you all fired up with its upbeatness and techno-beats.\\n\r\nThe greatest merit of Ben-to is that it manages to merge humour and seriousness seamlessly.All that packed in a mere 12 episode series.Saito gets renowned as 'The Freak',his honourary warrior's title.Situations lead him to earn his fame as the perverted freak.How he gets tangled in unwanted dire problematic situations which always seems to end with him being further recognized as a pervert is hilarious to watch. Two scenes are worth a mention-The swimming pool incident where Saito shows his,umm..,Radar to the public and the one where the Kyo sister mistakes him as the Ice witch in the hospital and makes her confession.They certainly should have you in splits.And there are other moments that have you laughing heartily too.\\n\\n\r\nEcchi,you get it in good amount keeping in mind that its such a short series.Yuri abounds and is proclaimed by Shiraume,the student council president.God,such a dominating nature she has that not even Shaga,a.k.a,The Beauty by the Lake can avoid her sexy 'naked-in-the-bathtub' attack.She gets to know Shaga intimately in the bathtub and her bare-it-all moments with Oshoroi,her love,is tiltillating to the extreme.But all of this adds to the 'Wow!' factor.Assuredly,you won't forget Shiraume and her escapades anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe serious parts are not compromised though.The history of Orthros,the Wolf duo,is quite deep.The sheer ignorance and seclusion from society they were made to face just because they were to strong to win against strikes deeply in the heart.It portrays that when you attain great power,you become more the lonely.Sato lives up to expectations as he plays the befitting wolf with magnanimous pride in the end.He's not something exceptional but he does his job of a protagonist nicely.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are some cons too.The Wizard could have been given more screen space and some greater role to play.In the end,despite being the West's strongest wolf,he ends up feeling insignificant as he leaves the country for studying abroad.Beardy,Brunette and Monk could have been more associative with the Ice witch and gang but perhaps they were purposedly kept as the loyal friends and fight-buddies.Hercules Combo turns out to be a manipulating wimp which disappoints slightly considering the terror he brought about at first.\\n\r\nBut all these are very minor things and not exactly flaws when you weigh them against the merits of the anime.So,in the end,not much remains to disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nOrthros' unique combat style is one cool thing to watch.The God of Discounts idea is quirky but fun.The battle sequences are of quality and the friendship factor is well-fitting.You get comedy,you get some lovely ladies baring it all,action,and quirkiness.So,conclusively,Ben-to is a good light-hearted watch which can make your day.If you have pride,if you have honour,leave your thoughts aside and join in the fight with the wolves.Ben-to may not sparkle with class,but with its glamour and glitz,it sure does leave a lasting impression.\\n",

            "content": "I expected Ben-To to be a generic harem anime about how the main character uses bentos to makes girls fall in love with him. (Ok, that might not be generic, but still, I expected something along those lines) Thankfully, I was wrong, or else I would've dropped it right at the spot. Ben-To is an anime that I never expected to enjoy so much, yet I did because of the good comedy, awesome action, unique characters, and, most of all, the shock factor that it both revolves around food, and they're literally risking getting beat up for that food!!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nBasically, Sato Yo went to geta half-priced bento one day, but then he got beaten up and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he has no memory of what happened in the supermarket. A girl then warns him (Sen Yarizui, AKA the ice witch) never to go to the supermarket again. However, Sato goes again with his friend, Oshiroi Hana, and gets beat up again. Yarizui then invites them to the Half Priced Food Lovers Club, where she teaches them all about being a \"wolf\" (figher for half-priced bentoes)\\n\r\nThe story is very comedic, with Sato getting embarrassed and the fights full of action-packed battles. The characters have their own special names, which the \"wolves\" refer to by. Then, there are \"boars,\" \"wolves pride\" and \"rulers of the east and west\".  This turns the plot into a great story, basically talking about how much fighting for bentos mean to them. It's surprisingly deep, for an anime about food. I'm also surprised how there are rankings, and how they use everyday supermarket items as weapons. Overall, a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nStandard anime art. It's colorful, but the art style has been used a lot of times. Not good, yet not bad, either. Looks good, scenes are animated great. There really is nothing else to say besides that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe seiyuu did a great job, doing voices that fit the characters perfectly. The BGM was good, but aside from the battle scenes it's pretty average. The OP is upbeat, which fits a series like this one. The ending was not bad, but the song didn't really fit the series, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the categories where it truly shines. Character design and seiyuu fits the character's respective personality, and everyone had a colorful and unique personality, which blends into the overall story and humor. I also got attached to some of them, like Orthrus and Ice Witch.  Everyone was great, and I found the characters to be very enjoyable with their interaction with each other. Only downside is that there's barely any character development, but I didn't really expect it to cover every character's backstory in a mere 12 episodes, or even 3-4 characters.  Still, it didn't hinder the experience for me and the characters are fun to watch even though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and laughed. I also couldn't believe how deep this anime was, and how an anime about FOOD would be one of my most favorite in this season.  The action scenes were cool, and the story was unbelievable. This all adds to the experience, however.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you like comedy, action, and totally unbelievable concept in one anime, look no further. This isn't your generic ecchi, action, or comedy. This is a whole other experience, an experience I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy.",

            "content": "Ben-to is a good example of a show with a lot of potential for a rule-of-cool anime with a lot of dumb over-the-top action sequences but ultimately fails in regards to lack of any interesting characters to root for while having, in what I believe, to be sub-par fighting choreography and animation. I honestly really wanted to like this show, I really did, but the lack of any fun characters or engagement dragged on through each and every episode as the anime tries its hardest to be silly and over-the-top  without carrying over the same charm it had in the beginning. It feels likeit wants to be over-the-top but suffers from serious tone problems which don't integrate all too well with the silly premise and story they throw us into. Allow me to elaborate:\\n\\n\r\nBen-to is a show in which people battle it out for the tastiest and the best bento boxes in numerous department stores around the city. Each part of the city is governed by a different gang and turf and the such with many people having unique nicknames based around their fighting styles and personality traits. I'd argue that one of the most interesting things about this show was precisely that - I found all of this to be incredibly fun and interesting in a stupid way. We learn that there are several customs and honours that each ben-to fighter must abide by and each character takes the art of beating the everlasting hell out of each so seriously it's comical in that sense. The insane rumours these fighters conjured up about special people, the insane nicknames given and the general stupidity of each turf war having their own insane laws and the such was a fun and dumb idea and this works very well for the first few episodes or so as we see our main character who learns the joy of beating the crap out of someone just for some cheaper ben-to.\\n\\n\r\nBut, while this idea does set-up a lot of possibilities into what is possible and how insane you can go with this idea, the anime suffers from two problems which I feel hold it back. The first being, as I've said, a lack of interesting characters to care for, all of which are annoying mind you, but the show's gimmick begins to wear off really quickly as they don't really do too much with this concept. Sure, there are new fighters that join which add some more history and depth about this strange fighting festival that takes place but as we travel along the show, the cool and over-the-top fights seem to take a back seat to boring character backstories which are equally generic as they're uninteresting. That's not to say that the anime doesn't have some cool looking fight scenes, it's just that many-a-time I found myself bored with the character interactions and a few times I felt kind of disappointed with a fight that had been building up for a while and had no payoff as we suddenly skip past it removing all of the dramatic tensions of the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime suffers from the same problem I believe the currently airing Keijo does; the gimmick is so stupid at first that it's fun when you first start but the lack of interesting characters begins to drain on you the more you watch and by the end, the novelty has worn off entirely. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this show is the comedy and the characters that go along with it. The main lead is kind of forgetful, as they typically are for these types of shows, and doesn't really do anything all too interesting.  He develops a passion for ben-to fighting but doesn't feel like he changes throughout the story, aside from gaining some random strength despite no training and no experience in the art of fighting. Hana was a character simply defined for her love for BL, frequently writing stories involving our main character. She also has an insane lesbian stalker named Ume Shiraume who is the biggest bitch I've ever seen. She frequently beats down on the main character for no reason for the most mundane things. I expect the creators wished for me to laugh at this but all I kept wondering was why this guy kept receiving the horrible treatment that he does. He is hit, slapped and has hit clothes torn off numerous times which all felt completely unjustified as he had never done anything to warrant this treatment.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, all of the characters treated him in this fashion and it just comes across as mean-spirited. As an audience, we enjoy seeing a character receive karma for something mean they've done and it feels satisfying as a result, but here, all it does is make me feel as if the characters are horrible people. There was one scene in which one of the characters threw out the guy's game console for no reason and upon attempting to rescue said console, ends up hurting himself and ends up in the hospital. Granted she does show some remorse, but not before putting him threw more agony for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other two characters worth mentioning is the annoying blond lead, mainly defined for her tits and the white-haired girl, only defined by her quietness. All of the characters in this show are all caricatures of anime stereotypes and none of them are unique enough to break away from this mould. When the show clearly wants us to root for one of these characters, I find it generally hard to do so as I found them all so uninteresting making the scenes in which the narrative stakes are high (as high as you can possibly get while fighting for products on Black Friday anyway) feel weak and kind of dull. As the anime ran on, this problem only got worse. To be fair, there is an attempt at character development and intrigue in regards to the Kyou sisters but it's kind of integrated half haphazardly into the plot without having too much time to fully develop. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was generally appealing to the eyes and the character design as well as the colour design was pretty spot on. While in motion, the animation did suffer from some animation error and at times it could look kind of jarring but nothing to take me out of any scenes. The music was pretty forgetful as a whole with the exception of the opening theme which is catchy as hell. The main thing with Ben-to is that it feels as if it wants to be silly and the over-the-top but it never gets to that stage and instead feels kind of lukewarm which makes the anime feel kind of forgetful. Ben-to is not the worst series in the world but it does leave a lot to be desired which is unfortunate considering how fun the show could of been if the characters were more likeable and if it were more over-the-top.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The end of this 12 episode anime has been aired, now we look forward to next' season's anime with similar twist than this, nuff said, so..............Hummmmmmmmm, If one is to look at this 12 episode anime the 1st thing that would come to mind is \"BLACK FRIDAY,\" yes it's a day after memorial day in the US where a few overruns would be sold on a special discount and surly chaos follows when every last customer would duke out for it. In this anime's case, this is something where the author takes of something that happens in real life and make it really reallyelaborate. This 12 episode anime's genre which is action, comedy and martial arts did played up to it in fact everything in this anime is about those 3 said genres. So for the story I'll give it a \"Fair\" number 6, since there is no plot in it and everything is focus on a few pieces of discounted TV dinners- which by the way is called \"Bento\" in Japan but the entertaining part is when  all hell breaks lose for a pack of rabid wolves out to get a cheap meal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask, I always rate it like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the female sieyus who did the voices of the main female casts, I  like that the voice of Satou is the same sieyu who also voiced Aki from \"Baka to test,\" co'z it really does play well as a moron for the said character, I like the opening theme, but I hate the closing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way the characters are compared to that of a canine hierarchy, since that's what the author projects them otherwise they won't be called \"Wolves.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo who are they:\\n\\n\r\nOshiroi Hana- In the opening she called \"The Muscle Cop,\" but actually she a blogger with a steady stream of fans, by canine standards she's a wimpy fox,  just like one she follows the pack ( in this case it is the members of the half price food lovers  club) but stays in the shadows and takes advantage of the chaos to silently steal some of the prize (referring to the bento)   , I kinda hate it when she makes no effort to resist Shiraume Ume's sexual advances, either she enjoys it or she can't. \\n\\n\r\nSatou You- Somewhere in the mid part of the 12 episode anime he was given the moniker \"Hentai,\" I hate it when his character is a dichotomy that's because he's willing to duke out with his cousin Ayame during bento brawls but is chicken to duke out with Ume . By canine reference he's a mongrel, in the 12th episode, it is establish that he has feelings for Sen. Then again, one might say that the comedy genre is him. \\n\\n\r\nYarizui Sen- one of the top wolves in the bento brawling business, who goes by the moniker \"Ice Witch\" which is taken from some popular sports drink, she the president of the Half Price Food Lovers Club and she only has 2 members, one is a mongrel (Satou) and another a wimpy fox (Hana). I kinda like that she contributes a lot to the Martial Art genre of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nChapatsu- I like the way her body is drawn and also being in a bento brawl as well, but I will never understand as to why the author of this anime only focuses on her body, but has forgotten to give this hot character a face.\\n\\n\r\nShaga Ayame- Well, I like it that she severs as a fine fanservice of in this anime, since the way she's drawn really makes her hot. l like it that her role is that of a former Gabrielle Ratchet gang, goes by the moniker \"Beauty by the Lake,\" since this anime has a small harem element in it, she kinda fills the void of a sister with a brother complex with Satou, actually they're cousin who attend different schools. She one unusual bento brawler co'z she uses chopsticks as her weapon, which is kinda lame for a white wolf like her.\\n\\n\r\nSawagi Kyo sisters- both are members of the student council from Ayame's school, both came from a well off family, whom are into bento brawling for fun and it is nice that they are added since this anime won't be complete without a rich girl (or girls) who is bored and is looking for some action kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nShiraume Ume- a student council president from Satou's school, who has hots for Hana and has rage for Satou, her beating up the poor muchacho (satou) more like adds to someone who is a unlikeable character in this anime.he also some one whom I wish that the Ice Witch would duke out with. By canine standards she can be considered a Guard Dog since she's very possessive of Hana and the muchacho happens to be her attack dummy. Like Ayame, she also provides some fanservice to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, since it is the chiquitas who are the main focus of the action genre, such rating is deserving for them, actually the rating is for the chiquitas (female leads).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime is focus more on the action and martial arts genre than the comedy regardless of how predictable it is. There is no plot here and the story is too simple, for a 12 episode anime like this where everything revolves around scrambling for  few pieces of discounted TV dinners may seems stupid, the elaborate fighting thing that goes with it  is \"Fair\" enough to provide some entertainment.. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe end\\n\\n\r\nTime for my TV dinner were I got it for a 20% discount from the grocer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There are only 12 episodes and its REALLY funny!

I finished the 10th episode and they are still not there.Only 2 characters but it doesn't matter that much.\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend that you watch the 1st and 2nd episodes. After that you will get into it. If you're not going to watch it then your really missing some GREAT COMEDY.",

            "content": "It comes as no surprise when Japan comes up with another one of their crazy concoctions. Their creation this time is Ben-To - the anime where half-priced bento are serious business and risking one's life for one is the norm. With an idea as crazy as that, it's no wonder there are so many skeptics out there questioning the entertainment value of Ben-To and its ability to compete with the other shows airing in the same season. While a new idea does have its advantages (e.g. viewers are likely to be more curious), there are also disadvantages that follow (e.g. not applying the logic ofsafety). Now, let's see how Ben-To fared. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nWhile the typical mecha fight boasts giant lasers and flashy machine guns, the brawls in Ben-To only involve human beings and their two weapons: their hands and feet. Thus, it may seem hard for an entertaining fight to make its way into the show. However, I was surprised at how wrong I was after seeing the first few fights in Ben-To. Not only were they exciting to watch, they were also animated well. The movements of the characters may have been a bit choppy but I considered that to be acceptable since humans are not like well-oiled machines - our movements are not perfectly smooth. The other artwork, including the characters, was also decent and easy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nThe entire show essentially focuses on the main protagonist, Satou Y\u014d, and how he grows from being a grovelling loser (a Dog) to an elite fighter (a Wolf), when it came to bento battles. Throughout the series, you see him slowly grasp the ideas of these battles and learn about the honor and respect that comes with being a Wolf. In the beginning he is depicted as an ignorant and stubborn high school boy who is running low on money for food. But as time goes on, his transformation is evident and, in the end, he becomes arguably the strongest and most respected fighter in the town. The visible growth and excellent development of this one boy already makes the entire series worth watching, though I would've liked to see more development for the other characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nFirstly, I found the OP to be very fitting as it was upbeat and full of energy, easily helping one to get into the spirit of watching some bento battles. The ED, on the other hand, was softer and more mellow, which I found was a nice way to end each episode. The BGM was very good and quite memorable, especially the music played at each of the supermarkets. Voice acting, like the other aspects of this category, was also great. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first read the synopsis for this anime, I asked myself, \"Will this kind of story even be interesting?\" After completing Ben-To, I can definitely answer myself and say that \"Yes, it was definitely interesting.\" I went into the show not knowing what to expect and I think that's best way to go. Ridding yourself of doubts and expectations, and becoming open to this new and crazy idea will definitely maximize your enjoyment. To be honest, the whole story is unrealistic. But, think about it, this is the world of anime - not everything has to be believable. When you forget about everything and just watch the show by itself, chances are, you'll enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nBen-To has gone where no other anime has gone before - and it has paid off. Overall, I felt it was a successful series. I, for one, would like a season two as I thought the ending was open-ended. I recommend Ben-To to anyone looking for a action-packed comedy series with a touch of fanservice; you definitely won't be disappointed. So what are you waiting for? Grab some bento to eat while you watch Ben-To!",

The premise is entirely absurd, and the show is very self-aware, so there is something comedic to the whole thing in that sense. But I thought there would be actual ha-ha-ha, laugh-out-loud funny gags in it; there weren't.\r\nWell, OK, to be fair, there is *ONE* scene in episode 8 -- BOKU NO SATURN!!!!!! -- that actually made me chuckle, but by and large I spent the entire series waiting for the showto get funny and it never did. None of the characters lean quite far enough into their tropes for it to be parody, so everything mostly falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some not-bad fight scenes (episode 10 comes to mind) and some bento descriptions that did make my mouth water, but really nothing to take note of. I'm not even sure I would classify it as mindless entertainment at this point. I didn't really hate it and I wasn't really super bored, so I'm not gonna say it was bad, but I think there's plenty of other anime I would rank above Ben-To as far as mindless entertainment or stupid comedy goes. I recommend skipping it unless you're really into the character design. \\n",

I found the former to be more accurate. Ben-To (no relation to Ben 10) is a show about the average self-insert harem MC who does a fight to the death in grocery stores for lunches on sale.\r\nThe characters in the show were the typical TVTropes harem girls, so just google tsundere, shrinking violet, etc. and that should give you agood idea of how this show's characters act and develop (I'm not sure if they actually develop, I watch a lot of harems so I usually start phasing out halfway if they're not good). I don't remember very much about the main character at all, probably because he's not even the nice guy stereotype, he's just this character without any personality who's basically told to do everything he does by other people. It's not even in the deep or philosophical way like in Punpun, it's as if the voice actor felt like he wasn't getting paid enough so he just stopped saying his lines.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's opening song was pretty decent though, it's one of the few things I remember from this series. The art and character design of the show was pretty good too, I mean it did make me want to jerk off to the characters so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest part of the show though was it's deep philosophical nature, using high school students to represent kids from Africa fighting over grains of rice so that they can get something to eat, and the various gangs who represented the military forces that forced the kids to risk their lives, fight for, and mine (buy) blood diamonds (bento).\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't watch this.",

I have generally been content to stick with things like Fullmetal Alchemist, Kekkaishi, Soul Eater, etc., shows that are funny but don't go all out. However, The Devil Is A Part Timer was absolute genius, so it encouraged me to try another comedy.\r\nHow does Ben-to stack up? Eh, this is a little more what I pictured a comedy anime to be like. However, it gets a solid \"good\" from me. It is not nearly the comedic gargantuan that The Devil Is A Part-Timer is, but its serviceable. \r\nLike a lot of anime comedic themes, one of themost endearing aspects of Ben-to is how earnest it all is. Beating the tar out of people to get a bento at half price is clearly something that the characters take very seriously. Austin Tindle and Trina Nishimura both deserve praise for their work here.\\n\r\nHowever, the amount of base sexual perversion in the show is somewhat unsettling. Never have I seen textbook cases of sexual harassment (both male and female) played for laughs like this. Some of it is funny, but there is waaaay too much of it. Maybe it's the language gap, but Ben-to didn't really excel. It's good, I guess.",

The struggle here is a fight between members of the bento with street fighting self defense for those who get a discount that is labeled \"honor\" gained the nickname of wolves while they are merely subordinate and earned the nickname of the discount food fight over the dog. So many conflicts in the anime and the development of the more interesting story.\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nIn terms of story, this anime has the unique power of ideas and made good at exploring the discount, it is in today's all that certain discounts and cheaper it would be a bone of contention even though the rest of the stuff and that's the power of this anime but it's unfortunate that a plot was made impressed imposed proven easy and classic stories, seem boring because there is no social relationships between the characters and the look seemed only a matter of bento in their minds.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is the advantage of this anime, Art presented seems so strong, especially in the bento proved to exist in each episode presented bento is always different and look so delicious when seen, as detailed in drawing food. Not only is it a picture of the character is also very strong in the anime where there is a lot of female characters and everything can be spelled \"Kawai\" Yarizui especially the main character who can make the audience fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt is also a weakness of this anime, the soundtrack is presented not so inspiring and the lack of sound when there is a moment of action characters. However, if the observed soundtrack lyrics are presented to illustrate the story of this anime here the rest is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately the character of this anime, in which the main character in the plot to be Yarizui that figure fails Kudere played and impressed looks like a normal High School girl who likes to talk and look serious when describing the characters who figure Kudere quiet, mysterious and compelling. Not only are there other weakness is apparent lack of chemistry between the characters prove to all the characters seem to walk alone, look Yarizui that only focus on the bento discount regardless of the friends around him, too terobsesu Oshiroi by Satou to be a novel without knowing Satou Satou figures more closely and the appear to struggle alone get a discount bento without any cooperation among members of the club. But the pull of the character here is the development of each character and leads to a strong friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime is less so because there are so many factors \"Impossible\" from the anime where the previously weak Satou suddenly seem so strong and can beat all his enemies, wounds that do not make sense when there is so badly needed at least one week of healing and the worse they think of themselves is an animal who only think of only lust.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nSince I focus on the story, then the value that I think is pretty good for a short anime series and I think there should be no sequel of this anime",

I present to you a review of the anime Ben-to\r\n The premise of the series is very simple, people fight for half priced ben-to in convenience stores at night. The battle for half priced food has its own rules, supposed to be followed by the participant who refer to themselves as wolves. that's all there is to it.\r\n Anyone who trash this anime because it doesn't have a deep plot, twists and much character developments is retarded. It's only purpose is to entertain you by  comedy,action, a tiny bit of romance and lastly fan service. Before watching an anime, you better set your expectations right so as not to be disappointed. Ben-to is really simple, that's its very nature. if the you hated it because the story is messed up and the events are random, it's not the fucking fault of the creators of the anime but yours for having stupid expectations and by being pretentiously deep.\\n\\n\r\n Regarding enjoyment, it was a really fun anime to watch. The gags hit and the fight scenes are enjoyable to watch as well. About the characters, you will love some of them and you will hate some. The interaction between them are mostly the source of fun in this show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if you exclusively enjoy anime with deep plot and all seriousness, then stay the fuck away, as I said, there's nothing others can do regarding a viewers taste. but if you enjoy the occasional \"don't think about things\" kind of anime, I think you can enjoy Ben-to \\n",

There\u2019s something kind of really hilarious watching high schoolers Street Fighter-it-out for half priced, convenient store bento boxes. (Ew\u2026)\r\nFrom an technical standpoint it looks kind of generic. I like that the characters are all recognizable, but the animation is only okay. You can tell that most of the effort was put into the battle scenes, and even then there are short cuts. But they were good short cuts, clever effects and angles and timing made the fights appear dynamic and exciting to watch. The music was also all over the place\u2014I remember hearingsomething resembling African tribal music as well as Italian opera\u2014but in it\u2019s strange goofy way, it also fit the sort of survival of the fittest, overly dramatic approach these high schoolers take to getting their discount meals.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, our main character, Yo Sato, is that stock male character you see in harem anime\u2014pretty average looking, sort of a weenie, not too unique or memorable; the kind where all the girls have unreasonable crushes on him for no apparent reason. Heck, even his brawler name is \u2018Pervert\u2019. He deviates from the stereotype a little bit--he gets some character development and the girl he likes also likes him back for legitimate reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of the harem are all bento brawlers. \u2018The Ice Witch\u2019, Sen Yarizuri, is one of the strongest fighters around, very stern and detached, mostly because she doesn\u2019t know much else aside from her survival of the fittest wolf mentality. Yo\u2019s cousin, Ayame Shaga, is known as the \u2018Beauty by the Lake\u2019\u2014there\u2019s not really much to her (but she does use chopsticks in battle :D). The last is Hana Oshiroi who nicknames herself \u2018The Muscle Cop.\u2019 She was by far the most enjoyable character in the series; easily excitable and into writing yaoi erotic fiction who wins her bento by sneaking in and taking it while everybody else is brawling. There are other trope-y charcters, including the little moe girl who\u2019s pure evil and the domineering lesbian student body president...\\n\\n\r\nThe show is unabashedly fanservicey. Not really my thing, but I understand why it\u2019s there. It never really got in the way of anything in the show, so I was fine with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did like was the Darwinian theory that sort of plays in and how it does allow for some character development in our lead. He rises from dog to wolf and comes to understand that it\u2019s not just about half priced meals, but it\u2019s about honor and dignity and all that.\\n\\n\r\nI supposed if I could sum up to someone what anime is in a 12 episode anime series, this would be the one I would recommend. It\u2019s got the typical stereotypes, fighting, naked girls, but it was legitimately entertaining and funny and did put it\u2019s spin on it with it\u2019s unique premise.",

Ben-To left me positively in awe with it's ridiculousness, it is not an anime you watch for the dramatic accuracy of it's science, nor the unwavering strenght of it's plot. No. It's a solid anime where comedy meets action. A place where supermarket employees are treated as Gods, losers settle for instant noodles and victoriously emerged heroes of war get rewarded with the tasty half priced Ben-Tos. \r\nStory & Characters: \r\nBen-To doesn't strive on exceptional story like many other animes I think well ofnor does it give you a fair share of interesting characters that grow during the show fabulously intertwining with the numerous plot twists. But the synergestic power of the weird setting, the simplistic characters and the 'generic' story fit in together quite well creating a show that is very well worth watching. The characters barely made any development save for few exceptions, but that is not what this show is about nor should you focus on it when watching the show. Obviously you should avoid the show if you're all about the story and character development but the comedic value of this show was high. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nThe art in the show was mediocre yet very fitting in a sense that the show wasn't likely even trying to be overly beautiful nor exceptionally accurate in it's portrayal of the show. The fanservice IS there time to time, but it wasn't really overly annoying in my opinion except for a few scenes towards the end of the show. I absolutely loved the ridiculous theme musics of the supermarkets they played in the background during the supermarket scenes (and thank you subbers for remembering to sub them), but otherwise music and sounds wasn't anything I really paid much attention to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: \\n\r\nIn a world where I didn't enjoy stupid and random shit as much as I do, Ben-To wouldn't be worth an 8. It is definately not an anime for everyone and even in between the people who do enjoy weird stuff, it might not be a fit for everyone. Overall I enjoyed the show, it had enough action to keep you interested and the jokes weren't 'cheap' either. I liked how overly dramatic they made fighting for a packed lunch could look like and in a way I could relate to it as a poor student myself (but no, I don't go around punching people when I'm seeking for chicken for sale). It's very likely that after few first episodes you've already made up your mind whether the show is good or bad, and you should trust it. The show won't be getting dramatic changes later on but it stays interesting to those who enjoyed it to start with.",

            "content": "I found this on some of the \"anime that surprised us\" lists.\r\nAfter seeing cover art and few screenshots I was very sure I\"m about to see another fanservice ecchi harem anime (but hey, I like to Love Ru, so why not?). I was very surprised to find something very different.\r\nThe main issue is that this anime tries to be too many things at once. Some of those \"things\" are mediocre or even bad, but other scenes are brilliant.\r\nThe Bad:\r\n1. The main heroine is a walking anime stereotype. Lightly colored short-haired girl with red eyes something half-way between kuudere and a \"strong girl\" archetype. I couldswear she reminds me of at least seven different characters, but the problem is I can't tell who exactly. She reminds me of Yakumo from \"School Rumble\", Nozomi from Kanokon, and even transformed Moka Akashiya from Rosaria to Vampire along with army of other white haired red eyed characters I saw elsewhere. having said that, occasionally heroine snaps out of it, and starts interacting with others in interesting way, but her personality is barely displayed.\\n\r\n2. Attempts at fanservice. Main character occasionally starts having some sort of sexy delusions (meaning he misheards something and starts imagining stuff, like a girl suddenly being into him for no reason), and occasionally anime attempts fanservice. Now, I don't mind fanservice (as I said, I liked To Love Ru), but here it looks like those scenes were written by someone completely clueless. It isn't cringe-worthy, it looks VERY awkward most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\n1. Shirayume. She is a side character, but for some reason she absolutely shines in the series, and is present in most of the amazing scenes. On some occasions her presence creates some sort of bizzare or even surreal atmosphere, and some of those scenes in the beginning effortlessly match top moments of titles like azumanga or yuyushiki. There aren't a lot of them, unfortunately.\\n\r\n2. Comedy. Occasionally characters start just talking to each other, and it clicks and starts looking amazing, becomes interesting to watch and is geniuenily entertaining and even funny. Those interesting dialogues happen once per two or three episodes, meaning frequently enough.\\n\r\n3. Main character is not a wimp, while he's at school age, the story doesn't feel like it is revolving around school (classroom is rarely portrayed, and there is n't even one \"kirits' ... rei!\" scene), and the anime avoids the situation when \"all girls fall in love with main character for no reason whatseover\". This doesn't happen. Interactions between characters feel believable enough, even though a lot of characters are cliched.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, quality of the series jump all over the place, from mediocriicty to brilliance. There are were moments that made the whole season worth watching, although final episode was a bit of a letdown for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow... MORE details below.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe premise is quite ridiculous (people fighitng over half-priced bentoes in some sort of a fight club), but it is mostly used as an excuse to start character interactions. I.e. there is a story, but the structure is similar to yuyushiki - meaning characters doing things. There's an overarching story to all this (meaning things happen in order), but it is not that important and is not heavily emphasized.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is slightly above average. It is not a cookie cutter designs, like in, say. \"Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei\", but amount of details is a bit low. Not bad, but nothing outstanidng.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSome nice music here, but nothing incredibly memorable to the point where it would take your breath away. It complements atmosphere very well, but doesn't capture your heart and you won't remember it once the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are a lot of cliched characters in the series. However, during its moments of brilliance anime break some of the cliches rather creatively. Shirayume is definitely the most memorable character in the series, with her bizzare behavior, and main male protagonist does a great job not devolving into \"wimp\" stereotype. Characters don't evolve much, but their interactions are often enjoyable, funny and don't feel awkward or forced. Relationship of the two main characters looks believable, and even somewhat sweet.... although main character's \"delusions\" feel off and awkward. Main female character is a quite flawed (which is outlined), but in the moments when she snaps out of it, she becomes quite believable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It wasn't a \"harem ecchi comedy\" I expected, but it was unexpected and entertaining. It could've been better, for example, if its attempts at fanservice/ecchi weren't so awkward.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend watching it. The quality of the story is all over the place, but overall it is good, and moments of brilliance are definitely worth seeing.\\n",

            "content": "Times are hard, and in these days of global economic crisis and recession more and more people have joined the hunt to find the best bargains. As with anything in life though, experience is what counts, and veterans in the ways of saving money will usually have the upper hand in the war of the aisles. While there are a few young hotshots who have a natural talent for finding a store's bargain products, the truth is that wherever there are discounted groceries, there will undoubtedly be kings and queens who rule over them.\r\nNow it may sound as though that whole paragraph is nothing morethan a flowery representation of Ben-Tou, Asuara's light novel series (and its anime and manga adaptations), about Satou You, a highschool student who unwittingly becomes embroiled in an all-out brawl between people wanting half-price ready meals, but that's actually incorrect. Surprisingly, it's more akin to the reality of discount shopping than most people think, but while there's generally a lot of shoving, actual combat is ... uncommon.\\n\\n\r\nBen-Tou has a relatively simple storyline that isn't encumbered with complex philosophical questions or existential uncertainties. The plot is straightforward, but very typically shounen in its repetitiveness and predictability, which may explain why there are attempts towards the end of the series to add a layer of depth to the narrative. Unfortunately it doesn't really work as the show spends too much time trying to be funny, justifying all out brawls in grocery stores (which never seem to attract the attention of the police), and servicing hormone crazed teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad thing is that Ben-Tou has potential as a concept, but when it comes to execution the author, and then everyone else, seem to have left their artistic sensibilities by the wayside. There are some genuinely good flashes of inspiration in the narrative that come about because of the fact that each territory is \"ruled\" by the strongest fighter (or \"wolf\"), in that area. Sadly these sparks of inspiration never really amount to anything, and the anime becomes little more than a parade of characters, brawls, inane comedy and pointless fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is supposed to be an action anime, one would assume that the emphasis would be on making the combat scenes look good, but unfortunately that isn't the case. The characters are decent enough, but the reliance on stereotypes can make some viewers think that the designers lacked imagination. In addition to that, the settings for many of the show's fight scenes are grocery stores, so it's remarkable that the post-battle shop floors remain unscathed. The animation quality is fairly reasonable, but it's not up to the standard that David Production are capable of (they made Tatakau Shisho: The Book of Bantorra), and the series can sometimes look like a rush job (which may explain the unusual postures and the odd jumps and glitches).\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence features the song \"Live for Life: \u014ckamitachi no Yoru\" by Manami, an upbeat rock song set against a backdrop of character introductions, action and fanservice that make a surprisingly accurate presentation of the show's content. There's also an additional introduction for episode four that focuses on Shaga Ayame while \"Treasure\" by Kato Emiri plays out in the background. The melodic ballad used for the ending theme, \"Egao no Housoku\" by Ise Mariya, serves as a nice counterpoint to each episode, and the rather placid sequence fits well with the idea that it's a post-battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the music, although the series is well served in the variety of pieces on offer, the usage of particular tracks can seem a little repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nBen-Tou likes to wear its shounen heart on its sleeve, so the dialogue is filled with juvenile sentiment and lots of shouting. Like almost every other action/harem/comedy/fanservice anime out there, the script is a little too reliant on familiarity with the genre, but within that there are a few decent little deviations from the norm (mainly about fighting for discounted food). Unfortunately the acting is pretty much what one would expect from this type of show - lots of effort and not much actual skill, but maybe that's to be expected. The four leads have little experience with serious roles, which isn't an indictment of their abilities, but rather an observation about the anime industry's propensity for churning out mediocre titles that cater to the minority of fans.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, stop wasting talent. It's too hard to come by.\\n\\n\r\nIn true shounen fashion the characters are about as one-dimensional as they come, and there's very little in the way of refinement throughout the series. That said, the main focus of the story isn't to develop each person, but rather to put them in situations where the warrior mentality can be prominently displayed. Unfortunately it doesn't work out that way as Ben-Tou is a veritable who's who of stereotypes, and pretty much every trait and personality associated with genre are on display, especially the wishy-washy lead male - Satou You. The problem is that viewers may become too familiar with a character's behaviour outside of combat, so watching them fight can often raise several questions, the main one being why does someone who is supposedly capable keep getting slapped around by Shiraume Ume.\\n\\n\r\nLike many harem lead males, Satou You seems to be a bit of a masochist.\\n\\n\r\nAs a concept, Ben-Tou has some merit, but somewhere along the way a decision was made to try and appeal to a specific fanbase, and that's what ultimately lets the show down. The addition of multiple love-interests, inane comedy, innuendo and fanservice seem tacky at best, and can often feel more like hasty additions to the plot. Although there is some entertainment value in the series, this is mainly due to the fact that audiences can watch this as though it was a half-decent action movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is that Ben-Tou could have held up a mirror to the real-life tribulations of discount shopping, but sadly the show fails to realise its potential because it tries too hard to jump on the harem/comedy bandwagon, and this gets in the way of it being a true parody.",

            "content": "Ben-To is philosophy. Ben-To is art. Ben-To is everything, but bad for your health.\r\nHow does a show deliver such greatness that cannot be matched by other action shows? The answer is simple: Ben-To knows its place as an over-the-top parody work. Most shows suffer from being blatant copies of each other and turn bland by the time the second episode pops up. However, every single episode of Ben-To is simmered, well-roasted, and served with refreshments.\r\nThe show\u2019s main appeal is its dramatic fighting sequences and Production David does well. Do not fear the \u201cabsurd\u201d premise. In shopping malls, it is a well-known fact that discounted goodsare pretty much fought over; Ben-To just takes it into account and increases the fighting factor. The ridiculous over-the-top action scenes are rendered and always intense; not even a typical pool episode can hinder the awesomeness of punching people\u2019s stomachs for the sake of an unagi don bento. Speed lines are used graciously and the action can be seen easily due to the presentation it is drawn, the OP being a great example.\\n\\n\r\nDo not also be let down by the huge amount of cliches and archetypes; this is a parody of action shows. You have the Rei Ayanami clone, the perverted ordinary high school student, a perverted girl, and more. However, what Ben-To does is something spectacular: it plays with the tropes and archetypes and puts it into the most awesome setting of all, a supermarket. There is a lot of interesting twists into an archetype, trope, and setting that is admirable in creative standards; it is very rare to see a work so understanding and playful of its tropes and Ben-To does it well.\\n\\n\r\nYet, this work is tainted by the huge amount of fanservice. Most of the characters are females with noticeable cleavage and this can be distracting and sexist to many. I have trouble liking Oshiroi\u2019s character sometimes as all she does is make sexual innuendos. It is problematic that the action clashes with the fanservice in many times.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs are beautifully animated and highlight the show\u2019s distinctive features. \"Live for Life\" is a catchy, irresistible theme song that I hum every time I remember Ben-To. The background music is pretty wacky and cool at times, showing the effort done in the sound department. All of the seiyuus sound about right, though there isn\u2019t anyone who did a spectacular job.\\n\\n\r\nThe reasons that you may not watch this show become the reason you will watch the show. Its ingredient list can be skeptical at first, but it is godly. The show is more addictive than Dr. Pepper and tastier than Kettle potato chips.\\n\\n\r\nWhy are you waiting in line at the restaurant? Go to your nearest supermarket today and grab a bento.\\n\\n\r\nItadakimasu!",

XD and I like how these is a whole system of ranks and special names for the top fighters.(Great 9)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art isn't \"OMG look at the animacion\" but ain't bad either,all the characters faces and eyes are in the right places,you can't complain about it becuase it's better then average with all these lazy animators nowadays,it looks good in high quality on the TV.(Great 9)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is cool while the ending song is a nice slow one and the backgorund music when there fighting is a up beat song that is just the right one for the mood of the anime.(Great 9)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe reason I picked up this anime was because one of the main girl characters Sen Yarizui(aka the Ice witch) caught my eye and that rarely happerns with me,she's cute and unique looking and I also liked the look of Yuu Kaneshiro(the wizard),so far there isn't a character I don't like.(Outstanding 10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't even understand why I enjoy this anime so much but I can't help smiling and getting exicted rooting for the characters! Very very funny and I don't get bored at all witch is something to say for me.(Outstanding 10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nVery enjoyable :D (9 Great)\\n\\n\r\nAdd this to you MAL list now and don't miss out on the laughter and enjoyment of this anime!

            "content": "It's like Fight Club with Lunchables.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nBut there isn't a whole lot to spoil here.  When I first saw this series on the coming-season chart, I laughed at the ridiculous premise.  Just read the description!  Teams of high school students fighting over discounted groceries, all while following some sort of highly regarded honor code?  \"This show has to be absolutely mindless,\" I thought.  It is.  But that's okay, because Ben-To is completely self-aware.  It knows you didn't come here for the plot.  You came to be entertained.  And you shall beentertained.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, the story is an absolute trainwreck.  To put it briefly, at certain time in a certain convenience store, a special sticker is placed on food to mark it as discounted.  Logically, there are dozens of people, waiting like vultures, to swoop in and beat each other senseless to save a few yen (sounds a bit like Black Friday, but I digress).  There are leaders in these battles, such as Sen \"Ice Witch\" Yarizui, the president of the \"Half-Price Food Lover's Club\" that You Satou, the MC, happens to join.  These leaders battle it out, claiming the sticker as a  trophy of their victory. Those who fight with honor and abide by the rules of bento brawling are given the title of \"Wolves.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is about as bad as a story can get.  The reason it gets an \"average\" 5 is because it is able to build a complex system around this idiotic premise, a system which happens to be interesting and funny at the same time.  The customs, titles, everything about it has been thought out to an unnecessary level of detail.  Really, this is as much a comedy as it is an action series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBen-to is surprisingly well animated.  The fight scenes are choreographed well, and there is a large variety of character models which each get their own style.  There is a significant amount of blatant fanservice, if you're into that kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has a pretty bad sound track consisting of several background convenience store songs and corny action music.  I have no complaints about the voice cast.  I don't put much weight into this category anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like cheeesy, over the top characters, you came to the right place.  While the main character resembles Harem Protagonist #652, nearly every other character is highly entertaining (if shallow).  You have the cold, calculating Ice Queen, the formidable \"Kyou\" sisters, the incredibly violent lesbian Ume who is constantly after Hana, who only joined the Half-Price Food Lover's Club because she wanted material for her yaoi muscleman fanfics.  Lastly we have Shaga, who is one of the main fanservice magnets, and while the other girls were by no means left constantly covered, I felt she was the main source of the series' tissue material.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLet me compare Ben-to to junk food.  It's bad for you, has no real value, and you know deep down you shouldn't like it.  However, that never stopped me from loving every bite of this anime.  If you can sit down and turn off your brain for a bit, I promise it will leave a smile on your drooling, vegetative face.\\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nMy brain is too numb for thoughts, but I will leave you with a quote.  \"To the winners go glory and half-priced bento! \u2014 Ayame Shaga\"\\n",

            "content": "The Ice Witch,the Beauty by the Lake...These nicknames at the start of opening theme along with the upbeat song itself got me quite interested.The name was awkward in itsellf but what the anime turned out to be didn't make me regret watching it.The story is quirky enough to amaze you and at times it becomes hilarious.On the other hand,it puts forward a story that you can relate to,something that is relevant morally,an idealistic view-that you have to fight for your own food to aquire it and in that way,you can realiseits true flavour and worth.Bento has a central theme-food is precious and we should realise its worth and not just mindlessly eat it but appreciate the effort of so many other people that has gone into bringing it to us finally.Thus,the meals that we eat everyday shouldn't be taken for granted but rather treated as a precious commodity.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with us being introduced to an ever-lazy protagonist Satou who does as much as he absolutely has to everyday.On a certain high-school night,when he goes to the supermarket to buy some cheap food suiting his limited allowance,that he first witnesses and gets dragged into a Bento fight and gets beat up awfully by an unknown girl who later turns out to be a senior at the same high-school as his and is the famed Western Wolf,'The Ice Witch'.\\n\\n\r\nHungry and testosterone-fuelled youngsters who fight it out with all their might to get their hands on the exclusive half-priced bentos that are made available in the supermarkets after a certain fixed time at night is what the anime is about.But it not only the food that they are after but also Honour.Warriors of such kind aquire 'nom de guerres',i.e,Honorary titles that are given to those fighters of the Wolf grade.The beauty of the nom de guerre concept is quite fulfilling.The titles of the characters build up an atmosphere of excitement.Then there are pigs,dogs,boars and other types of fighters depending on their style of fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle-sequences are very good and smooth and you can feel the quality of animation at its best.They are very enjoyable and relatable.The music that plays in the background when battles happen gets you all fired up with its upbeatness and techno-beats.\\n\r\nThe greatest merit of Ben-to is that it manages to merge humour and seriousness seamlessly.All that packed in a mere 12 episode series.Saito gets renowned as 'The Freak',his honourary warrior's title.Situations lead him to earn his fame as the perverted freak.How he gets tangled in unwanted dire problematic situations which always seems to end with him being further recognized as a pervert is hilarious to watch. Two scenes are worth a mention-The swimming pool incident where Saito shows his,umm..,Radar to the public and the one where the Kyo sister mistakes him as the Ice witch in the hospital and makes her confession.They certainly should have you in splits.And there are other moments that have you laughing heartily too.\\n\\n\r\nEcchi,you get it in good amount keeping in mind that its such a short series.Yuri abounds and is proclaimed by Shiraume,the student council president.God,such a dominating nature she has that not even Shaga,a.k.a,The Beauty by the Lake can avoid her sexy 'naked-in-the-bathtub' attack.She gets to know Shaga intimately in the bathtub and her bare-it-all moments with Oshoroi,her love,is tiltillating to the extreme.But all of this adds to the 'Wow!' factor.Assuredly,you won't forget Shiraume and her escapades anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe serious parts are not compromised though.The history of Orthros,the Wolf duo,is quite deep.The sheer ignorance and seclusion from society they were made to face just because they were to strong to win against strikes deeply in the heart.It portrays that when you attain great power,you become more the lonely.Sato lives up to expectations as he plays the befitting wolf with magnanimous pride in the end.He's not something exceptional but he does his job of a protagonist nicely.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are some cons too.The Wizard could have been given more screen space and some greater role to play.In the end,despite being the West's strongest wolf,he ends up feeling insignificant as he leaves the country for studying abroad.Beardy,Brunette and Monk could have been more associative with the Ice witch and gang but perhaps they were purposedly kept as the loyal friends and fight-buddies.Hercules Combo turns out to be a manipulating wimp which disappoints slightly considering the terror he brought about at first.\\n\r\nBut all these are very minor things and not exactly flaws when you weigh them against the merits of the anime.So,in the end,not much remains to disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nOrthros' unique combat style is one cool thing to watch.The God of Discounts idea is quirky but fun.The battle sequences are of quality and the friendship factor is well-fitting.You get comedy,you get some lovely ladies baring it all,action,and quirkiness.So,conclusively,Ben-to is a good light-hearted watch which can make your day.If you have pride,if you have honour,leave your thoughts aside and join in the fight with the wolves.Ben-to may not sparkle with class,but with its glamour and glitz,it sure does leave a lasting impression.\\n",

            "content": "I expected Ben-To to be a generic harem anime about how the main character uses bentos to makes girls fall in love with him. (Ok, that might not be generic, but still, I expected something along those lines) Thankfully, I was wrong, or else I would've dropped it right at the spot. Ben-To is an anime that I never expected to enjoy so much, yet I did because of the good comedy, awesome action, unique characters, and, most of all, the shock factor that it both revolves around food, and they're literally risking getting beat up for that food!!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nBasically, Sato Yo went to geta half-priced bento one day, but then he got beaten up and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he has no memory of what happened in the supermarket. A girl then warns him (Sen Yarizui, AKA the ice witch) never to go to the supermarket again. However, Sato goes again with his friend, Oshiroi Hana, and gets beat up again. Yarizui then invites them to the Half Priced Food Lovers Club, where she teaches them all about being a \"wolf\" (figher for half-priced bentoes)\\n\r\nThe story is very comedic, with Sato getting embarrassed and the fights full of action-packed battles. The characters have their own special names, which the \"wolves\" refer to by. Then, there are \"boars,\" \"wolves pride\" and \"rulers of the east and west\".  This turns the plot into a great story, basically talking about how much fighting for bentos mean to them. It's surprisingly deep, for an anime about food. I'm also surprised how there are rankings, and how they use everyday supermarket items as weapons. Overall, a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nStandard anime art. It's colorful, but the art style has been used a lot of times. Not good, yet not bad, either. Looks good, scenes are animated great. There really is nothing else to say besides that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe seiyuu did a great job, doing voices that fit the characters perfectly. The BGM was good, but aside from the battle scenes it's pretty average. The OP is upbeat, which fits a series like this one. The ending was not bad, but the song didn't really fit the series, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the categories where it truly shines. Character design and seiyuu fits the character's respective personality, and everyone had a colorful and unique personality, which blends into the overall story and humor. I also got attached to some of them, like Orthrus and Ice Witch.  Everyone was great, and I found the characters to be very enjoyable with their interaction with each other. Only downside is that there's barely any character development, but I didn't really expect it to cover every character's backstory in a mere 12 episodes, or even 3-4 characters.  Still, it didn't hinder the experience for me and the characters are fun to watch even though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and laughed. I also couldn't believe how deep this anime was, and how an anime about FOOD would be one of my most favorite in this season.  The action scenes were cool, and the story was unbelievable. This all adds to the experience, however.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you like comedy, action, and totally unbelievable concept in one anime, look no further. This isn't your generic ecchi, action, or comedy. This is a whole other experience, an experience I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy.",

            "content": "Ben-to is a good example of a show with a lot of potential for a rule-of-cool anime with a lot of dumb over-the-top action sequences but ultimately fails in regards to lack of any interesting characters to root for while having, in what I believe, to be sub-par fighting choreography and animation. I honestly really wanted to like this show, I really did, but the lack of any fun characters or engagement dragged on through each and every episode as the anime tries its hardest to be silly and over-the-top  without carrying over the same charm it had in the beginning. It feels likeit wants to be over-the-top but suffers from serious tone problems which don't integrate all too well with the silly premise and story they throw us into. Allow me to elaborate:\\n\\n\r\nBen-to is a show in which people battle it out for the tastiest and the best bento boxes in numerous department stores around the city. Each part of the city is governed by a different gang and turf and the such with many people having unique nicknames based around their fighting styles and personality traits. I'd argue that one of the most interesting things about this show was precisely that - I found all of this to be incredibly fun and interesting in a stupid way. We learn that there are several customs and honours that each ben-to fighter must abide by and each character takes the art of beating the everlasting hell out of each so seriously it's comical in that sense. The insane rumours these fighters conjured up about special people, the insane nicknames given and the general stupidity of each turf war having their own insane laws and the such was a fun and dumb idea and this works very well for the first few episodes or so as we see our main character who learns the joy of beating the crap out of someone just for some cheaper ben-to.\\n\\n\r\nBut, while this idea does set-up a lot of possibilities into what is possible and how insane you can go with this idea, the anime suffers from two problems which I feel hold it back. The first being, as I've said, a lack of interesting characters to care for, all of which are annoying mind you, but the show's gimmick begins to wear off really quickly as they don't really do too much with this concept. Sure, there are new fighters that join which add some more history and depth about this strange fighting festival that takes place but as we travel along the show, the cool and over-the-top fights seem to take a back seat to boring character backstories which are equally generic as they're uninteresting. That's not to say that the anime doesn't have some cool looking fight scenes, it's just that many-a-time I found myself bored with the character interactions and a few times I felt kind of disappointed with a fight that had been building up for a while and had no payoff as we suddenly skip past it removing all of the dramatic tensions of the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime suffers from the same problem I believe the currently airing Keijo does; the gimmick is so stupid at first that it's fun when you first start but the lack of interesting characters begins to drain on you the more you watch and by the end, the novelty has worn off entirely. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this show is the comedy and the characters that go along with it. The main lead is kind of forgetful, as they typically are for these types of shows, and doesn't really do anything all too interesting.  He develops a passion for ben-to fighting but doesn't feel like he changes throughout the story, aside from gaining some random strength despite no training and no experience in the art of fighting. Hana was a character simply defined for her love for BL, frequently writing stories involving our main character. She also has an insane lesbian stalker named Ume Shiraume who is the biggest bitch I've ever seen. She frequently beats down on the main character for no reason for the most mundane things. I expect the creators wished for me to laugh at this but all I kept wondering was why this guy kept receiving the horrible treatment that he does. He is hit, slapped and has hit clothes torn off numerous times which all felt completely unjustified as he had never done anything to warrant this treatment.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, all of the characters treated him in this fashion and it just comes across as mean-spirited. As an audience, we enjoy seeing a character receive karma for something mean they've done and it feels satisfying as a result, but here, all it does is make me feel as if the characters are horrible people. There was one scene in which one of the characters threw out the guy's game console for no reason and upon attempting to rescue said console, ends up hurting himself and ends up in the hospital. Granted she does show some remorse, but not before putting him threw more agony for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other two characters worth mentioning is the annoying blond lead, mainly defined for her tits and the white-haired girl, only defined by her quietness. All of the characters in this show are all caricatures of anime stereotypes and none of them are unique enough to break away from this mould. When the show clearly wants us to root for one of these characters, I find it generally hard to do so as I found them all so uninteresting making the scenes in which the narrative stakes are high (as high as you can possibly get while fighting for products on Black Friday anyway) feel weak and kind of dull. As the anime ran on, this problem only got worse. To be fair, there is an attempt at character development and intrigue in regards to the Kyou sisters but it's kind of integrated half haphazardly into the plot without having too much time to fully develop. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was generally appealing to the eyes and the character design as well as the colour design was pretty spot on. While in motion, the animation did suffer from some animation error and at times it could look kind of jarring but nothing to take me out of any scenes. The music was pretty forgetful as a whole with the exception of the opening theme which is catchy as hell. The main thing with Ben-to is that it feels as if it wants to be silly and the over-the-top but it never gets to that stage and instead feels kind of lukewarm which makes the anime feel kind of forgetful. Ben-to is not the worst series in the world but it does leave a lot to be desired which is unfortunate considering how fun the show could of been if the characters were more likeable and if it were more over-the-top.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The end of this 12 episode anime has been aired, now we look forward to next' season's anime with similar twist than this, nuff said, so..............Hummmmmmmmm, If one is to look at this 12 episode anime the 1st thing that would come to mind is \"BLACK FRIDAY,\" yes it's a day after memorial day in the US where a few overruns would be sold on a special discount and surly chaos follows when every last customer would duke out for it. In this anime's case, this is something where the author takes of something that happens in real life and make it really reallyelaborate. This 12 episode anime's genre which is action, comedy and martial arts did played up to it in fact everything in this anime is about those 3 said genres. So for the story I'll give it a \"Fair\" number 6, since there is no plot in it and everything is focus on a few pieces of discounted TV dinners- which by the way is called \"Bento\" in Japan but the entertaining part is when  all hell breaks lose for a pack of rabid wolves out to get a cheap meal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask, I always rate it like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the female sieyus who did the voices of the main female casts, I  like that the voice of Satou is the same sieyu who also voiced Aki from \"Baka to test,\" co'z it really does play well as a moron for the said character, I like the opening theme, but I hate the closing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way the characters are compared to that of a canine hierarchy, since that's what the author projects them otherwise they won't be called \"Wolves.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo who are they:\\n\\n\r\nOshiroi Hana- In the opening she called \"The Muscle Cop,\" but actually she a blogger with a steady stream of fans, by canine standards she's a wimpy fox,  just like one she follows the pack ( in this case it is the members of the half price food lovers  club) but stays in the shadows and takes advantage of the chaos to silently steal some of the prize (referring to the bento)   , I kinda hate it when she makes no effort to resist Shiraume Ume's sexual advances, either she enjoys it or she can't. \\n\\n\r\nSatou You- Somewhere in the mid part of the 12 episode anime he was given the moniker \"Hentai,\" I hate it when his character is a dichotomy that's because he's willing to duke out with his cousin Ayame during bento brawls but is chicken to duke out with Ume . By canine reference he's a mongrel, in the 12th episode, it is establish that he has feelings for Sen. Then again, one might say that the comedy genre is him. \\n\\n\r\nYarizui Sen- one of the top wolves in the bento brawling business, who goes by the moniker \"Ice Witch\" which is taken from some popular sports drink, she the president of the Half Price Food Lovers Club and she only has 2 members, one is a mongrel (Satou) and another a wimpy fox (Hana). I kinda like that she contributes a lot to the Martial Art genre of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nChapatsu- I like the way her body is drawn and also being in a bento brawl as well, but I will never understand as to why the author of this anime only focuses on her body, but has forgotten to give this hot character a face.\\n\\n\r\nShaga Ayame- Well, I like it that she severs as a fine fanservice of in this anime, since the way she's drawn really makes her hot. l like it that her role is that of a former Gabrielle Ratchet gang, goes by the moniker \"Beauty by the Lake,\" since this anime has a small harem element in it, she kinda fills the void of a sister with a brother complex with Satou, actually they're cousin who attend different schools. She one unusual bento brawler co'z she uses chopsticks as her weapon, which is kinda lame for a white wolf like her.\\n\\n\r\nSawagi Kyo sisters- both are members of the student council from Ayame's school, both came from a well off family, whom are into bento brawling for fun and it is nice that they are added since this anime won't be complete without a rich girl (or girls) who is bored and is looking for some action kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nShiraume Ume- a student council president from Satou's school, who has hots for Hana and has rage for Satou, her beating up the poor muchacho (satou) more like adds to someone who is a unlikeable character in this anime.he also some one whom I wish that the Ice Witch would duke out with. By canine standards she can be considered a Guard Dog since she's very possessive of Hana and the muchacho happens to be her attack dummy. Like Ayame, she also provides some fanservice to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, since it is the chiquitas who are the main focus of the action genre, such rating is deserving for them, actually the rating is for the chiquitas (female leads).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime is focus more on the action and martial arts genre than the comedy regardless of how predictable it is. There is no plot here and the story is too simple, for a 12 episode anime like this where everything revolves around scrambling for  few pieces of discounted TV dinners may seems stupid, the elaborate fighting thing that goes with it  is \"Fair\" enough to provide some entertainment.. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe end\\n\\n\r\nTime for my TV dinner were I got it for a 20% discount from the grocer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I didn't mind finishing the anime since its so short so I continued watching.\r\nSome of the characters in the first episodes disappeared and I was hoping to see them again but didn't. I finished the 10th episode and they are still not there.Only 2 characters but it doesn't matter that much.\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend that you watch the 1st and 2nd episodes. After that you will get into it. If you're not going to watch it then your really missing some GREAT COMEDY.",

            "content": "It comes as no surprise when Japan comes up with another one of their crazy concoctions. Their creation this time is Ben-To - the anime where half-priced bento are serious business and risking one's life for one is the norm. With an idea as crazy as that, it's no wonder there are so many skeptics out there questioning the entertainment value of Ben-To and its ability to compete with the other shows airing in the same season. While a new idea does have its advantages (e.g. viewers are likely to be more curious), there are also disadvantages that follow (e.g. not applying the logic ofsafety). Now, let's see how Ben-To fared. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nWhile the typical mecha fight boasts giant lasers and flashy machine guns, the brawls in Ben-To only involve human beings and their two weapons: their hands and feet. Thus, it may seem hard for an entertaining fight to make its way into the show. However, I was surprised at how wrong I was after seeing the first few fights in Ben-To. Not only were they exciting to watch, they were also animated well. The movements of the characters may have been a bit choppy but I considered that to be acceptable since humans are not like well-oiled machines - our movements are not perfectly smooth. The other artwork, including the characters, was also decent and easy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nThe entire show essentially focuses on the main protagonist, Satou Y\u014d, and how he grows from being a grovelling loser (a Dog) to an elite fighter (a Wolf), when it came to bento battles. Throughout the series, you see him slowly grasp the ideas of these battles and learn about the honor and respect that comes with being a Wolf. In the beginning he is depicted as an ignorant and stubborn high school boy who is running low on money for food. But as time goes on, his transformation is evident and, in the end, he becomes arguably the strongest and most respected fighter in the town. The visible growth and excellent development of this one boy already makes the entire series worth watching, though I would've liked to see more development for the other characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nFirstly, I found the OP to be very fitting as it was upbeat and full of energy, easily helping one to get into the spirit of watching some bento battles. The ED, on the other hand, was softer and more mellow, which I found was a nice way to end each episode. The BGM was very good and quite memorable, especially the music played at each of the supermarkets. Voice acting, like the other aspects of this category, was also great. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first read the synopsis for this anime, I asked myself, \"Will this kind of story even be interesting?\" After completing Ben-To, I can definitely answer myself and say that \"Yes, it was definitely interesting.\" I went into the show not knowing what to expect and I think that's best way to go. Ridding yourself of doubts and expectations, and becoming open to this new and crazy idea will definitely maximize your enjoyment. To be honest, the whole story is unrealistic. But, think about it, this is the world of anime - not everything has to be believable. When you forget about everything and just watch the show by itself, chances are, you'll enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nBen-To has gone where no other anime has gone before - and it has paid off. Overall, I felt it was a successful series. I, for one, would like a season two as I thought the ending was open-ended. I recommend Ben-To to anyone looking for a action-packed comedy series with a touch of fanservice; you definitely won't be disappointed. So what are you waiting for? Grab some bento to eat while you watch Ben-To!",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong -- I wasn't going into Ben-To expecting a masterpiece. But based on other reviews I was expecting it to be a comedy. I mean, it is, to some extent. The premise is entirely absurd, and the show is very self-aware, so there is something comedic to the whole thing in that sense. But I thought there would be actual ha-ha-ha, laugh-out-loud funny gags in it; there weren't.\r\nWell, OK, to be fair, there is *ONE* scene in episode 8 -- BOKU NO SATURN!!!!!! -- that actually made me chuckle, but by and large I spent the entire series waiting for the showto get funny and it never did. None of the characters lean quite far enough into their tropes for it to be parody, so everything mostly falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some not-bad fight scenes (episode 10 comes to mind) and some bento descriptions that did make my mouth water, but really nothing to take note of. I'm not even sure I would classify it as mindless entertainment at this point. I didn't really hate it and I wasn't really super bored, so I'm not gonna say it was bad, but I think there's plenty of other anime I would rank above Ben-To as far as mindless entertainment or stupid comedy goes. I recommend skipping it unless you're really into the character design. \\n",

I found the former to be more accurate. Ben-To (no relation to Ben 10) is a show about the average self-insert harem MC who does a fight to the death in grocery stores for lunches on sale.\r\nThe characters in the show were the typical TVTropes harem girls, so just google tsundere, shrinking violet, etc. and that should give you agood idea of how this show's characters act and develop (I'm not sure if they actually develop, I watch a lot of harems so I usually start phasing out halfway if they're not good). I don't remember very much about the main character at all, probably because he's not even the nice guy stereotype, he's just this character without any personality who's basically told to do everything he does by other people. It's not even in the deep or philosophical way like in Punpun, it's as if the voice actor felt like he wasn't getting paid enough so he just stopped saying his lines.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's opening song was pretty decent though, it's one of the few things I remember from this series. The art and character design of the show was pretty good too, I mean it did make me want to jerk off to the characters so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest part of the show though was it's deep philosophical nature, using high school students to represent kids from Africa fighting over grains of rice so that they can get something to eat, and the various gangs who represented the military forces that forced the kids to risk their lives, fight for, and mine (buy) blood diamonds (bento).\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't watch this.",

I have generally been content to stick with things like Fullmetal Alchemist, Kekkaishi, Soul Eater, etc., shows that are funny but don't go all out. However, The Devil Is A Part Timer was absolute genius, so it encouraged me to try another comedy.\r\nHow does Ben-to stack up? Eh, this is a little more what I pictured a comedy anime to be like. However, it gets a solid \"good\" from me. It is not nearly the comedic gargantuan that The Devil Is A Part-Timer is, but its serviceable. \r\nLike a lot of anime comedic themes, one of themost endearing aspects of Ben-to is how earnest it all is. Beating the tar out of people to get a bento at half price is clearly something that the characters take very seriously. Austin Tindle and Trina Nishimura both deserve praise for their work here.\\n\r\nHowever, the amount of base sexual perversion in the show is somewhat unsettling. Never have I seen textbook cases of sexual harassment (both male and female) played for laughs like this. Some of it is funny, but there is waaaay too much of it. Maybe it's the language gap, but Ben-to didn't really excel. It's good, I guess.",

The struggle here is a fight between members of the bento with street fighting self defense for those who get a discount that is labeled \"honor\" gained the nickname of wolves while they are merely subordinate and earned the nickname of the discount food fight over the dog. So many conflicts in the anime and the development of the more interesting story.\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nIn terms of story, this anime has the unique power of ideas and made good at exploring the discount, it is in today's all that certain discounts and cheaper it would be a bone of contention even though the rest of the stuff and that's the power of this anime but it's unfortunate that a plot was made impressed imposed proven easy and classic stories, seem boring because there is no social relationships between the characters and the look seemed only a matter of bento in their minds.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is the advantage of this anime, Art presented seems so strong, especially in the bento proved to exist in each episode presented bento is always different and look so delicious when seen, as detailed in drawing food. Not only is it a picture of the character is also very strong in the anime where there is a lot of female characters and everything can be spelled \"Kawai\" Yarizui especially the main character who can make the audience fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt is also a weakness of this anime, the soundtrack is presented not so inspiring and the lack of sound when there is a moment of action characters. However, if the observed soundtrack lyrics are presented to illustrate the story of this anime here the rest is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately the character of this anime, in which the main character in the plot to be Yarizui that figure fails Kudere played and impressed looks like a normal High School girl who likes to talk and look serious when describing the characters who figure Kudere quiet, mysterious and compelling. Not only are there other weakness is apparent lack of chemistry between the characters prove to all the characters seem to walk alone, look Yarizui that only focus on the bento discount regardless of the friends around him, too terobsesu Oshiroi by Satou to be a novel without knowing Satou Satou figures more closely and the appear to struggle alone get a discount bento without any cooperation among members of the club. But the pull of the character here is the development of each character and leads to a strong friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime is less so because there are so many factors \"Impossible\" from the anime where the previously weak Satou suddenly seem so strong and can beat all his enemies, wounds that do not make sense when there is so badly needed at least one week of healing and the worse they think of themselves is an animal who only think of only lust.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nSince I focus on the story, then the value that I think is pretty good for a short anime series and I think there should be no sequel of this anime",

The battle for half priced food has its own rules, supposed to be followed by the participant who refer to themselves as wolves. that's all there is to it.\r\n Anyone who trash this anime because it doesn't have a deep plot, twists and much character developments is retarded. It's only purpose is to entertain you by  comedy,action, a tiny bit of romance and lastly fan service. Before watching an anime, you better set your expectations right so as not to be disappointed. Ben-to is really simple, that's its very nature. if the you hated it because the story is messed up and the events are random, it's not the fucking fault of the creators of the anime but yours for having stupid expectations and by being pretentiously deep.\\n\\n\r\n Regarding enjoyment, it was a really fun anime to watch. The gags hit and the fight scenes are enjoyable to watch as well. About the characters, you will love some of them and you will hate some. The interaction between them are mostly the source of fun in this show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if you exclusively enjoy anime with deep plot and all seriousness, then stay the fuck away, as I said, there's nothing others can do regarding a viewers taste. but if you enjoy the occasional \"don't think about things\" kind of anime, I think you can enjoy Ben-to \\n",

The music was also all over the place\u2014I remember hearingsomething resembling African tribal music as well as Italian opera\u2014but in it\u2019s strange goofy way, it also fit the sort of survival of the fittest, overly dramatic approach these high schoolers take to getting their discount meals.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, our main character, Yo Sato, is that stock male character you see in harem anime\u2014pretty average looking, sort of a weenie, not too unique or memorable; the kind where all the girls have unreasonable crushes on him for no apparent reason. Heck, even his brawler name is \u2018Pervert\u2019. He deviates from the stereotype a little bit--he gets some character development and the girl he likes also likes him back for legitimate reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of the harem are all bento brawlers. \u2018The Ice Witch\u2019, Sen Yarizuri, is one of the strongest fighters around, very stern and detached, mostly because she doesn\u2019t know much else aside from her survival of the fittest wolf mentality. Yo\u2019s cousin, Ayame Shaga, is known as the \u2018Beauty by the Lake\u2019\u2014there\u2019s not really much to her (but she does use chopsticks in battle :D). The last is Hana Oshiroi who nicknames herself \u2018The Muscle Cop.\u2019 She was by far the most enjoyable character in the series; easily excitable and into writing yaoi erotic fiction who wins her bento by sneaking in and taking it while everybody else is brawling. There are other trope-y charcters, including the little moe girl who\u2019s pure evil and the domineering lesbian student body president...\\n\\n\r\nThe show is unabashedly fanservicey. Not really my thing, but I understand why it\u2019s there. It never really got in the way of anything in the show, so I was fine with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did like was the Darwinian theory that sort of plays in and how it does allow for some character development in our lead. He rises from dog to wolf and comes to understand that it\u2019s not just about half priced meals, but it\u2019s about honor and dignity and all that.\\n\\n\r\nI supposed if I could sum up to someone what anime is in a 12 episode anime series, this would be the one I would recommend. It\u2019s got the typical stereotypes, fighting, naked girls, but it was legitimately entertaining and funny and did put it\u2019s spin on it with it\u2019s unique premise.",

            "content": "In a parallel world where half priced Ben-Tos are worth risking your dear life for, Satou 'Pervert' You finds his calling. Ben-To left me positively in awe with it's ridiculousness, it is not an anime you watch for the dramatic accuracy of it's science, nor the unwavering strenght of it's plot. No. It's a solid anime where comedy meets action. A place where supermarket employees are treated as Gods, losers settle for instant noodles and victoriously emerged heroes of war get rewarded with the tasty half priced Ben-Tos. \r\nStory & Characters: \r\nBen-To doesn't strive on exceptional story like many other animes I think well ofnor does it give you a fair share of interesting characters that grow during the show fabulously intertwining with the numerous plot twists. But the synergestic power of the weird setting, the simplistic characters and the 'generic' story fit in together quite well creating a show that is very well worth watching. The characters barely made any development save for few exceptions, but that is not what this show is about nor should you focus on it when watching the show. Obviously you should avoid the show if you're all about the story and character development but the comedic value of this show was high. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nThe art in the show was mediocre yet very fitting in a sense that the show wasn't likely even trying to be overly beautiful nor exceptionally accurate in it's portrayal of the show. The fanservice IS there time to time, but it wasn't really overly annoying in my opinion except for a few scenes towards the end of the show. I absolutely loved the ridiculous theme musics of the supermarkets they played in the background during the supermarket scenes (and thank you subbers for remembering to sub them), but otherwise music and sounds wasn't anything I really paid much attention to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: \\n\r\nIn a world where I didn't enjoy stupid and random shit as much as I do, Ben-To wouldn't be worth an 8. It is definately not an anime for everyone and even in between the people who do enjoy weird stuff, it might not be a fit for everyone. Overall I enjoyed the show, it had enough action to keep you interested and the jokes weren't 'cheap' either. I liked how overly dramatic they made fighting for a packed lunch could look like and in a way I could relate to it as a poor student myself (but no, I don't go around punching people when I'm seeking for chicken for sale). It's very likely that after few first episodes you've already made up your mind whether the show is good or bad, and you should trust it. The show won't be getting dramatic changes later on but it stays interesting to those who enjoyed it to start with.",

            "content": "I found this on some of the \"anime that surprised us\" lists.\r\nAfter seeing cover art and few screenshots I was very sure I\"m about to see another fanservice ecchi harem anime (but hey, I like to Love Ru, so why not?). I was very surprised to find something very different.\r\nThe main issue is that this anime tries to be too many things at once. Some of those \"things\" are mediocre or even bad, but other scenes are brilliant.\r\nThe Bad:\r\n1. The main heroine is a walking anime stereotype. Lightly colored short-haired girl with red eyes something half-way between kuudere and a \"strong girl\" archetype. I couldswear she reminds me of at least seven different characters, but the problem is I can't tell who exactly. She reminds me of Yakumo from \"School Rumble\", Nozomi from Kanokon, and even transformed Moka Akashiya from Rosaria to Vampire along with army of other white haired red eyed characters I saw elsewhere. having said that, occasionally heroine snaps out of it, and starts interacting with others in interesting way, but her personality is barely displayed.\\n\r\n2. Attempts at fanservice. Main character occasionally starts having some sort of sexy delusions (meaning he misheards something and starts imagining stuff, like a girl suddenly being into him for no reason), and occasionally anime attempts fanservice. Now, I don't mind fanservice (as I said, I liked To Love Ru), but here it looks like those scenes were written by someone completely clueless. It isn't cringe-worthy, it looks VERY awkward most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\n1. Shirayume. She is a side character, but for some reason she absolutely shines in the series, and is present in most of the amazing scenes. On some occasions her presence creates some sort of bizzare or even surreal atmosphere, and some of those scenes in the beginning effortlessly match top moments of titles like azumanga or yuyushiki. There aren't a lot of them, unfortunately.\\n\r\n2. Comedy. Occasionally characters start just talking to each other, and it clicks and starts looking amazing, becomes interesting to watch and is geniuenily entertaining and even funny. Those interesting dialogues happen once per two or three episodes, meaning frequently enough.\\n\r\n3. Main character is not a wimp, while he's at school age, the story doesn't feel like it is revolving around school (classroom is rarely portrayed, and there is n't even one \"kirits' ... rei!\" scene), and the anime avoids the situation when \"all girls fall in love with main character for no reason whatseover\". This doesn't happen. Interactions between characters feel believable enough, even though a lot of characters are cliched.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, quality of the series jump all over the place, from mediocriicty to brilliance. There are were moments that made the whole season worth watching, although final episode was a bit of a letdown for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow... MORE details below.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe premise is quite ridiculous (people fighitng over half-priced bentoes in some sort of a fight club), but it is mostly used as an excuse to start character interactions. I.e. there is a story, but the structure is similar to yuyushiki - meaning characters doing things. There's an overarching story to all this (meaning things happen in order), but it is not that important and is not heavily emphasized.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is slightly above average. It is not a cookie cutter designs, like in, say. \"Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei\", but amount of details is a bit low. Not bad, but nothing outstanidng.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSome nice music here, but nothing incredibly memorable to the point where it would take your breath away. It complements atmosphere very well, but doesn't capture your heart and you won't remember it once the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are a lot of cliched characters in the series. However, during its moments of brilliance anime break some of the cliches rather creatively. Shirayume is definitely the most memorable character in the series, with her bizzare behavior, and main male protagonist does a great job not devolving into \"wimp\" stereotype. Characters don't evolve much, but their interactions are often enjoyable, funny and don't feel awkward or forced. Relationship of the two main characters looks believable, and even somewhat sweet.... although main character's \"delusions\" feel off and awkward. Main female character is a quite flawed (which is outlined), but in the moments when she snaps out of it, she becomes quite believable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It wasn't a \"harem ecchi comedy\" I expected, but it was unexpected and entertaining. It could've been better, for example, if its attempts at fanservice/ecchi weren't so awkward.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend watching it. The quality of the story is all over the place, but overall it is good, and moments of brilliance are definitely worth seeing.\\n",

He completely loses his memory, but as time passes it comes back, especially whenhe pays a visit to the store again and sees a silver-haired girl who mutters words behind the glass. He doesn't know what's going on and rushes to get... the ultimate prize... half-price bento, but for some reason he blacks out and wakes up in hospital again, and the only way to resolve this is to find that silver-haired girl and ask her what the hell she said. She eventually tells him to stay away from the supermarket, but he refuses to and this time he realises that people have gone mad over the half-price bento and are now battling to the death to try and win it, but has he got a chance, and just who is this silver-haired girl?\\n\\n\r\nWatch the anime and you'll find out!\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n- Art -\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Ben-To is colourful, but it's your every day modern anime art style, but it's still nice to look at, but it's nothing new either. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\n- Sound -\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is pretty damn good and usually fits well with the whole scenario, but the opening is sort of... over the top, but that's not a bad thing, right?\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n- Character -\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Yo Sato is you average guy, but he's determined to get the half-price bento that's on sale, even if it means sacrificing his life. He's a huge fan of SEGA, especially Sonic the Hedgehog.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters including the mysterious silver-haired girl who plays a big role in the story, a shy little girl with glasses and a blonde haired women with glasses are all very colourful characters, but I won't spoil too much for you.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - \\n\\n\r\nThe series is enjoyable, but I seriously don't know how they're going to somehow fit all this in to 12 episodes... I mean... where's the plot? All will be revealed, I guess.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n- Overall -\\n\\n\r\nI like this anime and even though I've only watched one episode, I think it's pretty damn good! Possibly one of the best animes' of the current season, but nowhere near as good as Guilty Crown, Mirai Nikki and Mawaru Penguindrum, but it's still not to be missed, folks!\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving this series an 8/10. It's fresh and unique, but there's a few flaws here and there and I don't know where the plot is going to go, but that doesn't mean I won't enjoy this series. I sure did enjoy the first episode, and I'll edit this review as I go along throughout the series\\n\\n\r\nWill upgrade this as I watch more episodes, but may not need to (much)",

            "content": "The quick review:\r\nSTORY: 7/10 \r\nNot the most original plot, Ben-To actually delivers well using themes such as supermarket, food and hunger as the backbone of the story. \r\nART: 8/10 \r\nThe fighting scenes are definitely a blast to watch. Ecchi elements meaning that female characters are often designed to be well-endowed. \r\nSOUND: 8/10 \r\nPre-battle - the heartwarming, family-friendly supermarket jingle; during-battle - the hot-blooded, fist-pumping rock soundtrack = WIN. \r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10 \r\nSo-so cast of characters but still likeable. The writers did fine to develop the main characters well and flesh out the side characters enough. \r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\r\nBen-To is hilarious, addicting, and highly entertaining to watch. \r\nThelong review:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\r\nDo you remember the time where you were so hungry that you could easily gulp down an entire cow? Do you remember how extra-delicious the food was just because you were THAT hungry?\\n\\n\r\nAnd indeed, hunger is a very powerful motivation that can drive us a desire for food so strong that, we could as well push ourselves beyond our limits to obtain it. \\n\\n\r\nUsing this as the central plot element, Ben-To turns out to have a very easily relatable plot where the viewer can understand well, without the need of scratching one\u2019s head, why the characters in Ben-To are so determined to get the half priced bento. \\n\\n\r\nFighting is how the hungry wolves in Ben-To decide the winner for the half priced bento. I find it awkward at how the characters are never shown to train their brawling skills, yet they can quickly adapt to the deadly battlefield and look perfectly natural in it, as if they are born to fight for bentos. Hmm\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOh, did I forget to mention that in Ben-To, while you got beaten down to a point where you lose consciousness the day before, your wounds heal so fast that you are in tip-top condition to fight again the next day? \\n\\n\r\nThere are additional themes in Ben-To, such as friendship, rivalry and also a little bit of love (maybe) to spice up the plot a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe central theme of Ben-To is easily relatable enough that it\u2019s a solid 7 to me.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nI am really fond with the fighting scenes of Ben-To. They are drawn and animated in detail, and the camera angles are decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are average but fits well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several ecchi scenes so you can expect the female characters to be drawn voluptuously.  \\n\\n\r\nOh and finally, the food! Although they aren't real, they are drawn decently enough that may make your mouth dripping with saliva!\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t find any slip ups in the animation so it will settle with an 8. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nBen-To has a rather\u2026 unique soundtrack. Supermarket jingles play a big role in the soundtrack department and I really like how the producers use them.  Before the bento fight starts, you will listen to the heartwarming, family-friendly supermarket jingle while waiting for the \u201chalf pricing god\u201d to finish pasting the discount stickers onto the delicious bentos. Once he\u2019s done and the rumble begins, a heart-pounding, fist-pumping rock track will be played to signal the change of the overall mood of the show. This alone always got me excited, I must admit.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED of Ben-To are decent songs to listen as well. The rest of the soundtrack are nothing memorable, but functions well to fit into the scenes they are inserted into.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting are fine, although Oshiroi\u2019s voice may annoy me sometimes. \\n\\n\r\n8 points to the sound section!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\r\nThe character cast in Ben-To might be its weakest aspect. You have Satou You, the male protagonist who is clueless at first, but once he got the hang of things, he turned out to be pretty much a stereotyped male lead: determined, never give up, kind, and lots of resolve. Oshiroi is mostly for comic relief with her sexual fantasies with Satou and how she uses him as fan fiction material. Yarizui is your \u201ccool and badass\u201d character in which she isn\u2019t one who speaks a lot but packs a lot of fighting prowess. Finally, you have Ayame who is the boldest among the four and isn\u2019t afraid to use her sexual appeal. \\n\\n\r\nOur 4 main characters do develop somewhat throughout the course of the show. I will not spoil much for you, but you should note the usage of the word \u201csomewhat\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters do enjoy sufficient screen time to flesh themselves out and make themselves memorable enough for the viewers. However, some villains only appear for one part of the show and dissapear soon after. So they might be less memorable to viewers, then. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s decided that this section will earn 6 points.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:  9/10\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the short review above, Ben-To is funny and action-packed enough to keep me entertained every single episode. The plot is good enough to prevent things from getting stale. Also, personally I myself don\u2019t mind a little bit of fanservice here and there as long as it doesn\u2019t steal all the spotlight from the main aspects of the anime. The fighting scenes are good enough to keep myself at the edge of my seat (kudos to the brilliant soundtrack) and make my blood boiling. \\n\\n\r\nOne does not need to take the anime too seriously or else you may fail to grasp the main idea of watching Ben-To. Just relax, let your eyes and stomach do the watching and you will enjoy every single flavour of Ben-To. \\n\\n\r\nBeing highly entertaining and amusing makes this section deserves a healthy 9. \\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts:\\n\r\nFinally, do not expect any superhuman, otherworldly powers from Ben-To. The fights are still, at least to me, human-like. Watch out for the ecchi elements in case they aren\u2019t your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n",

            "content": "Bento now i have to say im one of those people who dont really put to much thought into ratings infact if you look at my list they are all practically 7+ so i wouldnt pay to much mind to my ratings of this anime either but lets get to the actual explaining :P\r\nNow the story, first of all i thought \"oh a fight over bento's? eh sounds lame\" but once you really get into it and once they start explaining the rules, the pig's and dogs' and wolves of the story really just get you hooked in and makes you think \"oh damn howmuch fun would that be?\"\\n\\n\r\nIt really is an outstanding story with a bit of school love and i mean a bit not much at all, lots of fighting but the real enjoyment comes out from what goes on between the wolves, pigs and dogs. If it didnt have those things it would certainly be alright yeah but not outstanding!\\n\\n\r\nThe art well i dont really have any complaints about it, it was above average and good all round. Though someone might be able to point out the flaws of the art i dont really care much for the art as long as it isnt stick figures and they bother putting the effort in to make things look realistic isnt that all that matters?\\n\\n\r\nWell same with sound it was very good and quite interesting at times, the fight music and all, quite interesting choices made and some i didnt get the point of which occurs in an episode it practically is something that only occurs that one time and for only a few seconds but i guess its just to make out that she doesnt want the other person to see it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting and the 'Ice witch' and 'Pervert' were certainly my favourite characters im sure if you watch it you'll figure out who they are (im been vague to prevent spoiling things) The Ice witch because shes powerful and quite knowlegdable about the art of 'Bento Wars' or Bento Royals' whichever, or what ever you wanna call them, in the end it doesnt matter, anyways how she helps 'pervert' to become a wolf and teach him the difference between wolves, pigs and dogs. Though he learns from other characters in the story like 'brunette' and 'monk' oh and 'goatee' as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'pervert' is interesting because he seems to be quite unlucky and its funny on how things end up, it really is just hilarious watching what bad luck occurs to him, XD. How he likes the ice witch is also quite interesting. And then there is the 'bento gods' cant remember the actual term so ill use a title of one as an example \"The Oil god\" but the one of the Ralph store seems to attract his attention as well! XD even the cliche' pool scene has the added fervor of his bad luck and the bento royal! \\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime its one of those that you have to watch from start to finish to truly love which isnt hard since its 12 episodes long, but even if you dont watch start to finish its certainly is an awesome anime to get into.\\n\\n\r\nThough alot of animes out there have comedy and action this really just takes the cake the 'cliche' pool scene i mentioned earlier also has a very funny bento there and i have to say you have GOT to watch it to learn it, as it would be a massive unfortunate spoiler if i did here in this review.\\n\\n\r\nWell overall a grand anime, and one of my favourite 12 episode animes. Its just not long enough to be one of my top favourite animes as im one of those guys who get attached and wanna see MORE! but not to much if they have 38 more episodes i would be so happy but i guess it would be alot less action packed if it did. Only boon of short animes more going on. \\n\\n\r\nSince im babbling on in a review it will probably be ignored but ive written this much and not discarding it. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those who like action packed funny animes and dont care to much for it been a relatively  short anime compared to some out there. And dont mind a tiny amount of \"Senpai is all i need\" think thats what he says XD well you gotta watch this anime just WATCH IT!!",

            "content": "So much potential wasted.\r\nBen-To has a very strong opening.  The first three episodes did a great job world building, setting the tone, developing likeable characters, and delivering on high-octane corner-market warfare.  And those 3 episodes are arguably the only ones worth watching.\r\nI suppose up to episode six, the show at least performs tolerably, but past that, the production falls apart.\r\nThe simplest way to explain: In the second half of the show, about 5 out of the 6 fights that occur aren't shown.  Yup.  They just don't show them.  Including the finale fight that the last few episodes build up to(I guess they show about a quarter of the final fight, but not the part that matters).\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part it's just: \"Lets do this!  Yeah!\"\\n\r\nInsert freeze frame of people charging, fade to black, show aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what most of the fights amount to in the second half, except for one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the fanservice is completely over the top, and not even in a fun way.  Believe me, I'm not one to complain about fanservice.  Some people hate it, I think it's just fine.  But in this show, it's so gratuitous and poorly done that it actually was uncomfortable.  I just wanted to watch people fight in grocery stores.  I don't want to see one of the characters forcibly give another a bath for 3 minutes straight of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly if I was going off of the first three episodes only, I'd give this show a 9/10.  It was funny, exciting, well animated, and well written.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, I imagine the production lead was like: \"Yo... what are you guys doing?  This is actually good.  You're supposed to be shooting for a 5/10 rating with this show.  No more fight scenes.  Stop focusing on the interesting characters.  Jam the screen full of tits.  Where are the filler episodes?  I got a fever, and the only prescription, is more filler!\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWatch the first three episodes, then drop it.  That's my recommendation.",

            "content": "I think in some ways this anime depicts the hardship one faces in a declining economy.  That being said, it also sheds light on how humorous certain situations can be.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing less serious than fighting over your favorite food(s).\r\nIf you are considering watching this anime, be forewarned--- you will laugh.  As you progress through the episodes, more and more characters will pile up, each with their own \"nom-de-guerre\".  Although some of the pseudonyms are dramatic and even historic names, Satou ends up with the most unsavory alias out of the bunch.  In case youhaven't read the synopsis, Satou You is the main protagonist, along with the Ice Witch (Yarizui) and a few others that are best left out for spoiler's sake.  \\n\\n\r\nNow for the numbers game---\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really hard to grasp when you begin the anime. You might think, \"Are these people actually FIGHTING over half-priced bentos?\"  Yes, they are.  I bet you would join in if you saw the structure and rules behind the story in this show.  I know what else you are thinking, \"Wow, school uniforms, this is one of THOSE anime isn't it?\"  Well yeah, sort of.  Ben-to really doesn't capitalize on the high school thing TOO much, but the overused setting is still there.  However, the refreshing atmosphere of the grocery aisles are more than enough to keep you coming back.    \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nSurprisingly good for a comedy based anime, though definitely not the best animation I have seen so far.  The characters aren't cartoony and overly colorful like certain dramas, though the distinct hair differences of key characters are present.  I will discuss why the detailed artwork isn't necessary  later.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nThe voice actors are great and all, but the OP didn't really drag me in like some other anime do.  I think the main theme for an anime is really something that gets stuck in someone's head and reminds them to tune in every week.  With that aside, the animation in the OP fits the song perfectly.  It is nice that the song was actually crafted for this anime particularly.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 \\n\r\nSatou or Saito, is voiced by Shimono Hiro, who was really able to bring that humorously sarcastic undertone that made certain moments unbearably funny .  The other characters were hit and miss, they each had their mysteriousness and past stories that will play out as watch.  I think as a whole, they were able to band together as \"wolves\" to make a cohesive comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nOverall:  8\\n\r\nI lumped these together because they essentially compliment each other.  The big thing for me that I left out until the end of this review is THE FIGHT SCENES.  Who would have thought that each one of the wolves would be so talented in martial arts?  The fight scenes are really exciting and are played up each episode.  With respect to animation, this makes up for the smaller details you may have missed out on. Who needs to tell how many fingernails one has while an outstretch leg is rocketing towards your face? Not this guy.  You will see some special abilities as well as special enemies who try to shark the half-priced bentos without following the way of the pack.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was worth watching.  I brought away some pretty good laughs and ultimately learned a thing or two about the seriousness of low-priced food.",

Making little sense to my picture of British shopping, Ben-To is a welcome breath of fresh air and has won my heart and stomachs. The plot is relatively easy to follow and can be viewed casually and even though character relations can range from frustrating to the questionable and even queasy.\r\nThis show was hard to watch because I'm a Student (Student's will all understand when I say this). With such a variety of tasty looking food and the comedy to follow this show has made it's way into my personal favouritesbecause it leaves a feeling when it ends that you want the show to go on but at the same time you know that it might get ruined and as such better not risk ruining such a good show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the show pretty much nailed it when it comes to what it set out to be. The only downfall is that the show abruptly ends when you've just bonded with the characters which I would view as a shame but none the less, great fun to watch. Here's a Recommendation!",

            "content": "Ben-To! is about a bunch of high school kids from Japan that go to stores every night and brawl over half price bento. When I saw brawl I mean they are BRUTAL! I think that this story is really interesting and I love the idea. It was very well put together. There were times where I absolutely loved how seriously the characters all took bento brawling. They made it their lives and it was very comical. Great story with an original concept and it is very well put together. \r\nThe story follows Yoh Satou; A perverted high school boy, Sen Yarizui; a member of thehalf priced food lovers club, and Hana Oshiroi; a girl who follows Satou and writes perverted novels about him. While I did like these characters and how they all contrasted with eachother and other side characters, I found a lack of development in all of them except Satou, and even then, I thought he wasn't very dynamic. After he learned to fight, nothing more changed. Yarizui  did lighten up to Satou but that was a small thing.\\n\\n\r\n I did like this animation a lot. It was very vibrant and pleasing to look at. The soundtrack was nice but not very exciting. It's not bad, but it's just kinda meh. Overall I gave this series a 9/10 because it was very enjoyable and the story was written greatly.\\n\\n\r\nCheck out the full review at\\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/TR6HPh7xwGs",

            "content": "Have you ever watched a show that was far more epic than it had any right to actually be? Well, that's how I felt while watching Ben-To. The whole premise of this anime is so absurd and yet it just... works. The moment I started watching it I just couldn't take my eyes off of it. The art was just beautiful, the music adrenaline inducing, the characters lovable, it was just all around great.\r\nThis anime isn't your typical underdog anime where the protagonist spends the whole series trying to become top dog, or in this case, wolf. No, by episode 3 he has already joinedthe upper echelons of the wolves. And that is what makes this show so enjoyable. The protagonist fights against other equally strong Bento Brawlers. It's a fight to see who can claim the half-priced Bento boxes. Even the strongest of wolves can be defeated which makes it clearer that this show doesn't intend for Sato to become the strongest. He just wants to brawl for Bento and that is exactly what he does.\\n\\n\r\nJust by watching this show, it isn't hard to tell that the fights are the real spectacle. A good chunk of the shows budget went into the fights themselves which are fast, fluid, and just plain beautiful. And of course, any good fight needs a beautiful prize to make it worth all that hassle, and the Bento boxes are drawn with such artistic beauty that it makes my mouth water every time I see one. It also makes me wish Bento brawls really existed and that they were in the US because I would totally participate even though I'm not that strong.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, no good anime is complete without a pulse-pounding soundtrack. I haven't been able to find the actual names of the some of my favorite tracks which is disappointing, but its enough to just hear them in the series proper. My favorite song of course is pretty much the Bento Brawl main theme. It starts off really nice, peaceful, and then it kicks up into a heart racing pace and before you know it, all of the characters are beating the crud out of each other just for some half-priced Bento.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Ben-To has a story. It's split into multiple two to three episode story arcs. I can't say that they're the greatest story arcs, but things get better by the end. The two best arcs are the Monarch Arc and the Orthros Arc. I'll let you figure out exactly why.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was just plain amazing and the English dub was almost perfect. So kudos to Funimation and Bang Zoom! I'm pretty sure I'm gonna end up watching this series a couple of times just for the fights alone. And don't forget to thank the god of discounts.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not really sure what attracted me Ben-to. I think I noticed an advert on my Facebook from Manga UK. The premise sounded pretty ridiculous but for some reason I was interested to see how it would turn out.\r\nBen-to is basically a group of high school students battle for half priced Ben-to. Driven by hunger and the desire to acquire the best Ben-to of the day they fight out every night in the supermarket. That's about as deep as it gets in terms of story. In fairness Ben-to never tries to be anything more that all out crazy action.\r\n We are introduced to the maincharacter Sato Yo a boy who loves Sega and lives on a tight budget. This forces him to go to the supermarket one night where he spots a man putting half price stickers on Ben-to. As soon as he tries to get one all hell breaks loose and he is knock out by a girl known as the Ice Witch. She is the president of the Half Priced Food club and eventually he decides to join.\\n\r\nFrom this point on he becomes a \u2018Wolf\u2019 and competes with other wolves for half priced food. We are introduced to other character such as the \u2018Beauty by the lake\u2019 and even gets his own nickname \u2018The Freak\u2019 (due to several unfortunate incidents).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is wafer thin and usually revolved around turf wars in certain areas of the city east & west. The main character is your typical male anime lead, who seems to spend most of his time getting slapped silly by the class president or playing SEGA when he\u2019s not fighting for Ben-to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the one dimensional characters most episodes manage to hold you attention to some fantastic fight scenes. These are made even more exciting by a great soundtrack which really give extra energy to fight.  The animation is great and flows well during fight scenes. The characters are fairly standard and are a bill on the plain side. There is a bit of fan service but it usually involves the class president sexually harassing other girls. I don\u2019t mind fan service as a whole but it just feels like they have added it for the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nI found Ben-to quite entertaining but at the same time it\u2019s quite a shallow experience. There is little in the way of character development and at times it\u2019s hard to believe the lengths people will go to get half priced food. Ben-to is difficult to rate much higher that a six, but don\u2019t be too put off.  If you disengage your brain it\u2019s perfectly enjoyable.\\n",

These high school students duke it out in a grand royale for the half priced bento, to sooth their stomachs and wallets.\r\nPersonally, it was a pointless jumble of ecchi and repetition after the pool episode. Very little semblance of a plot yet, with meaningless characters getting squeakier and squeakier seiyuus. The characters are never really fleshed out in a meaningful way, and the comedy takes a dive after the umpteenth iteriation of it.\r\nHowever, if you enjoy squeaky voices, wandering nonexistent plots, and seeing some dudesduke it out and see some boobies, Ben-To is for you. Personally, I had to drop it.",

            "content": "Ben-To is a very odd show; there aren't very many anime that center on teenagers and young adults doing battle in order to buy discounted food at the local corner store. Yeah, this is one of those over-the-top, nonsensical shows that sells you a premise that many would understandably scoff at. However, this show, through its wacky yet consistent execution manages to be very entertaining.\r\nOur hero is Y\u014d Sat\u014d, a high school kid who inadvertently finds himself pulled into the crazy world of bento brawls. For those of you not in the know, bento boxes are basically Japanese TV dinners; you buy them, take thetop off and eat them, quick and easy. You might think it'd be impossible to build a 12 episode show off that premise, but it works (for the most part).\\n\\n\r\nThere's an entire etiquette and order in how bento brawls unfold, and anyone who steps outside those rules is cast out; there's a Geneva Convention for fights on half-priced food. The fights themselves are frequently entertaining; they're well animated and characters get a chance to shine in them. Where the show kind of loses me is that it could have used the brawls to deepen character development; the characters perhaps could have become more ruthless or implemented more strategy in the fights which in turn impacts who they are in everyday life. Sadly, the brawls are self-contained with no far reaching implications.\\n\\n\r\nI really appreciated how colorful this show is; from the character designs to the animations during fights, there's a lot of vividness going on. The character designs themselves are nothing particularly inventive, but they're serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nY\u014d Sat\u014d is a likable enough protagonist, but a lot of side characters I found to be either underdeveloped or just plain unnecessary. One character who is obsessed with yaoi frequently came off as annoying and overly exaggerated; she's sometimes endearing but often irritating. There are also side characters who I would have liked to see more of but they never really get their shot.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason this show loses points with me is because of a certain interaction that occurs close to the end of the series between two female characters. If you've watched it you may remember what I'm referring to; it's uncomfortable and it feels wrong watching it. It's not often that I'm unnerved by an anime, but this particular interaction made me feel kind of dirty; nothing wrong with physical intimacy, but when it comes off as unwanted, there's something not right. It's like the tone went completely off in another direction for one brief scene.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this show is dumb in all the right ways. Young men and women beat each other up in pursuit of half-priced TV dinners and for some of them it's more about the battle than the reward. I have some issues with this show, but for the most part it is very enjoyable and quick to get through. Just don't use that thing between your ears too much when watching; it's best to give critical thinking a rest to enjoy this show.",

            "content": "This is by far the best anime i have EVER seen. Honest to god this anime is,for me,one of the best of the bestest. Pick whateva you want.Story?Magnificent.Animation?Eye waternigly good. In fact i'm struggling to find something wrong with it for 2 days now..But since this is a review i had to,even if it's nitpicking.\r\nBeware though i do freakin swear a lot and if you're the oversensitive kind of chap or girl take a hike cause i'll slap you silly,make you cry your eyes out and off to years of psychotherapy.\r\nWith that begins my review of this glorious anime called Ben-To...And i have to saywhat a great name for an anime..The pun is out of this world cause as it so happens our MC's name is Ben...Well no it isn't it's actually You Satou which to me sounds like the name of a Viking God or something equally great and eternal.This lad puts David Hasselhoff to shame. Little curly David is a little whiny bitch compared to Satou. Satou can take a punch in the nuts by Goku even and he won't feel a thing.That's how badass our MC is. He takes what he wants,when he wants it. He wants a silver haired bitch on her knees? He slaps her perky ass and gives her some D and leaves her crying and then goes to a bar for a fight. What more can you possibly want from an MC?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also great. It's basically the creator's version of the apocalypse. The humanity has plunged into the darkness of war and we follow some high school kids who fight in order to survive. There's mayhem and death everywhere you look. So what does Satou do? He takes under his pretty wings 2 bitches,two prostitutes who sold their bodies to fat,disgusting middle aged men......But only to satisfy his sadistic urges.\\n\\n\r\nCan you now tell me that this premise isn't interesting?One thing though..\\n\\n\r\nThis is some shit i just came up with.Ben-To has absolutely no relation whatsoever with any apocalyptic bitchslapping. Slapping it has,just not the one i described. So i fucked with ya enough,so let's cut the crap and see what this piece of shit is all about.\\n\\n\r\nI take it you're not allergic to reading the synopsis so i won't bother with the premise. It's there for all to see. Now you must be thinking \"what a fucking stupid anime\"..And boy you'd be right. Now stupid isn't necessarily always a bad thing. Cause even a stupid premise can sometimes make for a good anime if you make an effort. And at first i thought that this might be the case with this one. I thought it was gonna be a parody or something of the fighting animes. Well sort of no. Cause after 1 or eps it's all downhill. Satou at the beginning was a somewhat nice lad. Mind you we have seen his kind over and over in animes..Yarizui on the other hand was the \"airhead\" with a knack for action and kicking the shit out of everyone. But as the series progress we are unfortunately introduced to some other characters.And that was it,that was my line in the sand.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain. I can forgive the show's idiotic premise. What i cannot forgive is wasting my time with characters who are as useless as a watch that has both hands missing. And if useless was their only prob that would be ok too..But they're also obnoxious to the point of meltdown. Take Ume for example. The only thing i recall her doing the most was kicking the shit out of Satou. Now i'm ok with slapstick comedy IF it's able tobring out some actual laughter. This wasn't funny,it was just idiotic and out of place. It's as if you're sitting now in your living room and i come over and punch you in the fez cause a dog was barking in fucking Alaska. The other annoying as hell trait of hers is that she's an absolute psycholesbian. So when Satou goes near Hana she goes berserk and almost kills him. And not in a funny way. In fact she abuses most of the cast and goes home with a tiara for it. Then there are the Kyo sisters who are just as annoying with a splash of in your face arrogance.\\n\\n\r\nSo you might be thinking now,it's not too bad,it's just them that ruin a small portion of the show,you're overeacting as usual. Firstly i hope your dick turns into a dead husk and it's not a small portion of the show. And it's not just them.If you take off the series half of the cast it wouldn't make a blind bit of difference. They bear no weight whatsoever to the flow of the story. Even characters who are supposed to be part of the main thing are pushed to the side,doing absolutely nothing. The writers didn't make any effort at all to develop them,make them part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound dept was bad. Bad bad bad. The overall animation was ok it had it good points here and there. It was when a \"battle\" ensued that things got all wobbly. The songs and VA were good. Just good nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i think this was as bad as catching gonorrhea. It's not as interesting as it sounds and it sticks with you no matter what spoiling the relationship. It tried too hard to be silly and over the top that it lost it's way and became outright stupid to the point of destruction. I cannot possibly recommend it to anyone. Or at least anyone i like. And if you think it can't be all that bad,go ahead,be my guest.",

Wrong! Whatever the writers were smoking, it clearly worked. The whole Ben-to system revolves around in a convenience store, at night, whatever Box-readied lunchboxes left over, gets discounted nearthe end of the night shift. Now, the rules on this system is simple, the manager puts discount stickers on the ben-to called the god of discounts, shall not be harassed, and everyone has to wait for them to get out of the aisle, after that, it's a free for all to get the lunch, the catch is that a boss in the area could get hungry, and then puts you down like a dog. The characters are easy enough to recognize, especially those baskets.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this was actually quite good, however, it does not mean that the animator deserves all the praise, mainly because the fights are almost just before and after the brawl, and when it does come to the actual fights, it's either too short or too blocked.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a part of me wants a season 2 of this, and a part of me demands better action scenes, the concept is almost perfect with a few flaws, it's quite interesting though.\\n\\n\r\nI wish this system gets implemented in real life soon, then my training doesn't get a once in a life time use.\\n",

Keep in mind that the MC is weak but not that whiny that you'll have to drop it.

            "content": "I'd place Ben-to somewhere between being a typical shounen, and a typical harem show.\r\nThe anime definitely tries to get far on a far-out concept and initial reaction of \"ha-ha, it's about fighting about half-priced bento isn't that crazy?\", but doesn't ultimately have enough style or sustenance to ride out 12 episodes. It relies pretty heavily on the hype of it's gimmick (and it is definitely one hell of a gimmick) then it does trying to flesh out it's characters or plot. The novelty in concept wears thin pretty quickly  when there is no tension in the character interactions, or plot.\r\nThe characters are all typicalshounen or harem fare. Though past being an average high-school self-insert type, the MC is as dense as some others in the harem genre. He does remain the typical everyman dragged into a strange new world by several cute girls, and adapts quickly and with minor stumbles. Remains to be the butt of jokes by every girl in the series at all times. The girls are all mean to him at virtually all times outside of the fights because. Just because, there's no end to that sentence. They're just supposed to be because he's the lone male MC that is human trash.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are pretty much all typical run of the mill copy-paste character types one would encounter in a show like this. There's the stoic one, who is smart (though dense when it comes to social interactions), cool, and a bit of a badass. There's a glasses-chan best friend type who is obsessed with bl, and her gimmick is making everything about bl. Cousin from MCs youth who is very invested with putting her boobs on the MC at all times. The twins, who embody every trope about twins in one fell swoop, twincest, one is dumb, the other smart, one is a crybaby, one is serious, etc. And then the younger, almost moe, plucky cheerful unlucky one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the fight scenes, there is nothing especially worth talking about. The show desperately tries to get us to like the characters, but does nothing new with their tropes, and keeps interactions between them fairly standard for the harem genre. It doesn't break any boundaries or toe the line outside of the formula.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character designs are pretty standard, nothing new or innovative, nothing especially strange. The show isn't ugly by any means. All the characters are nice, if not a little uninspired. The fight scenes are nice and well-choreographed, but with such uninvesting characters, it definitely lacks tension. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is fine, if uninspired. The seiyuus all seem to put in some good work. I'm always a fan of Emiri Katou and Yui Horie, so it's always nice to see them show up in things.",

            "content": "When I first seen Ben-to, I got quite hooked on the show special thanks to its nutty premise of struggling high schoolers brawling over discounted bento meals at local supermarkets. What made the premise fun for me was that these characters took the brawls quite seriously and we got to see some colorful characters with their own methods of getting the meals they want from a team of school athletes ambushing the efforts of the local \"wolves\" to ensure their team gets the victory to a fat lady shopper trying to butt in the fights with her shopping cart to a pair of twins whobrawl using shopping baskets. One fun episode in particular decided to subvert the typical pool episode as characters had a pool brawl over food being served to them at the resort they were staying at. For the most part, the visual presentation to Ben-to was solid with a good amount of detail put into the design of settings, especially at the supermarkets. In addition, the various Ben-to brawls were fluidly animated in many instances and there weren't too many occasions I noticed shortcuts.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does carry some major flaws for me though. The series makes a running gag of male lead Yo getting humiliated in nearly each episode of the series, in some episodes to the point where he gets stripped of nearly or entirely of his clothes. While this was okay the first couple times when Yo was unfamiliar with the Ben-to fights, it got quite annoying to see this so-called top fighter getting humbled in enough embarrassing predicaments for a cheap gag. Ume, as a character, was very unappealing to me as her regular thrashing of Yo for the slightest repercussions and her obsessive lesbian interest in Hana was bad enough to the point where it was bordering on criminal. Two later episodes of the series were also less focused on the bento brawls and more on focusing on the two mentioned flaws I hated with the show as one episode is focused on Yo getting humiliated enough and the other on how far Ume is willing to go to satisfy her lesbianism on Hana. There were also points where Ben-to decided to push the envelope a bit on sexual content with innuendo, fan service, Hana's yaoi writing and Ume's lesbianism, which seemed done just to appeal to the otaku fanbase.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed seeing Ben-to when it resorted to what it was doing best and that was its focus on the crazy brawls for bento and the colorful characters that took part in them. However, I didn't enjoy the show's occasional pandering to otaku with its sexual content, Ume's character in general and the repetitive gag of Yo being humiliated. It is a decent comedy title to check out, provided you are okay with its flaws.",

That's what Ben-To feels like after you're done. At the end you'll be like, What i miss, What i miss and feel like the animeitself is laughing at your miss-fortune. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you get passed my view and want to know, This anime knows how to intrigue the viewers, There is a bit of everything, Harem, Comedy, Hints of Romance, Yuri, and ACTION on over a Ben-To or a Lunch able.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime at anyone who can absorb a lot and can take in a lot that is thrown at them, And of course won't judge this anime on superficial whim. This anime is basically a modern re-enaction of what you do if you want to eat, Nothing makes food taste better than to earn it yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThis is somewhat of a Funny yet extreme perspective of what students that are short on cash do over to get dinner or lunch at the grocery store. I know my review is extremely vague, But i don't want to spoil the characters and story and i don't want to let my impression harm your view for those who have not seen \"Ben-To\". I gave it a 9 because when you get down to it, The story has a lot going for it, I can only hope for a Season 2.",

It's the setting that really makes this show stand out. The ludicrousness of people beating each other up for half-priced lunches was quite enjoyable. I especially liked how the characters took it so seriously. Unfortunantly, the characters were nothing special. They were all basic archetypes. I felt they might've been trying to make fun of the common anime archetypes but i fail to see where theyput any satire in. \\n\r\n    The art style was nothing special but i enjoyed the animation quite a bit. It was nicely colored and very fluid. The fights were beautifully animated and easy to follow! Very nice on the eyes! The music i found a bit lacking. When it wasn't the standard J-pop it was this weird auto-tuned stuff that really did not appeal to me. However, it did a good job at setting the mood and i can forgive a lot for that.  \\n\r\n    There were a few things in this show that rubbed me the wrong way. The fact that the only lesbian character is portrayed as a cold, heartless molester defiantly is no good. There are scenes where characters are clearly being touched in ways that they do not like and these scenes are framed in a funny or sexy manner. This is not okay and it really just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\r\n   However, despite its flaws the show can be quite enjoyable in parts. If you're into silly shonens with boobies bouncing all over the place, i'd say give it a watch. \\n",

There's a guy getting wrecked by some unknown force within bright lights, then collpases upon the ground with a battered body! And-wait...\r\nIs that guy that got beat up our main charater?\r\nOooh.... it's gonna be one of those anime... but you know what?\r\nI loved it.\r\nStory:\r\n     The poor fella who just got his ayuss' whooped in the first seconds of the anime is our main character, Satou You. After traveling with his father who's in the military, he comes to town to attend highschool. While in town, Satou gets hungry and visits a nearby corner store in search of something to eat.\\n\r\nWhile in the store, Satou broswes meals he simply cannot afford at present... until he goes toward the far back of the store where the refridgerated goods are held for sell. Satou was nearly brought to tears at the sight of several boxed lunches (Bento) being labeled with half price stickers!\\n\\n\r\n     As Satou frolics toward the boxed lunches and the managar (or God of Discounts) who labeled them leaves, Satou is introduced to the area's culuture...\\n\r\nThe moment the mangager leaves, EVERYONE FIGHTS OVER BOXED LUNCHES!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy.\\n\\n\r\n     Ok, maybe the anime's story dosen't end there, but that's the jest of it.\\n\r\nYou see, everyone who fights over the boxed lunches \"with respect\" are called \"Wolves\". And later on the best Wolf in the area, who's name is Yarizui Sen, takes Satou under her wing and teaches him what it means to be a wolf and earn those half priced boxed lunches. \\n\\n\r\n     As the anime progresses, it shows that wolves don't just have other wolves to worry about. Oh no, the wolf has natural enemies such as fat people (boars), jocks (tempest/The Storm), hunting dogs (guys who avoid fighting by teaming up and barricading), politics and land grabs!!!\\n\\n\r\n     Needless to say: if you like stories that involve an over the top premise, main characters training in order to be the motivating stalwart everyone looks up to, \"fight the power\" showers, and unrequited love from your hot blonde cousin, then you're gonna love this anime~\\n\\n\r\n     I enjoyed the story a lot. And it didn't need to be complex for me to look forward to what happens, or the final fight and conclusion of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n     The animation got the job done in this action comedy. There's no martial arts or anything like that. Just brawls, acrobatic duels, but no known styles of fighting. At least the styles used aren't known to me. Even still, I loved the attention put in the fights. The stunts the characters did, how moves weren't really recycled and used in scene after scene, it was all fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n     But the scenes that showed the cityscape and country side were the best. I feel a lot of thought was put here, and the first episode set the tone for the rest of the anime pretty darn well! Though areas, like in the corner store, expands (making the store seem as big as a gym), I think this is pretty normal for anime that wants to flaunt over the top action.\\n\\n\r\n     If you're a stickler for animation, you may not like the drops in frames when outside of fights and the opening theme's animation, but that's shouldn't worry you too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening did great in getting me pumped and informed about what kind of anime i'll be watching, but to me seemed like Satou was portrayed poorly. While he is striving and still learning throughout the anime, he isn't as weak at the opening made him seem to me. At least he wasn't that weak all the time, like the opening suggests. I would have liked to see him have more triumphant appearances in the opening.\\n\\n\r\nYou might also dislike how the characters might seem like they're floating or bouncing up in down when walking, or how in the dubbed version animations seemed to not really match up with the English dubbed version, but these things are pretty minor and didn't take away from my enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, solid stuff here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n     Solid work here too. Awesome opening and ending theme that portrayed the anime in a perfect light. The changes in opening and ending them hinted that the makers were probably having fun making the series. It's like, after the fighting and testing of souls, we come back to the club room to relax and eat~ Great theme choices!\\n\\n\r\n     The ambiance or background sounds and music were great.\\n\\n\r\n     The voice acting for the Japanese, and surprisingly the the English version, seemed spot on. Though the character's in the English dubbed sounded older, everyone made fine characters.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound effects during fights are amazing, brutal, and realistic.\\n\\n\r\n     What seems common in anime, though a small gripe, is how in the English version the voices seemed sped up in order to fit into the animation. I wish that in the future this is toned down a bit so it doesn't break immersion or enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Overall, good stuff. The comedy and how believable the characters and environment are is there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\n     Thanks to the voice acting, the characters are brought to life in amazing ways. Though some are annoying, I wouldn't change anything except for the changes in dialogue between characters.\\n\\n\r\n     Satou may be our delusional, and tries to come off as our average melancholic, main character but he's pretty damn cool. Both subbed and dubbed versions of him are great! It's fun to see his change in dialogue between the versions.\\n\\n\r\n     Yarizui is more stoic and battle hardened int he subbed version, while the dubbed version makes her come off as a bit meaner and like she has to actually put effort into her stunts, but she's still a pretty cool character.\\n\\n\r\n     While Oshiroi is timid and bullied  freshman when she's not thinking about man-on-man loving (which turns her into a drooling blushing mess), she might be the character that annoys you. While the dubbed version seemed to give her a little more backbone in her dialogue, I found her hilarious in how she draws inspiration for her yaoi fanfics from the characters in the story. And my god are her fanfics graphic.\\n\\n\r\n     Shaga Ayame, the hot blonde cousin, is lively and goofy. No matter what the version or change in dialogue between the sub and dub serious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna spoil the other characters for you, but just know that with everyone doing there parts, the anime is a gem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n     This anime is one of my favorites. It's as if all its oddities, like a story about highschooler's fighting over and making groups over box lunches, make the anime charming. The humor, the struggles, all during a modern day setting! It's awesome!\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it's the sheer ridiculousness, and how serious the anime takes itself that makes it fun to watch. It's almost motivating.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure if you find anyone willing to put with cartoons, and enjoy over the top action or and comedy, they'll like it too.\\n\\n\r\nIt's anime like this, that I enjoy reviewing. I get to share or bring attention to my favorite shows. Sure people might not like it if they're looking for a less ridiculous tone, but for the rest of us: we'll be waiting for works just like this one!\\n\\n\r\nHeck, i'm rewatching the anime now! To make sure i'm covering my bases and to enjoy it all over again!\\n\\n\r\nThe Subbed and Dubbed versions seem to have a change in dialogue. While subbed is insane fun, the dubbed is a little more practical or aligned with other anime based on what they say. Like being aware of the Main Character's pervy delusions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThe final score for Bento/Ben-to,\\n\\n\r\nis a 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one of my favorite anime that I will compare future anime that want to take a crack at ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nIt holds itself up not by trying to be by the book, but trying to have personality. Be it's on tale of Trials, Tribulations, and Box Lunches!!!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series i'd be willing to support, just to show my appreciation to the makers.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait to see what else they've made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nUntil then, I'll see you guys on my next view!",

As always, my review is short but conlude all my experience.\r\nStoryline:\r\nThe storyline quite impressive, people are fighting over bento (Japanese packed food) but in this anime people fighting for it because it was half-priced food. That was the root story of the anime (people fighting for half-priced bento). \r\nFirst impression:\r\nFirst impression from first episode is i'm quite blurry here. But the I think it was just a hint for the nextep, so I just going on and continue watching. Nothing impressed me anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe art is good but there is better quality on other anime. I would give 8/10 for the art. About sound, I like the song when they are fighting but I'm quite dissapointed with the op and ed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main character is totally newbie to the world but it seems like he is the one who will become one of the most wanted there. Every characters has not been fully described yet, I think I will just go on with the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime is quite enjoyable and sometimes makes me feel relax when watching it. Fighting for ben-to is funny. Sometimes the story moved to the serious scene but  its still funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe anime has unique storyline packed with action scene, much enjoyment on fighting scene for just a half-priced bento,some of ecchi elements blended with some funny supporting characters. I thinks its worth watching...9/10 for this.",

            "content": "We all know of at least one anime that stands out among the rest, one that's original and got something unique about it...Let me tell you this, you'll never see an anime like Ben-To in your life. I say this in a good way of course, who wouldn't enjoy watching a show about a group of kids who meet up at induvidual food markets every night to brawl in order to get their hands on a simple half priced bento box? Like I said..you'll never see anything like that. While the premise may seem highly interesting it was slightly disappointing to see a story thatwas pretty average. Personally I think if the show was 22-24 episodes it could have faired much better, because at times it felt like the show attempted to cram too much into such a short span of episodes. I would've loved to see more in-depth characterization, more bento brawls, and more short little arcs for this sort of episodic anime. The story never got to go into full bloom because it was simply too short, and as a result the ending felt slightly under whelming. That said, there aren't many other cons I can think of for this overall very enjoyable anime. I can't say i'm going to watch it again anytime soon, and it's not going to go down as one of my all time favorites..but Ben-To is an all around solid and enjoyable show. One of the things that stands out the most i'd say would have to be the soundtrack. Brawling for something as trivial as a food product seems like it's all fun and games right? You're wrong if you said yes. The OST which includes the intro as well, got me hyped for every action sequence, even the songs they played during downtime sounded very nice and added alot to the show's quality. This is a soundtrack I highly recommend downloading if you like instrumentals. The animation was as good as it could have been for when the show was released, but the action scenes are what stood out. When the brawls happened, they looked fantastic..not just some lazy thrown together one-and-done little altercation...each fight was dynamic and had it's own style, each of the characters fought differently as well. The \"Ice Witch\" aka Sen Yaruzui prefered using kicks, and the one known as \"The Wizard\" was just a badass who sadly was also in the show for a few episodes despite being made out to be this important character and we never see him again which was very disappointing. The protagonist was pretty likeable, at first I didn't care much for him but as the show progressed my liking of him increaced because he was fairly relatable. Two characters were introduced into the show a little more than halfway through, and they were actually my favorite charcaters however they hardly got enough screentime even though their character arc was finished by episode 12 (the show's end). The only reason I say I want the show to be longer, is because I want to see more of these characters together interacting. They had great chemistry, and there was a love intrest that was hinted at several times but never really was expanded upon. I'd want to see more brawls and more funny moments in the show as well, Ben-To is also a comedy..a funny one at that, the first brawl was hilarious to me because it was so bizarre, as well as some other funny moments that happened in the early episodes. The main character Saito, is also a pervert..so take what you want from that, just another thing that adds to the comedy. There's also fan service and ALOT of ecchi so if that's not your thing i'd pass on this show because it might bother you. Overall, Ben-To is a gutbustingly funny ecchi action show which can occupy your anime craving for about a week. 12 episodes is a little short for a show that made me like its characters and world building but I don't feel like they did a total disservice by making the show short, I simply would have preferred more of it. The characters don't stand out as being incredibly ambitious or unique, but their chemistry makes the show all on its own. The Ben-To brawls are jaw dropping at times and definitely worth watching for. Just a solid, enjoyable anime with few cons...again I ask, what more could you want?\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked/agreed with my review please give it a thumbs up! Thanks (:",

Satou was going too the supermarket one time just too go and grab a ben-to not to realize that there's more too it than just that he ends up getting his ass kicked the first time than he goes back again just too get hisass kicked yet again so he ends up joining a clue (i honestly dont remember the club name) and also that theres people called dogs and wolves otherwise he ends up finding the ice whitch and basically joins the fray for fighting for bentos.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art was very good i personally dont pay attention to this but it was good none the less  \\n\\n\r\nSound: i personally didnt care for the OP and the ED i could take it and leave it for all that matter otherwise the sound was good\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: so i will start every time with a character i could not stand and that was Ume like for real i fucking HATED this chick i personally love the dub for its cause it Tia Ballard but man i fucking hate her character just so much shit she would do annoyed me like hell. Satou so hes a pretty up and at them person he kinda is a perv but it more of too himself that showing is pervness too people also not surprised he gets the nickname pervert.Oshiroi i can understand that she a main but for the only fact of almost being Satou wing character in a sense, she pretty forward about writing a novel about Satou and dudes (just weird for me) also a pretty nice and chill person. Shaga how could you say is a gamer and  she does like her brawls but she super touchy somtimes like groping some like for real otherwise a kinda werid and oddball person. Yarizui is a pretty chill but also straight forward kinda person who you could say doesnt like too lose she basically wins all the time and also at the brawls also she a kinda cold person (well i got that vibe from her atleast)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally hella enjoyed this anime if there was ONE downside it would be Ume otherwise the comedy was REALLY good and the action wasnt have bad either even though this says it doesnt have Ecchi it does so be aware of that before watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: giving this a 8 for sure the comedy was REALLY good i was laughing every episode also like i said that action wasn't have bad either and all the characters (expect for Ume) for really good and didn't annoying me like Ume (man im really annoying myself just by just mentioning her name) this anime is worth the watch.",

            "content": "It is with a heavy heart that I wasted my time on eight episodes of this anime and I really couldn't explain what kept me watching after episode four, because the fourth episode is the exact point at which the plot ran out of ideas.\r\nBefore you get your metaphorical panties in a twist, I'd like you to sit down and think: How much of a plot can a parody anime about fighting for your dinner truly have? As math would show, eight episodes too many. The first four are a pretty enjoyable, if refreshing experience, with well animated battles, some genuinely heart-tickling comedy and atleast one girl you can feast your eyes on, if nothing more. I must admit it even got me interested enough to think I might actually watch it all the way and give it a solid grade, perhaps even get into the entire plot of the insanity that is Bento Brawling.\\n\\n\r\nAlas, with the end of the ideas, came the end of the plot and the arrival of Boobs McMegane Blondie fetish character who insofar served absolutely no purpose, be it plot/comedy/character-wise, aside from her irresistibly huge rack and the fact she wants to do the diddly-do with her cousin. Her being but the first in the series of things gone terribly wrong in this production, because any other character (predominantly but not solely female) to come after that, exists exclusively to fill out the missing fetish holes the anime successfully avoided so far. I guess there's a couple ways to go about producing 12 episodes worth of nothing, eh? First you hook them on a plot suitable for an hour-long movie, then you shower them with the residues of fetishes you dreamt up a night ago. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, yes, for most it's probably worth checking out for a very fine Absolute Territory-ish pair of legs but even that kind of melts down into nothing, leaving but emptiness that has already echoed through countless anime throughout the ages.",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself waking up on the sidewalk, struggling for consciousness and aching with intense physical pain all over your body, there\u2019s a decent chance you need to go seek help, from both a doctor and an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor.  But for You Satou, a slightly more perverted than average teenage boy, this advice really doesn\u2019t apply.  Yeah, he did find himself waking up face down in the pavement at the center of a crowd of worried onlookers, with a strange girl from his school babbling incoherently about some epic fight that he can\u2019t remember, but instead of a hangover andthe deep shame that comes with it, all You Satou can feel is an empty stomach demanding food, an empty wallet demanding cheap food, and an empty head demanding answers.  To make matters worse, this all happens while he living all alone in a strange town, staying away from his family in the dormitories of his high school, living on a strict budget, and his only clue comes from a mysterious white haired girl who gives him one simple warning;  Stay away from the Supermarket.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, budget wins out over brains, and he finds himself once again visiting the grounds of his unexplained injury, and he happens to get there right when the owner is about to place half-off stickers on Ben-To boxes full of fresh food that didn\u2019t get purchased that day.  Satou charges in, stomach roaring, youthful enthusiasm pounding away inside of him...  Only to get dragged into a world of culinary combat as the lingering loiterers around the market explode into an all out war over the discounted food.  The rabbit hole only goes deeper from there, as he suffers yet another defeat at the hands of Sen Yarizui, the white haired warrior, who takes him and his other new friend Oshiroi under her belt to become better Ben-To brawlers.  If they ever want to stand a chance of landing budget friendly food to dine on, they\u2019ll have to train, improve their fighting skills, and learn the intricate philosophies of Wolves, Dogs and Laurel Wreathes, but most importantly of all, they\u2019ll have to have the hunger for victory.  With wars breaking out between guarded territories, ambitions rising all around them, and a series of increasingly bizarre circumstances unfolding around them, will Satou have the stomach to survive in this game, or is he destined to lose his lunch?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard the name David Productions before, it\u2019s probably because you watched the 2012 adaptation of Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure.  Aside from that, and to a lesser extent Ben-To, they really haven\u2019t had any big hits.  They formed in 2008, and spent a year or two offering production assistance to a couple of big name shows, namely Code Geass, Soul Eater and Black butler, before finally branching out on their own in 2009, releasing some obscure titles.  They finally broke ground in 2011, releasing Level E and Ben-To, a couple of generally well-received but NOT popularly known titles.  It was born from the minds of some former employees of Studio Gonzo, and much like it\u2019s year-mate, Ben-To feels like some of Gonzo\u2019s better looking titles, and I\u2019m not just talking about a specific genre here.  Gonzo\u2019s visual style varies from show to show, with fast animation in it\u2019s light hearted action shows, intense focus and gritty detail in it\u2019s more hardcore action titles, and just enough smart camera work to make even the most mundane of slice-of-life shows feel lively and engaging.  Ben-To is all three of these achievements  stuffed tightly in a half-priced supermarket bento box.\\n\\n\r\nTo start, the slice-of-life scenes take place primarily in a school, and if not that, then at least primarily around students.  The day-time and in-class segments look on the surface like they could exist in pretty much any anime that shares a similar setting, with clean and sharp=looking exteriors and a bunch of uniquely designed background characters occasionally reacting to the quirkier crowd that makes up the main cast.  To be clear, there isn\u2019t quite as much background movement as you might find in a Kyoto Animation title, such as the first season of Haruhi, but it\u2019s more than enough to keep the rest of the country\u2019s population from looking like a bunch of cardboard cut-outs, and furthermore, it sells the idea that there IS a world outside of the main cast.  Scenes taking place in Sen\u2019s club-room or near and inside the supermarket aren\u2019t nearly as bright or sterile, but in a possibly ingenious move, they feel darker in a warm, inclusive kind of way...  When you\u2019re watching the main cast interacting with each other and other patrons, it feels like you\u2019re among friends and equals away from the conformity of everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the light-hearted action animation had a lot of money poured into making it look as smooth and kinetic as possible, despite the questionable material it wound up being used for.  Satou is the butt of a lot of physical comedy, both funny and non, and despite being a completely different character in both personality and disposition, the kind of things he lives through could easily be compared to that of Keitaro from Love Hina.  He\u2019s not even the unluckiest character in the show(we\u2019ll get to that), but misfortune follows him wherever he goes, and the show\u2019s obviously generous budget captures it all in sometimes excruciating detail.  Speaking of detail, some of the more intense action scenes are so vividly animated that they could almost be confused for clips from Hellsing Ultimate, particularly because of the use of shading.  Ridiculous premise aside, there are moments in this puppy that are meant to be taken dead serious, and they probably would have fallen flat without such intricate visual direction.  These two action-oriented animation styles make for a beautiful combination during supermarket brawls, and while a few shots are recycled, it happens scarcely enough that you\u2019d have to watch the series multiple times to notice.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are fairly standard and archetypal, but not lazy in any way.  Satou looks like your typical anime hero with an average face, messy brown hair and no other real distinguishing features.  Yarizui looks like your typical cold-hearted girl, ala Rei Ayanami, with the short white hair and everything.  Oshiroi looks like your typical Fujoshi/Manga-artist character, complete with mousy demeanor, pony-tail and glasses.  Ayame, Satou\u2019s cousin, looks like your typical sexually-forward character, with long blonde hair and a generously proportioned rack.  The rest of the cast isn\u2019t as obvious as these four, but they\u2019re still designs you\u2019ve seen before, and it\u2019s not hard to draw the connections, which would be annoying if each character wasn\u2019t branded with a \u2018nom de guerre\u2019 that blatantly calls out their specific archetype.  I won\u2019t spoil what name Satou eventually gets, but the fact that the cold-hearted Yarizui is referred to as an \u201cIce witch\u201d should be a proper example of why these designs were picked.  Other than that, it\u2019s up to the characters themselves to shine beyond their rather ordinary looks, which they do.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the music, I\u2019m working with a bit of a handicap here, so you\u2019ll just have to bear with me on this.  I usually look up OST tracks on youtube during the writing process, but I can\u2019t do that with Ben-To, because I can\u2019t for the life of me FIND any ost tracks to listen to.  It\u2019s bad enough that the series\u2019 title is a difficult one to search effectively, I swear to God I\u2019m getting more results about actual Bento food than I am for the series itself, but I can\u2019t even find the soundtrack on amazon or Ebay, and rewatching it twice in one month just to listen for background music sounds like overkill, but after a quick rewatch of the first two episodes, I\u2019ve noticed that it doesn\u2019t actually have much of a soundtrack.  Most anime have a set list of tunes that can play either in short bursts or on repeat for longer scenes, but the music in Ben-to is never just there to be there.  If there\u2019s no music needed, or if we\u2019re just listening to dialogue, there\u2019s little to no music present.  When music is needed to complement a certain tone or emotion, one of many vastly different short-length tunes will play for the exact purpose, and disappear the minute it\u2019s no longer needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, LIVE FOR LIFE by Aimi, is awesome, and a perfect fit for the series by all standards.  The song is upbeat and intense, the visuals synchronize with it perfectly, and it features some stellar animation.  I never thought the simple shot of characters walking around in a supermarket, passing in front of the camera as they move between aisles, could be so much fun to watch.  The characters are given proper introductions, and at a few points are even given a small bit of depth, if you\u2019re paying attention.  Some outstanding fight animation is also featured, and the transitions between shots are just gorgeous.  The ending theme, like most for this type of show, is a lot calmer and with a much more steady pace.  It takes place at the end of the day, with all fights behind us, and nothing ahead but the solemn rendezvous afterwards.  It\u2019s a nice tune with a soft ambiance, and the visuals offer a heartfelt look at what Yarizui\u2019s new club members, the pups she\u2019s taken under her wing, truly mean to her, and how they\u2019ve changed her life with the implication that she\u2019s transitioning from student to master herself.  \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is a Funimation effort, and it was made by exactly the right people, with John Burgmeier directing, and the ever-thoughtful Monica Rial working on the scripts.  I\u2019ve praised Monica\u2019s writing several times before, but with Ben-to, I think she;\u2019s added another feat to her list;  She can do a Jamie Marchi script WAY better than Jamie Marchi can.  No, I\u2019m not just attacking Marchi for shits and giggles, let me explain...  Marchi likes to pack cheeky comedy shows like this one full of slang, double-talk and quirky innuendo, taking every possible opportunity to make the characters say something outrageous.  Monica does the same thing in this dub, except with the slang toned down and allocated to specifically the characters who might use them, outrageous dialogue used sparingly so as to enhance the effect and not drive the audience into sensory overload, and innuendo divided up among the characters with the dirtiest minds.  Oshiroi, when she\u2019s fired up about her boys-love novel, takes on the brunt of this, and Felecia Angelle  has so much fun with the material.  The fact that nobody else in the cast gets to say the insane, perverted things she does is not lost on her, which is probably why the passion in the character\u2019s voice always feels so natural.  \\n\\n\r\nAustin Tindle and Trina Nishimura play the main characters, Satou and Yarizui, but it\u2019s kind of difficult to talk about their performances without also bringing up the kind of development they go through, and it\u2019s not really time for that yet.  To put it in broad terms, they both start off sounding like pretty much what you\u2019d expect from their character designs, but just as much development awaiting them as their is their characters.  Satou is a character who grows thro9ughout the series, finding passion and strength, and while Austin /tindle may play him as a normal male student most of the time, he\u2019s more than capable of getting fired up whenever his character does.  Yarizui seems cold and untouchable at first, but as we learn more about her, she becomes a lot more vulnerable and relatable, both to Satou and the Audience, and Trina is able to deliver on this depth in spades.  Tia Ballard plays the ACTUALLY cold hearted character, a far cry from the roles she\u2019s more famous for.  She plays the menacing class representative Ume Shiraume, and as demanded, she plays the role like a cold-blooded killer, speaking plainly and as needed, with volumes of venom injected into her words, making the character feel like a legitimate threat.  That\u2019s not all I could say by a long shot, there are a ton of Funimation actors who show up in both large and small roles, and...  They\u2019re great.  They\u2019re all really great.  I recommend this dub, although if you\u2019d prefer, the sub\u2019s just as good.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there\u2019s a good chance that, by the end of my plot description alone, you\u2019ve already decided whether or not you\u2019re going to ever watch this anime.  I\u2019ll be perfectly honest with you guys, it\u2019s pretty fucking out there.  This is a show that basically combines the worst of black Friday with a literal interpretation of The Hunger Games.  People beat the shit out of each other in the middle of a super market...  No, not even a supermarket, a convenience store, three pumps away from being a gas station...  for half-price boxes of leftover food.  They don\u2019t do this spontaneously, either.  Oh no, this is their lifestyle.  It is taken with complete sincerity, Satou nearly gets his head knocked off at one point for questioning it, and at no point does anyone compare the money they\u2019re saving when they win a bento to the possible cost of hospitalization.  There is actual drama at play here, with more than just hunger on the line.  It\u2019s a matter of pride and respect.  I will never be able to hear someone dismiss this series based on it\u2019s plot without completely understanding why.  But among people who\u2019ve actually watched it, and fully experienced it, Ben-To is a very well-regarded and even respected title.  How is that possible with such a ludicrous premise?\\n\\n\r\nWell, first of all, you can say whatever you want about that premise...  It\u2019s insane, it\u2019s ridiculous, it doesn\u2019t make any sense...  But it is dead fucking serious, and it never wastes any time questioning or second guessing itself.  If it did either of those things, it wouldn\u2019t have as much time to explore every single possibility that it\u2019s premise might allow, branching itself out to cover just about every detail that it can, and fleshing them out in ways that make sense because it MAKES them make sense.  It builds upon the idea of brawlers beating each other up for cheap food by figuring out why they fight, what their philosophies are, what the rules are, what kinds of people break those rules, how the brawlers interact before and after each fight, what turf wars might look like, even going as far as figuring out ways that different convenience store items, from chopsticks to shopping baskets, might be used for in combat.  If you have a question about the world of bento brawling, and it\u2019s not about the realism or practicality of the situation, it\u2019s probably answered at some point in the series.  I, for one, felt a whole new sense of depth when it was revealed that some brawlers retire from fighting and move on to take more neutral roles in the community, even though their pasts might come back to torment them.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all part of the sincerity of the series.  It knows what it should be, but refuses to be anything other than what it wants to be...  A combination of melodramatic black comedy and straight forward shounen action.  For those of you who don\u2019t know what melodrama is...  Which is understandable, as it\u2019s one of those words people hear all the time without ever really looking up...  It\u2019s the story-line equivalent of making a mountain out of a molehill, and it\u2019s not the easiest thing to pull off successfully.  In order for the audience to take the material seriously, you have to take the audience seriously.  You can\u2019t blow something out of proportion and hope they won\u2019t notice.  It\u2019s possible to get them swept up in the emotion of the story, but once they start thinking about it, they start to realize that the stakes aren\u2019t nearly as high as they thought.  Yeah, people love Angel Beats, but eventually, they start to wisen up and pick away at the show\u2019s many plotholes and deeper issues.  That\u2019s why the melancholic element has to be up front and straightforward.  If it\u2019s the central conflict, any question about it can be answered with a hearty \u201cYeah, so what?\u201d  By using that element as an obvious foundation to the story, and building from there in terms of themes and characters, the added depth gives people a much better experience upon further viewings.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the nature of that depth, it\u2019s surprisingly thorough.  When we meet Satou, he makes a point to inform us that he\u2019s lived an ordinary, boring life that\u2019s been devoid of purpose or direction.  He initially enters the bento brawls as a curiosity because he\u2019s attracted to Yarizui in both the traditional sense, the way any boy his age might pursue a girl, but also in a deeper sense.  He doesn\u2019t just want her, although he does, he wants what she has...  A passion, a purpose, something to dedicate his life to.  He begins tio pursue both, and as he progresses, they both slowly become a part of him.  He develops as a fighter, discovering the pride of a wolf and the reward of sportsmanship, all as he gradually becomes adopted into the community of like-minded fighters.  He learns what the sweet taste of accomplishment is like, and almost immediately afterwards, he learns that an undeserved victory doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to it.  This is all as he comes closer and closer to Yarizui, who\u2019s going through an arc of her own, although it\u2019s not as obvious.  I won\u2019t go into too much detail about where their journeys take them, but they are definitely in a different place than they were at the beginning of the series, both as individuals and together.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of other colorful characters supporting the story, including Satou\u2019s boisterous cousin Shaga and her friend Asebi(who I am begging to see as the main character of her own show), and while this may seem like a weird thing to praise, Satou\u2019s relationship with classmate Hana Oshiroi is like nothing else I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime.  The two of them clearly hit it off and have chemistry, but there isn\u2019t a drop of romance between them.  They form a charming dynamic right off the bat, and while Oshiroi openly objectifies him and bases her boys\u2019 love novel on his exploits, they still wind up feeling like platonic friends on equal footing, which is a refreshing change in a genre full of forced and unwarranted affections.  Unfortunately, Oshiroi also offers a segue into this show\u2019s weaknesses, which run almost as deep as it\u2019s themes.  She doesn\u2019t come into the story unencumbered, she comes packaged with a psychotic lesbian stalker who attempts to control her life and beat the crap out of anyone who comes close to her, male or female.  This is already bad, as she\u2019s yet another entry into the anime medium\u2019s collection of predatory queers, an insulting stereotype that it can\u2019t let go of, but she takes it to much worse levels.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s not so bad at first.  Her relationship to Oshiroi is ambiguous in the early episodes, and her beatings on Satou are even kind of funny...  moreso than Naru\u2019s from Love Hina by a long shot.  However, as her methods get more and more severe, any humor they could have had gets lost not only in predictability, but in the story\u2019s refusal to ever have her suffer consequences or comeuppance for her actions.  She strips Satou naked in class, makes death threats, appears out of nowhere just because the writers need her as a crutch, and in the thankfully rare moments when she\u2019s interacting with other female characters like Shaga or Oshiroi herself, the scenes play out in extremely rapey fashion, which I swear to God isn\u2019t even supposed to be funny, but sexy.  Yeah, I get the appeal of the whole girl-on-girl thing, but what kind of broken, depraved mind finds rape of any kind sexy?  Sure, Oshiroi writes about Satou in such situations, but there\u2019s a big difference between a character indulging in that kind of fantasy and the assumption that the audience will feel the same.\\n\\n\r\nEven leaving aside the sexually questionable material...  Which I didn\u2019t even scratch the surface of, believe me...  Ben-to is at it\u2019s best when it\u2019s following it\u2019s plot, and the material on the side is okay at best, cringeworthy at worst.  Yeah, I don\u2019t mind seeing Satou running through the school yard in his underwear to save his clothes from the incinerator...  It\u2019s not funny, but it\u2019s a short enough sequence to not damage the story at all...  But when an unfunny joke drags on, it REALLY drags on.  There are two episodes in this series, episodes 8 and 9, which are ungodly terrible.  They don\u2019t have anything to do with the bento brawling plot, which is probably their first mistake, and the actual laughs they offer are few and far between.  In the first one, Satou winds up in the hospital over an antic that should have offered a huge development in his relationship with Yarizui, but winds up getting quickly forgotten so two new characters can be introduced through some insultingly stupid interactions with him.  Episode 9 spends a lot of it\u2019s time on Oshiroi and Shiraume, which is just uncomfortable.  Thankfully, both of these episodes are skippable, as the only question you\u2019d really have if you skipped from episode 7 to 10 is \u201cWhy did Satou wind up in the hospital?\u201d  Unfortunately, as a reviewer, I don\u2019t have that liberty.\\n\\n\r\nBen-to is available from Funimation.  It\u2019s not available cheap however, and it\u2019s only available as a DVD/Bluray combo pack, so unless you\u2019re able to snag it from a Rightstuf or from someone on Ebay who\u2019s looking to recoup their money by getting rid of half the collection, you\u2019ll have a hard time finding it for less than forty dollars.  The original light novel by Kaito Shibano that ran for 15 volumes between 2008 and 2014 is not available stateside, and neither are the five...  count them, FIVE...  single volume spin-off manga, which is a shame, because the one called \u201cRoad to Witch\u201d sounds like it might offer some backstory for the character of Yarizui, which I\u2019m definitely interested in seeing.  Here\u2019s hoping they translate it and release it in the future!\\n\\n\r\nBen-To is a fun series that works on multiple levels, but unfortunately fails on a few equally important levels.  I\u2019ll admit that the search for purpose in one\u2019s life isn\u2019t that hard a theme to write, but it\u2019s done so well here that it still feels admirable as a result.  When it\u2019s sticking to it\u2019s plot, it offers an experience that\u2019s pleasing to people looking for a fun action series as well as viewers who are looking for something deeper to enjoy.  This dual appeal wears off whenever the story loses focus for an extended period of time, with it\u2019s attempts at delivering fanservice coming off as a desperate, tone-deaf attempt to find some new identity outside of the premise and plot that drew people into it in the first place.  Thankfully this doesn\u2019t distract from what\u2019s otherwise a smart, well written action/comedy full of interesting, memorable characters, and the worst of it is contained within two easily skippable episodes.  I know I\u2019m not the only one who would have liked to see more backstory involving the other bento brawlers, such as the nameless three and The Wizard, who we\u2019re told has a history with Yarizui, and the two wasted episodes could have easily delivered on both.  It\u2019s still a pretty awesome show, but I can\u2019t help feeling that it could have been, and deserves to have been, so much better.  All in all, this is one action series that should have had the pulp beaten out of it.  I give Ben-To a 7/10.",

            "content": "I must admit that I had thought about watching Ben-to a few times but was not fully convinced by the description that it would be worth my time. Lets face it, there are so many anime series you can watch, so why watch one that doesn't grab you with the description? Well, I finally was at a point where 'i felt like giving Ben-to a chance and I am glad I took the time to watch it.\r\nOverall: 7/10\r\nStory: 7 - Ben-to features a plot that is pretty unique. Its about the brave students that gather at the supermarket late at night when the store discountstheir Ben-to box meals 50% off, and the battles they have to determine who will walk away with delicious half priced bento and who will have to settle for cup noodles and instant ramen. The dramatic battles that unfold in these markets are epic, and some of the best competitors becomes legends whose names strike fear in the hearts of others seeking the prize. Its sort of like Highlander, only with bento boxes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 - Its nothing too strong, but for the most part the animation is fluid and the characters stay on design. Backgrounds are pretty damn average, but nothing in the art is bad in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 - Sound is definitely used to help heighten the drama around the mad grab for the bento's, but is really nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 - Some of the names that the fighters (called wolves in the series) earn are pretty funny. There's the Ice Queen, Beauty of the Lake, Club of Heracles, Pervert, Monk, and the Half Price Gods who add the 50% off labels prior to battles commencing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 - That's why you should give this a go, because it is definitely enjoyable to watch. I would suggest streaming rather than buying the series, as I feel it will have minimal rewatch value. While I wouldn't want to rewatch this series, I enjoyed the time spent watching it and have no regrets.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch bento for an enjoyable experience and a unique story line.",

            "content": "There are a lot of anime where characters use their powers to fight. And then there's Ben-to, where all you need is a grumbling stomach and 300 yen! So what makes this anime so good?\r\nAt first glance, it might look like a typical comedy anime, which is not bad. But this anime just had to add ecchi in the middle of the series. It would've been fine as a simple action comedy, but no. They had to add fanservice just 'cause. But hey, to each their own, right?\r\nPlotwise, I think the story's stable. It had tension in every arc, and it had me anticipating whatwould happen next. I also liked the idea of dividing the city into \"west\" and \"east\", depicting a humorous presentation of violent groups who are crazy for half-priced bento.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I liked about this series, it's the music. It fits the atmosphere it sets in. For example, the bgm for the fight scenes really had me all pumped up and wanted to join in on the battle as well. Kudos to that.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an action-packed anime (kinda), the art really fit into the category.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the characters, specifically because they weren't all falling for the MC. I'm just glad that it didn't become a harem, else it would've ruined the mood of the anime. The girls were simply girls with big appetite and small cash.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime, especially while you're eating your lunch box. That way, you can feel how exciting it is to be in the world of ben-to!",

            "content": "If you're hungry for a quick, no-frills meal of ecchi-based action, look no further than this 12-course filler. In the world of ben-to, inflation has apparently gone so high that normal students can no longer afford meals (bento boxes). However, craving the delectable combination that each succulent box contains, the students lurk nightly in grocery chains awaiting each store's half-price god. However, as supply is much shorter than the demand at that rate, a fair means must be used to ensure that everyone have a shot at the boxes. Thus, the honorable system used by \"wolves\" (fighting) is employed by bookworms, jocks, and vixens toall brawl (in the store) for the chance to walk away with a tasty victory.\\n\\n\r\nThis series seems to mix in some ingredients from other shows. The main protagonist is nicknamed \"hentai\" as he often ends up naked or becomes otherwise illogically undressed in a similar fashion to Keita in Inukami, and the series throws in an over-sized portion of random jargon and terminology (as well as nicknames for everyone) similar in scale to that used in Hidan no Aria.\\n\\n\r\nThe almost mockingly ironic premise is hilariously implausible; pretty much just an excuse for lots of fighting and occasional ecchi. But if that's all you need to satisfy your hunger, then this fairly light series that goes nowhere might just be the right combo meal for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe overall animation is fairly average for your run of the mill show, but some of the backgrounds are indeed eye candy. For instance, I was quite impressed by the level of detail in the supermarkets (all the products on the shelves...). The color palette is ever so slightly under saturated though hardly noticeable. Character styling isn't anything particularly special though I question whether some of the outfits are really what they ought to be wearing during fighting... I did find it quite hilarious that they had actual Virtua Fighter 2 sequences in the show as I wasted quite a bit of my youth in that game.\\n\\n\r\nThere is substantial blood at times, coupled with a magical, computer-game like recovery speed (considering that wolves fight nightly). There is substantial action though for the most part it's just a lot of punching with the occasional \"shroud of darkness\" where a special attack is so potent that the drawer apparently couldn't keep up. The battle scenes are nothing spectacular and are comparable with a lot of other harem-ish fighting series such as the fairly recent Majikoi. To be honest, most of the time it's just the protagonist getting beaten to a pulp or otherwise being abused by other characters. As for ecchi, clothes here aren't made from seaweed sheets so it's limited to intentional breast->face attacks and a lot of bouncy bits. The series focuses more on indirect ecchi such as a special bento box in the shape of two omlette rice portions with a bit of the stem and top of two red peppers to top it off. The only one really getting any \"exposure\" is the main character, reminds me way too much of Inukami.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a typical, fitting rock-based song though the melody doesn't really whet my appetite. The ED is a more mellow melody that fits well with a food coma. The BGM varies from a Amazon theme for Shiraume to electric guitars for fighting wolves. It fits fine though some of the supermarket theme songs are quite hilarious as they try to brainwash unsuspecting shoppers.\\n\\n\r\nVAs were fair overall with some having heartier roles than others. No one was a super standout in this series as there are way too many characters in general.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFor a series with a harem's worth of girls and a supposed focus on action, they really could have done a lot better here. I felt like I was promised a grand meal and ended up with one of those diet 100-calorie chip packets.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows our hopelessly hungry protagonist as he gets introduced as a \"wolf\" and joins his \"parent\", sempai Yarizui, as they \"hunt\" for their prey. It's divided into two meals/arcs, the first one about a dude from the other side of town trying to satisfy his ego and the second one about twins who have to come to grips with their past. Each of the two arcs feel more like plateaus with the intensity of eating plain konnyaku as there's so little back story that you really can't help but not care about what's going on. Perhaps it also is related to the illogical nature of the premise as I just couldn't take much of anything seriously (strength through hunger, right...).\\n\\n\r\nThink of the plot as just a means to bring about additional battles and pointless beatings of the protagonist. I don't think they even bothered to give the series any form of conclusion either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is like an angry fruit salad. You have a sadistic yuri, a macho-loving writer, a masochistic dude that secretly worships the protagonist, busty European relatives, and a bunch of emotionally-stunted girls to name a few. Not only are there way too many ingredients in ben-to, but many of these are random side character dishes. There are at least a dozen characters introduced with a seemingly-important title that you can practically remove from the story with no impact whatsoever. Unfortunately, the series spends a lot of time on these supporting characters that actually don't support much at all, so much so that it detracts from learning about the important primary characters.\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe the supporting characters are just there to give some flavoring to the main entree as all the primary characters here are completely static save the main character. And his only development is somehow gaining Saiyan powers and miraculously growing from a wimp to a person who can beat other \"legendary\" wolves within a matter of months (including many trips to the hospital- which obviously would have dented his insufficient funding even further).\\n\\n\r\nThis means that if you're looking for any relationships (other than virtual in the mind of Oshiroi) you ought to look elsewhere as they get further in even Majikoi than they do here.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nTo use a fitting metaphor, don't expect a full-service Sashimi dinner out of this one; it's only a bentou. While there is enough going on to keep you from falling asleep, it's not going to wow you into a second serving. Overall a fairly plain series, you can find better in this genre elsewhere. The primary value (or negative value) in this series is that it will make you fat/forever hungry as the characters talk incessantly about food. The secondary value in the series is the ridiculousness of the scenario. I'd pass this ben-to for a quicker cup noodle thank you very much.",

Personal Opinion people, I understand that my reviews may not appeal to some people, but I hope I can be helpful. I try not to spoil anything in my reviews cause I want them to help people who haven't watched the show.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nWhat can a show called \"Ben-to\" possibly be about. Are they just buying Ben-to boxes and comparing them off in class to see who can make the best or something. NO! This show went in with the firstepisode starting off with the main character lying on the floor, with bruises and such. This story was new and refreshing. I've never heard or seen of a thing where people fight in the local market for Half-priced Ben-to boxes. It is as great as it sounds. That's something I would love to try. The sory was great and unique, which particularly helps make for a cool show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI actually really liked the art style, and the action scenes were pretty cool. Solid stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nAbout average sound, but I did enjoy the opening. It matched well with the show's take on action and such, While some epic music would've been cool, I'd say the music was more light, making the audience try to just relax and enjoy the scenes instead of it attracting the audience to get super excited.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nAgain about average. I had forgotten the main character's looks, but did remember the main heroine's looks. Also they had a good name for what they called the people who fought for the Ben-tos. \"Wolves\". In which Wolves that were very skilled or stood out got a Nom de guerre, so it was interesting, cool and funny cause the heroine has a cool Nom de guerre, \"Ice Queen\", whereas the main character got \"The Freak.\" LOL.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nIt doesn't measure up to other shows, but I well enjoyed the show and believe that it was a good watch in terms of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nCloser on the 8 side, but not just there in comparison to other animes yet. In conclusion though, it was a great watch, I recommend this show to mainly anyone who needs something refreshing after watching a show they really enjoyed, because it will keep he/she in that great mood, but not get too depressed when the show scomes to an end because it is only 12 episodes.",

The fighting is done with a code of honor and there is a system with rules in place. The drab life of a fundless boarding school kid being filled with such an intense purpose is surprising fulfilling. I expected senseless violence and that is not what this story is about.\r\nThere are a couple of really colorful supporting characters in this story. The main character is a bit depressing at first, but he comes to life as he learns that fighting fordiscounted lunches makes him appreciate the little things. He forms some strong bonds, and goes from sheep to wolf in a den of wolves.\\n\\n\r\nGreat story, worth watching every episode. There are some surprises and I found it overall a fulfilling yet short series. Don't skip this one.",

            "content": "With such a silly premise, can Ben-To deliver consistent, appetizing results? For the most part, I would say yes. This anime has three main dishes to it: the fighting, the comedy, and the characters- in that order.\r\nThe fighting in this anime is extremely exciting and well animated. Both the choreography and detailed animation, always left me hungry for more. When the episodes sometimes  didn't have fights or only showed the result of a fight, I found myself deprived of my nightly Ben-To meal.  However, when the fights did happen, they were the highlight of the show, often-times shown at the end as aclimax, and often left me satisfied but desiring seconds. \\n\\n\r\nThe best thing, I liked about Ben-To's fights was the refreshing taste of not having to watch the main protagonist struggle for episode upon episode, learning new moves or skills or techniques, and then getting tons of side commentary from side-characters so that the fights last three episodes to six episodes long. These fights may last a few minutes at most but are intense, full of flavor, and rich in detail. The fights may not do anything new or unique but what they animated they animated well. I enjoyed the pacing of comedy with intense good fighting sequences.\\n\\n\r\nIf you got a taste for hilarious slap-stick comedy, you'll find this anime has heaps of second helpings. Ranging from the usual over-active guy's imagination to the exotic Bento food, you'll find some laughs in the common places and even in some unexpected ones. In my opinion, the unexpected ones were the best.\\n\\n\r\nLike a well-planned 7-course meal, this anime has some extremely good timing on the jokes, with just enough length that the ingredients in the first course become even funnier in the fourth or fifth in combination with the other previous courses. In one particular take on the classic pool-side episode I found myself laughing for pretty much the entire episode. The humor style runs the gamut of flavors, you have your sexual perversion, crude humor, over-active imagination, hilarious situations, exaggerated beat-downs, and extreme cuteness. Overall, I believe the humor was pretty consistent and just enough that they didn't taste over-used. My only dislike was what seemed like the excessively violent nature of Ume though on closer inspection I think it was never un-justifed, just repetitive and almost evil. However, I don't hold this against the anime since each person has their tastes.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the laughs from this anime come from the characters, and the characters this anime are diverse and ranging in tastes. Some may find themselves loving one characters and hating another. I believe this richness in the anime does have its benefits, and also results in some really good comedy when timed just right. In some respects, I'd say the intensiveness of the laughs are just as intense as the fights. Just because the range of characters, and the jumping between characters, are meant to create the chaotic and hilarious atmosphere this anime centers around- intense and seemingly random fights at the supermarket.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to this anime I'd say would be the inconsistent results. Sometimes with the anime trying to give every flavor to appeal to such a wide audience, you'll enjoy some parts of the anime and get bored of other parts. People watching it for the fights like me, may be discouraged from the lapse in fighting or the pure epicness of every fight. People that enjoy certain characters may find those characters not shown or highlighted as much as they'd like. If like me you were looking for really great laughs in-between the great fights, the re-arrangement of the ingredients that make the show entertaining resulted in some great episodes and some lagging or filler episodes, depending on what you enjoyed most about the show. However, I think this show delivered on the balance, never spending too much on the fights, too much on one-character, too much on the same gag, and would continue to push the story forward. Most likely though, if you like one particular emphasis such as a character, or fights or even romance, you'll find it lacking since Ben-To never just focuses or develops too in depth on one thing.\\n\\n\r\nI would say, that despite its inconsistency, Ben-to delivers great entertainment- good food and the occasional awesome dessert, that will whet the appetite of any comedy or action lover due to its attempt to try everything. You gotta respect an anime that tries to mix the standard contemporary animes up a bit, and you sometimes get great dishes and you sometimes get ok dishes. Specializing in just the same formula over and over again, would probably please one particular audience a lot but after awhile get them tired of the same dish over and over again. Maybe not- some people can eat Pizza or Spaghetti for life. xD But for the average person, I think Ben-To will fill that spot in your stomach without giving you the same thing so much you forget what makes this anime fun and entertaining to watch.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this anime and I would have scored it higher but for one thing.  The writers made a gargantuan mistake towards the end which rendered everything that went before it completely pointless.\r\nI'm sure everyone knows by now that this anime is about a group of students who choose to do battle over half-priced packed lunches in the supermarkets.  It's a novel idea and an interesting one.  It certainly caught my interest and I was thoroughly enjoying it, right up until that woeful bit of writing at the end.\r\nEarly on, the writers went to great lengths to make it clear thatthere's two types of people who fight for ben-to.  Some fight in groups, or packs, and are known as dogs.  Others fight alone and are known as wolves.  It's made abundantly clear to the viewer that being a wolf is what matters.  Wolves fight with honour and are the true legends of these battles.  Dogs, we're led to believe are lesser mortals.  An excellent point and they explained it well.  Then it all went south.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, without giving too much away, a pair of siblings turn up and join in the battles.  They fight as a team and use baskets as weapons.  In keeping with what the writers had informed us, this therefore should make them dogs as they fight as a team.  Dishonourable dogs at that, because they use weapons which is cheating.  Alas, no.  The last few episodes are very much about the fact that these cheating siblings must be accepted as they're the best wolf; and any wolf should always welcome the challenge of beating the best.  Now, hang on!  Of course they're the best, there's two of them and they use weapons.  They're dogs.  The writers seemed to miss this however.  They were written in purely as wolves even though they fail to fit the show's own definition of what a wolf is.  They do however, match the shows description of what dogs are.  To make matters even more bewildering, at one point the siblings decided to dub two of the males wolves \"two dogs\", an attempt at a nickname.  Not once did it occur to the writers that in that situation at least of one them would have said, \"That's rich coming from you.\"\\n\\n\r\nI watched the last few episodes in the hope that it wasn't a mistake and something might be revealed to let us know why these two obvious dogs were being heralded as the ultimate wolf but it didn't happen.  The writers had simply set up guildelines for us to understand then ignored them and wrote something that didn't fit.  That bewildering oversight pretty much ruined it for me.  I was very much enjoying it until then.  I'd still recommend people watch it but I'd advise them to pretend the siblings are actually one person and overlook their use of baskets as weapons.  If you can do that, you'll enjoy this show immensely.",

            "content": "On paper, the premise of Ben-To seems ridiculous. A shonen battle series about people who literally engage in fist fights over half priced bento meals in super markets. It's the kind of ridiculous story that could only work in anime.\r\nI haven't read the manga, so I don't know how it holds up as an adaptation. The anime series does a good job at making the ridiculous premise enjoyable by making the characters enjoyable and establishing Fight Club-esque rules for the food fighting. This series has a lot of stereotypical character types, and the main protagonist suffers a lot of physical abuse that he doesn't deserve(from female members of the cast). \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting animation is very fluid and alive, but character designs go off-model fairly often. The theme song is really catchy and actually ties into the series (if you read the subtitles for the lyrics). I watched the English dub of the series and the cast chosen did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a crazy idea that I found very enjoyable nonetheless. The story is engaging and the world-building makes the scenario seem more plausible. If you like shonen battle series or food fights, check Ben-To out.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, why do I keep getting recommendations from friends, only to be disappointed?\r\nWe deal today with something that I think should be re-done, and done right this time.\r\nI mean to review \"Ben-To\".\r\nWhile I enjoy writing good reviews, and I really detest writing scathing reviews; I keep having to wade though the end products of a bunch of degenerates and downright stupid writers and authors of the noble craft of Anime.\r\nAs of 9:00pm today, I have finished the twelfth episode of something that had every right to have been made into an Anime that could have pressed every one of my 'watchability buttons'. And failedmiserably. 4.7 hours of wasted effort. After about the 5th episode I began to feel the sting of being cheated. I thereafter became increasingly certain, until the final curtain of this miserable piece of non-art, and finally surrendered into outright rage.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even going to waste my time rating the parts of the Anime, that most people expect, because Ben-To and its' authors don't respect the public well enough to even do a decent job of their own product. School life done as a failure of everything civilized. Romance done completely wrong. Hatreds with sincere outcomes, failed. They couldn't even succeed at a decent form of hentai. Even that too, was botched.\\n\\n\r\nI'll only say this; the sound was adequate, the music at least was not J-PoP (something some of you know I despise), the artwork tolerable, and the story which had promise could have been okay. But the production team blew it, by going for what they thought would attract a younger demographic, which is foolish. It's the parents that have the money, and most of them will not tolerate their children watching this kind of silly, uneducated, and pointless tripe.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've done my best to show the stuff I was not enraged by, I can discuss Ben-To with the outright rage that this 'product' deserves.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe entire purpose of Ben-To was to encourage young teenagers to think that causing a riot within a grocery store for discount boxed-lunch, is tantamount to honorable samurai or Jedi conduct. Which it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nLet's look angrily at the facts;\\n\\n\r\n1). The school these kids go to, and several others, supplies breakfast, but nothing else; as part of their dormitory functions. Students who have meager money therefore find the search for cheap rations a near necessity. Which leads many to get involved in a poker-game known as 'Wolf'ing; which means becoming a brawler in the context of multiple person bare-knuckle riots. This brings about the multiple injuries of several of the main characters, and many minor characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat of course leaves the losers weaker than they started because they don't get enough to eat. Survival of the fittest, within the context of civilized high-school life. Does anybody really like this picture?\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, reality never reaches the consciousness of the authors, or the viewer. Hidden in all the Bushido (intentional rhyme with a mangled word that I never use in public), is the plain fact, that the only reason fresh food is discounted, is because it's fresh food. If the store doesn't do so, or waits until it is too late; the food will spoil and be thrown away as a health hazard. 'God of Discounts'? Really? Is that as good as the authors could do?\\n\\n\r\nSchool is supposed to be a place of quiet reflection, studious endeavor, and relaxed striving for academic excellence. One then makes their own challenges. Having to add the severe injuries of the previous night to this list of condensed milk makes Jimmy and Jane dull people; in class and outside of class. Not to mentioned the obvious bruises on the face, body and appendages.\\n\\n\r\nThese points, lead us to a recognition of the voyeurism of a prize fight, in the wrong setting.\\n\\n\r\n2). Considerations of threats.\\n\r\nWhat does the viewer think is going to happen to the combatants when they get thrown or punched into  a isle shelf, or a marketing display, or worse destroy a cooler full of high-priced meats; and of course, splatter it all over the store? Sweetness and light, from the store owner? Of course, we never see any outcome at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat will happen, because of these riots, when the police show up? '... it's okay, we'll see you people tomorrow night? ...'. The police never show up.\\n\\n\r\nMaking friends with fellow combatants, has a lot of personal problems for our hapless heros, doesn't it? Wanna bet some of the competing girls will feel like dating the guys that just broke every bone in their face? We never see the consequences of these brawls, because everything is sweetness and light. Besides, Samurai Nobility is at the heart of knocking the duck excrement out of your best friends, right? How could anybody hold that against anybody else?\\n\\n\r\nA female Student Body President (Shiraume Ume) that takes a severe dislike to our male hero (You Sato), because he has a way of talking her girlfriend (Hana Oshiroi) out of lesbian fun, to the extent of her getting hot and bothered by pictures of men, and writing about them; ends in our hero getting the crud kicked out of him by our President. Repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nMainly because nobody will touch her, oh I dunno, how about a good swift kick behind the knees and then proceeding to break every bone in her face seems only reasonable. After all, she leaves him in severe bruises and beatings, repeatedly, for no earned reason.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what passes for the rare recurring humor in the show. There are some minor bits, involving Ayame Shaga and her attempts at seduction of You Sato, and the running gags involving the irrepressible Asebi Inoue, who always has a cold, and always has this ability to laugh about the spilt milk involving a permanent bad-luck spree.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut waiting in the wings of this play, but never really allowed on stage, is the obvious romantic interest of Sen Yarizui for You Sato. Why not? The show is already botched, why not jump in with both feet and finish at least one thing in the huge list of unfinished disasters? But no, the producers wasted their time, and mine.\\n\\n\r\nLook folks, I wanted to like this show, but was just plain disenchanted by the constant non-retaliatory strikes against people nobody hated, or ever would. Why not? Some of the characters actually did deserve to get their mutton chopped. Cosmic Justice is sometimes the right thing to do. Several people should have had their stuffing punched into oblivion, and we never got to see that happen. It was all just good fun right?\\n\\n\r\nThe following earned and needed severe beatings: Shiraume Ume, the Sawagi Sisters. The following should have earned bare-bottom spanking with a two-by-four: Ayame Shaga. The following should have gotten personal relationship training, nobody should have to put up with repeated forcible lesbian rape (after Shiraume Ume got put in the hospital): Hana Oshiroi.\\n\\n\r\nVirtually every one of our school student body's of several schools (involved in the nightly riots), and both sides of town; should be arrested, and be charged as an adult, convicted of serious rioting, and jailed for long prison sentences. That would have stood as reality. But this a very bad form of fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nSo I finish a lousy review of a lousy show, that if this had never seen the light of day, would never have forced me to write such a lousy review. There is nothing here to grab onto and like.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no heart, no soul, no joy, no laughter, no honor, no comedy, no tragedy, no sense of anything of importance lost, nothing of importance ever gained; and most of all no sense of real theatre.\\n\\n\r\nSatoshi Adachi, is the Executive Producer of this masterpiece of macabre garbage, and therefore needs a severe horse-whipping. \\n\\n\r\nI give this nonsense a weak 5.\\n\\n",

Sometimes, you can just make something FUN. And that is the best word I can use to describe Ben-To; fun.\r\nAlthough, it would've been nice to see more of a coherent and expanding story, which was not what we got. However, the premise is very good and crazy, being very out there. I love how Anime and Japan can do this, take a basic story and make it interesting with a unique twist or a weird premise.\r\nThe characters are overall not incrediblystrong, but still, again, very fun. I like these characters. You, Hana, Ayame, and Sen, they're all fun and playful characters that are likable in their silliness. Even the random side characters like Brunette and Monk are weird but also kind of charming. I know I'm not being very descriptive, but the important thing to take from my explanation is that, while not completely unique in anime terms, the characters are still endearing.\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the soundtrack, it fits the action quite well, and it's catchy. I also really like the opening theme, it's very catchy and upbeat, and it gives a great feeling for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also quite good, especially in the action, which can be very dynamic and entertaining. It's also very over the top with it's own logic and insanity, which is something that I love seeing. Realistic and gritty action can be great, but when physics get put into question, suddenly it becomes a lot more fun.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're in the mood for a great time, even if it is a bit mindless, Ben-To is a good anime to check out. It is very enjoyable.",

But later i did understand.  In world where you earn less, but expenses are great, half priced food is very appreciated. I love Bento, and i learn to make several  different types of Bento myself, but of course ingredients still cost money, \r\nI like the humor in this show, especially perverted one between Satou and that crazy perverted guard with batteries. The last scene where he show four large batteries , i laughso much that it hurts. \\n\\n\r\nAgain i love this anime, it is shame there is no second season, but voice actors really did their job well, Emiri Katou, Hiro Shimono, Yui Horie and rest really did their best. \\n\r\nDo i recommend this for watching, yes i do. Although i like it, i give it 8, because its to short and some smaller things i didn't really like.",

I thought I would skip through the entire thing to the interesting parts but I didn't...\r\nStory 7/10: Okay... The story isn't amazing right. I mean it's a well thought and perfectly executed story line and I enjoyed it... but it's a bunch of kids fighting over half priced bentos at a supermarket? The story progressed well at the beginning although I was kinda confused at the beginning due to them taking forever toexplain what was actually going on. Was getting kinda annoyed that it took them so long too explain that people were fighting over half priced bentos and there was basically no reason to it. Also I would love to know how the male main turned into a badass fighter in the case of no where? Like no training? He was just explained what happens and he some how got better?... \\n\r\nBut still I really enjoyed how the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Art was fairly decent and nothing looked out of place. The fight scenes were really well done and overall it just looked really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: This is probably based on just one part of the anime but that fight music at the end was amazing! I felt pumped up listening to it and watching the fight scenes go down. Like damn!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: Honestly wasn't much character develop further the entire thing and it was one of those animes where you don't expect very much to happy at all and it seemed a little like fan service but probably not. Characters were good and I think they each fit into each part apart from Hana... I still don't understand what the whole reason her being there was for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed it, I think it could of definitely done with some romance init? Maybe just me but I did notice slight hints at a crush in there and I would of really liked for it to develop further but at last it did not! Disappointing! Give this a watch if you love watching anime fight scenes over bentos ma dudes",

            "content": "A little late for a review on this one. Oh well. X3\r\nThe history of humanity is covered in blood. Through history, countless battles were fought. Thousands of lives were lost. Thousands of cities were turned into collateral damage. Often, the greatest battles of humanity had come with a reward to the winner, while the losers would bathe in defeat. Now, this bloody cycle continues. In modern Japan, our modern warriors fight for an oh-so-modern prize. . . . . Discounted Box Lunches!!!!!\r\nWell, that pretty much sums it up. Oh, I forgot one last thing. A Harem! Although it seems that they tried a little toohard on trying to shove all that fighting and emotion into a Harem. At times, it even seems stressful just to try to take the serious parts serious, and the funny parts, well, funny. But it's not that big of a drawback. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. It fits perfectly well with the whole \"convenience-store war\" thing they have going on. It has a colorful array of places, as well as characters, and it also adds a little aesthetic cuteness to the scene. So there will be a little bit of moe.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is spectacular. I was very impressed with the OP, especially. They made the right choice on Aimi to sing this. The ED was nice as well. They also had little insert songs for each supermarket, an element which I found pretty cute. (Especially the Tokiwa Supaa)\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I can very much say Ben-to would be a good watch for all types of anime fans. I can't say for the ones who would dive in an anime for a deep plot though, since the plot isn't really that deep (A little shallow even). But all in all, I would say this should be a plus one to any otaku's \"to watch list\"",

When he comes to he is warned to stay away by a mysterious girl. On his first day at his private high school he meets the mysterious girl (Sen) and joins the the half priced food club and introduced to the world and culture of Ben-to brawls which a fightsfor half priced Ben-to in supermarkets. Beginning as a dog (beginner) Sato soon progresses to be a wolf (expert) and begins to win his half priced ben-to and gets his own nom de guerre, Freak or Hentai in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nSato gets beat up a lot and not just in the Ben-to brawls he is often the victim of Ume the jealous yuri student council president, Ume who is in love with his friend Hana.\\n\\n\r\nAs a parody it struggles to escape the bizarre and is amusing rather than outright funny. However, it is a good watch but there are funnier anime.\\n\\n\r\nI am proud to announce that thanks to Ben-to I managed to get my first Japanese pun.

And each top wolf has its own \"area\" in which it hunts. In a really dumb way, the anime is like playing a strategy game. In a dumb way. Dumb.\r\nBut the action is insane. The story is also very unique. I'm convinced the author must have seen a fight about bento and that's how the idea came to fruition.\r\nI love the music. Both the fighting theme andthe ending theme. \\n\r\nBut I am biased, because I bonded with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it as an action-comedy anime.",

Prior to this, I had been burning myself out on, 'slice of life,' and 'comedy,' focused shows so this was actually a welcome experience.\r\nStory: I suppose the story on it's base isn't particularly interesting or fascinating, but the idea of a bunch of students battling for a money saving meal is fun. The way this premise is turned into an epic battle over territories and pride just makes the pay-off feel satisfying. If you like the declaration of values before a big fight, than you're on theright track.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Having been lucky enough to watch the show in 720p on a capable computer I will say that the art is pretty eye-candy. The action is fast and the character designs (while generic at times,) are fun to watch in motion. The art for some of the bento's had me drooling, so that's also a plus.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well, the voices were appropriate. I especially liked Hana's voice acting because it sounded like the actress was having fun at times. The themes are the average J-Pop songs that are to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I liked the variety, personally. Even though I am familiar with the archetypes, the way the characters dance out their lines and actions was enjoyable. I must also mention that Yarizuri isn't your average melancholy upperclassman, but also shows a bit of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bias warning! I watched this show with a hope for fun, over-the-top action and guess what? It delivered. The premise is wacky enough and the character interactions are funny and enjoyable. Overall, I would have to say that the characters create the world they wish to portray. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Listen, if you are like me and seek the occasional wacky, over-the-top, epic anime about a subject matter that seems banal 95% of the time, than you will find this show to be a joy. This is a fun series that only takes itself seriously when need be in order to up the 'epic,' factor. It was a blast!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, shout-outs to Satou for having a Fantasy Zone poster being displayed proudly. I respect that Sega love, ha.",

It was nice, but it wasn't what I expected.\r\nThe story was somewhat mediocre. Fight Club-style battles that take place in supermarkets and grocery stores for various products. Gangs fight with each other and their leaders take the stamps of vegetables, fruits etc as trophies of their victory. The story sounds pretty shallow and in order to upgrade it, they gave an unessecary depth and showered the anime with tons of useless details. It could have been better off without them.\r\nWhenit comes to art, there is a good amount of fanservice for those interested. The battle scenes are well coordinated and depicted nicely without too much confusion. The character models are unique for each person and their styles are different. Not a bad job there.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very poor, consisting of only a couple of tracks. Although the battle theme is really neat and has a lot of energy in it, I don't think it fits well for grocery store beat-up. They could have chosen something better and add some more tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, at least most of them, cheesy. Nearly all members of the female cast exist to satisfy your fanservice needs (luckily, they achieved that), while the male ones are predictable, lacking depth and development. Nothing impressive there.\\n\\n\r\nMost possibly you will enjoy this one, since it combines weird plot with a nice dose of fanservice with cheap, easy but impossible to resist humour.

            "content": "Single season anime based on light novels are a dime a dozen, enough of them having come out in the past five years to oversaturate the market with mediocrity. That said, I\u2019ve found that around eighty or ninety percent of these anime are given the same score by me. Every time I give this sort of anime a solid six out of ten. And I know I\u2019ve just spoiled the entire review in the first paragraph now, but I feel that it\u2019s worth discussing how light novels influence anime and anime produced about light novels are so boringly adequate. Light novels themselves are typically badlywritten scripts for anime, thrown together in book form with the occasional illustration. That isn\u2019t the case with many (Spice and Wolf and Haruhi Suzumiya are among the very few light novels I can recommend) but the ones that get turned into anime are very often that way.  The Devil is a Part Timer, Aria the Scarlet Ammo, Ben-To, Haiyore! Nyaruko-San. And let me iterate that all of these have good ideas behind them. The devil works at McDonalds, a high school for detectives, people battling for half-priced bento boxes, Lovecraftian horrors come to Earth as cute girls. But each and every one of these is executed poorly beyond that good idea. Most of them contain a very boring main male lead who we as an audience are supposed to put ourselves in the shoes of. Which is how these anime and light novels succeed: they\u2019re fantasy simulators. If you make the lead character the most boring, characterless person possible, the male viewer or reader can stick himself in the role.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems being, beyond that, these anime have no savory components. The initial idea is typically very inventive or funny, but the execution is flawed beyond that. Aside from the main lead comes a cast of varied females, the more the merrier (and the more varied, the more male viewers). The plot plods along, introducing new arcs every few episodes to keep the viewer engaged. But, by four or five episodes in, the series has lost the initial pleasure and its\u2019 existence becomes merely arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nThus, Ben-To. How can a guy write nine novels (so far) around the concept of battles taking place in Japanese supermarkets for the half priced bento boxes sold before close? Especially when an anime that covers two of the novels overstays its\u2019 welcome? The first episode and the initial revelation that this is an anime about mosh-pit style brawls over half priced lunch boxes is absolutely hilarious and clever. But then it keeps going, introducing gangs and federations that band together to fight for the bento, then twins who are so powerful no one can beat them. That\u2019s the extent of the plot. This weak plot is padded with the prerequisite pool episode that further exemplifies the generic quality. It\u2019s almost like these anime are factory made, though with a small difference in the mold to fit the plot or characters better.This generecism is further compounded with the tsundere, the kuudere, the yaoi-obsessed sex fiend, the lesbian, the incestuous twins, and the dorky klutz characters who round out a cast cut and pasted from many other series of the same quality.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Ben-To can be enjoyable. It\u2019s definitely occasionally funny and the fight scenes are well animated and better than anime with four times Ben-To\u2019s budget. At the same time, the animation is still pretty cheap and generic, managing to make the girls cute as hell but not make anything else stand-out. And while the animation plays to the girls\u2019 benefit, it\u2019d help if the script and character development made these cute girls memorable. Rather than build up any of the characters, it decides to instead subject us to pointless lesbianism, a lot of worthless episodes and fights, and pretty much two arcs that could be resolved in one episode but are instead spread out like a pea sized glob of butter over toast.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the kind of anime I can easily dismiss if I wanted to. It\u2019s an easy target to abuse. But at the same time, it\u2019s really not that bad. In the grand scheme of things, it manages to be entertaining without being very good. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s cute a lot of times, and it\u2019s a decent way to pass a few hours.  Would I suggest it? No. Would I suggest buying the recently released Blu-Ray? No. For certain people, they\u2019ll find a lot of enjoyment in it. But I don\u2019t see a lot of merits within. An anime can\u2019t survive exclusively on cute characters and one good idea. As much as I love cuteness and girls in short skirts and long socks, there has to be substance beyond thighs and boobs. And that substance can come from a well-executed plot, character development, or even good comedy or world building. But Ben-To is exceptionally shallow and average in all four of those areas.  It\u2019s a good average, but good average isn\u2019t really a compliment.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about Ben-To because it doesn\u2019t give me much reason to say anything. And typically an anime like that can be dismissed as average. If you can\u2019t complain about how bad it is or rave about how good it is,  then it\u2019s merely there. And that\u2019s Ben-To in a nutshell, it\u2019s just there.",

            "content": "So here's the thing... I don't think this show is very good, and that is rather bothersome, seeing as how this series held the potential to be very entertaining (which is mostly was, do not mistake this as me suggesting I did not enjoy it.) The biggest problem with this show for me was that it sold itself on the premise of a ridiculous action show, and every episode worked towards a climax to such a tune. While it did a justifiably entertaining job when geared towards a silly action-packed romp, in my opinion, the show shined brightest during the quiet comedic slice-of-life moments, andthis became problematic for me. I'll try to elaborate more clearly as I delve into the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.\\n\\n\r\nI ended up giving the story a 7 because it is an entertaining shot that just barely misses the mark. This leaves it in a \"good,\" place for me; not great, not awful, just good. For example, the show is 100% built on an absurd premise: extreme fighting over half-priced bentos. The absurdity of this claim rests entirely upon how exactly wild the fighting is, and unfortunately for me, the fighting was often a bit tame for what the premise seemed to promise, initially. This forced me to instead fixate on the story outside of the actual fighting, in which case the show became a school-life anime, and this better delivered the absurdity, to me. The constant assaults, perverted misfortunes (cliche, but I'll always laugh at someone running around naked, call me old-fashioned) and miscommunications were always great. At the end of the day though, if I wanted a funny school-life anime, I would pick through the plethora out there that focus on doing exactly that more thoroughly. Perhaps I am just being picky (but that is, after-all, the point of a review?) but I wish the show would have had more interesting and crazy fights, instead of a few punches and kicks. It paid ample homage to fighting shows in many ways (including the obvious \"alias\" for fighting) but no one had a signature move and worst of all, the character's perceived power levels fluctuated so drastically between episodes I actually never got around to getting a head for ranking the fighters. I'll elaborate on that more in \"Character.\" In all honesty, this show flung itself in-between two other shows that have a similar feel to me: Shokugeki and Dagashi Kashi. I believe that Shokugeki succeeds as the superior anime because (while the characters are a bit more fleshed out and nontraditional) it sticks to its premise and delivers absurdity expertly plated for the audience. The entire show is funny and entertaining, just like Ben-To, but where they differ is when Shokugeki begins a fight, I am 100% on board and in the moment. For Ben-To, the fights sort of run together and fizzle out. Ben-To succeeds against Dagashi Kashi though, in my opinion, because it does not focus too much on the slice of life aspect like Dagashi did. The absurd nature of all three of these shows does well with some \"real life,\" basis in the plot line, but Dagashi captured the monotony of real life in its pacing, whereas Shokugeki is electric the whole way through, and Ben-To bounces between interesting moments for me. The final flaw for me is that there is no looming plotline throughout the story. The plot is literally just getting some cheap food when hungry, and this just brings us back to the issue I have between viewing it as an unsuccessful slice-of-life. There are moments hinted at, such as The Wizard's cryptic study abroad or Monarch Butterfly's past with the games. These are never elaborated on really though (I assume the manga does so much better) and the show ultimately suffers as being seen as episodic, which is not generally my half-priced cup of tea. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am not educated in art technique, I can at least say that this was a pretty anime and it did not rely on heavy CGI graphics or budget shots, which is a particular pet-peeve of mine. The colors were vivid, the animation was smooth, and the character design was attractive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was professional, and the score was always fitting. I gave a 7 because no voice actor, song, or moment in the score stood out enough for me to recognize that, and to that, I must assume it just did a good job and succeeded in fulfilling the requirements of all three areas of sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.\\n\\n\r\nI've been going back and forth on my rating for this, but I think I'll just start speaking now and stop second-guessing myself. I gave this series an 8, and surprisingly, I did so for the secondary characters, not the main characters. Satou, Shaga, and Yarizui are all just tropes, and I loved them for the exact same reason I have always loved them. The fool with an iron will and a heart of gild, the cold \"Kuudere,\" character who is detatched from the world but somehow warm to the main character, and of course a healthy sprinkling of cousin-complex love interest that is never viewed as one. These are fine archetypes, and we keep them around for a reason, but I often prefer them as secondary characters, leaving us with more dynamic and individual main characters. This show does the opposite for me, in that while Oshiroi and Asabi are both static secondary characters, they consistently had me dying with laughter as the absurdity of the character. I think the reason why this works so well is because, as I have probably said too many times by this point, this is to be an absurd show, and these two characters are by far the most absurd. As a matter of fact, these two dominated the comedy for me, most of the time, and was just another hanging factor that made me feel like I was just missing something from this show. My biggest complaint though was unreliable power levels. Satou gets demolished his first fight, but then very quickly into the series is shown as an able fighter, beating people known to be stronger than him. My problem with this is that even after defeating Nikaidou and Monarch, he still does not seem to have a name (aliases or otherwise). Later, he is thrashed instantly on two separate occasions by Othros, but then shows up the third time and it is implied (with a Laurel sticker) that he beats both of them himself, when two days prior and with no special training he could not beat them even with the help of the \"unbeatable\" Ice Cold Witch. Monk, Hairdye, and other guy (?) also seem to slip in and out of being actually powerful, and they still call him \"pooch,\" (a slightly derogatory name for a newcomer) even though he has obviously proven himself a more able warrior. This constant power shifting did not sit well with me, nor did the decision to not mention a single time how Satou was getting stronger, which would have been a logical direction to take since Yarizui was literally his club president and always with him. In my mind, this opaqueness of character hurt them in my eyes and did not allow me to fully suspend my disbelief in order to truly enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have lobbed some fairly critical comments against the series, let me back-peddle and suggest that I am more than aware that this show is not a masterpiece, nor was it aiming to be. It was an entertaining and ridiculous premise that aimed to be fun and quick to get into, and I believe it more than succeeded. While my attention did wane every now and then, I never strayed so far that I thought of quitting, and I laughed quite hard multiple times throughout the series. I think it was a \"good,\" anime, and while I didn't get what I wanted, I could easily claim to have gotten a fair consolation prize instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.\\n\\n\r\nI'll walk away knowing I probably won't revisit this show, and while I would watch a second season, I likely won't be scouring the internet looking for confirmation of such. I think this was a good anime that did something interesting. While it did not quite live up to what I had hoped to get out of it, it most assuredly did not let me down entirely, and I think it was just a above-average good way to kill some time. I hope that if a second season ever did come to fruition, it might take a glance at the success of Shokugeki and fix some of the areas that were bothersome to me, so that the show might reach the potential I believe it has. All in all, definitely worth a watch, but do so casually. I would not recommend this if you're looking for a new obsession, keep this one in the queue for when you need a quick laugh. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\r\n1. Shokugeki (Food Wars). As I already mentioned, Ben-To would work very well as a palate cleanser or cool-down after watching Shokugeki. Although Ben-To was unique enough that I would not go so far as to suggest it was just \"Food Wars Lite,\" or anything, they do have similar feels. Whereas Shokugeki presents an ever-present larger plotline lingering in the background, Ben-To is more simple, not really looking forward towards anything, just enjoying itself in the moment. I think if anything, you could say that Ben-To could be watched like a more casual Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\n2. Dagashi Kashi. I was not a fan of this show, but they have similarities between them. Dagashi Kashi relies on fan service a bit more than Ben-To, in my opinion, and Ben-To succeeds more as an interesting show because it does not suffer the pacing issues Dagashi has for me. They both deal with people caring far too much about common food to the point of obsession, and being carried too far because of these obsessions.",

            "content": "Ben-To Review\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\r\nPLOT: 7/10\r\nThe concept of the story is unique, honestly. However, I don't see any development in it as every episode seems to be repetitive. It is just like one boss after another. One floor after another. If you get what I mean. Well yeah, I admit that the action scenes are good and if you're the type who only want to watch an anime who fight again and again. Then you can try this. I rated it above 5 or 6 since I'm amazed on how the plot of this is unimaginable. Like for the sole purpose of getting that something, they becomebrave and fight. Maybe the message of it was if you do want something, you should fight for it.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nThe main character has no impact at all for me. Or it is just to cliche? The protagonists role are too common. It made me bored to watch the anime because of the character which I often see in most of the anime who have the same genre. Aside from the traits, the looks is also common. Black Hair, a masochist one, a pervert one and the like. I DON'T HATE IT. I just don't like it.\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nI don't really know how to rate sounds. But I like the opening song and the emotional song on the last episode of the series. I'm planning to download it later. The song is also exclusively for the anime, as the message of it focuses on the plot or the anime itself. The voices of the character, in my opinion, is good. I think they successfully express the emotion of the role they're trying to voice out.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6/10\\n\r\nBoringness and enjoyment is quite the same level when I watched this series. I enjoyed the fighting. And at the same time, I want to fast forward it when the fighting ends. I get the idea that even if I fast forward it, there's no significant message or scene I'd skip. But FYI, I don't skip it at all. I watched it completely.\\n\r\nENDING: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is where I burst \"What?\".\\n\r\nThe ending of an action anime should be the final fight. That's for me. However, they skip the fighting and proceeded with the friendship thing. I expected something more exciting than the previous fighting episodes. I want more of the psycho face of that girl. But yeah, that's nowhere to be seen.",

            "content": "Ben-to! Is what life really should be like, and what life sometimes is.\r\nStory: 6\\10\r\nI gave the story 6 because it didn't have much of it. However, it's been awhile since I watched the anime, so I've probably forgot a bit of the story. However.... You'll start watching this amazing anime, knowing it is about a bunch of people beating each other up for half priced Ben-to. You'll also be aware that there are good looking anime waifus for you to add to your harem. I don't think you care much for story.\r\nArt: 10\\10\r\nI'm pretty easy going on art and sound. As long as there isn'tsomething glaringly wrong with the art, I'm happy. An example: The mouths in Your Lie in April make me shudder. Another example is how everyone is so deathly thin in some anime. Like, it's unhealthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Ben-to is much better, so there's not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\10\\n\r\nI watched dub, and the dub was okay. Everyone could be heard, it wasn't like the Elfen Lied dub where everyone whispered. The timing for mouths and speech if I remember correct, was top quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\10\\n\r\nEveryone had these well made backstories, which affected the good nicknames given to them. The Ice Queen and the lady of the lake are just two of the names given to the top dogs.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the nicknames, we also get to see various interwining backgrounds between some of the characters. It might be a little cliche at times, but Ben-to isn't an anime you watch because you want a sensible plot with great character depth. I'd say it has an acceptable level of character depth, but from my memory, it isn't the best out there. The fact I can't remember the character names or all their nicknames also suggests that my memory is either betraying me, or the characters are just forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\10\\n\r\nI may forget their names, their nicknames, and the story, but I'll never forgot Ben-to as a whole. The enjoyment was brilliant, because it was hilarious and showed the true savagry of humans. If shopping was like this, then I would love shopping! Wanna get strong? Shop for half priced Ben-to and fight!\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of these fully grown men fighting and getting their backsides handed to them by some high school girl also proved to add to the hilarity. Of course it is a anime cliche that women are gods of war who can never be harmed, even if they never went through fight training, but Ben-to just mad eit so I didn't care. It became acceptable for these men to be weaker than this girl.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\10\\n\r\nI gave it a 10\\10 because this will be one I will rewatch, and it has a high priority over other anime. The score could chnage after a rewatch, if for some reason i decide it isn't as fun the second time round.\\n\\n\r\nRight now, without a doubt this is a great watch, and one I'll come to see again.",

But you'll be in for a surprise, as normally a light-hearted anime has light-hearted plot and minimal suspense, but in a believable situation. This anime is the opposite. Serious plot and fighting scenes, in a ridiculous situation. It is very hard to take seriously or even find comical.\r\nIf you decide to watch this anime, goodfor you.

            "content": "Waring this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions, so we got harem show where people fight for half price bento's and there is some heram shit going down sounds fun enough.\r\nSide note a bento is a Japanese lunch box  in case you didn't know that.\r\nStory, 6/10\r\nSo bento is about the main character who goes to a shop to get himself some half price bento. But then gets his ass kicked by a girl when he try's to get one.\r\nAfter that he soon learns that one doesn't just simply get himself a half price bento one must earn it though  honorable combat and blood shed.This contest of strength and willpower is known as the bento brawl where the wolfs get to fed  and the dogs go home hungry. \\n\\n\r\nSo to sunrise bento it pretty much about these group of people who beat  the living shit out of each other for what is essentially half price food, and I thinking to myself man this is really stupid this will never work and to my amazement I find that this actually works.\\n\r\nNow I am not saying that this best story ever made  because it's extremely simplistic in both ideas and presentation. but I think what makes it work is that it takes the battle shounen mentality and compressed it into one of the most mundane of tasks which is shopping.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also includes some harem/school life  elements as well \\n\r\nAnd your properly  thinking that it's going to be one of those things where the main character a bata male and has all these badass girls protecting him well if you thought that then your wrong because it more like they kick his ass and then he kicks there ass and they become apart of his harem so it's like a reverse Kung fu harem and the school life parts are self explanatory.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I think is quite fun about this show is that \\n\r\nFor one the characters seem to take this whole bento brawl thing  very seriously. For example you got characters having monologues about honor  and way of the warrior type of shit.\\n\\n\r\nBut a negative I got to say about it is that it really doesn't have any type of logic to it and that kind thing kind of bothered  me a bit.  So pretty much turn off your brain while watching this show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character can be pretty much be sum up as the normal high school student who is a bit of a pervert and likes old school games and is a bit bata male at first.\\n\r\nbut after a while he starts becoming a bit of a badass in his own way \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pretty much two dimensional at the most.\\n\\n\r\nBut they are quite the interesting bunch of .......  no interesting isn't really the word I would use probably I should  use the word zany so the are a zany bunch  of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey all have some personally even though it's really basic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very well done it isn't at that God level of animation quality but it looks very nice.\\n\r\nIt also has very bright colors that is uses.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has some very well done fight animation as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a very genneric art style that you seen it once you seen it all.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are also generic as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nIt has an ok op that fits the tone nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIt's ost to me is pretty generic.  nothing really stands out about the ost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nSo this show some what blowed me away of how fun this show was.\\n\\n\r\nI like that it's got people fighting over stupid shit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the  really cool steet fighting.\\n\\n\r\nI also found the characters to be fun as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo overall if your looking a dumb fun anime then you will find bento to be one kick ass of a show. But if your the kind of person who like his shows a bit more serious and have logic behind then this show won't really be your cup of tea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I will say i enjoyed Ben-To a hell of a lot more than i should of but that still doesn't make that good. The plot doesn't really make sense but it's still better than that bland anime that people are still making carbon copies of. I think the main reason I enjoyed Ben-To so much was it's character progression.In this anime you start off with the MC not able to fight what so ever but eventually making a \"NAME\" for himself let that name be good or bad. The faults is that it has so many cliches in it I kinda lost interest in a couple of episodes. The problem is it's uniqueness didn't need as many cliches as it had made me get bored at times. The cliches in this anime vary from cliche boob girls to cliche douche bags but are caring on the inside all the way to loli that is very clumsy. See what I mean these are the token anime characters. All in all I still enjoyed the anime it was a lot of fun especially with the changing conflict. I personally suggest this anime if you have down time but it's not a drop everything and watch this kinda anime.",

Honestly, when I see anime like this one, I think the manga/anime authors are running out of ideas here for their creation.\r\nBen-To has no story to begin with. Almost every episode is all about people (teen or adult) fighting over bento boxes at half the original price offered at various supermarkets. That's Ben-To in a nutshell.\r\nI would have rated it lower overall, but the bloody fistfights were at least enjoyable. So I decided to score it 5/10.\r\nIf you have nothing else to do, you can watch it as atime pass. Otherwise, I don't recommend this anime if you're looking for something with a story.",

            "content": "Going into Ben-To, I was expecting a light-hearted and ridiculous series, and that's exactly what I got. It does what it says on the tin. They were several aspects that made this a very enjoyable anime to watch, but it was also let down on a few things - one in particular. So I'll go through three key points (from best to worst) and try to explain the 6/10 rating I've given it as best I can.\r\n1. Characters - easily the strongest force in this series. I wouldn't describe any of the characters as 'deep' or 'wholesome', but they don't need to be. They're notcomplicated by anything superfluous, and any/all past history is directly relevant to the absurd present-day pursuit of half-price bento. Oshiroi is a great new riff on a classic (but overdone) stereotype, with some of her outbursts genuinely funny (I'll get to the dub later). The Ice Witch immediately had me groaning, until it became clear that her title has nothing to do with any kind of frosty traits, and that she was just a normal person. She wasn't Tsundre, because her coldness literally lasted one episode, and I found this really refreshing. And Sato is your average regular teenage male protagonist, but somehow more likeable that many. Perhaps it's because whenever he's called a 'pervert', it's because there is some real truth in the matter, but the proportions to which each situation is blown out of context is both hilariously over the top, and really not his fault at all.\\n\\n\r\n2. The Dub - I generally take Dub over Sub, because I like to do things like drawing and messaging while watching shows, so I prefer not to have to read the screen constantly. My immediate thoughts for Ben-To's dub were: \"This voice-acting is awful\" and \"This does not translate well enough to dub\". But a few episodes in, and I'd completely forgotten all my concerns. This is to the character's credit more than anything - as I said before, Oshiroi provides many comedic moments, and it's the perfect combination Felecia Angelle's searingly annoying tone and some expertly adapted dialogue that makes this so. Sometimes annoying characters can be forgiven if they are funny enough, and this is definitely such a case. The clunkiness of Sato's dialogue soon disappears as you get used to the ridiculous shenanigans that this series is filled with, and surprisingly, there's not a lot that goes over the head of a western audience member.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Story. Oh, the story. This is where Ben-To really disappoints, I'm afraid. Before I started watching, I was thinking \"I know it's only 12 episodes, but how can you sustain an anime about fighting over Ben-To to more than a 4-parter?\" The initial introductory story was enjoyable, but it found itself with nowhere to go, so onto a new, completely left-field story... which lasted two episodes. And the rest was surrounded by two new characters, embedded in mystery, and the pay off was just so underwhelming. Honestly, it became thoroughly tedious to watch these boring twins go about their business, when there was no sign of their actual motives until the penultimate episode, and everything they did seemed such a farce. They were the worst characters, because they came so late in a cast of strong individuals. It was SO difficult to care what happened with them, and it was painful that the whole second half of the series seemed to somehow revolve around them. Their storyline's ending was fair enough, but it could have been resolved in half the time with a quarter of the discombobulation their deployment caused.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us onto the ending. Which took place with one of the main characters completely out of action. Which not only ended the series, but also the boring and overly long final storyline involving those awful aforementioned twins. A series like Ben-To, especially being the size it is, really needed to go out with a BANG! And it didn't. The ending felt like a perfect way to end a mid-series arc, and was a great way of adding a little extra to characters we feel we know pretty well at this point... but to end the series? No, it left me quite dissatisfied. And the worst part is that I could see it coming. As this final storyline last 6 episodes out of 12, I could tell that the pacing was off, and that it was going to leave me underwhelmed. Ben-To's biggest weakness is that it was innately short on ways to sustain a story, and it was a problem that wasn't troubleshooted well at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo, all-in-all, I gave Ben-To a 6/10. Every element except for the story had it set up to be an 8 or a 9, but unfortunately it's just one of those things.",

I actually like to base an anime off what it deserves, in terms of plot, comedy if it had it, things not apparent in the artwork, and using art/sound to support it.\r\nOnwards,\r\nStory: 8\r\nI give the story an 8 due to the fact that the premise on its own is completely ridiculous. They go relatively in-depth with it, which was something I did not expect. When I heard that there were light novels and an animeabout people having a battle royale over half-priced lunch boxes, I first thought they were stupid, and then contemplated how they could make a 10+ volumes and 12 episodes of it. After progressing through, I found out how, and they did a pretty great job at solidifying everything. Other than the idea itself though, it's your standard anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art was pretty great. If you like moe overboard, then this is definitely for you. It's not my thing, but ho hum. Everything was fairly detailed and the fight scenes were animated very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime. The two openings, ending, grocery store songs, and fight songs were all amazing. They fit the atmosphere extremely well, and even when they didn't, it was pretty comedic. The soundtrack and B-sides of the singles are awesome, so I highly recommend that even if you don't watch the anime, get the soundtrack and/or singles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nCharacters were generic, save for the 'novelist', but somewhat fun in the way they interacted with each other. I can't really say anything else about them to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nNow here's the kicker, if all of these were mended together well, I would have no problem enjoying this anime wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the amount of unnecessary ecchi/fanservice roadblocks in this anime detracts from its score greatly. Hell, there was even a full episode about ecchi/fanservice just smack in the middle of everything. From a comedy factor, I found it was very lackluster, save for the yaoi fangirl. There were maybe one or two laugh out loud parts in each episode, while the rest were failed joke attempts (all rehashed cliche joke scenarios from other anime) that were forced upon you, wasting your time while you waited for the plot to continue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI was very disappointed, as this anime could have been so much more. While the premise and other things related to its production were excellent, it ended up like any other generic ecchi/harem anime.",

To say the truth when i would go through the top list of anime sites and i would see Ben-To with such a high rank, I would ask myself why on earth is an anime that is about people fighting for food so highly rated?\r\nAnd every time i saw it on a top list I would ask the question because truthfully the concept is just stupid, but one day i told myself if its so high on the ratings I might as well try it. So Idid, and it was completely awesome and so well done from the first minute of the anime to the last. I don't usually say this but if you happen to have some free time and feel like watching a lot awesome action with some hilarious moments you have to watch Ben-To.\\n\\n\r\nStory-(10) To me a well made and very unique idea makes a good story line. And this definitely has the most unique idea for a story line that I have ever seen and would have never expected this kind of story from any anime. Truthfully expected it to be really boring and bad, but it was really good :DD\\n\\n\r\nArt-(10) The art was perfect and combined with the really good sound it just gave the anime a big boost and also gave me the urge to watch this anime despite the fact that i thought it would be boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-(9) The characters were just hilarious at moments and awesome at others, and with the personalities that fit the characters perfectly it really enforces how good the anime can be.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is a must watch anime and is worth the time. And also one thing to say before i finish and that is never judge a book by its cover and this anime is a perfect example for that.\\n\r\nHave fun and hoped my review helped you. Thanks",

            "content": "Ben-To was really fun to watch. It has a ridiculous, over the top, and maybe innovative plot which holds together the anime. Without much money and maybe not much luck either, the protagonist finds himself in a fight for half-priced food. And when I say fight, I mean fight.\r\n  The anime goes through themes such as pride and respect in its own way. It tells that, even in the madness that a brawl for half-priced food is, there are unwritten rules and maybe what you could call etiquette. I would go as far as saying it makes the battle for half-priced fooda sport, without revenge or hate in mind, just food.\\n\\n\r\n  The fights are illustrated and animated in a very fluid manner. It does get a little violent, but only in the graphic side.The music which accompanies the animation has a great feel, I think the rhythm is just perfect. Sometimes you can't even tell it's there because it fits so well.\\n\\n\r\n  Beyond the primary plot of Ben-To, there is nothing much to say. Most of the anime is filled with fan service, or what you could call a rich high-school student protagonist life. A rather unlucky high-school student life, filled with beatings and awkward situations. The character development doesn't go very far. Maybe because it's short, or maybe because it's just unnecessary. Not any considerable back story, and perhaps not enough screen time for all characters, which are mostly girls.\\n\\n\r\n  TL;DR Ben-To is a fun to watch, nicely animated anime that is about food, fights, and high-school girls. It doesn't have any plot, story or character development and it doesn't need them. The fun had in Ben-To is from either from unlucky style comedy, or from the brave style action.",

Had to fight for that which would sustain and strengthen us. Had to be willing to push forward against fear and uncertainty to great heights of power and take what we want.\r\nThat is the way of the bento wolf.\r\nJapanese animation has had one iconic item in most anime since the inception of the medium taken from real life: BENTO!!!!\r\n A boxed pre prepared meal that is usually depicted as being either made at home or bought from asupermarket and consumed by kids and teens of pre college age. As has been the case for a long time, prices have been rediculous in Japan and have created a very strange state for people to live in. Hence when there is food that is half price, and in bento form laying around to be taken, there is no shortage of people willign to step up to the plate. \\n\\n\r\nEnter a generation of young people who literally fight with one and other to keep off starvation by laying low(not dead though) those around them in a supermarkets half price bento section to take whichever meal they want. But many are there to stand in ones way of not only nutrition but a primal urge to strike out on ones own and take what the law of nature says is the right of any strong enough to take it. \\n\\n\r\n Our protagonist is a young man who must decide if it is better to have a few scrapes or starve and vows to become a true 'wolf'. Sadly he is fairly pathetic considering he can fight quite well in a supermarket, but girls wipe the floor with him everywhere else....(*sigh* classic cheesy anime male..)..our poor poor misrepresented gender. LOL\\n\\n\r\nA seemingly plotless show to the uninitiated, but do not be fooled. There is as much comedy as dead seriousness about the intent to fight for ones food in this show. What is created is an enjoyable time spent relearning what our ancestors must have gone through in an unimaginably archaic time and why they saw nothing wrong with it. Laughs, a tad bit o romance and some good fights follow after an admittedly funny plot concept. \\n\\n\r\n LET THERE BE BENTO!!!!!",

            "content": "This anime was a little disappointing for me. I guess I had high hopes for this anime cause everyone in the comment section loved the anime! I feel like the idea and the animation was spot on, but the story, ost, and especially the characters were a disappointment. I was expecting the mc to be epic and not a typical harem anime weak chicken. I don't understand how this anime does not have a harem tag or ecchi tag. So many annoying characters, cause they are either wimpy or not cool enough. Like the ice witch was supposed to be strong, but the fighting scene,music, nothing made it look cool. I hated Ume the most how she kept on hitting the mc with no reason. That was the most annoying thing in this anime and how other characters were just bullying the poor mc. The story was terrible. It did not have any character development and left characters that were introduced like he/she was supposed to be important, but hasn't come back since. Just hated this anime in my OPINION.",

            "content": "Hey Mates, Vampmaster with more stuff here.\r\nLet's jump right into it, and as starters i would like to say not enough episodes.\r\nI really liked this and i would like to see the characters develop even more, but if they got to do that there is also the risk that they are not as unique any more.\r\nI love the characters and to meaning behind the very random storyline.\r\nI am known on some other sites to have a \"Golden eye\" to find a meaning behind a very blunt, non-thinking and weird storyline.\r\nSome of my friends liked how to Satou was strong, confident and how all the girlslooked up to him. But that's not true. After what i can see it's actually the other way around. Yes the girls may like him, but at the same time they fond over him like a caring mother. And if you look close enough does not argue over him being a \"barkling/dog\" (beginner). It's only at the end he tries to reverse it and tries to be the caring parent. And more episodes could reveal if he tries to reverse that with all the people or just for Yarizui.\\n\r\nWhile Satou being the most twisted person, we also have Oshiro who makes the series seem less serious, in other words, she is the supporting character that only exists as a joke, to lighten the mood, and hide the true plot from all none \"Golden eye\" anime-lovers.\\n\r\nOne of the best things with this series is the pride theme of it all. The titles wolves, dogs, pigs and so on, are the things that actually are hard to find in a lot of other series. You could relate it to the military these days, but that doesn't seem fair. I think it's more psychological than that, again with the Satou who is called \"barkling\", he is a wolf though, because i obeys the rules, have gotten a bento and even a title. Yet they call him \"barkling\", and he doesn't argue over it, that is because he knows that he isn't as strong as everybody else, he starts out relying on them, and it ends up with one person actually relies on him. And that second he probably would begin calling himself a wolf, instead of dog. Because wolves may hunt together, but it is always survival of the fittest.\\n\r\nEnough with the story and character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is right now a very common and popular style. It makes more people want to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound are great because a times when it gets serious, they cut background music of and it suddenly hits you how serious that moment is.\\n\\n\r\nI loved it, and pretty much anybody could do that, ecchi lovers, comedy fans, serious viewers, action people and normal people who cares for all genres. It contains all genres, and the hiddes slice of life makes it perfect for people who liked fx. Clannad because it has its moments that comedy fans would not could see because of it's clever disguise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall everybody would could love it, and it is a really brain-crusher for those who loves slice of life and the principal of pride.\\n\\n\r\nSo the scores are high and it would could turn all ways with a new season.\\n\\n\r\nLook out for more reviewers from me in the future, i don't write many here i only write for the best animes on animelist.net.",

            "content": "i quite enjoyed the idea behind it cute girls + well executed fights + comedy. it was so close to being a hit but it was missing one critical thing and due to that it fell apart completely. there was no solid story line, it was just people fighting over lunchboxes with cute girls and a weird harem.\r\nThe anime was visually okay it just lacked a proper story line, well that and a decent main character. \r\nhow can you have an anime about fighting when the main character is a masochistic wimp. i'm sure people will say there's nothing wrong with a perverted wimp [thatjust lets people beat him up for no reason] when its in a harem setting but the harem still kinda sucked. don't get me wrong the characters  were quite good as individuals i really liked sen, inoue and the wizard they all had they're redeeming qualities well except sato.\\n\r\nhonestly i think what pissed me off the most was the fact that he kept getting beaten up for no reason i know its an anime that revolves around fighting but he'd only get beaten up OUTSIDE the fight scenes. him vs people in a fight = awesome. him walking outside his classroom = owned for talking to oshiroi. wtf!?\\n\\n\r\nall in all i'd say it was fairly enjoyable i know i complained a bit but like i said at the beginning its only major flaw is the random jigsaw story and the main character but the latter is more of me just not liking wimpy main characters.\\n\\n\r\nbasically if you have loads of free time watch it, otherwise don't bother your not missing much.",
