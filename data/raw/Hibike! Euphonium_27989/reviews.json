            "content": "This is it, their grand return. While the past number of shows they\u2019ve animated may not have quite hit the mark in terms of greatness, KyoAni has captured the magic of what made me fall in love with the studio in the first place with their newest work, Sound! Euphonium. What many brushed off as just a K-On! 2.0, Sound! Euphonium is one of the best anime that I have seen in a long time. \r\nSound! Euphonium follows the Kitauji High School Concert Band, a group that sounds fairly mediocre, and follows their journey as they grow both as musicians and as people in theirefforts to truly accomplish what they before just claimed as a pipe dream: make the nationals of the Kansai Band Competition. The story itself is fairly simplistic, but the real meat of it is focusing in on the journey that is walked to achieve their goals. The band must constantly overcome the internal conflicts that it faces as a result of being a collection of individuals, but watching them overcome these conflicts and grow as individuals as well as a group is what I believe to be a rewarding experience.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, none of that matters if we don\u2019t care about the individuals that make up the group in the first place. However, that\u2019s one of what I believe to be the two things that really shine in this show that pushes it to be amazing. These characters feel real. They\u2019re not one-dimensional drawings that the creators expect us to care about just because they\u2019re there. They feel alive. Each character has depth to them in a way that makes it so that I can\u2019t really describe them in just a few words. In particular, I think that Kumiko is probably one of the best main characters that KyoAni has put out there, putting her up there or above the heights of some of their best like Oreki or Kyon. She feels like a person that I could relate with, rather than some exaggerated caricature. She\u2019s a little distant, but still a little lively. She\u2019s a little self-conscious, but still a little confident. She\u2019s not skewed so far in any one direction that makes her seem like, well, an anime character. The supporting cast all bring some depth to the table as well, with some standouts being Reina, Natsuki, Asuka, Taki-sensei, Haruka, and Kaori. And they\u2019re not just there; they grow as well. From being distant to becoming a little more open, from being apathetic to lighting their passion, they all change, some a little, others more noticeably, and this really makes Sound! Euphonium stand out from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nThe other part of what I believe makes Sound! Euphonium stand out is the attention to detail. That goes for in the artwork, the sound, the direction, and all the little parts of the show, coming together to make this a beautiful work of art. KyoAni is known for having great animation, but this is probably the best they\u2019ve put out. Every motion feels fluid and draws me in; the scenery and lighting are beautifully drawn and lit up or dimmed; and the background music or the lack thereof only serves that enhance the atmosphere. And then the camera work. The camera work really stands out in a way that enhances every scene, from focusing onto a specific point, or lightly moving around a whole scene. Two scenes in particular, in Episode 8 and Episode 12, just really stand above the rest in how these aspects are used and come together, and to me are some of the most outstanding scenes I\u2019ve seen throughout the entirety of anime. All these little things come together to paint a work of art that really shines, and it is a beauty to behold. \\n\\n\r\nAnd not just in those areas either; as a musician myself, I really appreciated the attention focused into the musical side of things. When the band first played, you didn\u2019t have to just rely on the words of the characters to know they were bad. If you listened, you could tell they were bad. All the instruments were made with a polish and shine that made them look like real instruments, and when they were being played, they even used correct fingerings. As this is something that is usually overlooked in the majority of anime, the amount of detail that KyoAni put into the musical aspect is amazing. They also captured the essence of a high school band beautifully. While there of course were some differences as it was a club rather than a class, the amount of work that was put in, the internal drama that the band members faced, the conflicting attitudes of how hard the students want to work, and then the tension that precedes a performance and the excitement or disappointment that comes afterwards was captured in a way that really exemplified the high school band experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere are few loose ends that aren\u2019t really tied up, mostly in the romantic department, just due to the nature of it being an adaption of a different work, but I don\u2019t believe that to be any fault of the show itself, and they are easily overlooked when compared to everything else that is done great. \\n\\n\r\nMany people believe KyoAni has fallen from grace, and whether or not that is true can be debated, but shows like Sound! Euphonium prove that KyoAni is still capable of creating works of art, and illustrate why some people have come to see this studio as one of the most capable out there. I only look forward to see what the studio has in store after bringing us a masterpiece like Sound! Euphonium.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: Great characters and attention to detail come together to provide a masterful work of art.\\n",

            "content": "This will be a very long review (I dare to call it an essay!), and while it may not exactly contain spoilers, I have included 'hints' which one may wish to look out for in watching this anime.\r\nPersonally, out of all the other studios, I find myself following and noticing trends in Kyoani's releases the most. After all, while the moe wave was not (exactly) started by them, K-On contributed hugely to it, and from there, I found myself observing how Kyoani seems to have very acute marketing tendencies - they would just somehow hit the demographics right, appealing to various clusters of viewers whilestill producing what are basically decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nI was not expecting very much from Hibike! Euphonium at all. After all, its resemblances to K-On are pretty eerie, and not being a great fan of how K-On turned out, I was not anticipating much out of this either. Still, I decided that I would give it a try - such is my inclination towards music.\\n\\n\r\nIt was only after I finished watching the whole series that I discovered something that pretty much explained why I felt Hibike was so successful. Just like one of Kyoani's previous works, Hyouka, Hibike is an adaptation of a novel. In my opinion, the novel as a medium presents a view quite distinct from that of the manga and the light novel. Mangas and Light novels are by no means simple or immature, in case you misunderstand, but the target audience and marketing intention behind those two mediums as opposed to the novel is quite different. I would argue that the novel is in general less geared towards entertainment than it is towards art. As such, the novel as a medium gives the studio a better base to build their anime upon - for its style and language offers a different perspective and vision to those reading it as opposed to other forms of media.\\n\\n\r\nIn this respect, the first important feature of Hibike that sets it apart from many other anime is its focus on the music itself. I played in a Jazz Band during my high school years, so I do have some experience in the field, albeit in a different context. Either way, I found that some of the scenes portrayed in the music room were indeed real - although dramatized. Furthermore, as a musical anime, Hibike actually shows the band playing music, with both individuals and the collective struggling to 'find their sound.' Even more impressive is the level of detail in the performances; I think that for a skilled player to play badly on purpose is difficult. Yet when the band plays badly, it is obvious enough to tell who went wrong. The pieces themselves were indeed impressive - every time that trumpet solo played, I would feel myself tingle, going, \"My goodness that is indeed a beautiful solo.\" That the studio would even go so far as to get the fingerings and etc correct for each instrument is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOne indisputable thing about Kyoani is their art. They have always been famous for taking actual scenes in real life and casting them into the anime mould - and with such detail and precision! I could even recognize some Kyoto scenes from the images in the anime itself! The studio has taken realism in anime to another level in this sense. Yet I couldn't help but feel that this was the best I'd seen from Kyoani just yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is nothing very complicated. In fact, it is precisely because it is not complicated that it relays what it should be about: music, and the things that stem from people trying to get that music together. As such, certain plot developments were not entirely unexpected (meaning that some others were, of course :P). In speaking about Slice of Life anime though, I find it crucial to speak about characters in relation to the plot - for it is the characters and their reactions that drive the plot forward. Yes, the characters have the typical cute Kyoani design, but none of them are moeblobs, or 'useless,' in the broad sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the story, Kumiko, is arguably nothing very special. I didn't expect very much from her. I perceive her as sometimes being more of the sort that 'just wants things to go by smoothly,' even if she does not give such a strong vibe of that sentiment. This begins to change once she starts coming into contact with all the different personalities of the band. This is Hibike's greatest strength: for with such a diverse cast of characters, I find that they have fleshed out a large number of them very well, such that the events and drama between each one actually has effects on the others. What is more amazing is that each one of them is actually very unique in their own right; just like how we humans are in real life. We all react to situations differently, and Hibike's characters are no different. For example, I find that contrasting the attitudes of 'Ribbon girl' with Asuka-senpai would be one combination where the viewer can see two highly contrasting attitudes to a situation. For me to list out all the combinations and characters would be impossible, for that is precisely how much development and thought has gone into many of them.\\n\\n\r\nLife is a magical thing, and Hibike has shown that to be true. For only certain moments can be deemed magical in order for them to stand out and make a deep impressions upon us. While most of our lives may come across as mundane, there are times we reflect upon in great wonder, having been enchanted by the atmosphere of the moment. There are such moments in Hibike, the most prominent of these being the development of the relationship between Kumiko and the mysterious Reina. Amongst all the characters in Hibike, Reina is the one I find most enchanting, for she is so distanced from everything else. Yet when she finally gets close to Kumiko, even i was left mesmerised by her entire being - such was the beauty of that scene and moment that I replayed it many times - for it was then that the novel's art reveals itself through in the monologues of Kumiko's mind and later the exchange between the two. For there is a depth and grace surrounding Reina that is an indescribable inspiration - and that portrayal is undoubtedly the product of Kyoani's vision. Yet in the episodes thereafter, that magic did not last - exactly like what life is, for nothing that's good can last; we can only hope to continue developing it slowly and cherishing what we were honoured to have.\\n\\n\r\nHibike is however, by no means a show drowned in unreachable sentiments. There's definitely plenty, but it has many other elements in it as well that constitute the various aspects of school life. One example would be the hints and touches of vague romance within it, for I find that any anime not focused on romance yet display it are some of the sweetest that there can be - and trust me, there are plenty here. It leaves one guessing - but love comes in many forms, and it is our decision as to how we wish to perceive it. For romance to be a feature in an anime focusing on high school life is nothing surprising - but it is merely a part, even if it could be a big one. I would challenge all potential viewers to not dig too deep onto the romance portion of this anime, even if it is so tempting and inviting.\\n\\n\r\nSuch are slice of life animes. They aim at portraying the world to us viewers in a certain manner and form that is familiar to us, yet they are filled with more drama and sentiment than our lives would typically be - because that's how we are entertained. I believe that Kyoani has attained a certain peak with this anime that have not seen in a while. In all the studio's attention to detail is the creation of an anime that while simple - is art in itself. For it has been executed so well that I felt myself vicariously going through much of what the characters did. Again I cannot help but make it clear that this is nothing like K-On; here, I felt that Kyoani decided to get serious. They were fully intent on creating something great, something worthy of the lives that we live and aspire to live, even if we may not be successful in doing so. In the process, it has shown that there are no means more suitable than through the expression of music - as each note rings in this anime, be it from an individual character, or when bonds are made between groups, I find it hard to feel otherwise, for even it made me want 'to be something special.'\\n\\n\r\nFull kudos to Kyoani on what I think is their best anime so far in a while, for it is the culmination of the ideals I feel they had been looking to achieve. Through adapting a novel with an excellent foundation, Kyoani's Hibike surpassed all my expectations, and while it is not a true masterpiece, I don't know how else to rate this series.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation has relationship with the viewer that I find to often be a complicated waltz between fame and infamy. Being so renowned, the line between these two traits is very thin, and often it is easier for the studio to be criticized rather than applauded; it is a much more popular option to join in on a cynical crowd mentality rather than to accept an achievement for what it is--and I believe Hibike! Euphonium is one of Kyoto Animation's achievements, a wonderful comeback from material that pushes the studio over to the infamous side of the line.\r\nBecause of the cynicism that often surrounds theproducts of KyoAni season to season, I went into the first few episodes of the show skeptical, critical, and determined not to enjoy myself. Episode one, then on to the next, soon episode five, then episode ten, and soon I realized that my determination had failed me.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is beautiful, and while my more pessimistic side imagined this to only be true on a surface level, the depths of the series' beauty went much deeper, with a great amount of pride present and accounted for in terms of character, story and further appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, at it's base, is very simple, and not at all an original tale, but the way it is told finds a certain realism that always pleases me when I see it. \\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium encompasses the story of struggle, and of goals to set and achieved through willpower and belief in oneself, but it also happens to contain the drama that I find much more native to the high school atmosphere that is introduced within this and so many other school stories.\\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that high school girls are, in reality, emotional, catty, dramatic, and hold grudges over petty things. The fact of the matter is that school clubs do not always get along like family, the fact is that some members are more prominent than others and rarely rely on tropes to set them apart from the crowd. \\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium understands this, and shows this, displaying a sort of quiet drama blown to the proportions that find their homes in both real life and in fiction, and it is perfect. The show knows when to take the situation seriously, and when to have side characters show off what makes them cute. The two aspects are never confused, which is supremely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show does experience some blips, in that I felt the romantic side-plot jams itself into places it may not necessarily fit. There are awkward attempts to build relationships between the main character, Kumiko, and her potential love interest, as well as awkward attempts regarding that same love interest and Kumiko's friend. These bits of the show were lopsided, but hardly something to do anything with other than ignore.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I believe some of the awkwardness comes from side characters such as the love interest, Shuuichi, and others like Midori (Kumiko's friend) taking away from the round dynamics of Kumiko and her primary relationship with Kousaka Reina. Kumiko and Kousaka have such a strong, utterly, utterly strong dynamic that it's very hard to match with anything else. As a positive, I applaud the relationship built between the two, and I feel it almost unmissable if one hopes to see anime in it's highest moments of beauty, but as a negative, it gives the rest of the show competition to rise to such a level.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic, I appreciate such competition.\\n\r\nMy original thought when I began Hibike! Euphonium was that KyoAni would try to squeak by on art alone, leaving the other aspects of the show--story, sound, pride in the overall work--out to dry. I appreciate that this was not the case, and that KyoAni made in effort to turn the piece into the beautiful final product of art and story combined that I now rate so highly.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you with a similar mindset such as my own, for those of you skeptical that Hibike! Euphonium hides behind pretty colors and fanciful design, I implore you to give the show a try. I implore you to be patient with Kumiko as a disinterested, pessimistic protagonist, as one who isn't striving to be spunky or original.\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium may not be original. It may be the recycled plot of many past anime in the music genre, but as a new addition to that genre, it is definitely not a show to pass up.",

            "content": "I\u2019d like to think of music as a form of art. It\u2019s a vocal expression by taking the form of instrumental emotion. And by talent, we see the beauty of it. What does that mean for a show like Hibike Euphonium? A lot. To me, this series is a musical adventure. If you\u2019re interested in a series about following dreams, building strong friendships, and exploring youth with an unforgettable experience, then you\u2019re in the right place. \r\nWhat is Hibike! Euphonium? (Sound! Euphonium) It\u2019s an anime adaptation of a Japanese novel written by Ayano Takeda. Taking place in Kyoto, the series has its focus on agroup known as the Kitauji High School Music Club. Directed by Tatsuya Ishihara with storyboard written by Jukki Hanada, this series is an explosive youth of the coming ages. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is pretty straightforward to be quite honest. It brings a rather strange nostalgia-like feeling when just thinking about the premise. Remember those halcyon days when you first sung a song or played an instrument? That\u2019s what kind of feels like when watching this series. To start off, we have a young girl named Kumiko Oumae coming from Kita Middle School. Now fresh with a new start at her high school, what better way than to make a first impression? Well, the catch is that Kumiko is reluctant in joining the school\u2019s brass band club. Despite having some talent in playing the euphonium, the series makes it clear that she had some sort of negative experience in the past with another member of the club. That would be Reina Kosaka. However, fate has it that she join the club anyway and the instrument she ends up with is none other than the euphonium. \\n\\n\r\nWith its direction of the first few episodes, one must be wondering what sort of relationship Kumiko used to have with Kousaka. Before that though, we also meet her other friends including her classmates Kazuki and Sapphire. A series like this will leave a first impression that music is not just the main focus. No, it\u2019s about also establishing a forte and build relationships to survive their spots. This is because the club\u2019s advisor, Taki-sensei has a goal in mind. He wants the club to go on and compete in the Nationals. Small group and big dreams. The series brings up a lot of questions for the first half. Many of them aims at the main characters\u2019 potentials and what their dreams are. Not to mention, we also don\u2019t know much about most of their past. This is why it take some patience to get through the show. Admittingly, there are some pacing issues and parts that are omitted from the novel. However, the series does its job to capture the vocal expression of the characters. Some of them are confident to make the game while others have doubts. For Kumiko, I\u2019d say that she\u2019s somewhere in between. In regards with the other characters, it\u2019s quite diverse. Characters like Hazuki and Asuka are surely confident in themselves while Sapphire has a more timid nature. Then, there\u2019s Reina, a character I\u2019d describe as a lone wolf, the ice queen, and in general someone that is not easy to make friends with. She\u2019s not unfriendly though but just someone who is very dedicated in pursuing her goals. Her past shows that she has some emotional problems with Kumiko and thus is a reason why the two have somewhat of a mixed relationship in the present storyline. Or is it?\\n\\n\r\nA good part of this series also makes time to craft their moments together. Every episode shows a bit of their chemistry whether it\u2019s direct or indirect. Some of the moments may be short but are meaningful, especially for Kumiko. One of the later episodes really take this forward to another level in both friendship and perhaps a bit even subtle yuri by their body language. And that\u2019s another thing I find interesting about the series. Music on the surface is an expression but the characters themselves too show genuine human emotions with body language. Every concrete detail has some sort of meaning to reflect the actions of our characters. Even when it\u2019s hard to notice, it depicts part of their personality. This is important as relationships in the series are forged by their experiences. Each episode shows us more about the main characters. Each episode wants us to learn even more. Each episode gets to show us why they are there. And by the end of the day, it can win the audience with all these ideas mixed in its story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, competition is also there. Rivalries are established especially for something as big as the Nationals. If you\u2019ve ever been involved in some sort of contest, your goal is to win right? Unfortunately, the series puts less emphasis on actual rivalries but more on the characters\u2019 development themselves. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a drawback though especially since it gives on insight on characters\u2019 behaviors. Characters who quit or doubt themselves brings a saddening emotion into the show. Likewise, there are also others who truly wishes to inspire and bring a light of hope. Regardless, Hibike Euphonium also likes to play a lot with its character cast and their roles. A main course of this series involves their development with one another as well as their individual progress. Even romance is part of the series although much of it is subtle and thus not a central element. To enjoy a series like this, it\u2019s important to realize why the characters are there and what they do in the story. It can even be supplemented by the charming comedy especially with the clever usage of its dialogues. Indeed, this series can feel snarky at times but accomplishes with humor in a sort of cheeky delight.\\n\\n\r\nHow do I describe the feeling of the artwork? Imagine a color blind person seeing color for the very first time. That\u2019s pretty much a gist of it. Kyoto Animation not only takes the character designs to a whole new level but also with its stellar visual quality. Beauty is expressed by the colorful backgrounds and rich resources. There\u2019s also a great amount of focus on character expressions. Like I mentioned before, this series expresses music with ensemble through human emotions. In essence, the artwork adapts that to precision and understands how to portray them each episode. This is also enhanced by the noticeable body gestures where characters can at times express their actions without dialogues. There\u2019s probably a lot more words to describe the overall tone of the artwork but this series knows what the audience wants and lives up to the hype of what the studio stands for.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack and music, the series is well aware of what it needs to do. Music after all, is a centerpiece of this series. Without it, it would be like a grey little world without color. But with its colorful music, the series enlighten itself to its highest degree thanks to its instrumental music. There\u2019s all types of sound you\u2019ll hear from this show ranging from those played from the tuba, contrabass, trumpet, and of course euphonium. Now, I\u2019m not a big expert on music but the show achieves its purpose to deliver what the audience needs to hear. The OP and ED theme songs are also decorative with an uninformative style on par with its musical merit. In addition, the show does a decent job to weed out the strongest and weakest links through music talents. Finally, voice mannerisms are tolerable especially for our main cast. Each of them shows a different personality that is quite diverse and matching thanks to their voice. From Sapphire\u2019s timid voice tone to Reina\u2019s cool yet confident style, it\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to miss.\\n\\n\r\nHibike Euphonium takes the idea of music and brings in a story with charm, emotion, inspiration, and youthful appeal. In a musical genre where there\u2019s emotions, you\u2019d have to believe what the characters are doing. Thanks to its execution, the show accomplishes that in a variety of ways. From the experiences and relationships that our characters forges, its shows that Hibike Euphonium is more than just about producing music. This series is a lot easier to understand though once you appreciate what it\u2019s trying to do. It\u2019s a combination of feeling easy, familiar, and also a bit of fun. And it also shows that talents aren\u2019t born but earned. After all, there\u2019s no such thing as free lunch.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation's success with K-On gave a new face to the genre of music anime\u2014a face that focused on the activities of cute girls in a group, and to a lesser extent, their relationships. Hibike Euphonium is more or less the same formula, but on a much larger scale; a school band of boys and girls alike. Said school band is aiming for a mere shot at the nationals with the help of an instructor much stricter than they'd prefer. It's by no means an original concept, but it would be acceptable if it showcased the trials a band faces in an admirable fashion; instead,Hibike is more concerned about weak shoujo ai coupled with the insecurities of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nKumiko and her friends are the main source of those insecurities, and they're not much more than what you'd expect from a teenage group of anime characters: na\u00efve, overstating, and worried about love. Little can be said about unique characteristics or personalities, since aside from a few cute quirks (like a character naming her tuba 'Tubacabra'), there are next to none. To balance this weakness out, the show introduces the collected and beautiful bandmate Reina, whose mutual admiration with Kumiko tends to go a little overboard. There's a load of flirting between the two without any romantic development, which leads me to believe the relationship is only there to give a reason to the protagonist's unnatural success; the two are driven by a non-existent love for each other, and it is not convincing in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThat wasted screentime could have been better used on the development of the school band, who the viewer only gets to know about a quarter of. Because of that lack of focus, there is no unifying element of teamwork to the storyline\u2014you are merely watching a few people surrounded by background characters whenever they play. Their instructor, Taki, is often pointing out musical flaws or weaknesses in certain sections of the band, but the lack of familiarity with the members makes their struggle to improve near meaningless. Unless you're driven by any personal nostalgia, it is seemingly impossible to empathize with anyone. It really makes the end goal to reach the nationals both predictable and uninteresting, as well as boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Hibike Euphonium is great. Crisp, fluid, and full of detail, it's something that can only be expected of the notorious studio behind it. The art itself isn't as impressive, but acceptable; everything looks as if it's been bathed in layers upon layers of oil, even excessive by the standards of teenage hygiene. Regardless, watching each instrument as it's being played is always a real treat. \\n\\n\r\nHearing them is pretty nice, too. It's likely the only real indicator of progress in the series, as they go from sounding like your average school band to something deserving of recognition pretty quickly. In fact, it's a little too abrupt of an improvement. Later performances begin to sound too professional for their age level, and as beautiful as it is, it's immersion-breaking. For better or for worse, you can tell that the soundtrack was performed by a group that makes its anime counterpart pale in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nClumsiness aside, Hibike manages to fit into the formula its predecessors put in place, albeit quite half-heartedly. The fundamentals are all there, but the soul is missing. It's drab, often slow, and questionable in focus, but it is what it is. If you're looking for something light and simplistic, go nuts. Just don't expect much in the drama department, OK?",

            "content": "There are three main types of \"specific interest\" story. When author knows and wants to submerge its viewer (or reader) into the world of interest; when author finds something unusual and shiny, googles about it and decides to make a story about it; and something inbetween.\r\nWhat you have here - is the story inbetween. Author knows about it, but puts it as unusual and shiny.\r\nIt is called \"Hibike! Euphonium\", and it is about big beautiful brass that shines, but does not breathe.\r\nMost of plots in modern anime about music tend to look like this: protagonist making or taking part in a band or orchestra, grindingits skill and becoming popular and famous in the end. This plot was used so many times that not it is not very interesting to follow it.\\n\r\nSo, as a multi-instrumentalist with a strong knack for musical instruments, before watching, I made a supposition: maybe these series will show us characters actually playing musical instruments? Maybe it will tell us about secrets and mysteries behind brass techniques? Or - in the most extreme case - would it turn me into a brass fan and persuade me to buy a trumpet, as I wanted several years ago? Let's wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, with shiny brass and glossy art in preview arts and videos, my first impression was positive enough. Even though the studio making this show would be Kyoto Animation, infamous in latest years for its beautiful bug-eyed art and lack of plot and character development.\\n\r\nFor example, the notorious K-On lacked any skill development, jumping from zero to hero in an instant for no particular reason.\\n\r\nIf you play a musical instrument, you should have known that learning to play any instrument, from recorder to tabla drums, takes a lot of time and work. Obviously, non-musician viewers would not be insterested in daily routine with blistered fingers, aching back or dry mouth, but a proper amount of these scenes would make you believe characters on screen are trying their best to do music. I did not believe K-On. Should I believe Hibike? Let's hope.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the actual reason: I decided to give this anime a try for having a character playing double bass. Why? Because this instrument is very uncommon in girl-cast shows.\\n\r\nLots of different characters in different anime series are playing violin; again, mostly they are girls, and violin is supposed to underline their femininity, giving them a very artistic and porcelain-ish aura. \\n\r\nBut suddenly here comes a tiny curly-haired moe-girl carrying a stringed coffin larger in size than her. No way it could be feminine: trust me, double bass is really that large and cumbersome, but - surprisingly - not so heavy and loud, being a low-pitched instrument. Would a moe-girl make it roar and slap? Let's watch.\\n\\n\r\nHere it goes. Beautiful art, girls in uniforms, everything is polished and nice. Girls, be ambitious...?\\n\r\nNope. Girls, be boring, dull and slow-paced.\\n\r\nThis is not the show about music. Music is not needed here. This is a show about problems.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be called \"Naku! Ennuiphonium\".\\n\\n\r\nEven K-On made a good and happy, yet poseurish, mood, and here we just watch characters playing in band with sad faces on.\\n\r\nAgain: I like happy and cheerful people and characters. They charge you with a will to live. With female protagonist being boring, slow-paced and not pursuing her unfinished dream (which every young musician has) with burning eyes, I can not empathize her. Yes, she had a loss in past, though would it be a shounen-oriented series, she would think something like: \"I lost? Who cares. I'll just grind more\". She prefers to dig deeper into her thoughts, without even thinking about how she could overcome her sadness.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem of this show lies not only in un-empathetic protagonist, but in wrong deepness balance of the whole show. Instead of dripping us, viewers, into the world of music, it drips us into relationship problems of female protagonist being afraid to speak with her childhood friend, who grew into an aloof-dark-emotionless-long-haired type (I personally hate such characters, but that's not the question). \\n\r\nWith all this drama bubblegum (as well as biseinen teacher not stopping to smile), Hibike looks more like a shoujo show with cheap plotline, but great art instead. Only Asuka (who looks like Mita from Hatsu Inu, by the way) tries to be the main genki and fanservice source of the show, making me change my opinion about Hibike being a pure shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, let's stop a little bit on Asuka, until we started to rant about everything else. It is the only character of the show with no purpose other than being better than others.\\n\r\nShe pushes female protagonist to the plot, makes her progress more and more, and does not actually care about sad things happening around her. Looks very similar to Kamina from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, but if Kamina was a charismatic character with a big dream and looked realistic and vivid in his setting, Asuka looks and acts like she came from nowhere to do everything better than others. Got what I mean?\\n\r\nYes. Asuka is a Mary Sue.\\n\r\nAnd being a Mary Sue is not a good way to push the plot. Because you're not a character, but more like a random person on stage caught improvising.\\n\\n\r\nWhere was I?... Another bad thing is that plot jumps from one place to another too much. With unneeded amounts of drama atop it reminds me of Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai, with the only difference Hibike being realistic enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem lies in over-dramatisation and depressive atmosphere suited only for 15-year-old girls experiencing coming-of-age period, because it is the time when you try to cope with your seeings of the future. In short, the characters are constantly sad.\\n\r\nAnd the sadness keeps going and going! Compared, for example, to Hanayamata, nobody ever tries to turn the sad situation on screen into aspiring, funny or just interesting. Each episode looks not at all like a show about dreams and future, instead looking more like a footage from some dark arts circle. Dress all characters in black, make it rain outside, and the atmosphere would be ideal for the show. \\n\r\nSeriously: the lack of any happiness in characters' onscreen life makes you believe that it's a show about a funeral band.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, you could take musical instruments out of the show and replace concert band with some other props to make the plot flow. Replace the setting with an artist academy, shooting range or tube-rolling mill, nothing would change drastically: a bit of inner works, and no actual gravitation of these works. They just exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are portrayed as realistic. But are they? \\n\r\nActually, they were balanced enough for a boring setting at the first six episodes of these series. Not counting female protagonist and her turned-aloof friend, we also have Hazuki, who I found really funny to watch, and again, typical quiet moegirl Sapphire with a large double bass. The problem is she did not play any bass soloes, and is also rarely shown in orchestra, with main frames being occupied with big beautiful brass. This does not make me happy as a contrabassist (self-taught, not the best on, but still learning!). The only moment of her starring was in a trio with Hazuki and female protagonist. And this is not enough for a main character with a double bass.\\n\\n\r\nThe most \"realistic\" part of these series is that characters always shed tears for other characters. Without even thinking about how exactly they could make a profit for themselves, I say. This, being Japanese enough trait, takes all characters down.\\n\r\nI do not propagate egocentrism, but if you want to live the life, you'll need to think about yourself first, not about your senpai. Just remember: if you give your clothes to everyone, you'll leave yourself naked and probably die of pneumonia.\\n\r\nAny lack of self-esteem in characters makes them unsympathetic and uncatchy, turning them into grey goo of depression. And the show without individual characters is not an interesting one.\\n\\n\r\nOne more question to discuss is the yuri part of the show. As some people already noted, this part was really unneeded in the plot. With Reina acting les-yay for Kumiko, I can only suppose it was just a move to attract more audience. Of course, they are in an absolute need for a mutual kiss, ain't they?\\n\r\nIf I am right, the original novel did not have such shameless fetish expositions to attract more audience, because female protagonist already had a potential partner.\\n\r\nAnd the show has no need in this yuri fanservice. The show needs yuri like a goat needs an accordion (or a fish needs an umbrella, or a dog needs a fifth leg, as we say in Russia).\\n\\n\r\nI had hopes on the series. Yet still, after the first 6 episodes, drama bubblegum goes on, female protagonist is still acting boring and unempathetic, and even cheerful Hazuki and Sapphire are turning into snot-chewing scenery, making these series even more uninteresting and boring.\\n\r\nThe problem can be described as such: every important character in this show (even the optimistic ones) survives such an unempathetic and dull background you just don't have any wish to feel with them. \\n\r\nAll problems with unsaid words, insincerity and fake feelings could be easily solved, but - apparently, the strong and noble people of Japan (with all their strength and nobility still raped by Soviet Union and USA) are not allowed to express feelings as they wish.\\n\\n\r\nAforementioned over-dramatization of events in these series makes you want to turn it off and think your life is much happier, even if you are a bankrupt disabled widow. This does not even look like a character development, it's a character degradation, a thin reason to turn characters, potentially capable of living, into fools walking through the forest and searching someone more stupid than them. (It was a reference.)\\n\\n\r\nStrange enough, with Buddhism being popular in Japan, to see every character in this show in sad mood, dramatized situations, uncomfortable around each other. Each and everyone of them does not even try to become a Bodhisattva and to forget any perishable bad luck of this world. \\n\r\nGirls, stop this. At the moment someone suffers more than you, stop crying over brass.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention goes to Reina. As I said before, I greatly dislike \"aloof&emotionless\" type of characters. They always look like they try to act grown-up, forgetting that not the actions are measure of growing up, but experience is. Reina's case is similar: she even states she tries to be special, that's why she wants to play trumpet better.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to be special by playing trumpet better?\\n\r\nReina, playing trumpet does not make you special. Even a street cleaner can learn to play trumpet, if he wants to. And becoming the best is the dream of all shounen main characters.\\n\r\nIf you want to deal with a trumpet, you need to play it in a special way. In a way nobody ever played it. No matter what, just do something unusual.\\n\r\nPlay djent on trumpet.\\n\\n\r\n(All right, jokes aside: check out Pierre Bastien. That's what \"special trumpet\" means.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd later this striving for being special became contagious. This is it, the unfinished dream to make your eyes burn...\\n\r\nNot. This part of plot is so far-fetched and hastily-made you don't have enough time to live with it, to believe it and, of course, to empathize with such aspiration. If KyoAni pushed it i the beginning of series, you could believe it more, though the show would really play itself like a badly-written shounen story.\\n\\n\r\nThe only part of the show that I watched without taking my eyes away was the ending song. The ending was suspenseful and overall gorgeous. Such a shame that for such an ending the anime would suffer such a depressive mood without any chance of happiness in the characters' eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn this quality, we have:\\n\r\nStory: 5/10 (for being not very original, but okay)\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (again, instruments are really beautiful)\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 (nothing special, but let it be 6/10, it's a show about boredo... err, music)\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10 (unempathetic ones are overbalancing empathetic ones)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 (so depressive and boring, you could go mad).\\n\\n\r\nLet's set overall score of 5/10. I really wished it could be better, but with the series being such a mood-dropper it could not.\\n\\n\r\nThat does not mean Hibike is bad. It is believable in some way, it is beautifully drawn, but it is overly dramatized, plays itself in a very unhappy and unwilling mood and, worst of all, does not have a hook. A quirky idea to be interesting enough to watch.\\n\r\nOf course, there is a potential to watch it. But not to breathe it.\\n\\n\r\nCry, ennuiphonium. Until the last episode.",

            "content": "EDIT: Now that the series has finished, here are my thoughts of the series.\r\nI am sick and tired of seeing people saying that this is just another show like \"K-ON!\". Because it's KyoAni, people will think that this show is less on music and more on moe blobs.\r\nSeriously? It isn't.\r\nThe story is really simple and I like it because it stays that way. It doesn't go overboard and it doesn't even complicate stuff. The story is about a struggle of one band trying to get in the Nationals and take home the gold. And guess what? They portray the story realistically. It portrays so muchreal life problems of a band and KyoAni really pulled it off so well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I am not a band geek nor have I joined a band but probably, those things happen.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're asking if there is some romance on this anime well, just a bit. There's one episode where it's pure romance but then they get back to music on the later episodes. This anime is heavy on Slice of Life, Drama and Music. Not Romance.\\n\\n\r\nYes, this anime does have some moe stuff on it but trust me, it's more than the moe stuff they show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of this season was also well executed. That's how you end a season.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw of the series is the part on who is going to play the solo for the trumpet. Now, actually it was good at first but the execution was bad and corny.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, it's colorful and amazing. Everything on this anime has details. Well, not as detailed as Zankyou no Terror but for a music anime and placing a lot of moe blob, it doesn't really need to go overboard and it works already. The fluidity of the animation when they play the instruments was really good and KyoAni did a great job on that one.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, maybe I'll just give it a 9/10. I am not onto trumpets and stuff but, I really like the music. The opening theme is also really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, they portray it so well. The conflicts of each character are portrayed realistically.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Kumiko. She's just a normal character. Now, this isn't a character where she's so passionate about music. No, this character is different. She doesn't have a lot of passion in music (Anymore... Maybe) and yet, she ends up joining the band but why is that?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's probably because of Kumiko's experience when she was on a band in middle-school. The anime portrays a lot of flashbacks about Kumiko's experience such as not getting into the Nationals, her getting in the audition but her rival failed, etc. These emotional flashbacks affected Kumiko but why is she joining the band? Well, this is my opinion but something is telling me that she isn't ready to let go with the band. Deep inside that if she lets go, she doesn't know what to do anymore. She doesn't even like playing the Euphonium but she ends up playing with it because that's her signature instrument and that's where she is good at.\\n\\n\r\nAnother main character is Reina who really strives getting into the Nationals and take home the Gold. Unlike Kumiko, she has a passion on the band and she has a passion on playing the trumpet like her Dad. She takes the band very seriously and she doesn't take the band just to have fun. She really tries hard to get into the Nationals.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still more characters on this anime who portrayed a life of a band in High-school really well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why are you not enjoying the show? It's either you cannot relate to it or you're looking for something deeper on other than this. I can't even relate to bands and yet, this anime tries their best to let me understand on what a life of a band in High-school is about.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one underrated anime of Spring 2015 and I think it deserves more attention. Especially for people who hated K-ON! thinks this show will be bad and I think they're wrong. I haven't watch K-ON! but, I think this isn't another K-ON!. I've seen other reviews about K-ON! and it's flaws are not found here on Hibike! Euphonium. This isn't another show where they focus heavily on Comedy and focuses a lot on MOE BLOBS. Unlike K-ON!, this show portrays the struggle of a band really well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love the first 2 episodes, watch further. However, if you were bored to death on the first 2 episodes, it's best if you drop the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe director of this show is Ishihara Tatsuya - the one who directed The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. He has shown his potential on how great he is in directing.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, there'll be a second season of this show. This time, how they will become No. 1 in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9.4/10 - FINAL SCORE",

            "content": "As a person who has had his fair share of pointless Moe blob shows I admit that my initial impression of Sound! Euphonium wasn't the best. In all honesty, The moment I saw the cover of the show I dismissed it as another Moe blob show and skipped it without much thought, and It was only through high ratings and numerous recommendations that I decided I would give it a chance. But even then I wasn't convinced. I went into the first episode with a face of disdain. Only to watch further and further until I realized how terribly wrong I was. Sound! Euphonium gaveme a slap in the face and made me realize how shallow I have become. I shall never judge a book by it's cover again.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Oumae Kumiko, a former Euphonium player who looks to change her life as a High School Freshman. Ironically although she wants to avoid the High School Brass Band she gets pulled into joining along with her two new friends, and there she accidentally meets her former bandmate Kousaka Reina. A girl she accidentally insulted in junior high.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty simple and isn't very original.If that's the case then what exactly is so good about this show? One of the reasons is because of Euphonium's representation of youth. Sure Euphonium is a show about music. The show is centered around music. But even more than that Euphonium is a show about hardships, ambition, frustration, friendships,life. Euphonium is just so much more than an anime about music.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the music is overlooked or anything. On the contrary the music in Euphonium is absolutely spectacular. The band pieces that the club plays sounds exactly like an actual brass band. When I say that I am not only talking about the good pieces but also the bad pieces in the beginning of the show. The band sounds very much like an actual High School Band and I definitely appreciate that.The soundtrack apart from the actual music pieces are also quite varied and all fit the mood quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show created by KyoAni you would normally expect the usual eyegasm inducing animation that the studio has become commonly known for. Well let me tell you Euphonium takes Kyoani's standards and puts it on a whole new level.I am not kidding at all.The amount of detail from the fingerings of the instruments,character expressions,backgrounds,etc are just amazing. There is also a hint of realism in the animation that fits the show just perfectly. I really couldn't do the animation justice explaining it here. You just have to go see yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to see that Euphonium has a nice story, stunning animation, and beautiful sound. But that would all go to waste if the characters weren't good. Well fear not, for Euphonium's strongest aspect comes from it's characters. \\n\\n\r\nYou have Oumae Kumiko, A High school freshman who doesn't seem to have any special goals in her life, and wants to have a fresh start at her new school.  At face value Kumiko doesn't seem very interesting, but dig a little deeper and you realize that there is so much more to Kumiko than your average female lead. Probably the most enjoyable part of her is watching her change along with her interactions with the other people in the band. Seeing her grow over the course of the show from an indecisive person who doesn't really know what to do with her life to a person who hungers to get better with her Euphonium is truly a rewarding experience.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand you have Kousaka Reina. A cold and seemingly distant trumpet player. Reina to me is a person that puzzles me constantly because it is often very hard to see what she's thinking. On the outside she has this cold demeanor but through her various interactions with Kumiko you realize that there is so much more to Reina than what you see on the surface. \\n\\n\r\nMost people who has ever been in a school band can probably attest to this when I say that usually not everyone is on the same page. What I mean by this is that not everyone has the same goal in mind. Some people are in the school Band to just have fun playing their instrument while there are others who take music more seriously and want to start a career out of it. Some people are naturally better at others while there are others who drag the whole band down. It's not as simple as just putting up a goal and working towards it. Everyone has their own opinions and their own ideals. Sound! Euphonium knows this and represents this perfectly. The side characters are not just there to become background characters with little relevance, but each of them have their own personalities, their own opinions, their own motives. Probably one of the greatest examples of this would be Tanaka Asuka. An eccentric but extremely talented Euphonium player who is liked by most people. Her energetic personality and humorous demeanor makes her a very fun person to watch, but as I watched deeper and deeper I realized that there was much more to Asuka than meets the eye. Honestly speaking Asuka couldn't care less about the emotional drama that happens in the club. Asuka is always neutral. She never picks sides and always distances herself away from the drama that goes into the club. Asuka doesn't have any emotional investment whatsoever with the members. This can probably be seen best in a scene where Kumiko asks her who she thinks should be the solo, and Asuka answers frankly that she doesn't care. It's these types of differing attitudes that make the club seem like an actual school band, and not one that is conveniently made for anime. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly speaking one of the reasons why I have become so attached to this show is because of the chemistry between Kumiko and Reina. At the start of the show part of the reason Kumiko didn't want to continue the Euphonium was partly because of Reina. In the beginning of the show Kumiko seems to have a really hard time understanding why other people can play with such dedication, and this is evident when Kumiko asks if Reina thought that they would actually make it to the nationals in Junior High. If anything Kumiko just seems to want fun with playing the Euphonium. She doesn't want to be so devoted playing an instrument at the beginning. Through the course of the show though Kumiko ends up finding the motivation to play from none other than Reina herself. Although they seem to be completely different from each other. They are similar in the fact that they both isolate others from getting too close to them. Reina realizes later on that Kumiko is isolated like herself and wants to become close with her, because she thinks that Kumiko might be able to understand her motivations for wanting to stand out from the others. This is what becomes the motivation for Kumiko to take playing the Euphonium seriously. After learning more about Reina's ambitions. Kumiko wants to become special to. She doesn't want to be left behind by Reina. This intimate relationship between the two characters is just absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the show is completely devoid of any problems though. Kumiko and Reina's chemistry end up taking up too much of the spotlight which ends up making the other potential romance completely fizzle out and become something that completely gets shadowed over.This is a very minor problem but its still worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Sound! Euphonium was surprising to me would be an understatement. It completely blew away my expectations and then some. If there was anyone who was in a similar situation like me and decided to skip this show I urge you to give this show a chance. You might be surprised to see what you find.",

            "content": "Watching a Kyoto Animation anime is like being served up a delicious cake. It\u2019s the same cake every time but you know what to expect. There\u2019s icing on top, being the pretty visuals and animation, but usually plays it safe with a \u2018vanilla\u2019 group of characters. It\u2019s easy to digest. Hibike! Euphonium however wants to be different. Not only does it comes with sprinkles of substance but it has layers to it, different flavours working in harmony. They aren\u2019t the most incredible flavours you\u2019ve ever tasted but they are still enough to put a smile on your dial. This high school, musical showpiece took meby surprise with its fun blend of band politics and self-improvement. While it hit the odd sour note in the dialogue and story department, this sill became an easily recommendable music feast.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the story of Kumiko Oumae in her first year at Kitauji High School. A long-time player of the euphonium, she finds herself looking for a fresh start in the concert band. She makes friends with Hazuki Katou and Sapphire \u2018Midori\u2019 Kawashima along the way and the group look to breathe life back into the band. Former band dramas come to the fore however when Kumiko\u2019s former junior high bandmate Reina Kousaka enters the frame \u2013 the two not leaving on the happiest note last time they saw each other. With an unmotivated and underperforming band to work with, things are shaping up to be tough for the new members. \\n\\n\r\nEuphonium is definitely one of those shows that needs to be approached with the right mindset. If you watch this expecting music to be at the forefront 24/7 then you may end up disappointed. The music is instead a vehicle for exploring the motivations of the different band members. While that may sound a little too deep for a show about cute girls playing instruments, you\u2019d be surprised. Those with concert band experience and music students will take a lot away from the drama behind the curtains. That said, you can still take a lot away from the show without such involvement.\\n\\n\r\nThe show loves diving into a lot of the little intricacies that go into learning an instrument and learning to play as a group. People get singled out at practice and people have to make sacrifices. Such is life when you want to reach new heights. This isn\u2019t some happy-go-lucky musical field trip. Some students contemplate their future and how band could impact it while others think about their impact on the band\u2019s morale and ability. You can bet relationships get strained over it. The drama is rarely overbearing and makes sense given the current situation of the band. I always was interested to see how disagreements could be resolved, in the musical and the personal department.\\n\\n\r\nI was a little turned off by some of the over-dramatic dialogue. You can find most of these examples when the cast talk to each about wanting to reach another level in their playing. None of these conversations feel natural at all. They sound like they should be standing on a podium with a microphone in front of them. It\u2019s a common complaint I could make about a lot of anime conversations though. It\u2019s nothing new and it\u2019s very easy to overlook. \\n\r\nThe romance elements also feel a little shoehorned at times. Love has its own part to play but it\u2019s at its best when it\u2019s being subtle. Some moments simply aren\u2019t, and whenever they come around I\u2019d think to myself \u2018I wish they\u2019d just get back to the music already\u2019. To delve any deeper into this goes into spoiler territory so it\u2019s one of those areas you have to judge for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOne of Kumiko\u2019s most interesting points as a character is watching her reasons to play changing. Different events make her want to back away from it all while others spur her on. While maybe having the least distinct personality of the lead quintet Kumiko is never dull. I wasn\u2019t too interested in her over the opening half of the show but as things change, and she\u2019s forced to become more proactive, her story is more engaging. She isn\u2019t the most memorable main character ever made but she\u2019s one you want to see succeed as the episodes roll by.\\n\\n\r\nReina is an enigma. She\u2019s easily the most interesting person in the show with that combination of her brooding nature and a desire to be at the top. You can never be sure what she\u2019s thinking. Reina is focused, driven and shut off from the more upbeat personalities she\u2019s surrounded by. I liked how alien Reina behaves in that area. She\u2019s the necessary cool head in a sea of more emotional classmates, but of course she has her own flaws. Her relationship with Kumiko is assessed on a few occasions, they being some of the series\u2019 turning points. At times she steals the show and feels more like the main character.\\n\\n\r\nHazuki bounces up and down in relevance. She has her moments but feels swept under the rug beyond a certain point in the show. Her energy is infectious and she could have been used a little more often. Then there\u2019s Midori who could have been invisible the whole time and it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. It\u2019s a pity because there\u2019s something about a tiny contrabass player that\u2019s amusing. I needed more of that.\\n\\n\r\nI love that most of the characters have some value to them, even those on the sidelines. It\u2019s rewarding as viewer to see side characters develop and watch them constantly interacting with our main players. In a show with a large group together like Hibike! Euphonium it helps the concert band feel dynamic. Whether it be the quiet club president Haruka Ogasawara or her polar opposite vice president Asuka Tanaka, they\u2019re all fun to watch. It could have been easy to let this show play out just focusing on one or two characters, but I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a show built on deep characters. It\u2019s a show built on different personalities clashing against one another. I personally found that a good experience, one that matched KyoAni\u2019s setting and design well. You could have taken a more serious route through a different studio, and that could have been fine, but I like what\u2019s been put to screen here.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals & Sound\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of setting and design, there are some mesmerising scenes in this show. There are even scenes that made me say \u2018wow\u2019 simply based on its animation quality. Background art is lovely and the instruments look and sound wonderful. KyoAni don\u2019t shy away from animating finger movements at regular intervals, showing off both their handy staff and their budget. That\u2019s an area most like to avoid when it comes to animating musical performances. \\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re also at the top of their game when it comes to animating minor facial expressions and details. It\u2019s the little things that can make a show engaging. There\u2019s twitches, shrugs and other movements studios often decide to leave out of the process. These keep coming at you every episode in Euphonium. Kumiko and Asuka are big winners in this area. It\u2019s also nice to see KyoAni break away ever so slightly from their regular, predictable character designs. Eye design and colouring are the big points there. They\u2019re almost hypnotic. They\u2019ve made some adjustments from the source material that really help bring some spark to certain characters, fusing their own style with the novel perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a show based on music so the sound better be on point. Thankfully it is. There\u2019s a selection of great group pieces and some amazing solo efforts. Overall it\u2019s a great audio package. I don\u2019t normally make space to discuss OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s either but both deserve a round of applause. Both upbeat blaring brass numbers \u201cDream Solister\u201d and \u201cTutti\u201d capture the energy and tone of the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nWhen you strip back all of the gorgeous KyoAni visuals there is still plenty to be found in both the story and characters department. All the conflict makes sense and people have to make tough decisions. In the face of that, Euphonium rarely becomes too serious for its own good. There are times when it does jump that shark however, particularly in the dialogue department. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is at its strongest when the focus is on band politics. The balance between music and romance thankfully favours the music side of things, with the latter\u2019s handling a little clunky. In spite of that, Hibike! Euphonium remains one of the most interesting shows and surprising success stories from the spring 2015 season.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7/10 (Good)",

            "content": "I really don\u2019t know about this series. I know for sure that it WAS NOT good, but I don\u2019t really know what to think about it and what exactly I liked and disliked about the series. I know that it looked really pretty and there were some beautiful moments, but many of these key scenes didn\u2019t have a purpose that was fulfilled by how they looked. Its as if the show wanted to look nice just to look nice and the images didn\u2019t enhance the plot as much as they should have. \r\nSpeaking of the plot, it was mostly hit or miss with both thefirst and second halves feeling weak in their own ways. The first half had some enjoyable parts but the main cast didn\u2019t really mesh together in any real or believable way, and most characters didn\u2019t have anything to really like about them. Many were bland and didn\u2019t have much purpose aside from either being an obstacle or fulfilling an aside that fed into the main conflict. Kumiko was likable to an extent and received the most development, and I can really appreciate that she isn\u2019t put into a certain mold and feels conflicting and layered enough that she feels the most real, but she was a character that would have been better served in a better plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was, personally, the weakest part of the series in part to how inconsequential it felt at times, and how many of the surrounding elements did not service it in a meaningful way. What I mean by this is that many of the asides that the series which served to either flesh out the world, provide character development, or explain the situation in a practical way, didn\u2019t seem to have much impact because the time spent developing these scenes did not, in turn, provide a similarly large effect on the world. Often the understandings of other characters to what is happening or the status quo does not change and it feels like most of these moments could have easily been tossed aside and it almost seems like they were. That is not to say that certain scenes such as Kumiko and Rikka on the mountain aren\u2019t memorable, but that it instead feels like it came out of nowhere and disappeared without any real impact on what is going on. You could call it subtlety and say that development on these characters is meant to be subdued and realistic, but even in that case it doesn\u2019t work because we do not spend enough time getting to know these people to really know how their feeling. Other than Kumiko who, admittedly, did believably change over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAside from this, the series feels the need to shove all development down our throat with useless narration which often repeats to us things we could understand just by watching what is happening, and most of the time comes off as redundant and unnecessary which ultimately takes you out of the experience. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the plot showed promise, particularly at the beginning where the destination and the obstacles were made clear and the possibilities of truly coming together while working towards something meaningful as a group seemed like what the series was aiming for, while emphasizing the attempted repair of an awkward friendship. The problem, I think, is that the series was too short. I faulted the series\u2019 inconsequential asides but I believe if this same story was told over more episodes and we really got to know more members of the band then while seeing them all interact would have given the story more impact as we see how the events of the story matter to them and better understand what makes them who they are. Instead nothing feels like it really matters because as certain elements are introduced, they often don\u2019t have a worthwhile conclusion or don\u2019t add anything to the story. They may tell you more but not enough that you know why it matters. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses certain events only add unnecessary drama or hold the overall plot back either because the whole story also has the misfortune of being largely predictable, and because they do not add any further tension when the stakes were clearly established and characters act in a way that defy what is best for everyone and holds everyone back. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, and this is much more personal, I did not enjoy Kumiko and Rikka\u2019s relationship. To be clear, most of the characters lacked meaningful relationships, but I did not see a reason to enjoy their\u2019s in particular. Nor did I see any reason to justify them as a yuri pairing. NONE AT ALL. I am being entirely serious. None of their interactions in the beginning gave me any reason to believe either of them even liked each other nor do they even seem to get along most of the time. They just have vaguely romantic moments that serve no purpose and feel very out of place.       \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don\u2019t hate the series, but I do have many problems with it, and would easily say that it is my least favorite Kyoto Animation show of recent memory. I can give credit to Kumiko being likable enough to make some parts bearable, and for the ending actually feeling fulfilling. However, most everything else was not enjoyable and I began to actively dislike the show by the 3rd quarter. I didn\u2019t like the characters, I didn\u2019t like how the plot flowed, and while the show is beautiful, the art does not add anything nor do anything to bring you closer to the world. Its pretty but without substance.",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium was absolutely gorgeous and blew away my expectations in every field. Kyoto Animation at their best what I mean by that is their ability to make the viewer fully engaged into a slice of life anime. Throughout my extensive catalog of anime I have had my fair share of the slice of life genre and I can say with the utmost confidence that Euphonium is definitely one to check out. I started watching the anime on the pretext of a group of people saying it may be the anime of the season. Upon hearing that statement from my high horse I decided thatit may be worth looking into. In the course of watching the show I constantly reminded myself that SNAFU Zoku was the anime of the season and as I completed the final episode of Euphonium I painfully, but not regrettably, give Euphonium anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory - You have to \"love\" anime Synopsis' because they merely scratch the surface. The Story focuses on a band club that commits to make it into the national competition little did they know how far away they were from meeting that goal.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The backgrounds! The highlights! I haven't been shown the beauty of 2015 animation until Euphonium premiered. Kyoto Animation really made an outstanding piece of work. No matter how familiar I am with their works it still did not prepare me for the beautiful display of emotional scenes that were blissfully captured.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Its of the Music genre of course the music would be emphasized. The music was very dependent on the skill of the club so as you would watch the show from beginning to end you could see their growth as well as hear it. I am no where near a person that can critique music but if you listen closely you could see how just a small change of sound and a strength of breath can take music a long way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Kumiko by far was my favorite as her inspiration was Reina who possessed an undying dedication to music as well as her future. Kumiko broke my preconceived image of her as the optimistic protagonist we have all seen before within the first episode. These two made for the most stunningly beautiful scenes I have ever seen in a long time. In the beginning each club member was made to make a decision not only as a club but also as individuals. The characters that were focused on in the anime each had something different that would propel them past their limits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Hands down this is a contender for anime of the year. I enjoyed every episode and I can potentially see myself rewatching Euphonium in the future.\\n\\n\r\nFor my closing remarks I would like to talk about how good of an anime it was for the music genre instead of the slice of life aspect I have been ranting on about. Musically, it was superb for an anime for being set in high school. So for my final piece, I would like to say Euphonium is better than \"Your Lie In April\" for many reasons that I wish I could disclose to the general public, however, I am afraid I cannot incorporate spoilers in this review. I know it is a bold claim as I too, am a fan of \"Your Lie In April\". In whichever case I hope you take this review into account when you decide on your next anime.",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is a curios production that in narrative, visuals and music has moments where it truly shines, but sadly they are diluted by mediocre plot points, unnecessary characters and unusual story structure, taking what could have been a strong and emotionally resonant series down to a pleasant, but ultimately scarcely memorable watch.\r\nThe story, centered around Kumiko Oumae and her music class companions as they try to get to the nationals, is very inconsistent in terms of emotional intensity, pacing and enjoyment. Throughout the early episodes, the story is focussed on introducing Kumiko and her friends, Midori and Hazuki, to the audience, however this islittle initial tension or overbearing atmosphere to keep the audience engaged through this middling introduction. Hazuki increasing her capacity to breate, though insightful to those who are interested in the qualities required to play a wind instrument, is neither comedic nor engaging; even worse, it feels as though the audience are being forcefully pulled away from the considerably more interesting side characters like Asuka, Reina and the instructor, Taki. As the narrative progresses, other characters do become more relevant, but the results are mixed. An entire episode is spent focussing on a love triangle that goes nowhere, a conspiracy of nepotism that adds nothing and the main character faltering the episode before the climax. However, that\u2019s not to say that the story is a failure; specific moments are so well written and directed that they are simply breathtaking, such as second halves of episodes 8, 11 and 13. On the whole, this leads to a story that feels too long in some ways, as it has many redundant gears that simple exist to pad out the series, yet too short in others, as the more interesting and resonant parts are never given the focus they deserve. Tragically, though all the ingredients were there to construct a heart-warming, memorable story, they were not handled with the competence required to make this a truly great slice of life series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are much like the story in terms of how mixed they are. Reina Kousaka is without a doubt the highlight character, boasting a stoic and occasionally cryptic attitude that makes her intriguing, but having sufficient depth and believability to make her relatable. Her scene on the mountain with Kumiko was the magnum opus of this anime, having sufficient build-up to warrant the reveal of her ideals without feeling cheap or melodramatic. However, her full potential isn\u2019t quite reached, as conflicts are introduced regarding her, yet they rarely reach a resolution. Taki, the instructor, is also a very watchable character, but he gets little development or screen time, which, given the conspiracy surrounding his relationship with Reina, is quite a missed opportunity. Speaking of missed opportunities, Asuka has little done with her character after it is established, though thankfully this fault isn't nearly as glaring, as her interactions with the rest of the cast more than make up for it. However, regarding the character cast of Hibike! Euphonium, the praise ends there. The other characters all fall into the categories of being either disappointingly mediocre or outright boring. Kumiko joins the former category; perhaps she was intended to act as a character through which the audience could view the others, but this approach leaves much to be desired, because she seems like too much of a blank slate. She does have some development in the penultimate episode, but by then it is too little, too late, coming off as more of a desperate attempt at character growth instead of a relatable problem. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of giving her more consistent growth, time is wasted on her friends, Midori and Hazuki, whose company would perhaps be more appreciated if they didn\u2019t distract from the emotional core of the series, Kumiko and Reina\u2019s relationship. As they are, they\u2019re annoying, uninteresting friends who say way too much and add much too little. Though other characters, like Natsuki and Aoi aren\u2019t bad by any means, they waste ample time in an anime that really needs to pick and choose its foci better. However, though everything mentioned thus far is mixed to a varying degree, there is one constant in Hibike! The comedy is uniformally bad. There is not one genuine laugh provided even though every trick in the moe-book-of-laughs is used. Breast gags come off as more obnoxious than anything else, awkward character interactions make the audience feel just as uncomfortable and the over the top facial expressions don\u2019t gel with the more dramatic nature of the series. Sometimes the comedy and drama are shifted between with so little grace that the audience suffer from tonal whiplash, and occasionally it feels like even the series doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s trying to communicate. That\u2019s not to say the drama is done poorly; quite the contrary. The climax of the series sent chills down my spine, and the aforementioned conversation between Reina and Kumiko in Episode 8 resonated to my very soul. If there were more moments like this, Euphonium might have been great, but it must simply settle for being decent.\\n\\n\r\nSurely the animation is its saving grace, right? Kyoto animation always delivers in this regard, right? Well, if you consider a spotless glass of water to be beautiful, then this will probably appeal to you. However, for me it didn\u2019t stick out nearly enough most of the time to make this series a real spectacle. The character designs are bright and consistent, fluid and detailed, but lack a sense of identity needed to make them memorable. Chuunibyou\u2019s character designs had a exuded a sense of silly optimism, giving the audience an idea of who they are before they even spoke. Hibike! Euphonium\u2019s character designs, on the other hand, didn\u2019t really have much emotion. Aside from Reina, who the animators seemed to priorities above everyone else just like the writers did, Kumiko and the others, particularly the males, are monotonous to watch, with their plain uniforms and uninteresting expressions. The animators not only seemed to put their best efforts into the best characters, but the best scenes as well. For the most part, the series is set in a detailed, yet ultimately blandly coloured and designed room, feeling very claustrophobic and unengaging, both visually and narratively. On top of that, wind instruments are, by design, not particularly notable visual stimulants, and the anime fails to work around this. Aside from the occasional mouth movement, the euphonium and trumpet players only occasionally move a single finger, and that\u2019s in the rare instance that the frame is focussed on them. That's not to say the instruments themselves were bad, as they are extremely well drawn and lit, but they weren't utilised properly. The occasionally visited lake, however, is absolutely breathtaking, as is Reina\u2019s resplendent white dress in episode 8 and the bridge shown during Kumiko\u2019s meltdown in episode 12, which, along with the accompanying strong facial animation and soaring music, leaves me both wistful to see more, and disappointed that such well-directed scenes are so few and far between. On the whole, Hibike! Is easy on the eye, but serves very little purpose for the vast majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is much like the visuals; technically, it\u2019s high quality, with crisp sound effects and realistic instrument sounds, but it feels much too safe and by-the-numbers to impress like it should, particularly in an anime the focusses so heavily on music. The OP and ED are both completely forgettable, often starkly contrasting the more dramatics episodes in the series and they\u2019re both overall weak, generic songs in their own right. The voice acting for the male characters in this series is completely forgettable, even for Taki-sensei, barring one or two emotional moments. Kumiko\u2019s fairly good, Asuka and Reina are both great, but Midori and Hazuki are nails on a chalk board, absolutely irritating in every line they speak. Interestingly, I think the voice actress for Kaori was the stand out, capturing the emotional intensity and restraint of her character in a role that would have been very easy to fumble in. The OST doesn\u2019t back up this relatively strong group of voice actors very well, shining only, as was mentioned earlier, in the same moments as the characters and visuals, but being disappointingly mediocre in every other respect. It\u2019s pleasant, certainly, and keeps up with the pace, but nothing is memorable or evoking, as the series further proves its inability to reach its potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes presented in Hibike! Euphonium, at least on paper, are resonant, relatable to people regardless of their age and should make for some emotionally satisfying moments. Themes such as being the underdog, finding self-acceptance and self-value and enjoying the little moments in life are all present.  However, much like every other aspect of Hibike!, they\u2019re a mixed bag. Reina herself struggles with her love for Taki, while also feeling slightly uncomfortable around him and very defensive of him, though this never reaches anything. Kumiko struggles with her ability, though after an outstanding character moment, this is resolved too easily and too late. Such themes and scenarios are peppered throughout, but the series messily tangles them, introducing too many and resolving few of them. Even Asuka is hinted to have some hidden secrets, but they never come to fruition. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hibike! Euphonium is a can-see anime. If it looks like it will appeal to you, if you have fond memories of being in a school band or aren\u2019t as concerned about messy structure, then you will by no means regret this. It\u2019s pretty to look at, sound pleasant, and has some stand out moments that elevates it from so-so to decent, though if, like me, you would prefer something with a more decisive and competent handling of its themes and characters, there are better anime out there for you. However, a second season could blow many of my problems away, and if there is a second season, I\u2019ll be watching.\\n\\n\r\n(On a side note, the translation of Hibike! Euphonium to Sound! Euphonium is one I disprove of. Instead, direct and more tonally accurate translate would be \u201cYou Can Play! Euphonium\u201d, though perhaps this would make the product less marketable. )\\n",

            "content": "I'm a music person. I've always been one, though at the beginning it was in heart alone. In middle school I played violin, trumpet and sang in the choir, and I was told promptly and I quote that I sounded like \"a cat being run over by a lawnmower\". This didn't get me down though (for some reason,) in fact I saw my apparent absolute lack of any talent whatsoever to be a sign that I was meant to pursue music. I continued to practice much to the suffering of everyone around me, and though I experienced harsh criticism along the way I'm now incollege and I'm part of two prestigious music groups and consider myself to be a functioning member of the music community. I can look back and track my progress from hopeless wannabe to soloing for Joe Biden at his Christmas party at the National Observatory. I still have the napkins I stole from his bathroom. Hopefully no NSA cameras were watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound! Euphonium is a show all about this struggle, the burning desire to make your seemingly impossible ambitions come to life, and so while I am obviously laden with personal bias due to my background I will still stand here and testify as an equally great fan of storytelling that as the great Euphonium yuri shipping fad of Spring 2015 comes to an end, what we're left with is... a pretty spectacular show.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has developed quite the reputation for itself over the past decade with shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, K-On and Hyouka, to name a few. Anyone who's seen more than one of these has probably noticed a trend; it's not something they try to hide. KyoAni loves three things, or rather they know that anime viewers love them: high school, slice-of-life, and moe. Literally everything they've put out in over ten years has had these traits, and they've been spectacularly effective at least in part due to them. I've heard a lot of people complain about how KyoAni's endless fluff shows are ruining anime, and to that I would say: KyoAni really hasn't made that many shows. Blame other studios trying to replicate their success for the moeblob spam that inevitably flood every season. When KyoAni DOES make a show, however, anyone who is willing to put up with the inevitable fluff should check it out, and Sound! Euphonium is no exception. Actually, I would go so far as to say that Sound! Euphonium is one of the best KyoAni shows to ever be produced. Euphonium is pretty much the perfected embodiment of KyoAni's strengths: the art is stunning. The character animation is out of this WORLD. The writing and drama are strong and honest. The music... ohhhh the music.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name would imply (and contrary to what many lusting fans seem to believe,) Euphonium is a show about music. Yes, there are drama and romance in it but its first-and-foremost focus is on the growth of the high-school band in which our protagonist Kumiko is a euphonium player. Because of this, the show has a very group-oriented focus, because hey, bands are a group effort. The band cannot succeed without the effort and cooperation of ALL of its members, not just the protagonists, and while Kumiko and her close friends strive for personal improvement both in attitude and talent Euphonium shows us time and again that they are inevitably only part of a collective whole that must all come together in this way in order to be successful. This is the first aspect in which the show absolutely wowed me: \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nEuphonium is a short 13 episodes, and yet not only does it manage to deeply develop the protagonist and her close relationships but also follow a supporting cast of an unbelievable size. More than ten characters have full arcs across the length of the show and countless others gets development and recognizable personalities. Despite this, the show never feels rushed and it never feels as though its detracting attention from either the main cast or the band itself. It does this by carefully weaving the character's struggles together so that each episode focuses on a plethora of conflicts, showing how they may or may not be connected but also how they all matter as part of the band's dynamic. No one gets left behind: there are small, quick scenes all over the place keeping tabs on all of the characters, and by the end when I'm watching the band preform it feels like I'm actually connected to the ensemble rather than just some of the people that are in it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main cast are individually compelling as well: Kumiko is definitely up there as one of the best female protagonists of all time, as someone who is relatable, charismatic, and a touch-- dare I say-- deep? She begins the show as directionless but contemplative, and as her obviously intense thought process slowly guides her towards something she cares about she experiences some of the most profound moments I've ever seen in an anime: spectacularly executed scenes about the pursuit of passion and trying to weigh what's supposed to matter against what matters to you personally. (Of course, the show handles these ideas in a much more tactful way than I just did, and that's really what sells it.) Her exceptionally driven comrade (and secret lesbian lover) Reina is actually equally compelling: her frustration with others apathy, her honesty about her own ambition, and her struggle to try to interact with others in a way that is more tactful but still honest all add up to make her a suitable romantic counte-- I mean, \"best friend\" for Kumiko, the protagonist. You'll get plenty of heartwarming scenes from the two of them, but you'll also get ones that are powerful and true: Euphonium is one of KyoAni's most driven shows, and it is not content to just sit back and be cute and charming. Much like Reina and Kumiko it wants to go places, and go places it does.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT\\n\\n\r\nI was actually amazed by how much story the show managed to cover in thirteen episodes. Much like an elegant trombone slide the story of the show progresses fast but smooth, blending together with the character's development to achieve that most desirable effect that all slice-of-life shows dream of: a plot that is driven by countless small moments rather than a few obvious big ones. Life doesn't move in big shifts, it moves through countless small moments, and Euphonium captures that. The band grows and improves, both in sound quality and relationship, such that it is an unrecognizable ensemble by the end of the show. Progress and change are steady in the show, but they aren't dramatized. You can look back and see how far the band and the characters have come (and they do the same thing) but it's not something where you can point to a specific moment and say \"this is where things changed\". Things are ALWAYS changing. What I will say, without spoiling anything, is that Euphonium has a definitive story and conclusion. It isn't just a slice-of-life where stuff happens and then at the end some stuff has happened and it teeters off: Both Euphonium and its characters have a goal, and by the end of the show we are given a definitive resolution to that goal. While a sequel would be both possible and much desired, it is not required as the show does a great job (especially amongst anime, which are known for having obnoxious unresolved conclusions) of having a powerful and definitive ending, with what was in my opinion the best episode of the season (and maybe even the year if not for episode 9 of Death Parade) thanks to its top-tier character moments and ABSOLUTELY FRIGGING GORGEOUS MUSIC\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThis is the VERY BEST soundtrack I have EVER experienced. Not because it's the prettiest or catchiest music-- though it is extremely enjoyable, but because like everything else in the show it is the most impressively nuanced thing I've ever heard. People don't comically suck in Euphonium: they're usually just kind of sloppy and sad, so that you can tell not just that they're not great but exactly how \"not great\" they are. When the band first plays, it's not an abomination: it's simply lacking, morose, and full of small yet noticeable errors in tempo and pitch. It's not hard on the ears, but it's not fun to listen to either. However, as everyone improves and the talent of both the individuals and the group gets spectacularly better you can HEAR it. You can hear the marked improvement, even though there are still errors. You can hear the energy and vitality that begins to seep into everyone's performance. You can hear each rehearsal as the pitch becomes clearer and the parts begin to line up crisper. As I mentioned earlier I'm a music person myself, so I obviously have a little bias here. But I still firmly believe that this show NAILS IT with carefully executed performances and a stunning attention to detail when it comes to comparing and contrasting different sounds. One scene that jumps to mind (without spoiling anything: I'll be vague) is when characters are auditioning for a solo part and two markedly stunning performances are given... and yet despite how good one of them is you can still hear just how much better the other is. I was blown away. The show respects the audience, playing the music as it would be and letting them decide for themselves what they think sounds best rather than making the gap in performance qualities obvious enough that anyone can notice it as a contrived indication of talent. \\n\\n\r\nTHE ART\\n\\n\r\nis gorgeous. Remember Hyouka? Well, it's more of that. It might even be prettier in some scenes. The attention to character movements and details is on-point, the direction is godlike, the backgrounds and instruments are both drawn gorgeously. One of my favorite things about the animation is that it ensures that characters are always subtly shifting or moving in some way, as people do, as opposed to using the classic \"person standing here and only their mouth or maybe one hand is moving.\" People move constantly, especially in conversation, and Euphonium captures that bringing everyone in the show to more vibrant life. I'm not holding that against other shows at all though: it's great that KyoAni can do that, but that's pretty much only because they're rich as fuck and can literally bring worlds to life by throwing money at the screen. What they can get credit for though is the way that the scenes and character motions are framed: aka GORGEOUS and indicative of the countless complicated feelings and relationships the various band members have between themselves. This also is some of the most obvious and solid proof of Kumiko and Reina's steamy future, but that's besides the point.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching this. I loved the performances, as they were borderline epic. I loved the characters, as they were compelling and sweet and diverse and were portrayed in a plethora of environments and moods. I loved the romance, which was touching and adorable and didn't overshadow the actual story. I actually signed up for a crunchyroll trial so that I could watch the new episodes sooner, and I'll be adding this to the top tier of my sequel wishlist. It's short, its amazingly well executed, it's compelling, and I'd pretty much recommend it to anyone. Anime of the season. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10, Most impressive soundtrack of all time, Needs R-rated spinoff.\\n",

            "content": "\"Music is nice. You can't lie. You can only admit when something sounds good.\" \r\nIsn't that so true? Whether or not you like Kyoto Animation, it's hard to deny that Hibike Euphonium sounds amazing. \r\nHibike sounds alive. I don't know how they pulled it off, but the show sounds so human. You hear as students warm up and tune their instruments together, you hear when the trombone players goof up, you hear the protagonist's tone change as she develops her skills, and when the whole band plays together, it's a real treat. This is great sound design--this is music anime donewell.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the music, Hibike looks fantastic too! The attention to detail is especially high with instruments, and with how well the animation syncs with the sound. The combined result of vibrant visuals and lush sound is a truly immersive show. \\n\\n\r\nBut what's so cool about this show is that unlike K-on (...which I still guiltily like), this show is a kept promise.\\n\r\nLooking at the poster, you are sold the promise of good orchestral music and cute characters. \\n\r\nAnd if you came for that...you will not be let down.\\n\\n\r\nBut, saying this show is JUST cute girls playing music would be slighting it. The show undersells itself with its moe-looking setup. Hibike tells relatable tales about the struggle of not feeling good enough, shooting for goals that seem out of reach, and of course, relying on friendship and love to power through it all.\\n\\n\r\nBut believe me when I say that none of it is cheesy--not everything has to be cynical and brooding like 'Whiplash' to be awe-inspiring like Hibike can be. I would point out specific moments, but you just have to see them...and hear them.\\n\\n\r\nHibike is a classic example of \"short but sweet.\" The 13-episode length keeps the action rolling and the production value consistent. \\n\r\nAs you watch these 13 episodes, you'll be introduced to underdogs you can root for and relate to, as well as geniuses you can admire. You'll follow the steady growth of one determined orchestra band as they reach for the top of their game. And through it all, you'll hear everyone's music, and whether or not you like the soundtrack as much as I did, you won't be wrong--after all, music can't lie.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is a wasted opportunity. It has great attention to detail in both art and sound design when it comes to the instruments, but falls flat on its face in almost every other aspect. Having just come off of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso/Your Lie in April, which has two great musical sequences in the first two episodes, the fact that it took until episode 3 for any real music to pop up in this series frustrated me too much than it should have. That frustration followed me throughout the series.\r\nThe series seems to at times WANT to be about music, but is draggedinto drama because that tension is supposed to move the story and characters along. Ultimately, it seems as if only a few characters really meaningfully change, and we're left with maybe four decent performances in the 13 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the series roughly covers a school year, the entire pace seems slow, since there are only really two major plot points that involve playing pieces of music, and the series builds to the second over the course of the majority of its episodes. This is slightly understandable, since the point of the series is the drama of the club more than them actually playing music. If there's a sequel and it continues to follow this format it will be inexcusable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm probably judging this harsher than I should for what it is, but looking at it as a fan of music anime and seeing what it could have been... In the end, I'm just glad that I'm done watching this series so I don't have to fret over how much it annoys me any more.",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is like a symphony. It starts off slow and mellow, then comes at you full force, not letting you go until the very end. \r\nStory: Being that it's a KyoAni work, many people deemed the show \"K-On in Concert Band\" without further thought. From the first two episodes, the show seemed to just be a simplistic slice-of-life, albeit a cute and fun one. However, the plot picks up surprisingly quickly from the show's brilliant third episode. From that point on, Hibike! Euphonium becomes a terrific coming-of-age story, that roused feelings of nostalgia from my very core. The storyline is paced wonderfully, never goingtoo slow or too fast. Plot threads reveal and close themselves in beautiful ways. Sadly, Hibike! Euphonium is based off a series too large to adapt in one cour, so there isn't a defining conclusion. But, because of that same fact, we can hope for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: KyoAni has great animation. It's a well known fact. However, what amazes me is that KyoAni upped their game even more. Every single side character has a unique character design, full of personality, even if they never speak a single line. The particle effects that fill the show make it burst with personality and life. The lighting and colors on the instruments are almost like photographs. The backgrounds are gorgeous. Everything about the art is just perfect. I could rave about it forever. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is an anime about music. Unsurprisingly, the music in it is great. The actual soundtrack is orchestrated wonderfully, driving in the emotion of powerful scenes. However, the sound truly shines when the characters play their instruments. The amount of work that must've gone into the subtle differences between each player and each time they play a song astounds me. I mean, the show literally has Sound (Hibike) in the name. The sound better damn well be astounding. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the show truly shines. Well, I give everything about this show a 10/10, so I guess I have to give character an 11/10. The character development is just so realistically written, it hurts. It reminds me of my own high school experiences and the sometimes dumb, confusing ways I felt. I don't know if I can think of another show that has character development so fluid and natural. At the same time, every character is multi-layered in amazing ways. Even some of the side characters who only make a few appearances get their time to show off development or multiple dimensions. You'll love some characters and you'll hate some characters, but ultimately, you'll appreciate how all of them grow.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in Hibike! Euphonium comes together to create a piece that I think is truly special. Give it a shot. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! This time we're tackling a band adventure! The most important fact when it comes to this anime is one's experience in high school band. If you are not/were not a member, much the attraction is probably lost on you, just by the niche nature of the material. Now, a non band kid can understand frustration and hard work, but much of this show is (clearly) geared for those familiar with the experience. Having known the experience, I found a great deal to like! Taking bets on if/or how many pics this anime scored on the RTLR wall of terriblepain. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nMuch of the story revolves around motivating the lazy band kids into actually caring about their performance. A new band director comes to the school, and has a very interesting method to trying to get a response from the kids. I will leave the show to reveal his methods, but I can say as a former band member, his methods work, as they were similar as to what my high school director employed on my high school band. These methods, however, produce a great deal of friction from the members, who are used to doing things the 'way we always have' and see little reason to change. There is also a mysterious character related to the new director.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nThe instruments are well drawn, not an easy feat considering tubas can have up to 18 feet of tubing. Each instrument is instantly recognizable, and sharply drawn. The rest of the art also benefits from the same level of detail. The characters look amazing, and emotional overtones are easily carried through the artwork, always a sign that things are on the right track.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWhen a group is pointed out as sounding bad, they sound particularly bad. When the group improves and sounds good, the playing level of the music improves to match. This is an important factor as music is such a central theme in this anime. Maybe with a pop-music based anime some can be written off as personal preference, but this is classic brass and woodwind pieces where reed squeaks and off tone notes stick out like sore thumbs and cannot be written off as intentional by any means. When students play their instruments alone, the sound is dead on and at the right skill level for the character. The sound outside the music is well done, nothing of note, but nothing lacking either. The smaller girl's voice sounds appropriately small, etc. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThere is a mystery girl who is an accomplished musician who joins this school for mysterious reasons. I, like any 'band nerd' knew nearly instantly why she was there. Anyone that didn't live their lives around their tuba and/or non musicians should know the anime does lay the story out in appropriate pieces over the course of the series, so that by the end, it should be obvious. I think they were a little muddled and should have, at the end, stated it plainly, but I imagine they figured most viewers already knew. Still a couple points off for that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe 'pretty' girl is a weirdo, one of the instruments gets the best name ever, the sights and sounds of band are there in all their (sometimes gross) glory, the music is good, and some of the instruments are twice as big as the kids playing them, what more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\n If you've ever practiced your lips/fingertips off preparing for concert contest, or have done laps for marching contest, and enjoyed any of it, you'll find lots to love here. This is unabashedly high school band, and there's nothing wrong with that! In fact, in honor of my years as a tuba player (and a few years on trumpet) Kato Hazuki and Tubacabra made the RTLR wall of honor! Check this one out, might just work for ya! Thumbs up!",

            "content": "Kyoto animation is often described by many people as the studio in which they keep producing the exact same shows endlessly, that show being cute girls in a school type setting. While it is true that many, if not all do feature some kind of cute girl in high school, each one of Kyoto's works carries its own distinct flavour and personality that sets it apart from the others shows they have made. Hibike Euphonium is the latest anime by Kyoto and perfectly presents  the reason why I fell in love with this studio in the first place. Furthermore, while this anime can becompared to K-on since they both feature cute girls playing music the content is quite different which I'll get into a bit later in this post.\\n\\n\r\nLike most of the works from this studio, I was blown away by the high quality animation, character designs and the absolutely beautiful shot composition and design of the school. The music room is incredibly memorable just from how well designed it is and how much detail is put into creating this room much like the club room from k-ON! Another thing that impressed me is the changes in expressions the characters would have mid sentence which conveyed a better sense of their emotions than any other anime from this year, rather than simply having the character explain in black and white what their emotions are. The hair colours for each of the girls are more realistic, although it does push it in a few places, which works well with the more realistic approach to music this anime was going for. The lighting is fantastic and emphasises the playing perfectly and the characters move with such fluidity and movement that it is breathtaking to see.  But there is more to this show then just simply the well done design choices.\\n\\n\r\nHibike Euphonium tells the story of musicians and their complex relationship to their art and our main character Kumiko struggles throughout the entirety of the show with her feelings towards playing music and finding an aspiration in life. This sets up an interesting narrative and sinks the character with a higher level of realism. Kumiko's conflict stems from the opening scene where we see Reina, a character who takes playing the trumpet extremely seriously and somebody who is always working, begin to cry as they didn't make it into nationals. Kumiko is confused by this and enrages Reina even more therefore setting up the emotional conflict of these two characters, as well as their stance when it comes to playing their instrument right from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nUpon entering high school, Kumiko is more or less ready to give up her playing of the Euphonium and move on with her life with a fresh start but soon becomes mixed up with people who all have the same interest as her in the brass band and kind of joins in reluctantly as the first two friends she makes also join. Kumiko, in contrast to Sapphire and Reina has no aspirations or motivations for playing in the band and tries her best to avoid this topic, most likely stemming from the fact that she herself is not aware of her own passion yet. \\n\\n\r\nHowever this is ironic as Kumiko is someone with so much talent for playing her instrument as she almost made to the nationals and has the ability to tell when people are performing badly or not while also carrying around a plushie of her instrument.\\n\\n\r\nKumiko's character does become more and more inspired and motivated by her music through the course of the show as she begins to mend her past with Reina leading to some thick homosexual sub tones in later episodes and by realising how fun playing music is. Her commitment to playing the instrument becomes almost overwelhiming as it becomes her main priority.\\n\r\nReina's character is also very interesting too, as she strives hard for some kind of recognition in music and even at times goes as far to proclaim herself as a better musician in front of her seniors. She is somebody who whole heartedly believes in herself and her craft which makes for an enjoyable and realistic approach to music.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Sapphire, one of the people who befriends Kumiko is driven by her desire to play her instrument as best she can and expresses a very optimistic persona that they could make it to nationals. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters are interesting in their growth and how they change throughout the course of the show. Each of the supporting cast has such depth and character all growing more and more throughout the anime. Each character is given enough time to breath and spread their wings. The growth of the characters is also evident by how well they can play at the end of the anime from the ability to play at the start.\\n\\n\r\nWhile musicianship does take up a large section of the narrative there are other themes thrown in such as love which doesn't feel tacked on but handled in such a way to invoke realism and character growth for Hazuki.\\n\r\nThe relationship that grows between Kumiko and Reina is very believable and they both complement each other well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat impressed me the most was the small attentions to detail. Simply just a teacher telling the girls to make their skirts longer sinks well in the pacing of the story and adds to the realism of the story. Also, the instruments these girls play all seem like real instruments with the amount of detail put into creating them. The drama between the different characters in the music room as well as the different opinions of how music should be play coupled with the anticipation of performing their music was all implemented amazingly into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall soundtrack was amazing with noticeable highlights being the final performance at the end and the scene in which Kumiko runs down a road proclaiming her desire to play the instrument. The soundtrack is amazing and really highlights many of the scenes bringing them to life.\\n\r\n Overall, whenever people say that Kyoto have lost their touch, this is a show I'll bring up in retaliation to what they just said. There is so much more to this show then what I could possible express. Parting thoughts: One of the best anime of 2015 \\n",

            "content": "You know, the circumstances surrounding Sound Euphonium are more interesting to me than the show itself. With the moe trend all but dead because \u201clight-novel fad\u201d didn\u2019t want to play nice and share - and KyoAni proving said fad had a point when their attempts to jump in on its territory whilst still maintaining a commitment to cute were about as well-received as second-degree sunburns in the middle of the North Pole - their fall from grace in terms of the public was pre-determined the moment K-On became so big. Word of advice: nothing ages faster than an anime that tries to cash in ona popular trend. Because even the really good products to come from \u2018em don\u2019t connect well with future audiences. Or at least, that\u2019s the reason I use for why I can\u2019t get into Bringing Up Baby.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s still a crowd for KyoAni\u2019s shit, and it doesn\u2019t help that the ones that actually do try to do more don\u2019t sell as well. So I guess some trends just won\u2019t die easy in the East, but the West was a different story. I\u2019m not participating in that FAL thing this season - and I never intend to play in it again for that matter - but I can suspect that some participants were frustrated at how so many of KyoAni\u2019s diehard fanbase pretty much gave up on the studio\u2019s new thing prior to airing because they saw it as their version of Sasami-san@Ganbaranai in terms of them repeating themselves. Sure, we knew Euphonium would actually have people play their instruments before we jumped into it, but the lack of focus on the topic wasn\u2019t the only reason why K-On was backlashed so hard. The fact that it wasn\u2019t funny, had dull-as-brick characters, and no f*cking story are problems that quite frankly were impossible for me to ignore, and Euphonium looked like KyoAni\u2019s revenge for all the shit we dished out at their shit, right down to hiring hack-writer Jukki Hanada again. It\u2019s a never-ending cycle of despair worthy of the Vengeance Trilogy.\\n\\n\r\nBut then it turns out that Euphonium was less revenge against the shit and more of the studio\u2019s determination to not let PA Works be the only studio to pull out a \u201cdarkest before dawn\u201d surprise hit, because now the anime is considered by critics and fans to be KyoAni\u2019s big comeback anime. It\u2019s doing well on MAL\u2019s top charts, it\u2019s pretty much the blogger favorite of the season, and considering my recent record in shows with those sorts of reputations (especially when they involve cute girls like Shirobako and Girls Und Panzer), I\u2019m sure most of you are expecting me to give it a lot of shit. Well of course I am; but in a twist that\u2019s praise-worthy of the Shyamalan meme from Robot Chicken, I think it\u2019s my favorite of these cute girl shows, let alone the popular ones. Because rather than dryly explaining the process like I\u2019m sitting through a construction company meeting despite the fact that I\u2019m an apprentice chef, or trying to cover up for your lack of substance with style like pretty much every movie Guy Ritchie has ever made, it\u2019s a sports-like show with characterization on its mind. And considering that Ping Pong is one of my favorite sports anime, I\u2019m all for that if it\u2019s executed well.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the thing though, isn\u2019t it? I mean excusing the fact that KyoAni are well-known for not focusing on developing their characters, how much can you really achieve in terms of characterization with light-hearted slice-of-life to begin with? After all, it\u2019s a genre designed by nature to have no grit in terms of goals and humor, and the notion of watching fiction in order to relax and \u201cbe friends with\u201d is completely lost on me these days. The only way you can possibly get some good substance out of it at this point is to be self-reflexive regarding the genre, and even that has its faults, as Euphonium excellently demonstrates for good and for bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound Euphonium\u2019s story starts off like practically every KyoAni show in that it\u2019s pretty much exactly as it\u2019s advertised in the summaries whilst being nothing like it\u2019s advertised in the initial PV.  On her first day of school, a young girl named Kumiko Oumae notices that her music club kind of sucks and after much prodding from her friends, joins said club with them. However, her middle-school friend (Reina) is also in the club, and due to a music-related incident in the past, she\u2019s pretty nervous around her. But Kumiko and the rest of the \u201cmostly-female for some reason\u201d band don\u2019t have time to focus on their personal problems, because the school hired Cillian Murphy as the club advisor in order to make sure that they achieve their goals of making it to the Nationals. And unlike Will Schuester (if he was channeling Negi Springfield), he\u2019s pretty ruthless underneath his \u201ckind\u201d nature and won\u2019t hesitate to stand in the band\u2019s way if they don\u2019t take things seriously. He\u2019s not exactly Coach Carter or the main teacher from Whiplash, but it\u2019s practically impossible to have a caeki~ moment around him if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how only one novel was released by the time this anime was put into production, you know what that means right? KyoAni once again expanding/changing the source material in their own ways in order to get a decent runtime out of it. I\u2019m not sure what they changed considering I never read the book, but something tells me that the yuri undertones weren\u2019t part of the original package. Yes, the very thing that finally caused the show to get out of its \u201coh KyoAni are making another anime? Whatever\u201d phase was when something I can only refer to as \u201cthat episode\u201d occurred, more than halfway in. \u201cWait then, Mr. Flawfinder? If the turning point was halfway in, then what about the stuff prior?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have my main problem with Sound Euphonium. Whilst I personally thought the episode prior to \u201cthat episode\u201d was the turning point that I wasn\u2019t sure was a turning point at first, the show nevertheless is similar to Steins;Gate in that it suffers from an entire \u201cnot very interesting\u201d first half. The parts when Cillian was put into conflict with the entire band were fine, but everything else is pretty much fluffy and kinda vague setup for what is to to come later, and said setup doesn\u2019t even pay off a good chunk of the time. Despite having four official main characters, it\u2019d be more accurate to say the show has two, and even KyoAni knew that the other two girls were the equivalent of S;G\u2019s trap and cat in terms of uselessness, given how quickly they get shunned from events after they go through their own boring personal arcs that don\u2019t even lead to anything. Hell, the third-years got more attention than them in the end.\\n\\n\r\nRightfully so too, because the parts of the story that did interest me was any of the drama focused on the third years. Why? Because being on the verge of graduation, they actually had to struggle in regards to whether their participation in getting to the Nationals was worth sacrificing school and possibly their future for, and when you combine that with Cillian\u2019s teaching methods, it makes for something I can really sink my teeth into. Since all of the main four are in their second year, this means they don\u2019t have said worries and thus don\u2019t have as much stake in the band, causing the initially huge focus on them to be kinda iffy. The main two do get a compelling reason regarding their own participation eventually, but before then, they\u2019re so tight-lipped about their true agendas that I wondered why Kumiko was the main female to begin with other than to be the female version of the typical KyoAni snarky lead who doesn\u2019t even get involved in the actually interesting personal turmoil most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor the record, like most people, my favorite character was the Vice President, Asuka. Not because of her chipper attitude, which didn\u2019t do too much for me in the beginning and has been known to annoy both the other characters and even fans of this show. I liked her because said attitude functioned as a good contrast to a darker side that does whatever it takes to avoid drama whenever possible, which works as a well-rounded complement to the fact that she\u2019s the most talented and honest member of the band. Unfortunately, what makes her the most (only?) interesting student character is also the very reason why she doesn\u2019t have much screen time, especially when the story kicks into gear. You can\u2019t have tension in your drama if someone who can cut through all the bullshit is readily available, now can you?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the drama never gets too heavy to the point of slipshodness. The finale in particular shows great restraint by not throwing in anything at the last minute and letting the character\u2019s personal journeys and what they learned from \u2018em ultimately make up the substance of the final musical climax. It even ends the story right at its highest (well, second-highest) point in order to provide a compelling conclusion that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome whilst giving a sequel hook that I\u2019m open to receiving whilst not necessarily needing it. See that, ufotable? This is how you end a well-animated personal journey. What? Waver\u2019s appearance was so important to the die-hard continuity fans that you just had to make that last episode just to show him and everyone else\u2019s non-story related roles? Well I don\u2019t give two craps, because that sort of epilogue has not and will never be compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I still think the show holds back a little too much at times. One of the central conflicts in the story is rendered completely pointless by the fact that all the problems were one-sided on their end, and both parties involved just brush it aside once said realization occurs, which makes me wonder why it went on so long in the first place. And for god\u2019s sake, why are none of the male members in the band the least bit interesting? I only remember two of them and they might as well have not existed for all the story importance they had. This especially becomes troublesome during a short love triangle interlude that I would have disliked regardless, but I would have been more forgiving if it had added anything to the story or the characters. Yes, I liked that it was brushed aside as quickly as it came. But if you\u2019re going to include it anyways, you might as well give it the same treatment you gave Asuka\u2019s limited time.\\n\\n\r\nSo whilst I can concede that Euphonium has its good points, the drama to fluff ratio isn\u2019t in its favor enough to be a great show. For starters, you\u2019d have to remove all the fluff in order to do that, and there\u2019s no way KyoAni was going to do that. Second, the drama could have been paced better. Maybe the execution of Ping Pong was too much to ask, but if you had mixed and matched the heavy stuff in the second half with the lighter conversations in the first half ala a Persona game, I wouldn\u2019t have smashed more than two guitars over the show\u2019s head. Instead, I have to sit through a bunch of middling episodes that even the majority of the fans agreed weren\u2019t all that considering the point in the series when it increased in popularity. That makes it one of the better shows of the season for sure, but considering how low a bar that\u2019s been for this Spring in particular, that\u2019s like being awarded a gold medal for getting first place in a soccer competition when all your teammates are three-year olds in broken wheelchairs. I\u2019d personally rather just give it the \u201cdecent at best\" certificate and call it a day.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I don\u2019t think Reina even interacted with Hazuki or Sapphire all that much, which makes the ending video look kind of weird.",

            "content": "This is it, their grand return. While the past number of shows they\u2019ve animated may not have quite hit the mark in terms of greatness, KyoAni has captured the magic of what made me fall in love with the studio in the first place with their newest work, Sound! Euphonium. What many brushed off as just a K-On! 2.0, Sound! Euphonium is one of the best anime that I have seen in a long time. \r\nSound! Euphonium follows the Kitauji High School Concert Band, a group that sounds fairly mediocre, and follows their journey as they grow both as musicians and as people in theirefforts to truly accomplish what they before just claimed as a pipe dream: make the nationals of the Kansai Band Competition. The story itself is fairly simplistic, but the real meat of it is focusing in on the journey that is walked to achieve their goals. The band must constantly overcome the internal conflicts that it faces as a result of being a collection of individuals, but watching them overcome these conflicts and grow as individuals as well as a group is what I believe to be a rewarding experience.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, none of that matters if we don\u2019t care about the individuals that make up the group in the first place. However, that\u2019s one of what I believe to be the two things that really shine in this show that pushes it to be amazing. These characters feel real. They\u2019re not one-dimensional drawings that the creators expect us to care about just because they\u2019re there. They feel alive. Each character has depth to them in a way that makes it so that I can\u2019t really describe them in just a few words. In particular, I think that Kumiko is probably one of the best main characters that KyoAni has put out there, putting her up there or above the heights of some of their best like Oreki or Kyon. She feels like a person that I could relate with, rather than some exaggerated caricature. She\u2019s a little distant, but still a little lively. She\u2019s a little self-conscious, but still a little confident. She\u2019s not skewed so far in any one direction that makes her seem like, well, an anime character. The supporting cast all bring some depth to the table as well, with some standouts being Reina, Natsuki, Asuka, Taki-sensei, Haruka, and Kaori. And they\u2019re not just there; they grow as well. From being distant to becoming a little more open, from being apathetic to lighting their passion, they all change, some a little, others more noticeably, and this really makes Sound! Euphonium stand out from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nThe other part of what I believe makes Sound! Euphonium stand out is the attention to detail. That goes for in the artwork, the sound, the direction, and all the little parts of the show, coming together to make this a beautiful work of art. KyoAni is known for having great animation, but this is probably the best they\u2019ve put out. Every motion feels fluid and draws me in; the scenery and lighting are beautifully drawn and lit up or dimmed; and the background music or the lack thereof only serves that enhance the atmosphere. And then the camera work. The camera work really stands out in a way that enhances every scene, from focusing onto a specific point, or lightly moving around a whole scene. Two scenes in particular, in Episode 8 and Episode 12, just really stand above the rest in how these aspects are used and come together, and to me are some of the most outstanding scenes I\u2019ve seen throughout the entirety of anime. All these little things come together to paint a work of art that really shines, and it is a beauty to behold. \\n\\n\r\nAnd not just in those areas either; as a musician myself, I really appreciated the attention focused into the musical side of things. When the band first played, you didn\u2019t have to just rely on the words of the characters to know they were bad. If you listened, you could tell they were bad. All the instruments were made with a polish and shine that made them look like real instruments, and when they were being played, they even used correct fingerings. As this is something that is usually overlooked in the majority of anime, the amount of detail that KyoAni put into the musical aspect is amazing. They also captured the essence of a high school band beautifully. While there of course were some differences as it was a club rather than a class, the amount of work that was put in, the internal drama that the band members faced, the conflicting attitudes of how hard the students want to work, and then the tension that precedes a performance and the excitement or disappointment that comes afterwards was captured in a way that really exemplified the high school band experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere are few loose ends that aren\u2019t really tied up, mostly in the romantic department, just due to the nature of it being an adaption of a different work, but I don\u2019t believe that to be any fault of the show itself, and they are easily overlooked when compared to everything else that is done great. \\n\\n\r\nMany people believe KyoAni has fallen from grace, and whether or not that is true can be debated, but shows like Sound! Euphonium prove that KyoAni is still capable of creating works of art, and illustrate why some people have come to see this studio as one of the most capable out there. I only look forward to see what the studio has in store after bringing us a masterpiece like Sound! Euphonium.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: Great characters and attention to detail come together to provide a masterful work of art.\\n",

            "content": "This will be a very long review (I dare to call it an essay!), and while it may not exactly contain spoilers, I have included 'hints' which one may wish to look out for in watching this anime.\r\nPersonally, out of all the other studios, I find myself following and noticing trends in Kyoani's releases the most. After all, while the moe wave was not (exactly) started by them, K-On contributed hugely to it, and from there, I found myself observing how Kyoani seems to have very acute marketing tendencies - they would just somehow hit the demographics right, appealing to various clusters of viewers whilestill producing what are basically decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nI was not expecting very much from Hibike! Euphonium at all. After all, its resemblances to K-On are pretty eerie, and not being a great fan of how K-On turned out, I was not anticipating much out of this either. Still, I decided that I would give it a try - such is my inclination towards music.\\n\\n\r\nIt was only after I finished watching the whole series that I discovered something that pretty much explained why I felt Hibike was so successful. Just like one of Kyoani's previous works, Hyouka, Hibike is an adaptation of a novel. In my opinion, the novel as a medium presents a view quite distinct from that of the manga and the light novel. Mangas and Light novels are by no means simple or immature, in case you misunderstand, but the target audience and marketing intention behind those two mediums as opposed to the novel is quite different. I would argue that the novel is in general less geared towards entertainment than it is towards art. As such, the novel as a medium gives the studio a better base to build their anime upon - for its style and language offers a different perspective and vision to those reading it as opposed to other forms of media.\\n\\n\r\nIn this respect, the first important feature of Hibike that sets it apart from many other anime is its focus on the music itself. I played in a Jazz Band during my high school years, so I do have some experience in the field, albeit in a different context. Either way, I found that some of the scenes portrayed in the music room were indeed real - although dramatized. Furthermore, as a musical anime, Hibike actually shows the band playing music, with both individuals and the collective struggling to 'find their sound.' Even more impressive is the level of detail in the performances; I think that for a skilled player to play badly on purpose is difficult. Yet when the band plays badly, it is obvious enough to tell who went wrong. The pieces themselves were indeed impressive - every time that trumpet solo played, I would feel myself tingle, going, \"My goodness that is indeed a beautiful solo.\" That the studio would even go so far as to get the fingerings and etc correct for each instrument is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOne indisputable thing about Kyoani is their art. They have always been famous for taking actual scenes in real life and casting them into the anime mould - and with such detail and precision! I could even recognize some Kyoto scenes from the images in the anime itself! The studio has taken realism in anime to another level in this sense. Yet I couldn't help but feel that this was the best I'd seen from Kyoani just yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is nothing very complicated. In fact, it is precisely because it is not complicated that it relays what it should be about: music, and the things that stem from people trying to get that music together. As such, certain plot developments were not entirely unexpected (meaning that some others were, of course :P). In speaking about Slice of Life anime though, I find it crucial to speak about characters in relation to the plot - for it is the characters and their reactions that drive the plot forward. Yes, the characters have the typical cute Kyoani design, but none of them are moeblobs, or 'useless,' in the broad sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the story, Kumiko, is arguably nothing very special. I didn't expect very much from her. I perceive her as sometimes being more of the sort that 'just wants things to go by smoothly,' even if she does not give such a strong vibe of that sentiment. This begins to change once she starts coming into contact with all the different personalities of the band. This is Hibike's greatest strength: for with such a diverse cast of characters, I find that they have fleshed out a large number of them very well, such that the events and drama between each one actually has effects on the others. What is more amazing is that each one of them is actually very unique in their own right; just like how we humans are in real life. We all react to situations differently, and Hibike's characters are no different. For example, I find that contrasting the attitudes of 'Ribbon girl' with Asuka-senpai would be one combination where the viewer can see two highly contrasting attitudes to a situation. For me to list out all the combinations and characters would be impossible, for that is precisely how much development and thought has gone into many of them.\\n\\n\r\nLife is a magical thing, and Hibike has shown that to be true. For only certain moments can be deemed magical in order for them to stand out and make a deep impressions upon us. While most of our lives may come across as mundane, there are times we reflect upon in great wonder, having been enchanted by the atmosphere of the moment. There are such moments in Hibike, the most prominent of these being the development of the relationship between Kumiko and the mysterious Reina. Amongst all the characters in Hibike, Reina is the one I find most enchanting, for she is so distanced from everything else. Yet when she finally gets close to Kumiko, even i was left mesmerised by her entire being - such was the beauty of that scene and moment that I replayed it many times - for it was then that the novel's art reveals itself through in the monologues of Kumiko's mind and later the exchange between the two. For there is a depth and grace surrounding Reina that is an indescribable inspiration - and that portrayal is undoubtedly the product of Kyoani's vision. Yet in the episodes thereafter, that magic did not last - exactly like what life is, for nothing that's good can last; we can only hope to continue developing it slowly and cherishing what we were honoured to have.\\n\\n\r\nHibike is however, by no means a show drowned in unreachable sentiments. There's definitely plenty, but it has many other elements in it as well that constitute the various aspects of school life. One example would be the hints and touches of vague romance within it, for I find that any anime not focused on romance yet display it are some of the sweetest that there can be - and trust me, there are plenty here. It leaves one guessing - but love comes in many forms, and it is our decision as to how we wish to perceive it. For romance to be a feature in an anime focusing on high school life is nothing surprising - but it is merely a part, even if it could be a big one. I would challenge all potential viewers to not dig too deep onto the romance portion of this anime, even if it is so tempting and inviting.\\n\\n\r\nSuch are slice of life animes. They aim at portraying the world to us viewers in a certain manner and form that is familiar to us, yet they are filled with more drama and sentiment than our lives would typically be - because that's how we are entertained. I believe that Kyoani has attained a certain peak with this anime that have not seen in a while. In all the studio's attention to detail is the creation of an anime that while simple - is art in itself. For it has been executed so well that I felt myself vicariously going through much of what the characters did. Again I cannot help but make it clear that this is nothing like K-On; here, I felt that Kyoani decided to get serious. They were fully intent on creating something great, something worthy of the lives that we live and aspire to live, even if we may not be successful in doing so. In the process, it has shown that there are no means more suitable than through the expression of music - as each note rings in this anime, be it from an individual character, or when bonds are made between groups, I find it hard to feel otherwise, for even it made me want 'to be something special.'\\n\\n\r\nFull kudos to Kyoani on what I think is their best anime so far in a while, for it is the culmination of the ideals I feel they had been looking to achieve. Through adapting a novel with an excellent foundation, Kyoani's Hibike surpassed all my expectations, and while it is not a true masterpiece, I don't know how else to rate this series.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation has relationship with the viewer that I find to often be a complicated waltz between fame and infamy. Being so renowned, the line between these two traits is very thin, and often it is easier for the studio to be criticized rather than applauded; it is a much more popular option to join in on a cynical crowd mentality rather than to accept an achievement for what it is--and I believe Hibike! Euphonium is one of Kyoto Animation's achievements, a wonderful comeback from material that pushes the studio over to the infamous side of the line.\r\nBecause of the cynicism that often surrounds theproducts of KyoAni season to season, I went into the first few episodes of the show skeptical, critical, and determined not to enjoy myself. Episode one, then on to the next, soon episode five, then episode ten, and soon I realized that my determination had failed me.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is beautiful, and while my more pessimistic side imagined this to only be true on a surface level, the depths of the series' beauty went much deeper, with a great amount of pride present and accounted for in terms of character, story and further appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, at it's base, is very simple, and not at all an original tale, but the way it is told finds a certain realism that always pleases me when I see it. \\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium encompasses the story of struggle, and of goals to set and achieved through willpower and belief in oneself, but it also happens to contain the drama that I find much more native to the high school atmosphere that is introduced within this and so many other school stories.\\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that high school girls are, in reality, emotional, catty, dramatic, and hold grudges over petty things. The fact of the matter is that school clubs do not always get along like family, the fact is that some members are more prominent than others and rarely rely on tropes to set them apart from the crowd. \\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium understands this, and shows this, displaying a sort of quiet drama blown to the proportions that find their homes in both real life and in fiction, and it is perfect. The show knows when to take the situation seriously, and when to have side characters show off what makes them cute. The two aspects are never confused, which is supremely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show does experience some blips, in that I felt the romantic side-plot jams itself into places it may not necessarily fit. There are awkward attempts to build relationships between the main character, Kumiko, and her potential love interest, as well as awkward attempts regarding that same love interest and Kumiko's friend. These bits of the show were lopsided, but hardly something to do anything with other than ignore.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I believe some of the awkwardness comes from side characters such as the love interest, Shuuichi, and others like Midori (Kumiko's friend) taking away from the round dynamics of Kumiko and her primary relationship with Kousaka Reina. Kumiko and Kousaka have such a strong, utterly, utterly strong dynamic that it's very hard to match with anything else. As a positive, I applaud the relationship built between the two, and I feel it almost unmissable if one hopes to see anime in it's highest moments of beauty, but as a negative, it gives the rest of the show competition to rise to such a level.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic, I appreciate such competition.\\n\r\nMy original thought when I began Hibike! Euphonium was that KyoAni would try to squeak by on art alone, leaving the other aspects of the show--story, sound, pride in the overall work--out to dry. I appreciate that this was not the case, and that KyoAni made in effort to turn the piece into the beautiful final product of art and story combined that I now rate so highly.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you with a similar mindset such as my own, for those of you skeptical that Hibike! Euphonium hides behind pretty colors and fanciful design, I implore you to give the show a try. I implore you to be patient with Kumiko as a disinterested, pessimistic protagonist, as one who isn't striving to be spunky or original.\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium may not be original. It may be the recycled plot of many past anime in the music genre, but as a new addition to that genre, it is definitely not a show to pass up.",

            "content": "I\u2019d like to think of music as a form of art. It\u2019s a vocal expression by taking the form of instrumental emotion. And by talent, we see the beauty of it. What does that mean for a show like Hibike Euphonium? A lot. To me, this series is a musical adventure. If you\u2019re interested in a series about following dreams, building strong friendships, and exploring youth with an unforgettable experience, then you\u2019re in the right place. \r\nWhat is Hibike! Euphonium? (Sound! Euphonium) It\u2019s an anime adaptation of a Japanese novel written by Ayano Takeda. Taking place in Kyoto, the series has its focus on agroup known as the Kitauji High School Music Club. Directed by Tatsuya Ishihara with storyboard written by Jukki Hanada, this series is an explosive youth of the coming ages. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is pretty straightforward to be quite honest. It brings a rather strange nostalgia-like feeling when just thinking about the premise. Remember those halcyon days when you first sung a song or played an instrument? That\u2019s what kind of feels like when watching this series. To start off, we have a young girl named Kumiko Oumae coming from Kita Middle School. Now fresh with a new start at her high school, what better way than to make a first impression? Well, the catch is that Kumiko is reluctant in joining the school\u2019s brass band club. Despite having some talent in playing the euphonium, the series makes it clear that she had some sort of negative experience in the past with another member of the club. That would be Reina Kosaka. However, fate has it that she join the club anyway and the instrument she ends up with is none other than the euphonium. \\n\\n\r\nWith its direction of the first few episodes, one must be wondering what sort of relationship Kumiko used to have with Kousaka. Before that though, we also meet her other friends including her classmates Kazuki and Sapphire. A series like this will leave a first impression that music is not just the main focus. No, it\u2019s about also establishing a forte and build relationships to survive their spots. This is because the club\u2019s advisor, Taki-sensei has a goal in mind. He wants the club to go on and compete in the Nationals. Small group and big dreams. The series brings up a lot of questions for the first half. Many of them aims at the main characters\u2019 potentials and what their dreams are. Not to mention, we also don\u2019t know much about most of their past. This is why it take some patience to get through the show. Admittingly, there are some pacing issues and parts that are omitted from the novel. However, the series does its job to capture the vocal expression of the characters. Some of them are confident to make the game while others have doubts. For Kumiko, I\u2019d say that she\u2019s somewhere in between. In regards with the other characters, it\u2019s quite diverse. Characters like Hazuki and Asuka are surely confident in themselves while Sapphire has a more timid nature. Then, there\u2019s Reina, a character I\u2019d describe as a lone wolf, the ice queen, and in general someone that is not easy to make friends with. She\u2019s not unfriendly though but just someone who is very dedicated in pursuing her goals. Her past shows that she has some emotional problems with Kumiko and thus is a reason why the two have somewhat of a mixed relationship in the present storyline. Or is it?\\n\\n\r\nA good part of this series also makes time to craft their moments together. Every episode shows a bit of their chemistry whether it\u2019s direct or indirect. Some of the moments may be short but are meaningful, especially for Kumiko. One of the later episodes really take this forward to another level in both friendship and perhaps a bit even subtle yuri by their body language. And that\u2019s another thing I find interesting about the series. Music on the surface is an expression but the characters themselves too show genuine human emotions with body language. Every concrete detail has some sort of meaning to reflect the actions of our characters. Even when it\u2019s hard to notice, it depicts part of their personality. This is important as relationships in the series are forged by their experiences. Each episode shows us more about the main characters. Each episode wants us to learn even more. Each episode gets to show us why they are there. And by the end of the day, it can win the audience with all these ideas mixed in its story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, competition is also there. Rivalries are established especially for something as big as the Nationals. If you\u2019ve ever been involved in some sort of contest, your goal is to win right? Unfortunately, the series puts less emphasis on actual rivalries but more on the characters\u2019 development themselves. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a drawback though especially since it gives on insight on characters\u2019 behaviors. Characters who quit or doubt themselves brings a saddening emotion into the show. Likewise, there are also others who truly wishes to inspire and bring a light of hope. Regardless, Hibike Euphonium also likes to play a lot with its character cast and their roles. A main course of this series involves their development with one another as well as their individual progress. Even romance is part of the series although much of it is subtle and thus not a central element. To enjoy a series like this, it\u2019s important to realize why the characters are there and what they do in the story. It can even be supplemented by the charming comedy especially with the clever usage of its dialogues. Indeed, this series can feel snarky at times but accomplishes with humor in a sort of cheeky delight.\\n\\n\r\nHow do I describe the feeling of the artwork? Imagine a color blind person seeing color for the very first time. That\u2019s pretty much a gist of it. Kyoto Animation not only takes the character designs to a whole new level but also with its stellar visual quality. Beauty is expressed by the colorful backgrounds and rich resources. There\u2019s also a great amount of focus on character expressions. Like I mentioned before, this series expresses music with ensemble through human emotions. In essence, the artwork adapts that to precision and understands how to portray them each episode. This is also enhanced by the noticeable body gestures where characters can at times express their actions without dialogues. There\u2019s probably a lot more words to describe the overall tone of the artwork but this series knows what the audience wants and lives up to the hype of what the studio stands for.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack and music, the series is well aware of what it needs to do. Music after all, is a centerpiece of this series. Without it, it would be like a grey little world without color. But with its colorful music, the series enlighten itself to its highest degree thanks to its instrumental music. There\u2019s all types of sound you\u2019ll hear from this show ranging from those played from the tuba, contrabass, trumpet, and of course euphonium. Now, I\u2019m not a big expert on music but the show achieves its purpose to deliver what the audience needs to hear. The OP and ED theme songs are also decorative with an uninformative style on par with its musical merit. In addition, the show does a decent job to weed out the strongest and weakest links through music talents. Finally, voice mannerisms are tolerable especially for our main cast. Each of them shows a different personality that is quite diverse and matching thanks to their voice. From Sapphire\u2019s timid voice tone to Reina\u2019s cool yet confident style, it\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to miss.\\n\\n\r\nHibike Euphonium takes the idea of music and brings in a story with charm, emotion, inspiration, and youthful appeal. In a musical genre where there\u2019s emotions, you\u2019d have to believe what the characters are doing. Thanks to its execution, the show accomplishes that in a variety of ways. From the experiences and relationships that our characters forges, its shows that Hibike Euphonium is more than just about producing music. This series is a lot easier to understand though once you appreciate what it\u2019s trying to do. It\u2019s a combination of feeling easy, familiar, and also a bit of fun. And it also shows that talents aren\u2019t born but earned. After all, there\u2019s no such thing as free lunch.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation's success with K-On gave a new face to the genre of music anime\u2014a face that focused on the activities of cute girls in a group, and to a lesser extent, their relationships. Hibike Euphonium is more or less the same formula, but on a much larger scale; a school band of boys and girls alike. Said school band is aiming for a mere shot at the nationals with the help of an instructor much stricter than they'd prefer. It's by no means an original concept, but it would be acceptable if it showcased the trials a band faces in an admirable fashion; instead,Hibike is more concerned about weak shoujo ai coupled with the insecurities of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nKumiko and her friends are the main source of those insecurities, and they're not much more than what you'd expect from a teenage group of anime characters: na\u00efve, overstating, and worried about love. Little can be said about unique characteristics or personalities, since aside from a few cute quirks (like a character naming her tuba 'Tubacabra'), there are next to none. To balance this weakness out, the show introduces the collected and beautiful bandmate Reina, whose mutual admiration with Kumiko tends to go a little overboard. There's a load of flirting between the two without any romantic development, which leads me to believe the relationship is only there to give a reason to the protagonist's unnatural success; the two are driven by a non-existent love for each other, and it is not convincing in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThat wasted screentime could have been better used on the development of the school band, who the viewer only gets to know about a quarter of. Because of that lack of focus, there is no unifying element of teamwork to the storyline\u2014you are merely watching a few people surrounded by background characters whenever they play. Their instructor, Taki, is often pointing out musical flaws or weaknesses in certain sections of the band, but the lack of familiarity with the members makes their struggle to improve near meaningless. Unless you're driven by any personal nostalgia, it is seemingly impossible to empathize with anyone. It really makes the end goal to reach the nationals both predictable and uninteresting, as well as boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Hibike Euphonium is great. Crisp, fluid, and full of detail, it's something that can only be expected of the notorious studio behind it. The art itself isn't as impressive, but acceptable; everything looks as if it's been bathed in layers upon layers of oil, even excessive by the standards of teenage hygiene. Regardless, watching each instrument as it's being played is always a real treat. \\n\\n\r\nHearing them is pretty nice, too. It's likely the only real indicator of progress in the series, as they go from sounding like your average school band to something deserving of recognition pretty quickly. In fact, it's a little too abrupt of an improvement. Later performances begin to sound too professional for their age level, and as beautiful as it is, it's immersion-breaking. For better or for worse, you can tell that the soundtrack was performed by a group that makes its anime counterpart pale in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nClumsiness aside, Hibike manages to fit into the formula its predecessors put in place, albeit quite half-heartedly. The fundamentals are all there, but the soul is missing. It's drab, often slow, and questionable in focus, but it is what it is. If you're looking for something light and simplistic, go nuts. Just don't expect much in the drama department, OK?",

            "content": "There are three main types of \"specific interest\" story. When author knows and wants to submerge its viewer (or reader) into the world of interest; when author finds something unusual and shiny, googles about it and decides to make a story about it; and something inbetween.\r\nWhat you have here - is the story inbetween. Author knows about it, but puts it as unusual and shiny.\r\nIt is called \"Hibike! Euphonium\", and it is about big beautiful brass that shines, but does not breathe.\r\nMost of plots in modern anime about music tend to look like this: protagonist making or taking part in a band or orchestra, grindingits skill and becoming popular and famous in the end. This plot was used so many times that not it is not very interesting to follow it.\\n\r\nSo, as a multi-instrumentalist with a strong knack for musical instruments, before watching, I made a supposition: maybe these series will show us characters actually playing musical instruments? Maybe it will tell us about secrets and mysteries behind brass techniques? Or - in the most extreme case - would it turn me into a brass fan and persuade me to buy a trumpet, as I wanted several years ago? Let's wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, with shiny brass and glossy art in preview arts and videos, my first impression was positive enough. Even though the studio making this show would be Kyoto Animation, infamous in latest years for its beautiful bug-eyed art and lack of plot and character development.\\n\r\nFor example, the notorious K-On lacked any skill development, jumping from zero to hero in an instant for no particular reason.\\n\r\nIf you play a musical instrument, you should have known that learning to play any instrument, from recorder to tabla drums, takes a lot of time and work. Obviously, non-musician viewers would not be insterested in daily routine with blistered fingers, aching back or dry mouth, but a proper amount of these scenes would make you believe characters on screen are trying their best to do music. I did not believe K-On. Should I believe Hibike? Let's hope.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the actual reason: I decided to give this anime a try for having a character playing double bass. Why? Because this instrument is very uncommon in girl-cast shows.\\n\r\nLots of different characters in different anime series are playing violin; again, mostly they are girls, and violin is supposed to underline their femininity, giving them a very artistic and porcelain-ish aura. \\n\r\nBut suddenly here comes a tiny curly-haired moe-girl carrying a stringed coffin larger in size than her. No way it could be feminine: trust me, double bass is really that large and cumbersome, but - surprisingly - not so heavy and loud, being a low-pitched instrument. Would a moe-girl make it roar and slap? Let's watch.\\n\\n\r\nHere it goes. Beautiful art, girls in uniforms, everything is polished and nice. Girls, be ambitious...?\\n\r\nNope. Girls, be boring, dull and slow-paced.\\n\r\nThis is not the show about music. Music is not needed here. This is a show about problems.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be called \"Naku! Ennuiphonium\".\\n\\n\r\nEven K-On made a good and happy, yet poseurish, mood, and here we just watch characters playing in band with sad faces on.\\n\r\nAgain: I like happy and cheerful people and characters. They charge you with a will to live. With female protagonist being boring, slow-paced and not pursuing her unfinished dream (which every young musician has) with burning eyes, I can not empathize her. Yes, she had a loss in past, though would it be a shounen-oriented series, she would think something like: \"I lost? Who cares. I'll just grind more\". She prefers to dig deeper into her thoughts, without even thinking about how she could overcome her sadness.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem of this show lies not only in un-empathetic protagonist, but in wrong deepness balance of the whole show. Instead of dripping us, viewers, into the world of music, it drips us into relationship problems of female protagonist being afraid to speak with her childhood friend, who grew into an aloof-dark-emotionless-long-haired type (I personally hate such characters, but that's not the question). \\n\r\nWith all this drama bubblegum (as well as biseinen teacher not stopping to smile), Hibike looks more like a shoujo show with cheap plotline, but great art instead. Only Asuka (who looks like Mita from Hatsu Inu, by the way) tries to be the main genki and fanservice source of the show, making me change my opinion about Hibike being a pure shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, let's stop a little bit on Asuka, until we started to rant about everything else. It is the only character of the show with no purpose other than being better than others.\\n\r\nShe pushes female protagonist to the plot, makes her progress more and more, and does not actually care about sad things happening around her. Looks very similar to Kamina from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, but if Kamina was a charismatic character with a big dream and looked realistic and vivid in his setting, Asuka looks and acts like she came from nowhere to do everything better than others. Got what I mean?\\n\r\nYes. Asuka is a Mary Sue.\\n\r\nAnd being a Mary Sue is not a good way to push the plot. Because you're not a character, but more like a random person on stage caught improvising.\\n\\n\r\nWhere was I?... Another bad thing is that plot jumps from one place to another too much. With unneeded amounts of drama atop it reminds me of Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai, with the only difference Hibike being realistic enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem lies in over-dramatisation and depressive atmosphere suited only for 15-year-old girls experiencing coming-of-age period, because it is the time when you try to cope with your seeings of the future. In short, the characters are constantly sad.\\n\r\nAnd the sadness keeps going and going! Compared, for example, to Hanayamata, nobody ever tries to turn the sad situation on screen into aspiring, funny or just interesting. Each episode looks not at all like a show about dreams and future, instead looking more like a footage from some dark arts circle. Dress all characters in black, make it rain outside, and the atmosphere would be ideal for the show. \\n\r\nSeriously: the lack of any happiness in characters' onscreen life makes you believe that it's a show about a funeral band.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, you could take musical instruments out of the show and replace concert band with some other props to make the plot flow. Replace the setting with an artist academy, shooting range or tube-rolling mill, nothing would change drastically: a bit of inner works, and no actual gravitation of these works. They just exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are portrayed as realistic. But are they? \\n\r\nActually, they were balanced enough for a boring setting at the first six episodes of these series. Not counting female protagonist and her turned-aloof friend, we also have Hazuki, who I found really funny to watch, and again, typical quiet moegirl Sapphire with a large double bass. The problem is she did not play any bass soloes, and is also rarely shown in orchestra, with main frames being occupied with big beautiful brass. This does not make me happy as a contrabassist (self-taught, not the best on, but still learning!). The only moment of her starring was in a trio with Hazuki and female protagonist. And this is not enough for a main character with a double bass.\\n\\n\r\nThe most \"realistic\" part of these series is that characters always shed tears for other characters. Without even thinking about how exactly they could make a profit for themselves, I say. This, being Japanese enough trait, takes all characters down.\\n\r\nI do not propagate egocentrism, but if you want to live the life, you'll need to think about yourself first, not about your senpai. Just remember: if you give your clothes to everyone, you'll leave yourself naked and probably die of pneumonia.\\n\r\nAny lack of self-esteem in characters makes them unsympathetic and uncatchy, turning them into grey goo of depression. And the show without individual characters is not an interesting one.\\n\\n\r\nOne more question to discuss is the yuri part of the show. As some people already noted, this part was really unneeded in the plot. With Reina acting les-yay for Kumiko, I can only suppose it was just a move to attract more audience. Of course, they are in an absolute need for a mutual kiss, ain't they?\\n\r\nIf I am right, the original novel did not have such shameless fetish expositions to attract more audience, because female protagonist already had a potential partner.\\n\r\nAnd the show has no need in this yuri fanservice. The show needs yuri like a goat needs an accordion (or a fish needs an umbrella, or a dog needs a fifth leg, as we say in Russia).\\n\\n\r\nI had hopes on the series. Yet still, after the first 6 episodes, drama bubblegum goes on, female protagonist is still acting boring and unempathetic, and even cheerful Hazuki and Sapphire are turning into snot-chewing scenery, making these series even more uninteresting and boring.\\n\r\nThe problem can be described as such: every important character in this show (even the optimistic ones) survives such an unempathetic and dull background you just don't have any wish to feel with them. \\n\r\nAll problems with unsaid words, insincerity and fake feelings could be easily solved, but - apparently, the strong and noble people of Japan (with all their strength and nobility still raped by Soviet Union and USA) are not allowed to express feelings as they wish.\\n\\n\r\nAforementioned over-dramatization of events in these series makes you want to turn it off and think your life is much happier, even if you are a bankrupt disabled widow. This does not even look like a character development, it's a character degradation, a thin reason to turn characters, potentially capable of living, into fools walking through the forest and searching someone more stupid than them. (It was a reference.)\\n\\n\r\nStrange enough, with Buddhism being popular in Japan, to see every character in this show in sad mood, dramatized situations, uncomfortable around each other. Each and everyone of them does not even try to become a Bodhisattva and to forget any perishable bad luck of this world. \\n\r\nGirls, stop this. At the moment someone suffers more than you, stop crying over brass.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention goes to Reina. As I said before, I greatly dislike \"aloof&emotionless\" type of characters. They always look like they try to act grown-up, forgetting that not the actions are measure of growing up, but experience is. Reina's case is similar: she even states she tries to be special, that's why she wants to play trumpet better.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to be special by playing trumpet better?\\n\r\nReina, playing trumpet does not make you special. Even a street cleaner can learn to play trumpet, if he wants to. And becoming the best is the dream of all shounen main characters.\\n\r\nIf you want to deal with a trumpet, you need to play it in a special way. In a way nobody ever played it. No matter what, just do something unusual.\\n\r\nPlay djent on trumpet.\\n\\n\r\n(All right, jokes aside: check out Pierre Bastien. That's what \"special trumpet\" means.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd later this striving for being special became contagious. This is it, the unfinished dream to make your eyes burn...\\n\r\nNot. This part of plot is so far-fetched and hastily-made you don't have enough time to live with it, to believe it and, of course, to empathize with such aspiration. If KyoAni pushed it i the beginning of series, you could believe it more, though the show would really play itself like a badly-written shounen story.\\n\\n\r\nThe only part of the show that I watched without taking my eyes away was the ending song. The ending was suspenseful and overall gorgeous. Such a shame that for such an ending the anime would suffer such a depressive mood without any chance of happiness in the characters' eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn this quality, we have:\\n\r\nStory: 5/10 (for being not very original, but okay)\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (again, instruments are really beautiful)\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 (nothing special, but let it be 6/10, it's a show about boredo... err, music)\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10 (unempathetic ones are overbalancing empathetic ones)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 (so depressive and boring, you could go mad).\\n\\n\r\nLet's set overall score of 5/10. I really wished it could be better, but with the series being such a mood-dropper it could not.\\n\\n\r\nThat does not mean Hibike is bad. It is believable in some way, it is beautifully drawn, but it is overly dramatized, plays itself in a very unhappy and unwilling mood and, worst of all, does not have a hook. A quirky idea to be interesting enough to watch.\\n\r\nOf course, there is a potential to watch it. But not to breathe it.\\n\\n\r\nCry, ennuiphonium. Until the last episode.",

            "content": "EDIT: Now that the series has finished, here are my thoughts of the series.\r\nI am sick and tired of seeing people saying that this is just another show like \"K-ON!\". Because it's KyoAni, people will think that this show is less on music and more on moe blobs.\r\nSeriously? It isn't.\r\nThe story is really simple and I like it because it stays that way. It doesn't go overboard and it doesn't even complicate stuff. The story is about a struggle of one band trying to get in the Nationals and take home the gold. And guess what? They portray the story realistically. It portrays so muchreal life problems of a band and KyoAni really pulled it off so well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I am not a band geek nor have I joined a band but probably, those things happen.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're asking if there is some romance on this anime well, just a bit. There's one episode where it's pure romance but then they get back to music on the later episodes. This anime is heavy on Slice of Life, Drama and Music. Not Romance.\\n\\n\r\nYes, this anime does have some moe stuff on it but trust me, it's more than the moe stuff they show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of this season was also well executed. That's how you end a season.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw of the series is the part on who is going to play the solo for the trumpet. Now, actually it was good at first but the execution was bad and corny.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, it's colorful and amazing. Everything on this anime has details. Well, not as detailed as Zankyou no Terror but for a music anime and placing a lot of moe blob, it doesn't really need to go overboard and it works already. The fluidity of the animation when they play the instruments was really good and KyoAni did a great job on that one.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, maybe I'll just give it a 9/10. I am not onto trumpets and stuff but, I really like the music. The opening theme is also really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, they portray it so well. The conflicts of each character are portrayed realistically.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Kumiko. She's just a normal character. Now, this isn't a character where she's so passionate about music. No, this character is different. She doesn't have a lot of passion in music (Anymore... Maybe) and yet, she ends up joining the band but why is that?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's probably because of Kumiko's experience when she was on a band in middle-school. The anime portrays a lot of flashbacks about Kumiko's experience such as not getting into the Nationals, her getting in the audition but her rival failed, etc. These emotional flashbacks affected Kumiko but why is she joining the band? Well, this is my opinion but something is telling me that she isn't ready to let go with the band. Deep inside that if she lets go, she doesn't know what to do anymore. She doesn't even like playing the Euphonium but she ends up playing with it because that's her signature instrument and that's where she is good at.\\n\\n\r\nAnother main character is Reina who really strives getting into the Nationals and take home the Gold. Unlike Kumiko, she has a passion on the band and she has a passion on playing the trumpet like her Dad. She takes the band very seriously and she doesn't take the band just to have fun. She really tries hard to get into the Nationals.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still more characters on this anime who portrayed a life of a band in High-school really well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why are you not enjoying the show? It's either you cannot relate to it or you're looking for something deeper on other than this. I can't even relate to bands and yet, this anime tries their best to let me understand on what a life of a band in High-school is about.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one underrated anime of Spring 2015 and I think it deserves more attention. Especially for people who hated K-ON! thinks this show will be bad and I think they're wrong. I haven't watch K-ON! but, I think this isn't another K-ON!. I've seen other reviews about K-ON! and it's flaws are not found here on Hibike! Euphonium. This isn't another show where they focus heavily on Comedy and focuses a lot on MOE BLOBS. Unlike K-ON!, this show portrays the struggle of a band really well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love the first 2 episodes, watch further. However, if you were bored to death on the first 2 episodes, it's best if you drop the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe director of this show is Ishihara Tatsuya - the one who directed The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. He has shown his potential on how great he is in directing.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, there'll be a second season of this show. This time, how they will become No. 1 in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9.4/10 - FINAL SCORE",

            "content": "As a person who has had his fair share of pointless Moe blob shows I admit that my initial impression of Sound! Euphonium wasn't the best. In all honesty, The moment I saw the cover of the show I dismissed it as another Moe blob show and skipped it without much thought, and It was only through high ratings and numerous recommendations that I decided I would give it a chance. But even then I wasn't convinced. I went into the first episode with a face of disdain. Only to watch further and further until I realized how terribly wrong I was. Sound! Euphonium gaveme a slap in the face and made me realize how shallow I have become. I shall never judge a book by it's cover again.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Oumae Kumiko, a former Euphonium player who looks to change her life as a High School Freshman. Ironically although she wants to avoid the High School Brass Band she gets pulled into joining along with her two new friends, and there she accidentally meets her former bandmate Kousaka Reina. A girl she accidentally insulted in junior high.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty simple and isn't very original.If that's the case then what exactly is so good about this show? One of the reasons is because of Euphonium's representation of youth. Sure Euphonium is a show about music. The show is centered around music. But even more than that Euphonium is a show about hardships, ambition, frustration, friendships,life. Euphonium is just so much more than an anime about music.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the music is overlooked or anything. On the contrary the music in Euphonium is absolutely spectacular. The band pieces that the club plays sounds exactly like an actual brass band. When I say that I am not only talking about the good pieces but also the bad pieces in the beginning of the show. The band sounds very much like an actual High School Band and I definitely appreciate that.The soundtrack apart from the actual music pieces are also quite varied and all fit the mood quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show created by KyoAni you would normally expect the usual eyegasm inducing animation that the studio has become commonly known for. Well let me tell you Euphonium takes Kyoani's standards and puts it on a whole new level.I am not kidding at all.The amount of detail from the fingerings of the instruments,character expressions,backgrounds,etc are just amazing. There is also a hint of realism in the animation that fits the show just perfectly. I really couldn't do the animation justice explaining it here. You just have to go see yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to see that Euphonium has a nice story, stunning animation, and beautiful sound. But that would all go to waste if the characters weren't good. Well fear not, for Euphonium's strongest aspect comes from it's characters. \\n\\n\r\nYou have Oumae Kumiko, A High school freshman who doesn't seem to have any special goals in her life, and wants to have a fresh start at her new school.  At face value Kumiko doesn't seem very interesting, but dig a little deeper and you realize that there is so much more to Kumiko than your average female lead. Probably the most enjoyable part of her is watching her change along with her interactions with the other people in the band. Seeing her grow over the course of the show from an indecisive person who doesn't really know what to do with her life to a person who hungers to get better with her Euphonium is truly a rewarding experience.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand you have Kousaka Reina. A cold and seemingly distant trumpet player. Reina to me is a person that puzzles me constantly because it is often very hard to see what she's thinking. On the outside she has this cold demeanor but through her various interactions with Kumiko you realize that there is so much more to Reina than what you see on the surface. \\n\\n\r\nMost people who has ever been in a school band can probably attest to this when I say that usually not everyone is on the same page. What I mean by this is that not everyone has the same goal in mind. Some people are in the school Band to just have fun playing their instrument while there are others who take music more seriously and want to start a career out of it. Some people are naturally better at others while there are others who drag the whole band down. It's not as simple as just putting up a goal and working towards it. Everyone has their own opinions and their own ideals. Sound! Euphonium knows this and represents this perfectly. The side characters are not just there to become background characters with little relevance, but each of them have their own personalities, their own opinions, their own motives. Probably one of the greatest examples of this would be Tanaka Asuka. An eccentric but extremely talented Euphonium player who is liked by most people. Her energetic personality and humorous demeanor makes her a very fun person to watch, but as I watched deeper and deeper I realized that there was much more to Asuka than meets the eye. Honestly speaking Asuka couldn't care less about the emotional drama that happens in the club. Asuka is always neutral. She never picks sides and always distances herself away from the drama that goes into the club. Asuka doesn't have any emotional investment whatsoever with the members. This can probably be seen best in a scene where Kumiko asks her who she thinks should be the solo, and Asuka answers frankly that she doesn't care. It's these types of differing attitudes that make the club seem like an actual school band, and not one that is conveniently made for anime. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly speaking one of the reasons why I have become so attached to this show is because of the chemistry between Kumiko and Reina. At the start of the show part of the reason Kumiko didn't want to continue the Euphonium was partly because of Reina. In the beginning of the show Kumiko seems to have a really hard time understanding why other people can play with such dedication, and this is evident when Kumiko asks if Reina thought that they would actually make it to the nationals in Junior High. If anything Kumiko just seems to want fun with playing the Euphonium. She doesn't want to be so devoted playing an instrument at the beginning. Through the course of the show though Kumiko ends up finding the motivation to play from none other than Reina herself. Although they seem to be completely different from each other. They are similar in the fact that they both isolate others from getting too close to them. Reina realizes later on that Kumiko is isolated like herself and wants to become close with her, because she thinks that Kumiko might be able to understand her motivations for wanting to stand out from the others. This is what becomes the motivation for Kumiko to take playing the Euphonium seriously. After learning more about Reina's ambitions. Kumiko wants to become special to. She doesn't want to be left behind by Reina. This intimate relationship between the two characters is just absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the show is completely devoid of any problems though. Kumiko and Reina's chemistry end up taking up too much of the spotlight which ends up making the other potential romance completely fizzle out and become something that completely gets shadowed over.This is a very minor problem but its still worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Sound! Euphonium was surprising to me would be an understatement. It completely blew away my expectations and then some. If there was anyone who was in a similar situation like me and decided to skip this show I urge you to give this show a chance. You might be surprised to see what you find.",

            "content": "Watching a Kyoto Animation anime is like being served up a delicious cake. It\u2019s the same cake every time but you know what to expect. There\u2019s icing on top, being the pretty visuals and animation, but usually plays it safe with a \u2018vanilla\u2019 group of characters. It\u2019s easy to digest. Hibike! Euphonium however wants to be different. Not only does it comes with sprinkles of substance but it has layers to it, different flavours working in harmony. They aren\u2019t the most incredible flavours you\u2019ve ever tasted but they are still enough to put a smile on your dial. This high school, musical showpiece took meby surprise with its fun blend of band politics and self-improvement. While it hit the odd sour note in the dialogue and story department, this sill became an easily recommendable music feast.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the story of Kumiko Oumae in her first year at Kitauji High School. A long-time player of the euphonium, she finds herself looking for a fresh start in the concert band. She makes friends with Hazuki Katou and Sapphire \u2018Midori\u2019 Kawashima along the way and the group look to breathe life back into the band. Former band dramas come to the fore however when Kumiko\u2019s former junior high bandmate Reina Kousaka enters the frame \u2013 the two not leaving on the happiest note last time they saw each other. With an unmotivated and underperforming band to work with, things are shaping up to be tough for the new members. \\n\\n\r\nEuphonium is definitely one of those shows that needs to be approached with the right mindset. If you watch this expecting music to be at the forefront 24/7 then you may end up disappointed. The music is instead a vehicle for exploring the motivations of the different band members. While that may sound a little too deep for a show about cute girls playing instruments, you\u2019d be surprised. Those with concert band experience and music students will take a lot away from the drama behind the curtains. That said, you can still take a lot away from the show without such involvement.\\n\\n\r\nThe show loves diving into a lot of the little intricacies that go into learning an instrument and learning to play as a group. People get singled out at practice and people have to make sacrifices. Such is life when you want to reach new heights. This isn\u2019t some happy-go-lucky musical field trip. Some students contemplate their future and how band could impact it while others think about their impact on the band\u2019s morale and ability. You can bet relationships get strained over it. The drama is rarely overbearing and makes sense given the current situation of the band. I always was interested to see how disagreements could be resolved, in the musical and the personal department.\\n\\n\r\nI was a little turned off by some of the over-dramatic dialogue. You can find most of these examples when the cast talk to each about wanting to reach another level in their playing. None of these conversations feel natural at all. They sound like they should be standing on a podium with a microphone in front of them. It\u2019s a common complaint I could make about a lot of anime conversations though. It\u2019s nothing new and it\u2019s very easy to overlook. \\n\r\nThe romance elements also feel a little shoehorned at times. Love has its own part to play but it\u2019s at its best when it\u2019s being subtle. Some moments simply aren\u2019t, and whenever they come around I\u2019d think to myself \u2018I wish they\u2019d just get back to the music already\u2019. To delve any deeper into this goes into spoiler territory so it\u2019s one of those areas you have to judge for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOne of Kumiko\u2019s most interesting points as a character is watching her reasons to play changing. Different events make her want to back away from it all while others spur her on. While maybe having the least distinct personality of the lead quintet Kumiko is never dull. I wasn\u2019t too interested in her over the opening half of the show but as things change, and she\u2019s forced to become more proactive, her story is more engaging. She isn\u2019t the most memorable main character ever made but she\u2019s one you want to see succeed as the episodes roll by.\\n\\n\r\nReina is an enigma. She\u2019s easily the most interesting person in the show with that combination of her brooding nature and a desire to be at the top. You can never be sure what she\u2019s thinking. Reina is focused, driven and shut off from the more upbeat personalities she\u2019s surrounded by. I liked how alien Reina behaves in that area. She\u2019s the necessary cool head in a sea of more emotional classmates, but of course she has her own flaws. Her relationship with Kumiko is assessed on a few occasions, they being some of the series\u2019 turning points. At times she steals the show and feels more like the main character.\\n\\n\r\nHazuki bounces up and down in relevance. She has her moments but feels swept under the rug beyond a certain point in the show. Her energy is infectious and she could have been used a little more often. Then there\u2019s Midori who could have been invisible the whole time and it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. It\u2019s a pity because there\u2019s something about a tiny contrabass player that\u2019s amusing. I needed more of that.\\n\\n\r\nI love that most of the characters have some value to them, even those on the sidelines. It\u2019s rewarding as viewer to see side characters develop and watch them constantly interacting with our main players. In a show with a large group together like Hibike! Euphonium it helps the concert band feel dynamic. Whether it be the quiet club president Haruka Ogasawara or her polar opposite vice president Asuka Tanaka, they\u2019re all fun to watch. It could have been easy to let this show play out just focusing on one or two characters, but I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a show built on deep characters. It\u2019s a show built on different personalities clashing against one another. I personally found that a good experience, one that matched KyoAni\u2019s setting and design well. You could have taken a more serious route through a different studio, and that could have been fine, but I like what\u2019s been put to screen here.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals & Sound\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of setting and design, there are some mesmerising scenes in this show. There are even scenes that made me say \u2018wow\u2019 simply based on its animation quality. Background art is lovely and the instruments look and sound wonderful. KyoAni don\u2019t shy away from animating finger movements at regular intervals, showing off both their handy staff and their budget. That\u2019s an area most like to avoid when it comes to animating musical performances. \\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re also at the top of their game when it comes to animating minor facial expressions and details. It\u2019s the little things that can make a show engaging. There\u2019s twitches, shrugs and other movements studios often decide to leave out of the process. These keep coming at you every episode in Euphonium. Kumiko and Asuka are big winners in this area. It\u2019s also nice to see KyoAni break away ever so slightly from their regular, predictable character designs. Eye design and colouring are the big points there. They\u2019re almost hypnotic. They\u2019ve made some adjustments from the source material that really help bring some spark to certain characters, fusing their own style with the novel perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a show based on music so the sound better be on point. Thankfully it is. There\u2019s a selection of great group pieces and some amazing solo efforts. Overall it\u2019s a great audio package. I don\u2019t normally make space to discuss OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s either but both deserve a round of applause. Both upbeat blaring brass numbers \u201cDream Solister\u201d and \u201cTutti\u201d capture the energy and tone of the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nWhen you strip back all of the gorgeous KyoAni visuals there is still plenty to be found in both the story and characters department. All the conflict makes sense and people have to make tough decisions. In the face of that, Euphonium rarely becomes too serious for its own good. There are times when it does jump that shark however, particularly in the dialogue department. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is at its strongest when the focus is on band politics. The balance between music and romance thankfully favours the music side of things, with the latter\u2019s handling a little clunky. In spite of that, Hibike! Euphonium remains one of the most interesting shows and surprising success stories from the spring 2015 season.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7/10 (Good)",

            "content": "I really don\u2019t know about this series. I know for sure that it WAS NOT good, but I don\u2019t really know what to think about it and what exactly I liked and disliked about the series. I know that it looked really pretty and there were some beautiful moments, but many of these key scenes didn\u2019t have a purpose that was fulfilled by how they looked. Its as if the show wanted to look nice just to look nice and the images didn\u2019t enhance the plot as much as they should have. \r\nSpeaking of the plot, it was mostly hit or miss with both thefirst and second halves feeling weak in their own ways. The first half had some enjoyable parts but the main cast didn\u2019t really mesh together in any real or believable way, and most characters didn\u2019t have anything to really like about them. Many were bland and didn\u2019t have much purpose aside from either being an obstacle or fulfilling an aside that fed into the main conflict. Kumiko was likable to an extent and received the most development, and I can really appreciate that she isn\u2019t put into a certain mold and feels conflicting and layered enough that she feels the most real, but she was a character that would have been better served in a better plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was, personally, the weakest part of the series in part to how inconsequential it felt at times, and how many of the surrounding elements did not service it in a meaningful way. What I mean by this is that many of the asides that the series which served to either flesh out the world, provide character development, or explain the situation in a practical way, didn\u2019t seem to have much impact because the time spent developing these scenes did not, in turn, provide a similarly large effect on the world. Often the understandings of other characters to what is happening or the status quo does not change and it feels like most of these moments could have easily been tossed aside and it almost seems like they were. That is not to say that certain scenes such as Kumiko and Rikka on the mountain aren\u2019t memorable, but that it instead feels like it came out of nowhere and disappeared without any real impact on what is going on. You could call it subtlety and say that development on these characters is meant to be subdued and realistic, but even in that case it doesn\u2019t work because we do not spend enough time getting to know these people to really know how their feeling. Other than Kumiko who, admittedly, did believably change over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAside from this, the series feels the need to shove all development down our throat with useless narration which often repeats to us things we could understand just by watching what is happening, and most of the time comes off as redundant and unnecessary which ultimately takes you out of the experience. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the plot showed promise, particularly at the beginning where the destination and the obstacles were made clear and the possibilities of truly coming together while working towards something meaningful as a group seemed like what the series was aiming for, while emphasizing the attempted repair of an awkward friendship. The problem, I think, is that the series was too short. I faulted the series\u2019 inconsequential asides but I believe if this same story was told over more episodes and we really got to know more members of the band then while seeing them all interact would have given the story more impact as we see how the events of the story matter to them and better understand what makes them who they are. Instead nothing feels like it really matters because as certain elements are introduced, they often don\u2019t have a worthwhile conclusion or don\u2019t add anything to the story. They may tell you more but not enough that you know why it matters. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses certain events only add unnecessary drama or hold the overall plot back either because the whole story also has the misfortune of being largely predictable, and because they do not add any further tension when the stakes were clearly established and characters act in a way that defy what is best for everyone and holds everyone back. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, and this is much more personal, I did not enjoy Kumiko and Rikka\u2019s relationship. To be clear, most of the characters lacked meaningful relationships, but I did not see a reason to enjoy their\u2019s in particular. Nor did I see any reason to justify them as a yuri pairing. NONE AT ALL. I am being entirely serious. None of their interactions in the beginning gave me any reason to believe either of them even liked each other nor do they even seem to get along most of the time. They just have vaguely romantic moments that serve no purpose and feel very out of place.       \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don\u2019t hate the series, but I do have many problems with it, and would easily say that it is my least favorite Kyoto Animation show of recent memory. I can give credit to Kumiko being likable enough to make some parts bearable, and for the ending actually feeling fulfilling. However, most everything else was not enjoyable and I began to actively dislike the show by the 3rd quarter. I didn\u2019t like the characters, I didn\u2019t like how the plot flowed, and while the show is beautiful, the art does not add anything nor do anything to bring you closer to the world. Its pretty but without substance.",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium was absolutely gorgeous and blew away my expectations in every field. Kyoto Animation at their best what I mean by that is their ability to make the viewer fully engaged into a slice of life anime. Throughout my extensive catalog of anime I have had my fair share of the slice of life genre and I can say with the utmost confidence that Euphonium is definitely one to check out. I started watching the anime on the pretext of a group of people saying it may be the anime of the season. Upon hearing that statement from my high horse I decided thatit may be worth looking into. In the course of watching the show I constantly reminded myself that SNAFU Zoku was the anime of the season and as I completed the final episode of Euphonium I painfully, but not regrettably, give Euphonium anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory - You have to \"love\" anime Synopsis' because they merely scratch the surface. The Story focuses on a band club that commits to make it into the national competition little did they know how far away they were from meeting that goal.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The backgrounds! The highlights! I haven't been shown the beauty of 2015 animation until Euphonium premiered. Kyoto Animation really made an outstanding piece of work. No matter how familiar I am with their works it still did not prepare me for the beautiful display of emotional scenes that were blissfully captured.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Its of the Music genre of course the music would be emphasized. The music was very dependent on the skill of the club so as you would watch the show from beginning to end you could see their growth as well as hear it. I am no where near a person that can critique music but if you listen closely you could see how just a small change of sound and a strength of breath can take music a long way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Kumiko by far was my favorite as her inspiration was Reina who possessed an undying dedication to music as well as her future. Kumiko broke my preconceived image of her as the optimistic protagonist we have all seen before within the first episode. These two made for the most stunningly beautiful scenes I have ever seen in a long time. In the beginning each club member was made to make a decision not only as a club but also as individuals. The characters that were focused on in the anime each had something different that would propel them past their limits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Hands down this is a contender for anime of the year. I enjoyed every episode and I can potentially see myself rewatching Euphonium in the future.\\n\\n\r\nFor my closing remarks I would like to talk about how good of an anime it was for the music genre instead of the slice of life aspect I have been ranting on about. Musically, it was superb for an anime for being set in high school. So for my final piece, I would like to say Euphonium is better than \"Your Lie In April\" for many reasons that I wish I could disclose to the general public, however, I am afraid I cannot incorporate spoilers in this review. I know it is a bold claim as I too, am a fan of \"Your Lie In April\". In whichever case I hope you take this review into account when you decide on your next anime.",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is a curios production that in narrative, visuals and music has moments where it truly shines, but sadly they are diluted by mediocre plot points, unnecessary characters and unusual story structure, taking what could have been a strong and emotionally resonant series down to a pleasant, but ultimately scarcely memorable watch.\r\nThe story, centered around Kumiko Oumae and her music class companions as they try to get to the nationals, is very inconsistent in terms of emotional intensity, pacing and enjoyment. Throughout the early episodes, the story is focussed on introducing Kumiko and her friends, Midori and Hazuki, to the audience, however this islittle initial tension or overbearing atmosphere to keep the audience engaged through this middling introduction. Hazuki increasing her capacity to breate, though insightful to those who are interested in the qualities required to play a wind instrument, is neither comedic nor engaging; even worse, it feels as though the audience are being forcefully pulled away from the considerably more interesting side characters like Asuka, Reina and the instructor, Taki. As the narrative progresses, other characters do become more relevant, but the results are mixed. An entire episode is spent focussing on a love triangle that goes nowhere, a conspiracy of nepotism that adds nothing and the main character faltering the episode before the climax. However, that\u2019s not to say that the story is a failure; specific moments are so well written and directed that they are simply breathtaking, such as second halves of episodes 8, 11 and 13. On the whole, this leads to a story that feels too long in some ways, as it has many redundant gears that simple exist to pad out the series, yet too short in others, as the more interesting and resonant parts are never given the focus they deserve. Tragically, though all the ingredients were there to construct a heart-warming, memorable story, they were not handled with the competence required to make this a truly great slice of life series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are much like the story in terms of how mixed they are. Reina Kousaka is without a doubt the highlight character, boasting a stoic and occasionally cryptic attitude that makes her intriguing, but having sufficient depth and believability to make her relatable. Her scene on the mountain with Kumiko was the magnum opus of this anime, having sufficient build-up to warrant the reveal of her ideals without feeling cheap or melodramatic. However, her full potential isn\u2019t quite reached, as conflicts are introduced regarding her, yet they rarely reach a resolution. Taki, the instructor, is also a very watchable character, but he gets little development or screen time, which, given the conspiracy surrounding his relationship with Reina, is quite a missed opportunity. Speaking of missed opportunities, Asuka has little done with her character after it is established, though thankfully this fault isn't nearly as glaring, as her interactions with the rest of the cast more than make up for it. However, regarding the character cast of Hibike! Euphonium, the praise ends there. The other characters all fall into the categories of being either disappointingly mediocre or outright boring. Kumiko joins the former category; perhaps she was intended to act as a character through which the audience could view the others, but this approach leaves much to be desired, because she seems like too much of a blank slate. She does have some development in the penultimate episode, but by then it is too little, too late, coming off as more of a desperate attempt at character growth instead of a relatable problem. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of giving her more consistent growth, time is wasted on her friends, Midori and Hazuki, whose company would perhaps be more appreciated if they didn\u2019t distract from the emotional core of the series, Kumiko and Reina\u2019s relationship. As they are, they\u2019re annoying, uninteresting friends who say way too much and add much too little. Though other characters, like Natsuki and Aoi aren\u2019t bad by any means, they waste ample time in an anime that really needs to pick and choose its foci better. However, though everything mentioned thus far is mixed to a varying degree, there is one constant in Hibike! The comedy is uniformally bad. There is not one genuine laugh provided even though every trick in the moe-book-of-laughs is used. Breast gags come off as more obnoxious than anything else, awkward character interactions make the audience feel just as uncomfortable and the over the top facial expressions don\u2019t gel with the more dramatic nature of the series. Sometimes the comedy and drama are shifted between with so little grace that the audience suffer from tonal whiplash, and occasionally it feels like even the series doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s trying to communicate. That\u2019s not to say the drama is done poorly; quite the contrary. The climax of the series sent chills down my spine, and the aforementioned conversation between Reina and Kumiko in Episode 8 resonated to my very soul. If there were more moments like this, Euphonium might have been great, but it must simply settle for being decent.\\n\\n\r\nSurely the animation is its saving grace, right? Kyoto animation always delivers in this regard, right? Well, if you consider a spotless glass of water to be beautiful, then this will probably appeal to you. However, for me it didn\u2019t stick out nearly enough most of the time to make this series a real spectacle. The character designs are bright and consistent, fluid and detailed, but lack a sense of identity needed to make them memorable. Chuunibyou\u2019s character designs had a exuded a sense of silly optimism, giving the audience an idea of who they are before they even spoke. Hibike! Euphonium\u2019s character designs, on the other hand, didn\u2019t really have much emotion. Aside from Reina, who the animators seemed to priorities above everyone else just like the writers did, Kumiko and the others, particularly the males, are monotonous to watch, with their plain uniforms and uninteresting expressions. The animators not only seemed to put their best efforts into the best characters, but the best scenes as well. For the most part, the series is set in a detailed, yet ultimately blandly coloured and designed room, feeling very claustrophobic and unengaging, both visually and narratively. On top of that, wind instruments are, by design, not particularly notable visual stimulants, and the anime fails to work around this. Aside from the occasional mouth movement, the euphonium and trumpet players only occasionally move a single finger, and that\u2019s in the rare instance that the frame is focussed on them. That's not to say the instruments themselves were bad, as they are extremely well drawn and lit, but they weren't utilised properly. The occasionally visited lake, however, is absolutely breathtaking, as is Reina\u2019s resplendent white dress in episode 8 and the bridge shown during Kumiko\u2019s meltdown in episode 12, which, along with the accompanying strong facial animation and soaring music, leaves me both wistful to see more, and disappointed that such well-directed scenes are so few and far between. On the whole, Hibike! Is easy on the eye, but serves very little purpose for the vast majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is much like the visuals; technically, it\u2019s high quality, with crisp sound effects and realistic instrument sounds, but it feels much too safe and by-the-numbers to impress like it should, particularly in an anime the focusses so heavily on music. The OP and ED are both completely forgettable, often starkly contrasting the more dramatics episodes in the series and they\u2019re both overall weak, generic songs in their own right. The voice acting for the male characters in this series is completely forgettable, even for Taki-sensei, barring one or two emotional moments. Kumiko\u2019s fairly good, Asuka and Reina are both great, but Midori and Hazuki are nails on a chalk board, absolutely irritating in every line they speak. Interestingly, I think the voice actress for Kaori was the stand out, capturing the emotional intensity and restraint of her character in a role that would have been very easy to fumble in. The OST doesn\u2019t back up this relatively strong group of voice actors very well, shining only, as was mentioned earlier, in the same moments as the characters and visuals, but being disappointingly mediocre in every other respect. It\u2019s pleasant, certainly, and keeps up with the pace, but nothing is memorable or evoking, as the series further proves its inability to reach its potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes presented in Hibike! Euphonium, at least on paper, are resonant, relatable to people regardless of their age and should make for some emotionally satisfying moments. Themes such as being the underdog, finding self-acceptance and self-value and enjoying the little moments in life are all present.  However, much like every other aspect of Hibike!, they\u2019re a mixed bag. Reina herself struggles with her love for Taki, while also feeling slightly uncomfortable around him and very defensive of him, though this never reaches anything. Kumiko struggles with her ability, though after an outstanding character moment, this is resolved too easily and too late. Such themes and scenarios are peppered throughout, but the series messily tangles them, introducing too many and resolving few of them. Even Asuka is hinted to have some hidden secrets, but they never come to fruition. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hibike! Euphonium is a can-see anime. If it looks like it will appeal to you, if you have fond memories of being in a school band or aren\u2019t as concerned about messy structure, then you will by no means regret this. It\u2019s pretty to look at, sound pleasant, and has some stand out moments that elevates it from so-so to decent, though if, like me, you would prefer something with a more decisive and competent handling of its themes and characters, there are better anime out there for you. However, a second season could blow many of my problems away, and if there is a second season, I\u2019ll be watching.\\n\\n\r\n(On a side note, the translation of Hibike! Euphonium to Sound! Euphonium is one I disprove of. Instead, direct and more tonally accurate translate would be \u201cYou Can Play! Euphonium\u201d, though perhaps this would make the product less marketable. )\\n",

            "content": "I'm a music person. I've always been one, though at the beginning it was in heart alone. In middle school I played violin, trumpet and sang in the choir, and I was told promptly and I quote that I sounded like \"a cat being run over by a lawnmower\". This didn't get me down though (for some reason,) in fact I saw my apparent absolute lack of any talent whatsoever to be a sign that I was meant to pursue music. I continued to practice much to the suffering of everyone around me, and though I experienced harsh criticism along the way I'm now incollege and I'm part of two prestigious music groups and consider myself to be a functioning member of the music community. I can look back and track my progress from hopeless wannabe to soloing for Joe Biden at his Christmas party at the National Observatory. I still have the napkins I stole from his bathroom. Hopefully no NSA cameras were watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound! Euphonium is a show all about this struggle, the burning desire to make your seemingly impossible ambitions come to life, and so while I am obviously laden with personal bias due to my background I will still stand here and testify as an equally great fan of storytelling that as the great Euphonium yuri shipping fad of Spring 2015 comes to an end, what we're left with is... a pretty spectacular show.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has developed quite the reputation for itself over the past decade with shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, K-On and Hyouka, to name a few. Anyone who's seen more than one of these has probably noticed a trend; it's not something they try to hide. KyoAni loves three things, or rather they know that anime viewers love them: high school, slice-of-life, and moe. Literally everything they've put out in over ten years has had these traits, and they've been spectacularly effective at least in part due to them. I've heard a lot of people complain about how KyoAni's endless fluff shows are ruining anime, and to that I would say: KyoAni really hasn't made that many shows. Blame other studios trying to replicate their success for the moeblob spam that inevitably flood every season. When KyoAni DOES make a show, however, anyone who is willing to put up with the inevitable fluff should check it out, and Sound! Euphonium is no exception. Actually, I would go so far as to say that Sound! Euphonium is one of the best KyoAni shows to ever be produced. Euphonium is pretty much the perfected embodiment of KyoAni's strengths: the art is stunning. The character animation is out of this WORLD. The writing and drama are strong and honest. The music... ohhhh the music.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name would imply (and contrary to what many lusting fans seem to believe,) Euphonium is a show about music. Yes, there are drama and romance in it but its first-and-foremost focus is on the growth of the high-school band in which our protagonist Kumiko is a euphonium player. Because of this, the show has a very group-oriented focus, because hey, bands are a group effort. The band cannot succeed without the effort and cooperation of ALL of its members, not just the protagonists, and while Kumiko and her close friends strive for personal improvement both in attitude and talent Euphonium shows us time and again that they are inevitably only part of a collective whole that must all come together in this way in order to be successful. This is the first aspect in which the show absolutely wowed me: \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nEuphonium is a short 13 episodes, and yet not only does it manage to deeply develop the protagonist and her close relationships but also follow a supporting cast of an unbelievable size. More than ten characters have full arcs across the length of the show and countless others gets development and recognizable personalities. Despite this, the show never feels rushed and it never feels as though its detracting attention from either the main cast or the band itself. It does this by carefully weaving the character's struggles together so that each episode focuses on a plethora of conflicts, showing how they may or may not be connected but also how they all matter as part of the band's dynamic. No one gets left behind: there are small, quick scenes all over the place keeping tabs on all of the characters, and by the end when I'm watching the band preform it feels like I'm actually connected to the ensemble rather than just some of the people that are in it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main cast are individually compelling as well: Kumiko is definitely up there as one of the best female protagonists of all time, as someone who is relatable, charismatic, and a touch-- dare I say-- deep? She begins the show as directionless but contemplative, and as her obviously intense thought process slowly guides her towards something she cares about she experiences some of the most profound moments I've ever seen in an anime: spectacularly executed scenes about the pursuit of passion and trying to weigh what's supposed to matter against what matters to you personally. (Of course, the show handles these ideas in a much more tactful way than I just did, and that's really what sells it.) Her exceptionally driven comrade (and secret lesbian lover) Reina is actually equally compelling: her frustration with others apathy, her honesty about her own ambition, and her struggle to try to interact with others in a way that is more tactful but still honest all add up to make her a suitable romantic counte-- I mean, \"best friend\" for Kumiko, the protagonist. You'll get plenty of heartwarming scenes from the two of them, but you'll also get ones that are powerful and true: Euphonium is one of KyoAni's most driven shows, and it is not content to just sit back and be cute and charming. Much like Reina and Kumiko it wants to go places, and go places it does.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT\\n\\n\r\nI was actually amazed by how much story the show managed to cover in thirteen episodes. Much like an elegant trombone slide the story of the show progresses fast but smooth, blending together with the character's development to achieve that most desirable effect that all slice-of-life shows dream of: a plot that is driven by countless small moments rather than a few obvious big ones. Life doesn't move in big shifts, it moves through countless small moments, and Euphonium captures that. The band grows and improves, both in sound quality and relationship, such that it is an unrecognizable ensemble by the end of the show. Progress and change are steady in the show, but they aren't dramatized. You can look back and see how far the band and the characters have come (and they do the same thing) but it's not something where you can point to a specific moment and say \"this is where things changed\". Things are ALWAYS changing. What I will say, without spoiling anything, is that Euphonium has a definitive story and conclusion. It isn't just a slice-of-life where stuff happens and then at the end some stuff has happened and it teeters off: Both Euphonium and its characters have a goal, and by the end of the show we are given a definitive resolution to that goal. While a sequel would be both possible and much desired, it is not required as the show does a great job (especially amongst anime, which are known for having obnoxious unresolved conclusions) of having a powerful and definitive ending, with what was in my opinion the best episode of the season (and maybe even the year if not for episode 9 of Death Parade) thanks to its top-tier character moments and ABSOLUTELY FRIGGING GORGEOUS MUSIC\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThis is the VERY BEST soundtrack I have EVER experienced. Not because it's the prettiest or catchiest music-- though it is extremely enjoyable, but because like everything else in the show it is the most impressively nuanced thing I've ever heard. People don't comically suck in Euphonium: they're usually just kind of sloppy and sad, so that you can tell not just that they're not great but exactly how \"not great\" they are. When the band first plays, it's not an abomination: it's simply lacking, morose, and full of small yet noticeable errors in tempo and pitch. It's not hard on the ears, but it's not fun to listen to either. However, as everyone improves and the talent of both the individuals and the group gets spectacularly better you can HEAR it. You can hear the marked improvement, even though there are still errors. You can hear the energy and vitality that begins to seep into everyone's performance. You can hear each rehearsal as the pitch becomes clearer and the parts begin to line up crisper. As I mentioned earlier I'm a music person myself, so I obviously have a little bias here. But I still firmly believe that this show NAILS IT with carefully executed performances and a stunning attention to detail when it comes to comparing and contrasting different sounds. One scene that jumps to mind (without spoiling anything: I'll be vague) is when characters are auditioning for a solo part and two markedly stunning performances are given... and yet despite how good one of them is you can still hear just how much better the other is. I was blown away. The show respects the audience, playing the music as it would be and letting them decide for themselves what they think sounds best rather than making the gap in performance qualities obvious enough that anyone can notice it as a contrived indication of talent. \\n\\n\r\nTHE ART\\n\\n\r\nis gorgeous. Remember Hyouka? Well, it's more of that. It might even be prettier in some scenes. The attention to character movements and details is on-point, the direction is godlike, the backgrounds and instruments are both drawn gorgeously. One of my favorite things about the animation is that it ensures that characters are always subtly shifting or moving in some way, as people do, as opposed to using the classic \"person standing here and only their mouth or maybe one hand is moving.\" People move constantly, especially in conversation, and Euphonium captures that bringing everyone in the show to more vibrant life. I'm not holding that against other shows at all though: it's great that KyoAni can do that, but that's pretty much only because they're rich as fuck and can literally bring worlds to life by throwing money at the screen. What they can get credit for though is the way that the scenes and character motions are framed: aka GORGEOUS and indicative of the countless complicated feelings and relationships the various band members have between themselves. This also is some of the most obvious and solid proof of Kumiko and Reina's steamy future, but that's besides the point.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching this. I loved the performances, as they were borderline epic. I loved the characters, as they were compelling and sweet and diverse and were portrayed in a plethora of environments and moods. I loved the romance, which was touching and adorable and didn't overshadow the actual story. I actually signed up for a crunchyroll trial so that I could watch the new episodes sooner, and I'll be adding this to the top tier of my sequel wishlist. It's short, its amazingly well executed, it's compelling, and I'd pretty much recommend it to anyone. Anime of the season. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10, Most impressive soundtrack of all time, Needs R-rated spinoff.\\n",

            "content": "\"Music is nice. You can't lie. You can only admit when something sounds good.\" \r\nIsn't that so true? Whether or not you like Kyoto Animation, it's hard to deny that Hibike Euphonium sounds amazing. \r\nHibike sounds alive. I don't know how they pulled it off, but the show sounds so human. You hear as students warm up and tune their instruments together, you hear when the trombone players goof up, you hear the protagonist's tone change as she develops her skills, and when the whole band plays together, it's a real treat. This is great sound design--this is music anime donewell.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the music, Hibike looks fantastic too! The attention to detail is especially high with instruments, and with how well the animation syncs with the sound. The combined result of vibrant visuals and lush sound is a truly immersive show. \\n\\n\r\nBut what's so cool about this show is that unlike K-on (...which I still guiltily like), this show is a kept promise.\\n\r\nLooking at the poster, you are sold the promise of good orchestral music and cute characters. \\n\r\nAnd if you came for that...you will not be let down.\\n\\n\r\nBut, saying this show is JUST cute girls playing music would be slighting it. The show undersells itself with its moe-looking setup. Hibike tells relatable tales about the struggle of not feeling good enough, shooting for goals that seem out of reach, and of course, relying on friendship and love to power through it all.\\n\\n\r\nBut believe me when I say that none of it is cheesy--not everything has to be cynical and brooding like 'Whiplash' to be awe-inspiring like Hibike can be. I would point out specific moments, but you just have to see them...and hear them.\\n\\n\r\nHibike is a classic example of \"short but sweet.\" The 13-episode length keeps the action rolling and the production value consistent. \\n\r\nAs you watch these 13 episodes, you'll be introduced to underdogs you can root for and relate to, as well as geniuses you can admire. You'll follow the steady growth of one determined orchestra band as they reach for the top of their game. And through it all, you'll hear everyone's music, and whether or not you like the soundtrack as much as I did, you won't be wrong--after all, music can't lie.\\n\\n",

It has great attention to detail in both art and sound design when it comes to the instruments, but falls flat on its face in almost every other aspect. Having just come off of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso/Your Lie in April, which has two great musical sequences in the first two episodes, the fact that it took until episode 3 for any real music to pop up in this series frustrated me too much than it should have. That frustration followed me throughout the series.\r\nThe series seems to at times WANT to be about music, but is draggedinto drama because that tension is supposed to move the story and characters along. Ultimately, it seems as if only a few characters really meaningfully change, and we're left with maybe four decent performances in the 13 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the series roughly covers a school year, the entire pace seems slow, since there are only really two major plot points that involve playing pieces of music, and the series builds to the second over the course of the majority of its episodes. This is slightly understandable, since the point of the series is the drama of the club more than them actually playing music. If there's a sequel and it continues to follow this format it will be inexcusable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm probably judging this harsher than I should for what it is, but looking at it as a fan of music anime and seeing what it could have been... In the end, I'm just glad that I'm done watching this series so I don't have to fret over how much it annoys me any more.",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is like a symphony. It starts off slow and mellow, then comes at you full force, not letting you go until the very end. \r\nStory: Being that it's a KyoAni work, many people deemed the show \"K-On in Concert Band\" without further thought. From the first two episodes, the show seemed to just be a simplistic slice-of-life, albeit a cute and fun one. However, the plot picks up surprisingly quickly from the show's brilliant third episode. From that point on, Hibike! Euphonium becomes a terrific coming-of-age story, that roused feelings of nostalgia from my very core. The storyline is paced wonderfully, never goingtoo slow or too fast. Plot threads reveal and close themselves in beautiful ways. Sadly, Hibike! Euphonium is based off a series too large to adapt in one cour, so there isn't a defining conclusion. But, because of that same fact, we can hope for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: KyoAni has great animation. It's a well known fact. However, what amazes me is that KyoAni upped their game even more. Every single side character has a unique character design, full of personality, even if they never speak a single line. The particle effects that fill the show make it burst with personality and life. The lighting and colors on the instruments are almost like photographs. The backgrounds are gorgeous. Everything about the art is just perfect. I could rave about it forever. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is an anime about music. Unsurprisingly, the music in it is great. The actual soundtrack is orchestrated wonderfully, driving in the emotion of powerful scenes. However, the sound truly shines when the characters play their instruments. The amount of work that must've gone into the subtle differences between each player and each time they play a song astounds me. I mean, the show literally has Sound (Hibike) in the name. The sound better damn well be astounding. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the show truly shines. Well, I give everything about this show a 10/10, so I guess I have to give character an 11/10. The character development is just so realistically written, it hurts. It reminds me of my own high school experiences and the sometimes dumb, confusing ways I felt. I don't know if I can think of another show that has character development so fluid and natural. At the same time, every character is multi-layered in amazing ways. Even some of the side characters who only make a few appearances get their time to show off development or multiple dimensions. You'll love some characters and you'll hate some characters, but ultimately, you'll appreciate how all of them grow.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in Hibike! Euphonium comes together to create a piece that I think is truly special. Give it a shot. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! This time we're tackling a band adventure! The most important fact when it comes to this anime is one's experience in high school band. If you are not/were not a member, much the attraction is probably lost on you, just by the niche nature of the material. Now, a non band kid can understand frustration and hard work, but much of this show is (clearly) geared for those familiar with the experience. Having known the experience, I found a great deal to like! Taking bets on if/or how many pics this anime scored on the RTLR wall of terriblepain. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nMuch of the story revolves around motivating the lazy band kids into actually caring about their performance. A new band director comes to the school, and has a very interesting method to trying to get a response from the kids. I will leave the show to reveal his methods, but I can say as a former band member, his methods work, as they were similar as to what my high school director employed on my high school band. These methods, however, produce a great deal of friction from the members, who are used to doing things the 'way we always have' and see little reason to change. There is also a mysterious character related to the new director.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nThe instruments are well drawn, not an easy feat considering tubas can have up to 18 feet of tubing. Each instrument is instantly recognizable, and sharply drawn. The rest of the art also benefits from the same level of detail. The characters look amazing, and emotional overtones are easily carried through the artwork, always a sign that things are on the right track.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWhen a group is pointed out as sounding bad, they sound particularly bad. When the group improves and sounds good, the playing level of the music improves to match. This is an important factor as music is such a central theme in this anime. Maybe with a pop-music based anime some can be written off as personal preference, but this is classic brass and woodwind pieces where reed squeaks and off tone notes stick out like sore thumbs and cannot be written off as intentional by any means. When students play their instruments alone, the sound is dead on and at the right skill level for the character. The sound outside the music is well done, nothing of note, but nothing lacking either. The smaller girl's voice sounds appropriately small, etc. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThere is a mystery girl who is an accomplished musician who joins this school for mysterious reasons. I, like any 'band nerd' knew nearly instantly why she was there. Anyone that didn't live their lives around their tuba and/or non musicians should know the anime does lay the story out in appropriate pieces over the course of the series, so that by the end, it should be obvious. I think they were a little muddled and should have, at the end, stated it plainly, but I imagine they figured most viewers already knew. Still a couple points off for that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe 'pretty' girl is a weirdo, one of the instruments gets the best name ever, the sights and sounds of band are there in all their (sometimes gross) glory, the music is good, and some of the instruments are twice as big as the kids playing them, what more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\n If you've ever practiced your lips/fingertips off preparing for concert contest, or have done laps for marching contest, and enjoyed any of it, you'll find lots to love here. This is unabashedly high school band, and there's nothing wrong with that! In fact, in honor of my years as a tuba player (and a few years on trumpet) Kato Hazuki and Tubacabra made the RTLR wall of honor! Check this one out, might just work for ya! Thumbs up!",

            "content": "Kyoto animation is often described by many people as the studio in which they keep producing the exact same shows endlessly, that show being cute girls in a school type setting. While it is true that many, if not all do feature some kind of cute girl in high school, each one of Kyoto's works carries its own distinct flavour and personality that sets it apart from the others shows they have made. Hibike Euphonium is the latest anime by Kyoto and perfectly presents  the reason why I fell in love with this studio in the first place. Furthermore, while this anime can becompared to K-on since they both feature cute girls playing music the content is quite different which I'll get into a bit later in this post.\\n\\n\r\nLike most of the works from this studio, I was blown away by the high quality animation, character designs and the absolutely beautiful shot composition and design of the school. The music room is incredibly memorable just from how well designed it is and how much detail is put into creating this room much like the club room from k-ON! Another thing that impressed me is the changes in expressions the characters would have mid sentence which conveyed a better sense of their emotions than any other anime from this year, rather than simply having the character explain in black and white what their emotions are. The hair colours for each of the girls are more realistic, although it does push it in a few places, which works well with the more realistic approach to music this anime was going for. The lighting is fantastic and emphasises the playing perfectly and the characters move with such fluidity and movement that it is breathtaking to see.  But there is more to this show then just simply the well done design choices.\\n\\n\r\nHibike Euphonium tells the story of musicians and their complex relationship to their art and our main character Kumiko struggles throughout the entirety of the show with her feelings towards playing music and finding an aspiration in life. This sets up an interesting narrative and sinks the character with a higher level of realism. Kumiko's conflict stems from the opening scene where we see Reina, a character who takes playing the trumpet extremely seriously and somebody who is always working, begin to cry as they didn't make it into nationals. Kumiko is confused by this and enrages Reina even more therefore setting up the emotional conflict of these two characters, as well as their stance when it comes to playing their instrument right from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nUpon entering high school, Kumiko is more or less ready to give up her playing of the Euphonium and move on with her life with a fresh start but soon becomes mixed up with people who all have the same interest as her in the brass band and kind of joins in reluctantly as the first two friends she makes also join. Kumiko, in contrast to Sapphire and Reina has no aspirations or motivations for playing in the band and tries her best to avoid this topic, most likely stemming from the fact that she herself is not aware of her own passion yet. \\n\\n\r\nHowever this is ironic as Kumiko is someone with so much talent for playing her instrument as she almost made to the nationals and has the ability to tell when people are performing badly or not while also carrying around a plushie of her instrument.\\n\\n\r\nKumiko's character does become more and more inspired and motivated by her music through the course of the show as she begins to mend her past with Reina leading to some thick homosexual sub tones in later episodes and by realising how fun playing music is. Her commitment to playing the instrument becomes almost overwelhiming as it becomes her main priority.\\n\r\nReina's character is also very interesting too, as she strives hard for some kind of recognition in music and even at times goes as far to proclaim herself as a better musician in front of her seniors. She is somebody who whole heartedly believes in herself and her craft which makes for an enjoyable and realistic approach to music.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Sapphire, one of the people who befriends Kumiko is driven by her desire to play her instrument as best she can and expresses a very optimistic persona that they could make it to nationals. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters are interesting in their growth and how they change throughout the course of the show. Each of the supporting cast has such depth and character all growing more and more throughout the anime. Each character is given enough time to breath and spread their wings. The growth of the characters is also evident by how well they can play at the end of the anime from the ability to play at the start.\\n\\n\r\nWhile musicianship does take up a large section of the narrative there are other themes thrown in such as love which doesn't feel tacked on but handled in such a way to invoke realism and character growth for Hazuki.\\n\r\nThe relationship that grows between Kumiko and Reina is very believable and they both complement each other well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat impressed me the most was the small attentions to detail. Simply just a teacher telling the girls to make their skirts longer sinks well in the pacing of the story and adds to the realism of the story. Also, the instruments these girls play all seem like real instruments with the amount of detail put into creating them. The drama between the different characters in the music room as well as the different opinions of how music should be play coupled with the anticipation of performing their music was all implemented amazingly into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall soundtrack was amazing with noticeable highlights being the final performance at the end and the scene in which Kumiko runs down a road proclaiming her desire to play the instrument. The soundtrack is amazing and really highlights many of the scenes bringing them to life.\\n\r\n Overall, whenever people say that Kyoto have lost their touch, this is a show I'll bring up in retaliation to what they just said. There is so much more to this show then what I could possible express. Parting thoughts: One of the best anime of 2015 \\n",

            "content": "You know, the circumstances surrounding Sound Euphonium are more interesting to me than the show itself. With the moe trend all but dead because \u201clight-novel fad\u201d didn\u2019t want to play nice and share - and KyoAni proving said fad had a point when their attempts to jump in on its territory whilst still maintaining a commitment to cute were about as well-received as second-degree sunburns in the middle of the North Pole - their fall from grace in terms of the public was pre-determined the moment K-On became so big. Word of advice: nothing ages faster than an anime that tries to cash in ona popular trend. Because even the really good products to come from \u2018em don\u2019t connect well with future audiences. Or at least, that\u2019s the reason I use for why I can\u2019t get into Bringing Up Baby.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s still a crowd for KyoAni\u2019s shit, and it doesn\u2019t help that the ones that actually do try to do more don\u2019t sell as well. So I guess some trends just won\u2019t die easy in the East, but the West was a different story. I\u2019m not participating in that FAL thing this season - and I never intend to play in it again for that matter - but I can suspect that some participants were frustrated at how so many of KyoAni\u2019s diehard fanbase pretty much gave up on the studio\u2019s new thing prior to airing because they saw it as their version of Sasami-san@Ganbaranai in terms of them repeating themselves. Sure, we knew Euphonium would actually have people play their instruments before we jumped into it, but the lack of focus on the topic wasn\u2019t the only reason why K-On was backlashed so hard. The fact that it wasn\u2019t funny, had dull-as-brick characters, and no f*cking story are problems that quite frankly were impossible for me to ignore, and Euphonium looked like KyoAni\u2019s revenge for all the shit we dished out at their shit, right down to hiring hack-writer Jukki Hanada again. It\u2019s a never-ending cycle of despair worthy of the Vengeance Trilogy.\\n\\n\r\nBut then it turns out that Euphonium was less revenge against the shit and more of the studio\u2019s determination to not let PA Works be the only studio to pull out a \u201cdarkest before dawn\u201d surprise hit, because now the anime is considered by critics and fans to be KyoAni\u2019s big comeback anime. It\u2019s doing well on MAL\u2019s top charts, it\u2019s pretty much the blogger favorite of the season, and considering my recent record in shows with those sorts of reputations (especially when they involve cute girls like Shirobako and Girls Und Panzer), I\u2019m sure most of you are expecting me to give it a lot of shit. Well of course I am; but in a twist that\u2019s praise-worthy of the Shyamalan meme from Robot Chicken, I think it\u2019s my favorite of these cute girl shows, let alone the popular ones. Because rather than dryly explaining the process like I\u2019m sitting through a construction company meeting despite the fact that I\u2019m an apprentice chef, or trying to cover up for your lack of substance with style like pretty much every movie Guy Ritchie has ever made, it\u2019s a sports-like show with characterization on its mind. And considering that Ping Pong is one of my favorite sports anime, I\u2019m all for that if it\u2019s executed well.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the thing though, isn\u2019t it? I mean excusing the fact that KyoAni are well-known for not focusing on developing their characters, how much can you really achieve in terms of characterization with light-hearted slice-of-life to begin with? After all, it\u2019s a genre designed by nature to have no grit in terms of goals and humor, and the notion of watching fiction in order to relax and \u201cbe friends with\u201d is completely lost on me these days. The only way you can possibly get some good substance out of it at this point is to be self-reflexive regarding the genre, and even that has its faults, as Euphonium excellently demonstrates for good and for bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound Euphonium\u2019s story starts off like practically every KyoAni show in that it\u2019s pretty much exactly as it\u2019s advertised in the summaries whilst being nothing like it\u2019s advertised in the initial PV.  On her first day of school, a young girl named Kumiko Oumae notices that her music club kind of sucks and after much prodding from her friends, joins said club with them. However, her middle-school friend (Reina) is also in the club, and due to a music-related incident in the past, she\u2019s pretty nervous around her. But Kumiko and the rest of the \u201cmostly-female for some reason\u201d band don\u2019t have time to focus on their personal problems, because the school hired Cillian Murphy as the club advisor in order to make sure that they achieve their goals of making it to the Nationals. And unlike Will Schuester (if he was channeling Negi Springfield), he\u2019s pretty ruthless underneath his \u201ckind\u201d nature and won\u2019t hesitate to stand in the band\u2019s way if they don\u2019t take things seriously. He\u2019s not exactly Coach Carter or the main teacher from Whiplash, but it\u2019s practically impossible to have a caeki~ moment around him if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how only one novel was released by the time this anime was put into production, you know what that means right? KyoAni once again expanding/changing the source material in their own ways in order to get a decent runtime out of it. I\u2019m not sure what they changed considering I never read the book, but something tells me that the yuri undertones weren\u2019t part of the original package. Yes, the very thing that finally caused the show to get out of its \u201coh KyoAni are making another anime? Whatever\u201d phase was when something I can only refer to as \u201cthat episode\u201d occurred, more than halfway in. \u201cWait then, Mr. Flawfinder? If the turning point was halfway in, then what about the stuff prior?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have my main problem with Sound Euphonium. Whilst I personally thought the episode prior to \u201cthat episode\u201d was the turning point that I wasn\u2019t sure was a turning point at first, the show nevertheless is similar to Steins;Gate in that it suffers from an entire \u201cnot very interesting\u201d first half. The parts when Cillian was put into conflict with the entire band were fine, but everything else is pretty much fluffy and kinda vague setup for what is to to come later, and said setup doesn\u2019t even pay off a good chunk of the time. Despite having four official main characters, it\u2019d be more accurate to say the show has two, and even KyoAni knew that the other two girls were the equivalent of S;G\u2019s trap and cat in terms of uselessness, given how quickly they get shunned from events after they go through their own boring personal arcs that don\u2019t even lead to anything. Hell, the third-years got more attention than them in the end.\\n\\n\r\nRightfully so too, because the parts of the story that did interest me was any of the drama focused on the third years. Why? Because being on the verge of graduation, they actually had to struggle in regards to whether their participation in getting to the Nationals was worth sacrificing school and possibly their future for, and when you combine that with Cillian\u2019s teaching methods, it makes for something I can really sink my teeth into. Since all of the main four are in their second year, this means they don\u2019t have said worries and thus don\u2019t have as much stake in the band, causing the initially huge focus on them to be kinda iffy. The main two do get a compelling reason regarding their own participation eventually, but before then, they\u2019re so tight-lipped about their true agendas that I wondered why Kumiko was the main female to begin with other than to be the female version of the typical KyoAni snarky lead who doesn\u2019t even get involved in the actually interesting personal turmoil most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor the record, like most people, my favorite character was the Vice President, Asuka. Not because of her chipper attitude, which didn\u2019t do too much for me in the beginning and has been known to annoy both the other characters and even fans of this show. I liked her because said attitude functioned as a good contrast to a darker side that does whatever it takes to avoid drama whenever possible, which works as a well-rounded complement to the fact that she\u2019s the most talented and honest member of the band. Unfortunately, what makes her the most (only?) interesting student character is also the very reason why she doesn\u2019t have much screen time, especially when the story kicks into gear. You can\u2019t have tension in your drama if someone who can cut through all the bullshit is readily available, now can you?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the drama never gets too heavy to the point of slipshodness. The finale in particular shows great restraint by not throwing in anything at the last minute and letting the character\u2019s personal journeys and what they learned from \u2018em ultimately make up the substance of the final musical climax. It even ends the story right at its highest (well, second-highest) point in order to provide a compelling conclusion that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome whilst giving a sequel hook that I\u2019m open to receiving whilst not necessarily needing it. See that, ufotable? This is how you end a well-animated personal journey. What? Waver\u2019s appearance was so important to the die-hard continuity fans that you just had to make that last episode just to show him and everyone else\u2019s non-story related roles? Well I don\u2019t give two craps, because that sort of epilogue has not and will never be compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I still think the show holds back a little too much at times. One of the central conflicts in the story is rendered completely pointless by the fact that all the problems were one-sided on their end, and both parties involved just brush it aside once said realization occurs, which makes me wonder why it went on so long in the first place. And for god\u2019s sake, why are none of the male members in the band the least bit interesting? I only remember two of them and they might as well have not existed for all the story importance they had. This especially becomes troublesome during a short love triangle interlude that I would have disliked regardless, but I would have been more forgiving if it had added anything to the story or the characters. Yes, I liked that it was brushed aside as quickly as it came. But if you\u2019re going to include it anyways, you might as well give it the same treatment you gave Asuka\u2019s limited time.\\n\\n\r\nSo whilst I can concede that Euphonium has its good points, the drama to fluff ratio isn\u2019t in its favor enough to be a great show. For starters, you\u2019d have to remove all the fluff in order to do that, and there\u2019s no way KyoAni was going to do that. Second, the drama could have been paced better. Maybe the execution of Ping Pong was too much to ask, but if you had mixed and matched the heavy stuff in the second half with the lighter conversations in the first half ala a Persona game, I wouldn\u2019t have smashed more than two guitars over the show\u2019s head. Instead, I have to sit through a bunch of middling episodes that even the majority of the fans agreed weren\u2019t all that considering the point in the series when it increased in popularity. That makes it one of the better shows of the season for sure, but considering how low a bar that\u2019s been for this Spring in particular, that\u2019s like being awarded a gold medal for getting first place in a soccer competition when all your teammates are three-year olds in broken wheelchairs. I\u2019d personally rather just give it the \u201cdecent at best\" certificate and call it a day.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I don\u2019t think Reina even interacted with Hazuki or Sapphire all that much, which makes the ending video look kind of weird.",

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 Cut/paste bland characters in a slightly interesting setting are plagued with drama that leaves the viewer confused and irritated. Music is cool if you enjoy chamber music (which I do). If the general idea of this anime interests you \u2013 go ahead and watch it if you need something to eat your dinner to every night, its a shallow anime that might leave some begging for more because of the want for basic, shallow, and sometimes CUTE GIRLZ.\r\nHaving been in a high school orchestra, I related to the struggles and anxiety surrounding the life of a high school musician. That is however, oneof the only things I related to. The shows characters for the most part are quite remarkably bland. So remarkably that I didn\u2019t truly understand the need to shove so many characters into this story to begin with. Even the characters that received screen-time were usually unlikable and disturbingly lacking depth.\\n\r\nThis show follows a typical sports anime pacing with practices, drama, and the final climactic competition. Unfortunately for the story \u2013 being in a school band is pretty boring to begin with \u2013 having said this they did milk some good little drama out of these characters, but by the end of the anime 90% of the drama was extremely fake-deep and shallow at best.\\n\\n\r\nA somewhat misleading and shocking yuri subtext permeates this show like the plague. This show however doesn\u2019t truly acknowledge the potential homosexual subplot however, and makes me feel actually insane after every yuri-implied moment as the show itself pretends like it never happened. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch this for the music \u2013 go for it. Some of the solos and individual performances in the show were well recorded and give a nice mood to the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was literally picking your waifu that plays whatever instruments you like: the anime. Which \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 doesn\u2019t make an amazing anime. With a smaller cast this show may have had itself under control, but too many characters in too many vaguely half-baked dramatic situations leads to quite the anticlimax once you complete this anime. \\n",

            "content": "Ah, band.  The fond memories of a music player such as I, remembers the time back when you were but one of a group of 50+ students, playing a piece conducted by the music teacher at your school.  But since there isn't much anime out there that encapsulates such an idea, this season of Spring 2015 brought us Hibike! Euphonium, a show that truly does capture the essence that is the high school band.\r\nStory (7.66/10): Euphonium follows the story of Oumae Kumiko, a Euphonium player (basically the instrument is that of a smaller tuba) our main female protagonist of this series.  Aftera brutal experience in middle school with her middle school band not making it to the ever coveted spot of being a participant in Japan's band Nationals, she becomes very distraught by the experience and swears not to join again.  But, as chance may have it, her new friends want to join the band, and so by peer pressure, she does too.  Now, she is once again holding the instrument she has been playing all her life with a band that has quite a divided history.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Hibike! Euphonium is an anime deconstruction of the idea of a high school band.  Every part of what the characters do for the most part is what actual bands do.  The sectionals where all the different instruments split off and practice individually, the tuning of the instrument before practice, the instrument maintenance, competing for that coveted solo part, and even the general attitudes both positive and negative from members within a band.  It accurately shows what one is to expect whenever they join a band, which makes it a great watch for those who haven't actually been in one (if they're curious as to what they do), and for those who have just to say \"yep, I've done that before.\"  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the bigger ways the show showcases these trials within a band are through the use of small character arcs, each of which dealing with a different member within the band who has an issue with the way the band politics are working out.  Each of these different arcs vary in importance and length in terms of screentime, but they make the show more interesting because it isn't always fun and games with band.  Each of these small arcs are different and require the use of different character each time, hence a lot more use of the band and in the end, make for a much better storyline cause it's different people having different problems, making things more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Euphonium sometimes does miss a note or two.  One of the more prominent things about it is the fact that it is a KyoAni show.  KyoAni as of late has had a track record of moe shows, and as a result, Euphonium does showcase quite a few of your stereotypical moe moments for the sake of comedy.  Of course, to me, this doesn't hamper the show all that much, but if you're not a fan of moe, then here's the warning for that.  One of the bigger problems that Euphonium has with itself is the fact that there are unnecessary conflicts.  In some cases, the show attempts to fill its runtime with conflicts within the band that sometimes feel unnecessary.  There're moments where other characters attempt to change whatever's happened within the band to no avail, thus going back to the show's status quo, and even a romantic sideplot that was completely unneeded, all parts of the story which I think bring down the overall quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Euphonium as a whole brought to the table a deconstruction of a topic that hasn't really been talked about in anime.  While there were parts of its story that were somewhat unfavorable, the end result was still able to showcase what the true feeling of being in a concert band was, and was able to deliver that concept very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:\\n\r\n+ Deconstruction of band\\n\r\n+ Show's problems are similar to that of a band's\\n\r\n+/- Moe moments (this is good or bad depending on your taste in anime.)\\n\r\n-  Unnecessary developments (like romantic sideplot)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.41/10): The characters in Euphonium differ than what you would normally see in a general anime in terms of presentation.  Rather than having a true, defined set of main and supporting cast, the show bounces back and forth with character importance, with each mini character arc dealing with a different problem focusing on a different member/section of the band. \\n\\n\r\nBut let's start with the main character of all of this, Oumae Kumiko.  As a Euphonium player, Kumiko wished to follow in her sister's footsteps at a young age and started playing the Euphonium just like her sister did.  Now in high school and the tragedy that was her middle school audition for nationals, Kumiko has become somewhat pessimistic, and very unmotivated to continue on band even when her friends say they're going to join as well.  Kumiko's character is very different from the other kinds of characters that KyoAni has made the star of the show.  Rather than being all cutesy and fussing adorably, Kumiko is a rather mischievous and downright mean character at times which I personally find to be a nice change, seeing how this is a much different personality than you would see in your standard moe fluff.  In terms of development, Kumiko, in simple terms, gets her instrumental spark reignited, the spark that encourages one who plays an instrument to do better, play better, and perform better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Kousaka Reina, Kumiko's middle school friend who is also a trumpet player.  From the start of the series, Reina's ideals are plastered on the idea of becoming special, becoming a better player and standing out from everyone else.  Representing that player in the band that never lets go of their instrument, Reina never lets go of that trumpet, and holds the brass instrument dearly, playing it even when there's no one else around.  While she doesn't particularly change all that much within the anime itself, she does spark some changes in other characters, creating her role to be more of that of a push onto other characters rather than herself.  She also makes her own contributions to the show in other different ways, but for the most part, she doesn't really change much herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Euphonium vary in terms of importance, but for the most part, all serve to represent different members of a concert band.  (Though Midori is a special case.  I don't remember having a double bass in MY band.)  While not all of the sections and their problems get featured within this anime, the supporting cast was still able to fill up the show's runtime with the various problems and issues that goes into participating in a band.  With every new group of characters, comes a different problem that needs to be resolved.  As a result, these characters are for the most part plot devices, but it works well for the show since you both learn about the character and progress through the story with every new change.  Still not a fan of Hazuki and Midori basically becoming the moe fluff of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good main protagonists\\n\r\n+ Actively utilized more of the band\\n\r\n+/- Side characters were mostly treated as plot devices\\n\r\n-  Some of the main characters were basically moe fluff\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.44/10 and 7.99/10): As usual with KyoAni's work, Hibike! Euphonium is a very high quality looking show that has a moe flair to it because that's really all KyoAni's been doing for the past couple of years.  As such, Euphonium has a very bright look to it, utilizing a bright and colorful color scheme that gives off this very glossy and refined look.  In addition, KyoAni puts a lot of attention to detail, seeing as how all of the instruments all look staggeringly great with the way they're animated and the attention to detail for each individual button, valve, and tube on the different woodwinds, brass, and percussion.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the character design is something that has to be noted for this show.  Rather than pointing out the main characters in the series by giving them a unique character design and making the other 50 members plain by comparison, the show does the opposite by giving each of band members a different character design which is something that has to be applauded all on its own because it makes each section feel more vibrant and adds to the fact that there're other characters aside from the main ones that have significance in the story.  Although, since this is KyoAni, the show is drawn in a moe artstyle where the girls look and act all cutesy, so if you're not a big fan of that, here's the warning.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, Euphonium provides us with a very big band and loud opening which is certainly an opening to remember.  It's an opening that is very brass heavy, just like all of the main characters in this show.  It's loud, it's proud, and its a pretty memorable piece.  On the other hand though, the ED doesn't really pose as much of a memorable feel as the ED does, but it still works to help the show in the soundtrack area.  (Also, there was a completely instrumental version of the opening in the ending credits of the show, and that was lovely to hear as well.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd because this is a show that is completely centered around the idea of making music, the fact that KyoAni was able to get these numerous sound bites in order to create the bits of music in the show in different qualities representing different things like an individual practice where someone misses a note, the altogether sound of the band, the solo, and even that trailoff of sound by random instruments that happens whenever the teacher stops in the middle of the piece to fix a mistake, all of these things are in the sound of the show which I find to be extremely impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, memorable OP\\n\r\n+ Fantastic, colorful artwork\\n\r\n+ Attention to sound detail\\n\r\n+/- Moe artstyle (This is good or bad depending on your tastes)\\n\r\n-  ED wasn't as memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.47/10): In the end, Hibike! Euphonium was a good watch.  While there were developments in show that felt a little forced on and sometimes kind of unneeded, I would say that this show encapsulated my experience in band.  (I was the 6th chair flute in middle school.  Didn't really enjoy always been told to play the second parts.)\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did.  While the story itself didn't always reflect a positive outlook from me, I still enjoy how the show represented the idea of band in animated form.  If nothing else, that was the better reason for me to continue watching this show, and I enjoyed it.  The characters in the show display progression in both their character and their playing right up to the date of their performance, which is also the fun in band, playing your hard learned piece with the precision and detail that you've been working hard in.  Also, I love Kumiko's character.  There are quite a few memorable scenes with her.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about the show?\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't really a big fan on how the show popped in a couple moe moments here and there.  It didn't really feel right with the show and I wasn't happy with some of the characters and their contributions, because they were the reason there were some of the more unfavorable plot developments within the series.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're someone that has participated in a band in your life, or you want to know how a high school band works, then Euphonium is the perfect anime for you.  The show completely encapsulates the idea of how a band functions, how a band progresses, and what kind of effort and work is needed in order to play wonderfully on that final concert stage.  To me, it reflected my experience in band to a tee, and it was great seeing that.  (Also, the trumpets ACTUALLY hold their bells up when they play!  My band's trumpet players NEVER did that!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.89/10",

Most of these issues include multiple episodes of drama from both sides of the party, and then a final episode when both parties have a single conversation that instantly resolves the issue. At least the show does a decent job developing these characters through these incidents, using the main character as a foil to rehash everything up until that point. Art is standard. Sound is slightly better than average, seeing as it's a show about music. Thereare some nice pieces thrown in there.

            "content": "I had a lot of hope for this anime and it not only disappointed me but also upset me. The premise of the series was promising and it offered characters and a plot I could relate to being about high school band and such. It was also produced by Kyoto Animation who did a phenomenal job as always with the animation and character designs. You\u2019ll still see me reblogging pictures and gifs of this series because-despite what I\u2019m saying now-I appreciate how much effort went into the presentation of this anime. My issue lies with the writing and character development because there is little tono substance there. I understand that you can only do so much in the span of a 12 episode series, but even so I felt that it introduced too many characters that were never fully developed. \\n\\n\r\nWhat started off as a series focusing on three friends (one of which learning about music and her instrument) became a pandering storm of yuri fanservice at the expense of developing Kumiko\u2019s (the MC\u2019s) character really at all. My main gripe however was that her two new friends were left in the background halfway through the series. As an audience member, I was happy to see Kumiko helping her \u201cfriend\u201d Reina, but I\u2019m biased towards hating unnecessary romantic subplots, ESPECIALLY when it takes over the series. After the semi-romantic tension is introduced between Kumiko and Reina, we barely ever see anything beyond the occasional glimpse of what Midori and Hazuki are doing besides just assisting the rest of the band. We\u2019ll see them sometimes slip in and help Kumiko or offer passive assistance but they back off and their presence isn\u2019t important to the story anymore. Why introduce these characters who both have confidence issues only to make them friends with a character too dense to give a care about them? It\u2019s honestly beyond me but it began to frustrate me as a viewer to see Kumiko (who was already a fairly shallow MC) begin to just pay no attention Midori and Hazuki. Meanwhile, Reina gets the most time on screen as Kumiko\u2019s supposed \u201clove\u201d interest. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem with this series does not lie in the fact that it has a semi-\u201dyuri\u201d love interest, (Yuru Yuri is one of my favorite shows) it\u2019s that it completely overhauls the show, takes it over, and rams whatever remaining plot and character development right into a brick wall. People honestly thought this show was Kyoto Animation\u2019s saving grace while bashing series like Hyouka, Beyond the Boundary, K-On!, and Chuunibyou for having shallow characters. If that\u2019s your opinion you\u2019re completely entitled to it, but I much prefer those series. What I dislike about Hibike! Euphonium was that it had so much potential and deep characters only to have them become a tiny little helping hand for Kumiko\u2019s shallow character who was too busy being a fanservice gateway to notice them anymore.",

It's open all night, so there's no hurry to leave. And if you needed to leave, where to? You look at your phone. A message from your friend asking to see you. It was received six hours ago. You didn't respond. You don't know why, you've known them for years. If you called them they'd head to where you are right now. You don't call. It's troubling for you, being so close to someone butfeeling so passable. They tell you all the time of your importance. You don't believe them. \\n\\n\r\nBut you want to.\\n\\n\r\n   We all want to believe them. We all want to think we are special. We are all getting older and we are all losing the chance to tell them we love them. We appreciate them. We want them around. Because once we are special, even to one person we've made it. We've sung our song.\\n\\n\r\n   It's incredible what a piece of work can do to a person. A show like this was never one I would jump to, but from the artwork I caved. What I stayed for was the pain. The pain of relating to the drag of normalcy. The pain of the dryness in the throat as we stand in front of the person we love, unable to speak. The pain of wishing for change, only to fall back into bad habits.\\n\\n\r\n   I never like giving out perfect scores. For one mans perfect is another's bane of existence. And it may be hard to understand how this review has anything to do with the show. But if I were told that a show could make you feel happy about feeling vulnerable, I may have watched this show sooner. I'm sure there's a flaw in the show that the searching will find, but what it succeeds at, what makes it worth watching is how the title speaks for itself. The euphonium is not what is speaking up. We are. We are the Sound!",

            "content": "When I was in high school I always wanted to be in a rock band, I played guitar and piano pretty frequently. However that opportunity never came because the school band was a more of an orchestra\\marching band and no one I knew shared my desire to be in rock band the same way I did. It was a pretty big letdown for me, high school in general wasn't all that exciting to be honest.\r\nBut ya know, don't let darkness consume you and other Yoda shit like that. So I ended up just moving on. Sound Euphonium (and in contrast K on) is a seriesthat I came to admire over the simple fact it that is was quite interesting to see how much effort goes into making music, the kind of diligence and passion that is required to be able to even think of getting good. \\n\\n\r\nThe character I enjoy the most is the main, Kumiko. Not necessarily is she the most interesting character or even the \"best\", but rather the one I relate to the most. I tend to develop an affinity towards characters whom remind me of others/things. Kumiko was a lot like myself in my high school days.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, what I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this one. My personal feelings and experiences are not the same for everyone else however, so there may be some of you who are looking for something nice to watch, something that requires your full attention as is the case with most KyoAni shows. Also if your a band geek.\\n\\n\r\nI give this recommendation a thumbs up to anyone who seems interested.\\n\r\nP.S All that is said here applies to the 2nd season as well.",

            "content": "update 6/30/2015\r\nHaving completed this series, this series breaks my heart in terms of plot.\r\nThere are SO many relationships that could be expanded on and there are so many stories left untold. I wish this was a multi-season 24 episode/season series\r\nHibike Euphonium is an anime that takes the same vein as K-ON! but with slightly better animation than K-ON! but has worse plot.\r\nAt the time of writing this review, the anime is not yet complete.\r\nHere's my tentative rating:\r\nArt--9.5-10 It's Kyoto Animation, and it's 2015. There's not much to complain about.\r\nSound/Music--9-10 The music is comprised of mostly classical. The Seiyuus, with an exception of a couple, havedone an excellent job\\n\r\nCharacter--~8-9 This sort of ties into the Story/Plot, but given the scope of this series (at least 20+ person concert band), and how the story gives just about everyone at least 1 scene, I feel like a lot of the characterization gets lost in the process. The 4 \"main\" heroines that we were introduced to in the beginning of the story are not the main focus at all, which can be nice, but it makes it so that we don't get very personal with all the characters\\n\r\nStory Plot--7-8 the plot is very badly paced. Even by KyoAni standards, it's badly paced. how, you ask? 1) there are at least 2 to 3 possible starting points for this anime, each of them could change the perspective of the viewer and possibly the outcome of the anime. 2) multiple characters and points in the anime leaves me wondering: what happened here? or i want to see the rest of it. 3) along the same veins, there are points where I kinda wished they got to the main points instead of dilly-dallying around the side. 4) we're now on episode 8, and I have no idea how this concert band is going where they want at this pace. It's like \"here's a couple episodes giving the outline, here's a couple fillers, and an obligatory episode, more fillers, etc\"\\n\\n\r\nkinda wish Kyoani actually tried with the plot of this anime.\\n\\n\r\noverall-8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation is back again to tailor to a new clique -- concert band. This time around, they have decided to shelf the swim-club fans of Free, the writers (And detectives?) of Hyouka, and the people that hang out at amusement parks way too much of Amagi Brilliant Park. Industry and KyoAni veteran, Tatsuya Ishihara, is back once again to direct this teen music drama. This show stays relatively inside the \"Safe zone\" for Ishihara and doesn't really bring out anything he hasn't already done before. (But that is to be expected when you have directed almost everything a studio has produced in the lastfifteen years). I basically watch Kyoto Animation productions out of obligation at this point. They become such a phenomenon so quickly and become virtually impossible to go a season without. But just because I watch them out of obligation doesn't mean I don't enjoy them -- in fact, most of the time they come out within my top 5 for the season. So when Sound! Euphonium was announced, I chalked it down and waited to see what the industry-giants had for us this time.\\n\\n\r\nSound! Euphonium gives us a glimpse into the lives of a few high-school band members, but focuses mainly on Kumiko Oumae, a first-year euphonium player -- an instrument so bizarre that auto-correct doesn't even recognize it. When Oumae joins the band at Kitauji High, she has no idea what she is getting into. That's all made clear relatively quickly though, when Noboru Taki steps in as the band's new instructor. Briefly after his introduction, he gives the band an ultimatum of some sort. They can either continue playing for fun, which is what they've been doing for years, or they could aim to improve themselves and try-out for the national competition. And after a vote which was not nearly as close as I expected it to be, the band decided it was time to step up to a challenge for the first time. Kumiko, being relatively indifferent toward which direction the band would go in, starts to question her decision on joining the band in the first place after she sees Reina Kousaka, one of the girls she was in band with just a year prior.\\n\\n\r\nSo now, in addition to the band practicing every day, we have the pre-existing kinship between Oumae and Kousaka that needs time to flourish and repair. And I say repair because the two had an altercation at the end of last year in which Oumae essentially consoled Kousaka and said it was okay that they didn't achieve a gold rating (Which would advance them to Nationals). Kousaka, being the fiery, motivated character she is, backlashed at Kumiko, telling her that Nationals basically meant everything to her. The two then go on to form one of the more interesting relationships of the season as they tend to their emotional wounds and learn more and more about one another, growing closer every episode.\\n\\n\r\nMy issue, as far as characters and relationships go, was that there wasn't ever enough time to care about the relationships apart from Kumiko and Reina. I don't know if that can be accredited to the fact that theirs simply out-shined the others, or if the others were just not good to begin with. We start to see these subplots that appear important for an episode or two, but then just wind up vanishing in less than an hour in total. For example, there is this whole thing with Hazuki (A new-friend of Kumiko's and novice tuba player) confessing her feelings to Kumiko's childhood friend Shuuichi (Who never really becomes important at all) that just seems out of place. It feels more like filler than actual plot or character development. Even the moments where the band was practicing were more emotionally-fueled than those occasions of unimportant romance or slightly-confused friendships. I'm not going to sit here and nitpick each one, but I will tell you that the only one that deserves your time would be the whole Oumae X Kousaka thing. Oh, and Midori X Contrabass -- but that's another story.\\n\\n\r\nSound! Euphonium is an example of how pacing can really diminish a series as a whole. For the first six episodes, I honestly did not care about anything in this show. There were all of these elements that seemed great when looked at individually, but none of them seemed to fit together. In a way though, this could be linked to the series in general. None of the band members seemed to mesh with one another at first. They needed time to grow closer and improve before becoming this high-school super-band. Even though this was probably not done intentionally, it's still an interesting theory and makes those unimportant and boring parts of the show feel more like much needed exposition. I just wish the whole thing could have been as good as the final arc -- which was probably the strongest of the season. And that's saying a lot considering it was up against shows like the newest seasons of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works and My Teenage Romantic Comedy SNAFU.\\n\\n\r\nBefore the wrap-up, there is one more important thing to note, that being pre-conceived hype for a series before it actually airs. For anything KyoAni makes, there is going to be mass-hysteria. The studio has become synonymous with works of art and very rarely lets anyone down. Notice how I didn't say \"Never\" lets anyone down. Sound! Euphonium is an example of how that is possible. Not everyone was happy with it, that's the honest truth. The season starts off incredibly slow and incredibly uninteresting. It was devoid of everything that makes KyoAni shows great until halfway through its course. It teaches us to not over-hype a series -- because something may appear great on the outside, but when you actually delve into it, there is a chance it might not be the final product that was expected. That mass-hype can really ruin a show for you if you aren't careful.\\n\\n\r\nSound! Euphonium is a light-hearted an enjoyable show once it gets past the first few episodes. The overall sound and production quality are stellar, but that is to be expected considering the studio that created it. The relationships apart from Kumiko and Reina are not necessary, but can still be enjoyed by the right crowd. The ending arc is one of the best of the year (So far) and even got me a little teary-eyed at points. Those last few episodes really create a memorable experience. It's the ride to those episodes that can really spoil the fun. If you were in concert band in high school, there is no doubt in my mind that you will absolutely adore this show. If you weren't though, there really isn't a strong reason for you to watch it.",

            "content": "(Heads up, this is a bit of a long one, but I felt the show really justified this discussion) \r\nAn unexpected delight, that\u2019s how I would summarise this anime. Time and time again, Kyoto Animation have shown themselves to be one of the greatest animating studios in Japan, but despite this I still go into shows like this expecting a moeblob. Boy was I wrong. Even for a Kyoto Animation show, Hibike Euphonium has set itself apart from their lineup through creativity and its sheer attention to detail. Let\u2019s see how exactly it does just that.\r\nHibike Euphonium is the story of a group of girlsin the school brass band, all working together to try to reach the nationals competition. So let me ask you something: Have you ever been in a band? If you have, you will really appreciate just how well replicated the band atmosphere is in Euphonium. For those not familiar though with being in a band, let me give you an idea. Bands are stressful, unpleasant environments. You can never work too hard, and you\u2019ll still never quite perfect the piece you\u2019re playing. But at the same time, there\u2019s a thrill in gradually building up little sections of the performance, and tying them all together to perform the piece to the best of your collective abilities. So if you\u2019re worried then that this brass band setting isn\u2019t really going to make for exciting anime, think again. Euphonium has all the joys and tension of a sports anime, but at the same time never exacerbates the band setting, and never tries to portray something that shouldn\u2019t really be there. It\u2019s realistic but at the same time damn exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOnwards then to the meat of the show, the characters and the story. There\u2019s a lot to be said about what Kyoto Animation has managed to do with these characters, because on the face of it, they\u2019re all not really that exciting. Adorable beyond words, I grant you that. But exciting? Not so much. Fans of the K-On style characters will find themselves right at home here, but you may find yourself disappointed with the more simple character archetypes that make up the cast. There\u2019s Kumiko, our determined and slightly sullen protagonist, accompanied by the exceedingly rambunctious Hazuki and the queen-of-all-things moe Midori (I couldn\u2019t care less that Midori is almost a carbon copy of Yui, because she is most lovable little button this side of the 2D world). Simple on their own, but together these characters have a lovely chemistry that makes the show just so pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOne very interesting character though is the slightly mysterious ice queen Reina. She mostly remains unexplored for the bulk of the anime, but proves herself to be a truly intriguing character towards the end of the anime (no doubt you\u2019ve seen already if you\u2019ve done any research on this show, but her relationship with Kumiko is a source of great ambiguity\u2026) Apart from that though she\u2019s also by far the most skilled musician in the band, and since she\u2019s only a first year this provides some of the friction between band members that occupies much of the story.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the story, it\u2019s really not too different to the classic sports anime formula: New kid on the block becomes part of a group, and together they work their way towards trying to win a competition, in this case the school brass band national finals. What is original though is just how well it works in the school band setting, just as well as in a sports anime, if not better. The large size of the band means there\u2019s inevitably in-fighting and drama aplenty (due in part to Reina as mentioned). Curveballs such as auditions and potential love interests amongst the band members provide the story material for individual episodes. But the overarching storyline is the band preparing for the competition in which they are undoubtedly the underdogs. You can really feel all the stress and tension in each character as they desperately prepare, and their actual performance itself in the final episode is a real crescendo if there ever was one. \\n\\n\r\nSo if the actual performance is the crescendo, then there must be some pretty good music right? Absolutely. The budget for this anime must have been phenomenal, because the quality of music performance in this anime is something straight out of a national orchestra. It\u2019s very well produced, and even if this sort of music isn\u2019t your thing you\u2019ll surely appreciate the obvious effort that has gone into making the music sound amazing. I\u2019m even tempted to say it\u2019s better than any school band could ever be able to perform (bit of a mistake there Kyoto Ani eh?).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019ll talk about the one piece of this Kyoto Ani show we all knew was going to be good: the animation. Needless to say they\u2019ve done it again with Hibike Euphonium, as it\u2019s really a fantastic showcase for the studio's talent. The locations, taken from real life Kyoto, are all beautifully replicated and full of detail. The instruments as well are works of art, especially when played because the music is perfectly synced to the animation of the instruments being used. My favourite little detail though has to be the individual music sheets. Each music book we see has these wonderful little annotations, such as particular sections to look out for, or small notes of encouragement, making them feel so personal they could easily have been real. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m waxing lyrical about this show because I think it\u2019s a fine example of what anime is really capable of. It\u2019s about larger than life characters such as Kumiko and Midori, who are appealing for being just so lovable, and are placed in an exciting and original setting that is full of drama and superbly animated. Before you are tempted to dismiss it as \u2018another Kyoto Ani moeblog\u2019, please for the love of all that is anime watch this show for yourself, I know you\u2019ll change your mind.\\n",

            "content": "I am usually not much a review-writer but this anime is surely underrated! Phew..\r\nHibike! Euphonium sits on the very pinnacle of my \"anime of the season\" list. If I have to pick one word to describe Hibike! Euphonium, I will choose \"beautiful\".\r\nThe story might not involved saving the world, flashy missions, or other typical heroic things. It is a very everyday thing, like many of KyoAni's masterpieces. Throughout the story, we closely follow Oumae Kumiko - the main protagonist. We wade through a life of a high school female student who tries to get a fresh start in her life, meet new friends, join theBrass Band, getting by in a club that sets what is a very unlikely goal (at first), dealing with her past, and experience how her character develops through every problem she bumps onto. Things we might stumbled upon in our own life.\\n\\n\r\nWait, what's the big deal, then? \\n\\n\r\nFor me, it's the detail.\\n\r\nI really love how Kyoto Animation pours all the details beautifully to present the story to us. How the characters move and act, how and when the music seeps in, how they set the layout, how very well drawn the anime is (characters, background, instruments, everything), how the voice actors sounds, when they cut the scenes, everything.\\n\\n\r\nTake some examples from minor scenes, how we can tell that Kumiko isn't so much delighted with how carefree Hazuki called her by her given name \"Kumiko\" and even worse, told Midori (Sapphire) to call Kumiko that way as well - just by seeing the dynamic on her expression. The other will be one moment when Kumiko went home late, very tired after an intensive practice. In the train on her way home, she checked to make sure that nobody was around then yawned widely, that her legs got slightly pulled up and her shoes messily slid off as if she's at her own home...then visibly tried to correct her manner after she spotted Reina watching from the other car - hiding her embarrassment. Kumiko didn't have to say a word. We just know. \\n\\n\r\nThose are minor scenes, but the details that KyoAni put beautifully describe what Kumiko felt. And we can find them everywhere throughout the episodes. As for important scenes, well..., I guess it goes without saying.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the effort in those details, I can very much grasp what the characters are feeling, the drive that made them did things, how each character's personality is - even most of the supporting characters. So that's also why I am very much cheering our main protagonist, who is refreshingly sarcastic (unlike typical protagonists out there) but kind and reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is a beautiful portrayal of life that - if not our own experience - might be actually happening somewhere around us right now.\\n\r\nIt's a complete package! \\n",

            "content": "If you're going to consider skipping this anime because you heard these statements from people such as:\r\n\"This anime is another moe\"\r\n\"This anime is a crappy slice of life\"\r\n\"This anime is K-On 2.0\"\r\n\"This anime is a K-On rip-off\"\r\nI'm warning you right now. DO NOT listen to the people who are making one of the statements above. The anime is nowhere near the statements that are made abo-...Hey, what the hell are you doing here? Get out of my room! Help!. \"I am now writing the review\" says jc9623, typing while putting jc9622 in his closet.\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nThe story starts off with Kumiko, a girl who was inthe concert band club in middle school, visits her high school's concert band club as a first year.\\n\r\nThis is another one of those anime that has a basic simple story except that this is one of the anime that has a simple story that turned out to be good.  \\n\r\nThe show focuses on characters struggling and trying to achieve their goal, their relationships, and some drama. I felt like the drama and emotional part was unnecessary. As a current member of a Concert Band (Percussionist), I find the drama that was inserted hilarious. The fact that they feel sad or they cry because they're not in sync with the whole band. The fact that they feel sad because they can't play some bars right. The fact that one of the girls was crying because her \"senpai\" did not get to play the solo.  I find them hilarious. Other than the unnecessary drama, the story is great. \\n\r\nFor a 12 episode series, I'm quite surprised that they decided to set the story pacing to slow. I'm not saying it's bad.. They actually managed to make it work. The ending however, felt like a cliffhanger to me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe anime had an outstanding animation which shouldn't come as a surprise since this is year 2015. The details on buildings, roads, and even the instruments are spot on. The lighting is very well done and the character design is also very well done. Although, what bothered me a little is literally every single character's cheek has a shiny red blush and their tears don't look like tears at all. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is an anime that focuses on music (mainly concert band music) and it needs to have a great or outstanding soundtrack. They didn't fail on the soundtrack, thank god. The concert band pieces were very well done and it also had an \"attention to details\". I can literally hear the mistakes and mess-ups these band members make before the teacher tells them to stop and tells them their mistakes. The opening soundtrack called \"Dream Solister\" is one of the best OP soundtracks I've heard. The instruments on the background along with the singer's beautiful voice, my god I'm in heaven.  I don't know about the ED soundtrack since I just skip it every episode. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10)\\n\r\nThere is a lot of characters in the series. I think there's over 55 of them? I thought the anime would just focus on the main characters and throw aside the remaining supporting characters but they didn't. There wasn't a lot of focus on the supporting characters but it was enough for me to actually understand them and probably like them. The show did give the main characters a great character development. Mostly Kumiko and Kousaka. You'll see a major change between Kumiko and Kousaka by the time you start watching this series and by the time you have finished watching this series. There is one character that I like and that is Asuka. There is something about her that made her one of my favourite characters. Is it her glasses? Her personality? The way she jokes around? Or maybe the fact that she also uses another language (mostly English) to make her a little bit cooler. I guess I'll never know and you won't too. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nBy the time I started watching this anime, I knew I would enjoy it. By the time I finished the anime, I did enjoy it and I wanted more! I will watch the anime again if it comes out in English Dub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10) \\n\r\nOverall, the anime is a great slice of life anime and fun to watch. It didn't get a masterpiece from me because of the unnecessary drama. They need to learn that drama will not work on a musical anime genre because it just turns out to be so cheesy. This was also one of my negatives in K-On. It just didn't work. I'm also glad that there isn't a lot of fanservice considering that this is an all-girls(mostly) cast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n-Great Story\\n\r\n-Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n-Outstanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Attention to details for both Animation and Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Great Characters\\n\r\n-Great Character Development\\n\r\n-Supporting characters weren't ignored\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Cheesy Drama moments\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"I want to improve.\"\r\nAt first, I had no idea what Hibike! Euphonium (aka Sound! Euphonium) was going to be. I thought it would be another generic clubroom comedy with instruments and music taking the back seat. But I was wrong. At its core, Hibike is about working together to achieve greatness, but also about finding yourself and what you want to achieve. This is Hibike! Euphonium, an anime about a high school concert band and its struggle to become the best in Japan. Now, let us begin the review.\r\nStory (8): The story begins with our main character Kumiko transitioning into high school, wanting to startover without having to worry about band like she did in middle school. However, when her new friends decide to join the school band (which sucks, by the way), she lets herself be dragged along, only to find that things there are much worse than she ever could have imagined. Everyone says they want to be the best concert band in Japan, but actually, they just want to have fun and make good memories. Which isn't bad in itself, but no one wants to commit to either choice. Like Kumiko, they want someone to decide their lives for them, so they go with the flow instead of making things happen for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that stands out to me about Hibike's story is that it addresses a common problem in band: apathy. Usually, you have stronger players who are genuinely interested in making great music and practice hard every day, but you also have players who kind of sit back and don't put much effort in at all. I think many people know what it's like to have a team with someone who doesn't pull their weight. Hibike is a relatable and refreshing take on concert band, being unique in that I can't name another anime that deals with concert band as well as this one.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): Do I even need to say anything here? The animation is by Kyoto Animation and the backgrounds are gorgeous. The character designs are cute, but not in a way that feels cheap and forced. Another thing worth mentioning is that all the background characters are animated and have as much life to them as the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): What I find amazing about the sound is that an experienced instrumentalist can pick out the different sounds/strengths/weaknesses of a particular piece. I play the trumpet, and I really enjoy being able to see the fingerings, listen to the tone, and hear the instrument along with a band. The effort required to put together so many music samples paid off, making the band seem more real and more alive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): Considering how many characters there are, you would expect Hibike to neglect a lot of them and push them to the side, but this season gives you just enough information to care about them and want more. For the sake of time, I'll just say that Kumiko's transformation into a passionate, talented euphonium player feels believable and well earned. The other players also have significant development, with notable examples being Natsuki and Haruka. The only problem? I need mooore. In particular, I'm very curious as to why Asuka behaves the way she does.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (9): If you read all the way here, I'll say that Hibike is definitely worthy of a 10 right now, but I will revise the review once a second season arrives (it better). Also, Kumiko and Reina better be a thing. But that's my opinion. Anyway, I fully recommend trying this series and I had a lot of fun with it! For anyone interested in watching/re-watching the series, here's a game: follow one \"background\" character in the band for the whole anime. I loved seeing the drill-haired trombone player (with the sass) and the lipstick-wearing saxophone player (gotta adjust my skirt).\\n\\n",

            "content": "I went into this expecting a show about music. Instead, what I got was some high school drama. While this adds realism to the experiences of the characters, I didn't feel that we had learned enough about the drive (or lack thereof) of the characters themselves -- aside from Kumiko - to care. I was longing for a reason each character we focused on was there, to learn more about them. While this does portray a high school band, and generally speaking a lot of band members in high school who don't find that passion or drive end up dropping out of it, the annoying(or downright bullshit) drama outweighed the actual character development.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, however, I don't agree with some people's ideas that Kyoto Animation did a \"wash-rinse-repeat\" of \"K-On!;\" the story here seems more grounded, and focuses different thematic elements than just a few club members bonding and how those relationships change them over time. Instead, this group of bandmates are working towards the goal of nationals -- something that \"brings them all under one roof\" in a different way and dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was stunning, as to be expected. It highlighted all the right contrasts, especially when it came to the instruments, without being too flashy or oversaturating.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the music was somewhat forgettable. This is one of the big mistakes that reflects the show's attitude towards music. I want to be engulfed in the score and have the characters do the same; instead I got repetitive instances of one selection, and the OST didn't help to alleviate that. I felt both the OP and ED were good.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, though I understand the paralleling motivations behind certain thematic decisions, I believe the show would have been much stronger focusing more on the characters, rather than the general ripple of drama around them. I can only hope for a change in this for Season 2.",

            "content": "First time doing a review so be gentle with me. This is done based on the first 11 episodes and will have minimal spoilers.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story in this anime flows rather coherently with a couple of unexpected story developments.  The anime presents the \"Everyone working together towards a common goal\" plot line quite carefully paced and does not seem rushed at any point (Though I can't say for sure regarding the last few episodes). Considering there being only 1-2 episodes left, it would be nicer if the series spanned slightly longer and they show more of the progress leading up to the actual day.The anime has multiple truly heartwarming moments and manages to cut off at the right moments, leaving viewers yearning for the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nFantastic art, though not on the \"Fate/stay night unlimited blade works\" level. I love the animation and art in this series as it really manages to bring out the emotions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  10\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime with music as it's basis, the sound definitely plays an intrinsic role in the series as a whole. Thankfully, the production team managed to record sounds of the band seamlessly and performances in the series really immerse the viewer/listener. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\\n\r\nOne particular aspect of the anime I like is how un-cliched it has seemed until this point. Romance between characters is subtle and enjoyable- though some dialogue may have proved vague in expressing character sentiments. (Particularly in the Reina and Kumiko relationship). As this is a 1-cour anime, they've fit the most character development I think they've possibly could and it's turned out quite wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\\n\r\nIt's the sort of anime you stay up till 3am to watch. That should suffice to convey the enjoyment of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:9",

            "content": "Ok, so there are quite a few reviews on Hibike! Euphonium which are quite long, so I wanted to make my review pretty short and concise. With as little additional, unnecessary information as possible. \r\nDon't get discouraged by its length, majority of it is just spacing. \r\nNote, this anime is extremely nostalgic if you have a long experience in being in school concert bands. For me, I could really relate to some of the experiences and events that happen. \r\nI'll start with a quick plot summary as to not spoil too much of the story, which for me had quite a few twists. \r\nPlot Summary\r\nMainCharacter Kumiko joins a not musically known high-school to avoid accidentally meeting up with Reina, a girl who she had disagreements with at her old school.\\n\\n\r\nSo there is no surprise when Reina is actually at Kumiko's chosen school and they both join the high school's concert band. \\n\r\nFrom then the characters go through the usual highschool events, love, disagreements with other characters, etc, etc.\\n\\n\r\nI won't rate the story as to not give any hints that could spoil it. \\n\r\nBut I will comment this.\\n\r\nOn a deeper level, the story is about the main character discovering and reawakening her love for music. \\n\r\nBut again, that's my personal opinion, so take it for what you may. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOutstanding KyoAni styled art. All characters look vivid and great.\\n\r\nNothing much to say here, just watch the anime and see. Obviously if you dislike KyoAni's art style then you'll rate this lower.\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nKyoAni usually gives all of its works a great soundtrack and Hibike! Euphonium is no exception.\\n\r\nBoth opening and endings sound excellent and don't deviate from the theme of high school concert music.  \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI might have to go on a tangent here and write more than usual.\\n\\n\r\nMain Cast:\\n\r\nKumiko: The main character, whole show revolves around her high school band experience and how it changes her. \\n\\n\r\nReina: The catalyst to Kumiko's change in perception towards music and actually trying hard and being 'special'. Slight Yuri love interest but KyoAni won't let the ship set sail.\\n\\n\r\nMidori and Hazuki, at times I feel that certain supporting characters have more impact than these two. But I guess they help and encourage Kumiko down her journey. Hazuki is new to music while Midori is a veteran at the contrabass Cello/Double Bass.\\n\\n\r\nSecondary Supporting:\\n\r\nAsuka: While Asuka doesn't directly have impact on major events in the show, she does subtly affect Kumiko by being a fellow euphonium player and a senpai.\\n\\n\r\nAoi: For me, Aoi represents a future Kumiko who didn't meet up and reconcile with Reina, etc. She would lose her fuel and drive and quit playing. \\n\r\nHence her role in the show was to show Kumiko a possibility of the future.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki: Her role is quite similar to that of Aoi but in Natsuki's case she revives her desire and love for music, however it is too late for her. \\n\\n\r\nKaori: Slight antagonist along with supporting character Yuuko. Contests Reina for soloist position. Again, she helps reignite Kumiko's desire to be special through her own desire. \\n\\n\r\nHaruka: The captain of band, she plays minor roles in the majority of important events. \\n\\n\r\nWith notable mentions to Taki-Sensei, who is basically the catalyst for all events in the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall + Personal Enjoyment. \\n\r\n9.5-10\\n\r\nA solid anime from KyoAni with no major flaws. Definitely one to put in your list to watch if you're a KyoAni slice of life fan. \\n\\n\r\nP.S: 2nd Review, hope I did ok.",

            "content": "All my reviews are spoiler free aimed towards people who haven't seen the show.\r\n Hibike! Euphonium, thank you Based KyoAni for this spectacular anime.\r\nStory: Kumiko Oumae and her band mates eagerly await the results of their Junior High prefectural competition. Although getting a Gold, they were not selected to represent their perfecture in the national comp. Kumiko is happy to do as well as they did, her bandmate Reina Kousaka on the other hand, is nearly a wreck with disappointment. Immediately the tone is set for what is sure to be a winding emotional road for not only Kumiko, but everyone that she meets alongfirst year at Kitauji High School. Kumiko chose Kitauji because it was the only school who had the cute sailor uniforms she loves so much, that and the fact that she didn't know anybody that was enrolling. This was her chance to start fresh, leave whatever stress and regrets she had behind her, and make a new path in the direction she wants to go. Upon hearing the concert band for new students on the first day of class, Kumiko states and I quote, \"they suck\". Hazuki Katou introduces herself to Kumiko and quickly befriends her and another girl by the name of Midori. After some banter and discovering Midori played in band as did Kumiko and Hazuki had intentions to join, they decide to listen in on the practice. When who just so happens to walk into the band room after them? Why Kumiko's old bandmate Reina Kousaka of course. According to Kumiko she was an exceptional trumpet player and could have chosen a school with a much better rep and history of a strong concert band. So.... why here? Why waste that talent knowing this school had a poor performing concert band? \\n\\n\r\nStory cont: Kumiko decides against joining the concert band at first, she was supposed to turn a new leaf, but after seeing the excitement of Hazuki who is a newbie and Midori who loves the contrabass, she's figures, why not, at least it could be fun. She can even act like she never played euph and try a new instrument. This years concert band is getting a new instructor, Taki Noboru. Not much is know about Taki-sensei, except this is first year as a school instructor. He asks the students to set their own goals, \"Do you want to make your goal for the year going to nationals? Or would you rather make good memories? Either is acceptable, but your decision will affect how I will instruct this band.\" As if not really understanding the seriousness of their decision, the students elect to aim for nationals. The unconventional and harsh lessons cause the students to become disgruntled. Can Taki-sensei turn this failing concert band into a ensemble to be recognized? Or will the previous turmoil that caused the low body count and lack of discipline in the second and third years prove to be a loss cause?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Kumiko has long record with the euph. She has a bad habit of saying what she thinks out loud without any hesitation, which more than often puts her in awkward situations. Reina takes her playing very seriously, as is shown with her talent at the trumpet. She's rather cold and isn't very personable with her peers. Her reasons for enrollment at Kitauji are unknown. Hazuki is very energetic and a newbie in band. She struggles learning the in's and out's of picking up an instrument. Shuuichi is a childhood friend of Kumiko's, he gets caught up in a triangle/unrequited love. Asuka is an eccentric and charismatic girl. Her attitude and leadership qualities make her popular among the other members, but her charade makes her personal thoughts hard to read. Haruka is the band president, she's rather shy and anxious. She feels like she was pushed into being the pres doesn't have everyone's respect because Asuka turned it down. And struggles with the pressure to keep things together. Kaori is a popular third year trumpet player. Reina's skill as as first year causes friction between Kaori's struggle for her own acceptance, as well as a second year who despises Reina because of this. Aoi is another friend of Kumiko's. A third year who struggles to balance her studies and band. Her actions shake up not only Kumiko but Haruka as well. And there's more! Each student feels pressure and fatigue of trying their best to find themselves while achieving a unlikely goal together.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:Stunning! Everything was gorgeous. The character design, the shine of the instruments, the reflection of the lake, the glow of the street lights, the cherry blossoms blowing in the breeze, movements of the characters, and position of scenes, then there was the performances! It was a joy at every minute just to view. KyoAni at it's best!!\\n\\n\r\nSound:Fantastic. Not only did we get some sweet Jap Ska from the Kitauji Quartet. But the choice of songs during the scenes were wonderful as well. Then their was the pieces played in the ensemble. Jacques Offenbach - Orpheus in the Underworld Overture, RYDEEN - YMO, Antonin Dvorak - New World Symphony,  Sato, Kunihiro - Walk down the Spring Path March, a wonderful original piece for the anime by  Akito Matsuda called Crescent Moon Dance that was incredible among some others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:Very much enjoyed this. So much good foreshadowing, with bits and  pieces given in flashbacks that portray a great deal depth into Kumiko's thoughts without really spelling them out. The relationship and interactions between various characters were always interesting and believable. A decent amount of comedy, some romance that wasn't really cheesy, and drama that wasn't forced or exaggerated on. I love all the story that's here. Every character has depth and there are so many little clues about their lives hidden in fine detail. I thought this show was pure brilliance. KyoAni way to bust out of your funk with this gem! 9/10",

            "content": "Who knew that English class would actually help me in a Japanese anime?\r\nThere is so much subtle character development going on that people who usually watch shallow fighting anime (like me) would think that this sucked.\r\nAt first, I only watched this for the art. Yes, it was so amazing that I couldn't watch any anime e.g. Fullmetal Alchemist during the same week, because of the clear overpowering art of this one. 10/10\r\nThe story was decent at first; it was pretty generic (some people using teamwork to get a goal). But then, I felt as if I was missing something. I rewatched it, and noticed howall of the character development going on. It was like putting my head under water in a coral reef for the first time. Hint: watch how Kumiko's physical spacing with particular people change over time. It's actually important to the story. And yes, KyoAni has worked to that extent on bringing the story into the animation. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is really catchy, especially the op and the ending. I even have the op band version as my ringtone. The band songs they played are also really good. (did you know that they were made specifically for the anime?) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are basically the story. This show is way more about the characters than the plot. It's the characters, in fact, which are the plot. And each one of them is developed very well, even the useless-ish Midori. Reina and Kumiko are by far, the best though. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: WATCH IT! If you have never seen anime, WATCH IT! If you have seen anime, WATCH IT!\\n\r\nThe only people who I do not recommend to watch are those who aren't too interested in literature which requires thinking\\n\r\ne.g. Hunger Games, Sword Art Online don't require too much thinking",

            "content": "I don't know what's with KyoAni lately, but they keep undershooting my expectations. KnK had shitty writing, Free2 was riddled with melodrama and both it and Chuuni overstayed their welcome, Amagi Brilliant Park was the fanservicey kind of nonsense I'd expect JC Staff to pick up, and Hibike Euphonium was kinda boring, despite not having bad writing and production. It was really great at first, but then it never picked up the pace. I know I said I wished K-On had more actual music, but applying this to orchestral music here didn't really do anything for me. Each time show dealt with actual music andpractice I just wanted it to skip to the character development, conflict and drama instead, or even random comedy gags. Didn't think I'd see the day when I'd call the music in KyoAni show mediocre. I don't hate orchestral, nor do I particularly like it, but I do love modern orchestral. And this wasn't modern at all, and I feel it would have benefited from it. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the actual story goes, there's nothing to talk about, as it's LN based and suffers from being underdeveloped and unfinished. We met some characters, learned about their relationships, there was some ship tease, some drama, half of which was okay, half of it meh, then there was a lot of practicing and a concert finale and... that's it really, nothing touching, nothing memorable, nothing engaging or compelling, at least to me. There wasn't enough conflict, and what conflict there was most often felt petty. I suppose it was a story about trying really hard, but that theme has been so overdone by shounens that I'm kinda tired of it, and Euphonium doesn't really make a compelling case for it. It's just okay regardless of how I look at it. \\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the show is that it had some characters that were really really great, namely Kumiko, Reina and Asuka, which pretty much carried the show. I also loved the way Noboru was portrayed, but I can't help feeling his character wasn't explored enough to realize its potential. Kumiko-Reina relationship was by far my favorite part of Euphonium, so not having any of that really resolved by the end felt rather disheartening. Overall, an okay show is not what I would expect from KyoAni.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMost people might think going through school is \u201conly\u201d to get an education. That is well and good, and indeed the major purpose. Accruing years of knowledge makes someone more well-rounded and capable as a person, more so than not learning the \u201cABCs,\u201d integrals of calculus, or the implications of the American Civil War. A smaller reason, but one that is just as important, is a bit more personable: providing motivation. Schooling houses mentors in the form of advisers, teachers looking to instill long-lasting lessons, and professors that give impossible opportunities, who all want nothing morethan to make their students shoot for the stars. Hibike! Euphonium shows that motivation is not easy to come by \u2013 this is partly why education requires so much time and effort \u2013 but once it is obtained, the need and the want to reach new heights never leaves.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nEuphonium (as it will be known from here on out) stars Kumiko Oumae, a girl finally entering high school. Growing up, she had always played the euphonium, and as fate would have it, the same path is followed. This time, however, the situation is slightly different.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime does well throughout the entire season is maintain a leveled approach to the drama that it concocts and the themes that it focuses on. Given the setting, the goals, and the motifs of the anime, the narrative consistently raises problems that fall in-line with these facets, providing drama that is not only contextually relevant but also manageable in doses. Events like the discord manifested between the students and their instructor, the loss of band members, and the pseudo-rivalry that ensues are neither weighty nor weak in the emotions they provide. Instead, the middle ground they reach envelopes the audience, allowing for the show to be less about trying to make the viewers understand what is going on and more about having them feel the gravity of the situations depicted.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the drama of Euphonium gives its theme of motivation a foundation with which to build off of. Motivation is nearly inherent; people act all the time but not without a push or shove coming first. It might be something physical, like an accident having the victim realize his or her mortality, or visiting a conference that inspires a goer to follow the same route. There is also the mental portion, where past transgressions cause someone to move beyond their past self or a relationship shared with another instills the wherewithal to do something more. In the anime\u2019s case, it delves into both areas \u2013 the physical and the mental \u2013 to showcase exactly what motivation is and what it can do. There are moments like Kumiko\u2019s nighttime trek up a mountain with Reina (physical) and Yuuko\u2019s fervent desire to see Kaori succeed (mental) that demonstrate the power that is motivation. There are even scenarios where a mix of the two sides occurs; the final ensemble is a culmination of the various students\u2019 aspirations, the end result of the motivation they acquired. There, the desire to win and the immense amount of practicing they took part in coalesces, with the conclusion mirroring the start. That is, it is motivation that causes one to move forward, from a band of misfits to a full-fledged band, from dud to pure gold.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the anime\u2019s tale is not impeccable. There are minor grievances in the execution of the previous band\u2019s difficulties \u2013 the problem they faced is not as dire as the show makes it out to be \u2013 and Kumiko\u2019s small side story involving her older sister is not utilized to the fullest extent \u2013 it is alluded to at times, but it never influences the dealings at hand. While these are minor issues, it keeps the overall narrative from attaining the perfection it sought.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s strongest aspect is undoubtedly the mood that it constantly generates. Mood in this sense is not necessarily the feelings established between the characters but the overall vibe that is created to surround the narrative and the audience. To achieve its moods of dreariness, uncertainty, love, and many others over the course of the season, Euphonium makes expert use of everything at its disposal. The lighting creates shadows while simultaneously giving characters gentleness and guidance; the camera placement is filled with flair and focus; and the coloring manages to be both apt and appropriate to create the perfect mood for any occasion. Alongside the beautiful backgrounds and the varying shot compositions, the anime is a spectacle to behold, both visually and mood-wise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs likewise find polish, from Natsuki\u2019s cool ponytail to Sapphire\u2019s childish looks to even Taki-sensei with his sweater, glasses, and frazzled hair. Mainstays like Kumiko with her medium-length, fluffy hair is cute whereas Reina\u2019s jet-black hair and sparkling purple eyes paint her as the beauty that she is. Asuka\u2019s red glasses giving her an air of superiority, Kaori\u2019s beauty mark to make her more womanly, and Hazuki\u2019s short hair and clip that provides her with higher prettiness are further examples of the anime\u2019s care towards the cast\u2019s designs.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains above average no matter what the show sets out to do. Small nuances like the movements of lips or the adjustment of a hair tie and the high amount of attention placed on the characters actually playing their instruments have the anime always animating from start to finish without a dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nJust below the mood-setting that Euphonium expertly crafts are the characters that traverse the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most interesting person out of the entire cast is Asuka. Known for her affable personality, leadership skills, and prowess on the euphonium, she is held in high regard by both her peers and her juniors. Yet she isextremely passive, unbearably so. The reason for her wanting to keep the \u201cstatus quo\u201d in terms of the relationships she holds is quite intriguing because of how simple it is. By her not taking sides in the conflicts that pop up around her, she effectively, in a rather unintuitive brand of thinking, remains in favor on all sides. She refrains from getting involved in even her closest friends\u2019 hardships, not because she cannot handle such problems \u2013 it is evident through her base capabilities that she is more than able to help \u2013 but because she wishes to keep herself out of scrutiny and in obscurity. It is not so much that she is acting selfish or looking to solely further her own goals but rather she does not want to influence anyone else\u2019s. In this manner, she indirectly aids her own motivations without coming off as a \u201cbad guy\u201d in anyone\u2019s eyes, keeping her on the pedestal she is placed upon. She is a fascinating character because of her strange yet relatable approach to people, marking her as one of the best Euphonium has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOther notable characters are Kumiko and Reina. On their own, each girl is respectable, but it is the dynamic they share that is incredibly strong. Reina is someone who embodies motivation; she believes herself to be the best and therefore strives to make this known. Kumiko, at the other end of the spectrum, has no such motivations. Right from the beginning it is apparent how unsure of herself she is \u2013 despite playing the euphonium for years, she tries (and fails) to select another instrument to play. As the plot progresses, Kumiko continues to keep to herself, mostly going along with the flow instead of driving onwards. It is not until her mountain climb with Reina, the girl who completely contrasts with her mentally, that she begins to change. She starts to play harder, she cries when she loses, and she encourages her fellow band mates; the motivation she always needed was provided through her bond with Reina.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, Reina receives help, too. For her, she had been perceived as the \u201codd one out.\u201d Without friends and without connections, caused by her distant behavior, she finds in Kumiko a similar kind of demotivation. In other words, Reina is not interested, not motivated, to make connections with others similar to how Kumiko was not motivated to achieve greatness. Thus, Reina finds friendship in Kumiko, and from then on, Reina\u2019s actual self is perceived through Kumiko. She is not quite as composed as she comes off as being, she likes to have fun, and she is sincere in the feelings she holds, all of which is witnessed because Kumiko was there to (in Reina\u2019s words) \u201cpeel away\u201d the trumpet player and get at the person hiding inside. In this case, opposites attract, making them the perfect coupling.\\n\\n\r\nSomething esoteric yet very profound that many of the characters are affected by is the symbolism of the instruments they play. The cast do not have their specific instruments just to play them; rather they expound on who they are as people, becoming representative of the messages they are meant to disclose. Looking at the tuba, it is a device that requires a lot of lung capacity. Furthermore, it is described as an instrument that one simply likes for what it is and nothing more. To that end, the tuba symbolizes love \u2013 it leaves one breathless while also needing no explanation. Simultaneously, the characters who play this instrument \u2013 Hazuki, Gotou, and Riko \u2013 are each people who partake in this emotion, either with or without success.\\n\\n\r\nThis type of symbolism can be applied to the euphoniums, too. How does one describe this instrument? It is a tuba and trumpet mixed into one, with a size that is neither big nor small. In other words, it is rather unique, much like the people who play it. Asuka\u2019s neutrality and Kumiko\u2019s often impersonal honesty are traits that make them different from everyone else. Even Natsuki\u2019s personality of reliance and coolness is not what one would \u201cexpect\u201d of someone in an orchestra, making her place among the euphoniums not out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThere is even more symbolism to be had. The trumpet is an instrument known for its resounding notes. Thus, those that play it \u2013 Reina, Yuuko, and Kaori \u2013 are just as impassioned in their own, respective ways. Sapphire plays the contrabass, a massive instrument that contrasts with her small stature. But it captures her \u201clarger than life\u201d outlook, with her unending positivity and optimism, in beautiful fashion. Such symbolism is instrumental in making these characters, the mains and the sides, more than the sum of their parts, ultimately leading to a cast that is powerful individually, together, and anywhere in-between.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a great track, filled with power not only because of the orchestra that backs it but also because the vocalist does an exceptional job in terms of range and note-holding. The ending theme is not quite as powerful, but its upbeat nature and catchiness allows it to stand out from the rest of the music Euphonium has at its disposal.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the soundtrack, it is mostly filled with \u201ceveryday\u201d pieces like \u201cOboro ge na Genzai\u201d and \u201cToushin Dai no Hibi.\u201d The single best track is \u201cUnmei no Nagare,\u201d with its slow piano and eventual violins that create a captivating piece filled to the brim with emotion. Many other tracks, like the art and animation, aid in establishing the mood; \u201cIshiki no Houga\u201d is ambient and mysterious, giving its sections a more inspiring feel. It is a wonderful OST that does what it sets out to do and more.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the anime is somewhere between average and above average. A special shout-out is deserved for Tomoyo Kurosawa for giving a splendid performance as a relative newbie in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIf you happen to know my preferences, then me saying that I preferred all of the \u201cyuri\u201d shipping that became possible between Kumiko and Reina should not be a surprise. Indeed, that is probably one of my favorite parts of the anime, which is funny because not only is it not canon but it also is not even the \u201cpoint\u201d of the show itself. I also have this one to thank for giving me yet another opportunity to improve my writing once more; my piece on how anime go about setting the right mood was only possible because of this one\u2019s existence.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, looking back on it all, I cannot say I really liked it. The characters are not that enthralling, the themes do not fully resonate with me, and I never found myself moved to the point of happy or sad tears. It was a very mellow ride, despite the technical success that the anime managed to achieve. A second season might shift my thinking but for now the series will stay as only slightly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium does quite a lot right, from the mood that it creates through its visual direction to the characterization of the people it focuses on. While it is not the most enjoyable of anime, its motivational story and the music it incorporates more than make up for any boredom encountered. At this point, it is safe to say that Kitauji High School\u2019s piece most certainly deserves to go on.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, leveled drama, with a nice theme of motivation throughout, but minor plot points are not as purposeful as they were designed to be\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, mood-setting cinematography, nice art style, nice character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Asuka is very interesting, Kumiko and Reina\u2019s dynamic provides comparisons and contrasts, and the symbolism of the instruments adds further insights\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great OP, great ED, very nice soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, the \u201cyuri\u201d shipping was fun as was my essay on the show, but nothing from the anime resonated with me\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

The development of the main cast, specially on the main character, was amazing. It's rare to see that many character grow so much on such short slice of life. What's more, since there's so many people, almost every viewer can relate with someone.\r\nIt'scommon to have music with competition, but what was done here was more a mix of music with sport. And this was great as well.\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the anime, I found out one of the reason it was so great. It's an adaptation of a novel, not a light novel.

            "content": "In an industry filled with idol and slice-of-life shows with just a pinch of music, it takes balls to go back to the basics, to actually pursue a less-tread path when the alternative has such a big and influential audience. Hibike Euphonium, however, is willing to take that path. But is its execution up to snuff? Yes. It is.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Hibike Euphonium begins with the crushed dreams of one girl and the reemergence of another. From there, the protagonist Kumiko and her new friends join the band club, which has recently undergone some big changes. From the very beginning, the show lets you knowwhat you\u2019re in for: a show about characters overcoming their challenges to play music. It tries not to dwell on the personal, miniscule problems that plague the girl\u2019s daily lives, but rather what stops them from being their very best. Despite the plot being very character driven, there is a clear direction in the progression, with occasional odd but at the same time necessary deviations. The pacing of the story is usually at a quicker clip, with events and backstories coming and going, not overstaying the welcome for the most part. A few episodes seemed to drag with pointless dialogues about cutesy-things and what not, but the show as a whole executes what it sets out to do quite well, portraying a thorough and believable story of personal growth in the face of challenges.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no review is complete without mention of the ending and it is, without a doubt, one of the best endings I\u2019ve seen to a show. The emotions are right, the tension is there, the music brings forth emotion, and while the final outcome is predictable, the journey to get there and the execution, how it even echoes the beginning in a sense, is a lot better than I thought it would be. It really shows how far everyone has come from their beginnings, leaving a sweet optimism in the minds of viewers. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of the work is crisp and clean, with nice lighting and (usually) well-placed camera shots. It give the sounds of the band life and meaning especially, allowing both visual and auditory stimulation to combine to form a well executed final product. The character designs are not needlessly otherworldly, but they also aren\u2019t just carbon copies of other characters. Personalities match appearances, and the setting, while ordinary, is brought to life with discipline and dedication to the kind of atmosphere the show aims to create.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nOf course, an anime about music is nothing without a good score. To start of, I must give credit to studio for portraying mistakes as well as triumphs. That\u2019s a line that I feared would not be as honestly toed as it was when I first started this anime, but the show\u2019s message includes the values of hard work. In other words, these kids aren\u2019t prodigies, which is refreshing. Now, the music itself, both the BGM and the actually played songs, fit with the moods of the various scenes, bringing an extra layer them. The voice actors are also exceptional. The beautiful OP has a building intensity that shadows the show\u2019s own plot progression, making it a very well made one. Unfortunately, the ED, while catchy in its own right, hearkens back to the few errors that the show makes when it temporarily forgets what it does well and focuses more on the \u201ccute girls doing cute things because we like money\u201d sort of thing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast as whole is pretty large and even if you only could the ones in the center, there are still 5+ characters. Unafraid of the sizable cast, the show is able to properly introduce characters that are imperfect and seek to better themselves in some way or get their priorities straight. Everyone at least tries to move on in this show. Some of the developments are more significant than others (Kumiko\u2019s two best friends\u2019 struggles weren\u2019t particularly interesting to watch, as they were punctuated by the typical boy troubles of the show\u2019s less-serious brethren) but others, such as Nakaseko, Kousaka and Kitamura, deal with their problems and don\u2019t hold the plot back and, if anything, drive it forward. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDespite my apparent high-praise, I didn\u2019t really love this show in its entirety. I saw the quality it had to offer and I saw that it was as a whole very well built anime. But this show isn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea. I wouldn\u2019t watch it all again, although there are some moments I would definitely rewatch (the ending, for one). However for those of you who are looking for a more serious music show or just want a nostalgia shot of high school band experiences, this is your show. I think people should be willing to give it a chance, especially if you a fan these kind of shows, but it is not a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWith a music-focused plot, beautiful visual, nice musical values, and awe-inspiring characters, Hibike Euphonium is a very good show. However, it is not perfect, as it still has the ghosts of the more-superfluous school-shows breathing down its creative neck, as seen in some of the female characters. It\u2019s worth a firm recommendation, surely, but unless you really dig its blend of band music and school life, it won\u2019t change any minds about the genre it represents. \\n\\n\r\nI must give Hibike Euphonium the grade of a \u201cwimpy 8\u201d. Fans of the genre/studio will probably love it, and non-fans might learn to like it too, but for others, this anime might not take the gold it desperately tries for.",

            "content": "I watched Hibike! Euphonium with quite high expectations since i heard a lot of good stuff about it. But despite the top notch art I was really disappointed by the rest of the show. \r\nWhat I expected was insight in a classical orchestra and at least some passion for music. But what I got was a rather dull all-day-life in a school orchestra, where people are motivated mainly by competition and peer pressure and not by affection for their instrument or their music. So most of the time you are watching students practicing solo or fighting their social struggles which I found pretty boring.All is lead by a music teacher who has no interesst in teaching his students passion for music while he tries very hard to inflict said social struggles within his orchestra. You barely see the whole orchestra play for more than a couple of seconds, also you learn very little about the different instruments and tasks in the orchestra and absolutely nothing about classical music. The creators seemed to be pretty insecure wether classical music would appeal to the audience and even chose generic j-pop songs for intro and outro. In the end the last episode seemed like a relieve since it delivered some of the stuff I found to be lacking in earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched Shirobako, I was disappointed by the low story appeal but that show did a lot to explain it's topic well, while Hibike! Euphonium fails in this aspect. Hence my low rating.",

            "content": "First of all I'd like to mention that this anime is mainly Music with a splash of Drama, and not mainly Drama. When starting the anime I was wondering which it was.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nSadly, this is the lacking part of this anime. At episodes 10-11 the anime changes it's pacing and has a lot of forced drama. That drama does have a place in the story, but not the way it was presented. It felt unnatural. But this forced drama is my only complaint about the anime. The rest of the story was unpredictable and well paced.\r\nArt : 10/10\r\nIt's KyoAni, enough said.\r\nSeriously though, this ismost likely the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. Everything from background art, to the character design is perfect. The animation is truly flawless and cannot be compared to other studios. Also the amount of \"reaction.jpg\" material is crazy. I've had great laughs at some of Kumiko's expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, this is a Music anime. The opening is perfect and has some amazing vocals, never skipped it. The anime, being based on showing the improvement of a group of high school students throughout the anime, does that really well. The note misses and mistakes all sound natural, as if somebody who really is progressing recorded the instrument parts for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBesides Yuuko Yoshikawa, who felt unnaturally annoying and made only for drama,  all the characters were well developed. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a division between characters in terms of their purpose. Some characters are major plot elements like Kousaka Reina, and some are just there for the Slice of Life element, like Katou Hazuki, which isn't exactly bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. Even though I didn't like it for it's drama elements, I loved it for the Slice of Life parts and the final 3 episodes. I will definitely watch season 2 when it comes out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is a great anime that caters to a lot of people's preferences, being Music, SoL, and Drama. You're bound to like it for at least something. I would definitely recommend it even if the anime is average in Drama.",

The show brought back all the happy feelings of performing in front of an audience of people. If you\u2019ve never experienced that before, whether it be in a concert hall, a football field, a soccer field, whatever stage you can imagine; this anime will show you exactly how terrifying and thrilling it is. It will also make you appreciate what people put themselves and others through to become better performers and people. There was never a character that I could bring myself todislike at the end.

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is, as another reviewer has said, Kyoto Animation at its best. This story is very personally engaging for me, being someone who played in wind ensembles and marching bands all through high school and college; I wish now that I'd been able to take music as seriously--and be around people who take it as seriously--as the ones in this story. Watching the level of dedication and passion these teenagers show really inspires a desire to follow something so wholeheartedly myself.\r\nThe production values are positively stunning. The music production in particular is great, offering very rewarding distinctions between different players. You can hear thesound improve as the band improves. You can hear individual players improve, and their deficiencies are realistic--whether it's tired lips, poor slurs, a section that's not together, or even just tentativeness in tone; and the music direction even manages to give clear portrayals of the difference between a good player and a great player.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the show is no slouch either--in addition to the KyoAni hallmark of adorable but fully realized characters, the color palette used is unique and effective. I love seeing the shades of green in the sky, the changes in the uniforms. Even the occasional bits of obvious 3D CGI are used with sufficient delicacy that it remains cool and not just eye-rolly.\\n\\n\r\nBut in all I rate this show so highly because I couldn't put it down. There are shows I'll watch for a little amusement value, there are shows I'll watch because they're available and I want to have seen it; there are shows I'll watch three or four episodes at a time. This show kept me from wanting to go to sleep, kept me from wanting to go to work, because I'd rather keep coming back to the story--to these roundly developed characters presented in such a compelling and beautifully rendered world. Congratulations, KyoAni, you made me not only want to join a wind ensemble, but you made me care about high school club drama... and make me float away on imagination of different lives I could've led.\\n\\n\r\nWhat detracts is that, as has likely been widely discussed, the show is very bait-y for people wanting to see certain relationships develop. I have yet to see S2 or the movies, so maybe this will be handled better later on, but it seems to want to have certain things both ways, or to hamfistedly withdraw from what seemed like a strong position. (I'm being deliberately vague to avoid spoilers.) If you go in not expecting a relationship focus, but just appreciating what it means to strive hard for your dreams (and what it can cost when not everyone can achieve them), while watching some beautifully done animation, you will be richly rewarded.",

            "content": "I will begin this review with the exterior aesthetic of the show : \r\n\tAs you can expect from Kyoani, Hibike! Euphonium has great visuals and amazingly detailed sound ambiance (mere steps, moving chair, manipuling musical instruments...), and has tons of little details in the animation (the way the characters move, lighting effects). The OST are equally beautiful and are fitting for this serie, which contributes to the already great atmosphere the anime has. They also put a lot of symbolism and ambiguous shots in their scenes that are up to the viewer to interpret.\r\n\tFor the scenario, it is rather simple and that is not detrimentalto the show (you don't necessarily need a complex scenario to have a good series) : the club is aiming gold in the national competition. In my opinion the main interest is the everyday lives of the club members (see next paragraph) and for that it's great.\\n\r\n However it doesn't prevent the main theme of the anime, concert band, being well depicted : in the majority of the episodes you see all of the practices, and you observe the results of their training in the very well animated competitions. These are intense, beautiful, and you can feel all the tension there is on the members. In fact they show the entire performances, and several times I actually feared that one of the members would make a mistake.\t\\n\\n\r\n\tNow the what I consider the main focus of Hibike! Euphonium is the way its characters are depicted : they are EXTREMELY realistic and they have a natural behaviour, be it in their gestures (all of the little movements they do that makes them look alive) or their interactions with each other. Especially Kumiko, who is probably the character that gives the most 'real' vibes that I have ever seen in anime in general. She makes decisions (it is often inaction) that are easily relatable and she don't suffer too much of the main character syndrome : she doesn't always have the right word to say (in fact, she often hasn't) at the right moments to solve problems, doesn't behave in an excentric manner and at the same time isn't too generic, but she does have the luck to be in the right place at the right time. \\n\r\nThe other characters also feels alive, even the background ones. Indeed, the club has over 50 members, they all have unique design, and, more importantly, they consistently appear in the show : if paying attention you can identify some of them regularly appearing in the background and in 'irrelevant' scenes. From all these appearences you can begin to see their personality and their relashionships, and it's easy to imagine that they could have been support characters (or even main character) if the context was different. They live their lives even though their names are never really explicitly mentionned in the show. I absolutely loved this attention given to the support and background characters. One particularity is that the majority of the cast is female, and, while I don't personally mind, it can be perceived as a negative point to others.\\n\\n\r\n\tFurthermore, the 'main characters' (the ones who are named) have great development, most of them have changed from the beginning to the end. It's particularly true for sleepy senpai (I won't say who it is as it may be perceived as a spoiler, but that would be a minor one) who goes from lazy/uninvolved/unoticeable to basically the opposite, revealing one of the best support character in the show, and Kumiko. These changes are not caused by one major event happening (as it is generally the case in most anime), but rather little by little, it's the accumulation of small events that makes a character change/open themselves (but the major events do play a part in these changes).\\n\\n\r\n\tIn addition to that, the VAs are doing a fantastic job, especially Kumiko's who is doing an INSANE job. You can hear when she is relaxed. You can hear the inconfort in her voice (in a natural way!) when she is uneasy. You can hear when she is bored.  And as a bonus, you can clearly hear when she does her Kumiko noises (which I personally find adorable).\\n\\n\r\n\tThank you for reading my review up to this point. For all of these reasons, I think that Hibike! Euphonium is a masterpiece and I fell in love with it. Ultimately it's my opinion on this anime so it might be a little biased, but nevertheless I heartedly recommend watching this anime to anyone. \\n\\n\r\n\tTL;DR : To summarize, the outstanding visuals (art & animation), the gorgeous OST, the insane attention to details, the consistent large cast of characters, the great character developments (and Kumiko, seriously she's THAT good) contribute to create a convincing world in which we take pleasure in observing the story unfold and its characters living and evolving. \\n\r\nIf you enjoy discovering characters's personalities, their developments and good relationship depiction between them, surely you will love Hibike! Euphonium.",

Because think of any car brands, from Toyota to Mercedes-Benz to Ferrari and I can be ascertain that almost no one can reckon each single model made by these automakers. Let\u2019s try on Toyota: okay, we\u2019re just lost on their sea of models. How about Ferrari? We may be able to identify them, but keeping the numbers 430 and 430 Scuderia, 458 Italia and 458 Speciale on our heads is like memorizing a math formula.And let\u2019s forget about the Mercedes-Benz because unless we have brochures, they seem to name each of the car models differently with an AMG equivalent that it\u2019s just impossible to keep up.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on the Lamborghini, we know them as names of famous bulls: Miura, Islero, Diablo, Murcielago, Gallardo, Aventador and Huracan. Yes, we know what these cars are\u2014they\u2019re the marvel of Italian engineering, they\u2019re Lamborghinis.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni works pretty much like that: they are the phenomenon of Japanese anime. Once you hear K-On!, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, Hyouka and Tamako Market, Lucky Star and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, you instinctively know it\u2019s all from Kyoto Animation. And whenever KyoAni releases their upcoming anime, the whole anime realm rumbles like the Lamborghini Aventador\u2019s V12 engine.\\n\\n\r\nYet, over the years, KyoAni seems to have transformed into something, well, non-KyoAni. It\u2019s like Lamborghini turning into Audi. Audi and Lamborghini started sharing their car platform with the R8 and Gallardo, respectively. So, the Gallardo is an R8 with the famous bull-badge attached; and buying an R8 was the same as getting a Lamborghini. Strange, it is.\\n\r\nAnd strange it should, because we remembered K-On! which was really magnificent. Then there\u2019s Hyouka and Chuunibyou which brings more of the KyoAni\u2019s soul of moe-goodness, and Tamako Market which may not have met expectations but is still a true KyoAni nonetheless. Things started to turn \u201cAudi\u201d with the Free!, and Kyoukai no Kanata somehow turned 90-degrees, and when Amagi Brilliant Park (Amaburi) arrived, it was like the Gallardo: the Lamborghini with an Audi engine. For lack of better terms, Amaburi honestly was more of a fan-service than the moe-soul. You won\u2019t believe the number of Sento Isuzu doujins around the net, but they\u2019re materials for people who can\u2019t discern KyoAni from hentai. The KyoAni moe-soul morphed thanks to either KyoAni wanting to attract some \u201cmature audiences\u201d, mature audiences who only want to satisfy their \u201cotaku\u2019s takoyaki\u201d rather than respecting the moe-magic that KyoAni is renowned for. Amaburi may not be ecchi, but with the number of showing-skin, armpits, thigh-highs, bikinis throughout the show, all of these eye-candies and innuendos are enough to harden an \u201cotaku\u2019s takoyaki\u201d. Amaburi is generally alright, but wrong KyoAni-wise. It would be better suited for other studios, Collaboration Works perhaps?\\n\r\nBut KyoAni? No. It was like a story coming from a pervert who was luckily hired to be a KyoAni staff and wanted to introduce harem into the KyoAni essence. Very Collaboration Works-ish. Also, thanks to this matter, I don\u2019t even want to associate Amaburi with the Gallardo\u2014because the Gallardo was awesome. Instead, it\u2019s more like a Honda Civic\u2019s clone. Imagine what it will be if Lamborghini makes an inferior-quality car that looks like a Honda Civic but unsightly. Are you mad, you cretin?\\n\r\nAnd that brings me to this new KyoAni work: Hibike! Euphonium. Least to say this could be the \u201cHuracan\u201d in my metaphor terms. But it\u2019s not. Instead, it\u2019s more of\u2026 the Urus\u2014Lamborghini\u2019s SUV.\\n\r\nYes, Lamborghini is now creating an SUV that can reach 200mph! And that\u2019s just unnecessary for an SUV.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 7\\n\r\nThe story is as fresh as what KyoAni can draft on storyboards: a high school wind ensemble\u2014or the \u201cwind group\u201d of a symphonic orchestra. Not really remarkable, but is a well-thought plot element. When I first saw Hibike! Euphonium, I had my doubts. But upon knowing the studio behind it, it surely has to be KyoAni or nil\u2014doubts erased, I know KyoAni can pull it off. They had their practices from K-On! after all.\\n\r\nThe story is not only bringing back the renowned KyoAni moe-soul, it\u2019s upgrading the story elements further: more character interactions and deeper involvement, it was really superb for KyoAni to make it as a slice-of-life in KyoAni trademark with a \u201ccoming of age\u201d theme to it. However, there is one thing that bugged me: this kind of element is predominant in PA Works, the studio that brought us Hanasaku Iroha and Tari Tari. Here, KyoAni could be guilty of offering us something like a whisky instead of a brandy: it\u2019s good, but it may not be the kind of liquor we want.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nOfc, nothing left to expect if it's KyoAni.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 8\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium revolves on Kumiko, an Ui-lookalike who had a hairstyle-change, rendering her a fresh KyoAni face. Fresh faces of Sapphire/Midori, Reina, and Hazuki joined in. And with the coming-of-age theme, their raison d\u2019etres doubled not just on playing music, but on their character dynamics and complexities. Reina brightened up and was able to show what she meant by \u201cspecial\u201d, Sapphire is not your usual moeblob as she has more determination than cutesy-character showing. Hazuki may be a little left-behind but that is the balance of characterization showing; and best of all is Kumiko\u2014who went dynamic: you can see her character development from detached or passively unwilling, to one who was showing her resolve. Supporting characters were not even left behind\u2014most of them are well-proportioned foil characters: Asuka, Haruka, and Aoi to say at least. Also, even with the farfetched attempt of Taki-sensei pushing high school students to Philharmonic level, it was all sublime for KyoAni to deliver it righteously. It might be farfetched, but never ridiculous. Instead, it was a good plot element on itself, shows much of the characters\u2019 determination and discipline, and the result was the make-or-break trick didn\u2019t turn clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 10\\n\r\nI could say 20, flat-out honesty. KyoAni mastered the sound in any anime-way achievable. From the seiyuus to opening/ending songs to the rendition of the ensemble and its musical instruments, the attention to the sound was extraordinary.\\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the seiyuus: Chaika the Coffin Princess\u2019 seiyuu is voicing Reina; you know Tomoyo Kurosawa as Sylphy from Amaburi, Itsuki from Yuuki Yuna, and that \u201cLove You!\u201d girl in Aikatsu, her role here resounded as she made a great Mai Nakahara-ish voice but is still unique to her own; then there\u2019s Hazuki\u2019s seiyuu Asai Ayaka who also shows talent, and best of all there\u2019s Moe Toyota\u2014the seiyuu I bet to show more promises in the future with her distinct voice to match moe characters. She gives moe characters a new life. Part from the best are the return of Minako Kotobuki who voiced Mugi from K-On! is now voicing Asuka; and Yoko Hikasa who used to be Mio Akiyama, is now voicing Aoi. To complete the seiyuu cast who had their KyoAni returns is Minori Chihara, who voiced Mitsuki in Kyoukai no Kanata. Then there\u2019s Saori Hayami, who\u2019s new to her KyoAni role but\u2014just look at it, it\u2019s Saori Hayami as Haruka-kaichou!\\n\r\nFor the music itself, like I said, KyoAni mastered it. I used my A4Tech heavy-bass headphones to assess the sound and it is staggering, all well-composed, well-made pieces. Mind you, I\u2019ve not only listened to classic Mozart, but I burned Metallica\u2019s S&M concert in my head, as well as Scorpion\u2019s Berlin Orchestra Live Concert\u2014both heavy metal bands with symphony accompaniment on one of their live albums. The effect of Hibike! Euphonium being able to match the fingerings and sound to be so accurate, with the individual accompaniment of instruments as I dissected to hear each of them from the headphone is just mythical. For an anime to have the concert-like attention, I could say they actually hired an actual ensemble\u2014because the beats and notes actually come individually and not the usual \u201cfrequency-sounds\u201d that accompanies on synthesizers. It was just with regret that I know only very few people/otakus/anime-fans who watched and will watch this would think nothing of the efforts made sound-wise. Most anime fans only focus on visuals, not on details especially the auditory\u2014and otakus themselves are too busy fiddling with their otaku-takoyakis for their own sake. It\u2019s sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 8\\n\r\nFor KyoAni creating Hibike! Euphonium, they set the bar higher for themselves and placed their trademark of \u201cfluidic\u201d anime that transpires correct finger placements, accurate renditions on the musical instruments and sound, the cast of talented seiyuus, and the plot and character to top it all, what reason for this not to be enjoyed?\\n\r\nHowever, I again will point out that as great as this may seem, the quintessence of this anime feels\u2026PA Works-esque. It is KyoAni, yes\u2014but PA Works in certain angles. Here, this is what I mean with the kind of method that Lamborghini ought to bring with their Urus\u2014for a supercar automaker to be making an SUV, they\u2019ll do a good job alright, but it\u2019s an SUV they\u2019re making, it\u2019s just not the same as a supercar, not the same \u201csoul\u201d Lamborghini has.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 8\\n\r\nNothing much left to say, except that Hibike! Euphonium was able to bring back the KyoAni moe soul, though not as precisely. The coming-of-age theme just resembled much of PA Works and maybe that\u2019s just me. However, I gauged that it made a different effect for KyoAni where they could have found a different way as they always have.\\n\r\nYet, the world moves on and we\u2019re all along for the ride. At least for KyoAni, they didn\u2019t press making an innuendo fan-service out of this. Good riddance if KyoAni decides to rather leave those kind of stuffs to Collaboration Works instead.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: Hibike! Euphonium is like the Lamborghini Urus, it must be awestruck, but being an SUV simply does not possess the same impact as the Lamborghini Aventador.",

            "content": "The written review to my video review.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe story begins as Kumiko Oumae is starting her new life in high school. Now she wanted a fresh start, completely new school, she ties her differently and she doesn\u2019t want to bump into any of her old friends from middle school, little does she know she bumps in Reina Kousaka, who she had an awkward experience with back at Middle School. Kumiko quickly makes new friends and joins the school\u2019s concert band club and that\u2019s when the drama begins. The school\u2019s band is known for underperforming and never getting anywhere, however their new teacher asks thestudents whether they just want to have fun or compete for the Nationals. So by peer pressure, they all said they want to compete for Nationals, but that\u2019s not where their hearts lie initially. So the overall main goal of the band is compete for the Nationals. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about the story is it\u2019s not a simple aim for the top story, but more a story that has to do with the behind the scenes of a band. We get to see a lot different relationships and ideas being bought to the table. There are some members of the band who try hard and compete, there some who don\u2019t care at all. And it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s rarely touched, because we get to see a conflict between the people who really want to try hard and the people who would rather goof off. The story is very interesting, because it feels so real and I love that, however at times it does get overdramatic being an anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKumiko Oumae is our main protagonist of Sound! Euphonium. At first she\u2019s not very enthusiastic to join the concert band and play the Euphonium as well, because she wanted a fresh start. You see she has a tendency to be awkward, whether speaking her mind she can upset some people or not speak at all. At first before she joined the band, she notices that they are bad. However even though she says they are bad, she\u2019s not the expert professional type of player as well. Kumiko sorts of hangs around the middle, where she not bad, but she\u2019s not great. So over the course of the show we really see her get better at playing the Euphonium. We see her gain that motivation to get better as the series go on, and that\u2019s what I love about her, she\u2019s not a complete noob, but not a complete perfectionist as well.\\n\\n\r\nTwo of the other main characters are Hazuki Katou and Sapphire Kawashima, who are both cheery happy girls. Unlike the members of the club band, Hazuki is a complete novice picking up her first instrument in the band, and it\u2019s a tuba. What I like about Hazuki is her personality, she knows she\u2019s not that good, but tries hard to get better, and we see slight improvement, because you don\u2019t become a professional in a short amount of time. Sapphire plays the Contrabass, and is the only member of the band to play it. Unlike Kazuki she is an experience player and good to see how she supports others with her knowledge even though she plays a different instrument. Only thing that bugged me was, we didn\u2019t get to see enough development out these characters because they showed potential. But most of the time we see them, they weren\u2019t really contributing that much to the storyline. I don\u2019t why they were mains, because they felt more like supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly there Reina Kousaka, who aims to be a professional. And this can easily be seen when she starts playing the trumpet. We always see her practicing and dedication to the band. She aims to best player, to be someone special. She is a quiet girl, but we really get to see a lot more of her when Kumiko starts interacting with her, and we see their relationship grow the more they interact with each other. What I love about her character is that she is straight up expressing her feelings. And also the fact that everyone knows she\u2019s probably the most gifted member of the band, they all reject her, simply because of how she acts. And when Reina changes a lot, when Kumiko comes in to help, and I love their interactions with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the show is more about Kumiko and Reina, it doesn\u2019t mean the supporting characters are completely left out. As I stated earlier in my review, they bring up a lot of different conflicts in the band. We see characters who are not interested and the reason why they aren\u2019t interested. We see characters who are ecstatic that they are competing for spot in the Nationals. We see some jealously, which plays a huge part of the story. I love the conflict between the characters, I just wish there was a bit more development to some the supporting characters, because even though some of them do developed, the majority don\u2019t really change too much. But we get to see a lot of different personalities because this is an ensemble cast, so we can\u2019t have too much of the same, and it\u2019s really interesting to see a lot of different friendship groups.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 9/10, 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has changed their animation style a bit for this anime. It is very clear to see that the characters are completely different to the background. The characters are much more cleaner and clearer, which is amazing to look at. However they do spot that very moe look, with their cheeks being really bright red. Another incredible thing the artists did if you noticed, is that the background band members all look different. They are uniquely design, and we get a clearer picture as the series progress, because in the middle of each episode, they show the band members and their respective roles in the band. However you\u2019re all wandering how the animation looks like when they\u2019re playing their instruments. We don\u2019t get enough of an actual performance to actually see them play. However we see a lot of practicing, so unfortunately there\u2019s not too much to awe over when it comes to the animation in that. But we do see the sweat the characters gain over the course of playing which is a nice added touch. The lighting in the anime looks gorgeous as well, we really get nice colour bright light setting, that fits in with the music.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a musical anime, the sound has to be the main focal point. And it doesn\u2019t disappoint at all. It\u2019s really sounds authentic. Because everyone in the concert band is of different skill level, so when they\u2019re not good we can clearly hear the mistakes and if they are good, we can see why it\u2019s better over the other. Even though they only perform probably 2 main pieces during the series, we get to hear different parts of it bit by bit, to appreciate the hard work that one must put into a section of the song they have trouble with. And when it\u2019s time to perform it is amazing to listen to, because it\u2019s great to hear the final polish product after the initial rendition. And it legitimately sounds like an orchestral, because we hear so many different instruments. It really adds to that atmosphere as if you were in the auditorium. Also the opening and ending themes are catchy as hell and I love them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I don\u2019t pay too much attention to musical anime, unless their idol anime. But I really enjoyed this show, because it looks and sounded very real. Seeing the improvement of the music as the show progress was good enough for me to keep it entertaining. The story was enjoyable as well, because it was interesting to get an insight on how the concert band members interact with each other and see the conflict that arises within. It\u2019s really fresh to hear a lot of same piece, but played differently by different instruments so we get enough of variety out of the music. I loved watching the characters practice and interact with each other; I loved how the music separates the ones who are good to the ones who aren\u2019t as good, because it really shows how realistic it is.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story gets a 9, for being a really authentic story. It may sound like simple concept to begin at first we story aiming for the top and overdramatic moments. But the story overall is very interesting in seeing the development and the backstory behind the band\u2019s drama and conflict. The journey to the Nationals is the main reason why I love the story, seeing how it\u2019s developed with a really realistic setting as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound get a 9 and 10 from me. The animation is gorgeous and clean to look at. I really love clean animated series, and the fact that they came up with a unique design for every band member adds more to the authenticity of the show, however there wasn\u2019t a lot of main performance to admire them that much. The music being played is amazing, because it really feels like a concert band and seeing it at different skill levels makes it all the more better. It really helps telling apart who is good and who is bad. The performances sound real and the opening and the ending themes are good as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, they get an 8 from me. I love the interactions between Kumiko and Reina and seeing their relationship build up. I like the interactions between each band member and seeing the conflict between them. However I think Hazuki and Sapphire weren\u2019t used properly as mains and we didn\u2019t get enough development for some of the other supporting characters, even though we got some, they weren\u2019t all developed.\\n\\n\r\n A 9 is the score for my own personal enjoyment. I really enjoyed listening to music and seeing how the story and characters unfolded. Seeing what separates them apart and listening to a huge variety of instruments playing the same track. I love seeing how realistic it is and watching it made me appreciate music much more, as it gave me a clearer mind on what sounds good and sounds mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nAfter rounding the scores up I give Sound! Euphonium a 9/10, making it the 5th anime I\u2019ve given over a 9 in Anime Reviews. It\u2019s incredible how genuine the show is when it comes to story and characters. Not only is the show pretty to look at, but it also sounds incredible, and that\u2019s what you want from a musical anime. I recommend this anime to Musical fans or any fans of the club genre of anime. It is definitely one of my favourite anime of Spring 2015, and one of the better anime in the Spring Season of 2015.",

            "content": "This would be the second anime I'll be reviewing so I do apologise if I make any mistakes in my review that either spoils your enjoyment or breach myanimelists' rules. Now to the actual review.\r\nStory (8). The story itself I admit had a K-On-esque feel for the first few episodes with everything being very chilled and relaxed. Towards the later episodes though or maybe towards the 3rd with hintings in the other two, the plot introduced a very interesting plot element, namely politics or more aptly put, group politics into the mix. We're not talking about 2 people bickering over something here but rather factionsof groups that normally consists of 5 to 6 people getting into arguments with one another because of a problem. The addition of the element itself did not feel out of place and one can very well imagine such things occurring in real life as well.I found it very interesting to see how these issues developed over time and I did not at any time remember having to stretch my imagination to make what had occurred seem believable (apart from maybe all there issues happening within just one school club). Overall, the story was paced very well but the one issue I had with the anime though would be that the much of the drama felt very isolated and contained. In short, the problems in one area did come to haunt the story later on. This makes the anime feel like it solves a problem and moves on when in reality, a problem never really goes away especially when you're dealing with groups of people given different people have different opinions on what they'd consider the \"best\" way to resolve a matter. Overall though, this problem didn't interrupt my enjoyment of the anime but I suppose was an element of realism that would have been nice if it had been there.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7). The art was done by Kyoto Animation or at least I'm pretty sure the characters were anyway and if you've seen the Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi, Hyouka or K-On, the character designs are pretty much the same. I don't quite remember anything jarring about the backgrounds either although I do have to take my hat off to the animation of the musical instruments given that it seemed very detailed and there were a lot of them and a few scenes in the anime that sent chills up my spine when i was watching them due to the sheer quality of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7). Now I'm pretty much a sucker for classical or instrument only music and given that the entire show was about one school band, I have to say I enjoyed the music quite a bit. I hadn't exactly listened to marching band music before and the anime didn't awaken the need to either but I still enjoyed the music while it played anyway.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8). I started watching this anime because a friend and I were trying to decide what we could simu-watch together and I heard that this anime was suppose to be good. I have to admit that once I started, I kind of marathoned the whole thing, leaving my friend in the dust. The anime was a pleasant surprise to what I had originally expected (more relaxed slice of life feel) and would probably re-watch the anime again at some time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8). This anime was not what I had expected to be honest. What could have easily been another slice of life anime turned out to be something completely different altogether.\\n",

            "content": "This is a review from a band member to you. (Rhyme intended.) I mean, I originally didn't have a clue what this anime was about; I only watched it because of Kyoto Animation. However, knowing exactly what it's about made me like it more. Although it's not 9-worthy, it came extremely close to it. Is it because I'm a band member at my school? I dunno. (I play flute, in case you're wondering.)\r\nHibike! Euphonium is about a girl named Kumiko Oumae, who just entered Kitauji High School. In junior high, she was a band member who played the euphonium. She checks out her school's bandand finds one of her old bandmates, Reina Kousaka, there. Because of a certain incident, the two of them aren't really on the best terms. Still, Kumiko joins band and, of course, gets stuck with the euphonium. As the band members of Kitauji High School works hard to get into the Nationals, Kumiko and Reina slowly but surely become closer to each other. (Oh, how they teased the yuri in this anime!)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty well-told; it's not perfectly-executed, but it's definitely well-told through the eyes of Kumiko. Most of the characters are well-developed and interesting, as well. However, there are some annoying characters in the mix, too (coughYoshikawacough). The voice acting is very well-done. The ED is very catchy, and I just plain fell in love with the OP! I don't know if it's necessary to say this, but the ED for the last episode was a wind orchestra version of the OP. That's pretty clever, if you ask me. Speaking of which, the way the band music is played in each episode is realistic; they're all improving little by little, just like in real life.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's something I can go on gushing about for hours on end: the art and animation. Obviously, as I've mentioned before, it's from Kyoto Animation. Kyoto Animation always manages to release an anime with beautiful animation, and the animation in Hibike! Euphonium is certainly no exception. With nice, vivid colors and serene animation, I liked the art and animation through and through. I noticed a little change in the characters' design, but this change is so insignificant that it's nothing to rant about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hibike! Euphonium is a good anime. If you like a good story accompanied by Kyoto Animation's ever-so-stunning animation, I'd recommend it. I'd also strongly recommend it to those who are or were in band; it might get you pumped up to play whatever instrument you play!",

            "content": "This show is for everyone who ever played in a concert band. If you've done so before, you will love all the nods and references to band culture thrown in everywhere. \r\nIt's also a show for people who want a very simple character-driven story where the main action comes through an introspective heroine trying to sort out her thoughts and then her relationship concerning a childhood friend of hers whom she had a falling out with during their middle-school band days. There is also a bright and cheerful character who knows nothing about concert band, and her interactions with the other characters are pretty cute.In addition there is the super-moe double bassist, who's an interesting case in that I expected her to be the shy, unconfident type, but she actually has quite a bit of fire.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves, though, are all that there are, because the story itself could be superimposed over any other situation and be mostly the same. Another reviewer here mentioned the same thing, but honestly, they could be magical girls, they could be vampires, they could even be on a sports team, and nothing would change, because it would still be a slow-moving story about a very boring girl just sort of slogging through life wondering what she should do about her past relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, everything was amazing, it's Kyoto Animation. The sound was all good, but none of the BGMs particularly stood out.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't finished the show, as it is not finished as of the time of this writing, but I just wanted to drop a short review for anyone thinking about getting into this show. It's very slow-paced, the plot doesn't exist, and it will only be interesting if you happen to like the characters for who they are, whereas I didn't find them all that fascinating. Also, if you have no experience with concert band, you're going to spend a lot of time staring at your screen wondering either what hilarious joke or fond memory you're missing out on because the show caters pretty hard to the concert band crowd.",

Euphonium is story involving Kumiko and her friends on a quest to take their band to nationals, as Kumiko had failed at doing that once before in Junior High. I felt that the did this story wonderfully, as well as realistically. It was very nice to see how the band triumphed, as well as how they got to that triumph.\r\nArt 10/10-  Let me justsay, that if any anime does their eyes and hair beautifully, i'm hooked, and Hibike! Euphonium is one of those anime. Not only are the eyes and hair done wonderfully, but the instruments are done really well too. This Anime just makes everything shine with it's animation, from the eyes to the instruments.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 - If you're an anime about music, you better do the music well, or the anime will fall flat on it's face, and thankfully, Hibike! Euphonium serves its purpose well. Any of Reina's trumpet performances are breathtaking, and the growing musical skill of the band itself it well orchestrated though the change in sound.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 - Repeating myself earlier, as a musician i found this anime to be enjoyable and relatable. On the non-musician side this anime is amazing from it's breathtaking art to the characters and their relationships with one another\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "Do you ever have that one anime that comes around just at the right time in your life? That anime for me was Hibike Euphonium.  \r\nJust to clarify.\r\n1. This is not a traditional review or in sense that most people would see a review. The point is here is not to objectivity explain how this series could appeal to the broadest general audience objectively. But to explain how some people could enjoy a show like this and to explore why people who've gone through things like this before and to guide people who need a show like this to it.\r\n2. I won't try toavoid spoilers because doing so misses the point I'm try to achieve, so that's your warning.\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite easy to fake play a brass instrument. So I did, this was a year before I saw Hibike. I didn't care, I thought if I didn't play no one would care. And no one did. I wasn't important to the band. Kumiko can relate to this. She is very apathetic to band. She doesn't care. Well Kumiko's not care for band isn't out not feeling important it's out of a fear of being too attached.\\n\\n\r\nI felt the same. I didn't want to waste my feeling on such a stupid thing. The other two kids were deep into it and I didn't want to be like them. \\n\\n\r\nPlaying in concert band this anime struck a cord with me just from the premise. At the time my school was having a advanced band program when I discovered this show. Similarly in the show our program was picking out of our section the best players, two out of seven french horns. Now I knew I wasn't going to get it because I was the third eighth grader at the time and wasn't as good as the other two.\\n\\n\r\nBut I hoped to get it. I had worked three years to get where I was and even though all the odds were against me I still tried. Of course like Kumiko I didn't get it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I got home that night the part was given to the other kids I turned on Hibike. I was right at the episode where Kumiko doesn't get the solo. I don't think I've cried harder in my life.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this girl who I've related so much to cry her heart out after trying so hard was heartbreaking. I got her. It was the first time I'd ever connected with a character so deeply. Watching her get back and try again was even more satisfying it made me want to try again. Made me want to never not play again. I wanted to be the best and I wanted Kumiko to be the best with me too.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and talk about the senior that was outdone by Reina and how I felt like that because a seventh grader got the part. Or the accusation of the teacher picking favorites because my band teacher loved our first french horn and it destroyed my self esteem. About how Reina acts exactly like that favorite. How Kumiko had a good friend who quite band as many of friends quite too. How everyone reacted to band in their lives was so accurate to how real band is and emotional roller coaster that comes with it.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes if a show means so much to you nothing bad about the show even matters. I don't care to talk about the problems with Hibike because they are nothing to they way the show creates a relationship with you.\\n\\n\r\nHibike means more than the world to me and hopefully it'll mean the world to you if you try it out.",

            "content": "Sounds Good To Me \u2013 A Sound! Euphonium Review\r\nSound! Euphonium is utterly fantastic. In a glance, it may look like just an anime that caters to band geeks (I know it did for me, shame on me I\u2019m awful), but it\u2019s actually an astonishing amount more. From characters to visuals to musical direction, I can\u2019t seem to find a single aspect that this show doesn\u2019t nail. A funny, charming, heartwarming, inspirational, down-to-earth show, Sound! Euphonium delivers in a variety of ways, all while giving a subtle, delicately framed view of the human condition.\r\nWhat it means to be special, what it\u2019s like to just fitin, and what it takes succeed as a group and as an individual; Sound! Euphonium has a firm grasp on its themes and loves to smack you in the face with them from the very beginning. The moment the instructor first walked in, he put it up to a vote as to what their goal as a band would be: To make it to Nationals or to just have fun. This of course is a trap, because no one wants to feel left out. The ideal thing to do here is to want to succeed, as defined by the society we live in.  \\n\\n\r\nNow that they\u2019re tricked into aiming for the top, the class must learn what it takes to reach Nationals. Time, effort, and the determination to commit both of those two things. Most of the class finds the will to push forward in a sense of not wanting to let each other down. And that sense is acutely taken away when auditions are introduced. This is where those who don\u2019t want to fail are separated from those who want to succeed. This is where our characters must find their own reason for progressing. Being around others makes you want to improve, to keep up with those around you and not be left behind. Because when you\u2019re alone, the feeling of content will stand in your way. And competition only adds to this divide as the mentality changes from keeping up with each other to surpassing each other, leaving those who feel inadequate in the dust. \\n\\n\r\nWith only a few major plot points, the characters of Sound! Euphonium are what really move the story forward. A festival, an audition and an end goal are the only significant points in the story that come to mind. The festival shakes up the relationships in a much more meaningful way than expected, having the Hazuki-Shuuichi romance as a playful misdirect and setup for Kumiko and Reina\u2019s moment on the mountain. It\u2019s here that we get a much more insightful look into who Reina is as a person. The audition is a place for Reina and Kumiko (and everyone else but mainly these two) to prove themselves, and complications arise that manage to bring Reina and Kumiko even closer together. The \u201ccomplications\u201d are brought up by students, further illustrating their control over the story and where it leads them. \\n\\n\r\nThe charming playfulness of the characters shines incredibly bright, and I suspect you could tell even if there was no dialogue whatsoever. Every little movement depicts some sort of emotional response or state, be it the way Hazuki\u2019s eyes widen in her awe of playing music in a group for the very first time, or how Kumiko always wears her discomfort on her sleeve. All their actions tend to be cute in some way, but the show never overreaches in an attempt to be \u201cmoe\u201d. Even the running animations add to their sense of character, and every character seems to run in their own specific way. The attention to detail in Sound! Euphonium is outstanding. Be it the shine of the instruments or just hair blowing in the wind, sweat dripping down a characters neck or faces turning red after long sessions of continuous blowing, and the accurate finger placement pushed in sync with the music. Sound! Euphonium is an absolute joy to behold from just a visual standpoint. And the backgrounds are very pretty as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about my two favorite characters, the first being Reina Kousaka. She\u2019s a cool and stoic individual who\u2019s incredibly smart and skilled, and just all-around a person to strive to be more like. \u201cI don\u2019t try to get close to people who don\u2019t interest me.\u201d Kousaka doesn\u2019t waste her time with formalities and appearances like most other students. She knows that \u201cbeing relieved to know you\u2019re the same as someone else is stupid\u201d and so she strives to be someone different. What makes her special is the fact that she wants to be special. She doesn\u2019t pretend to be perfect because she\u2019s actually trying to become it, and it\u2019s this determination that puts her above everyone else. Reina acts somewhat cold around others because they mostly don\u2019t interest her, and she wouldn\u2019t want to waste her time on them. Luckily, she has Kumiko Oumae, who was once the epitome of going along with the flow. Kumiko is the one person Reina can be herself around, and because of that we\u2019re allowed to see this other side of her, a side that speaks about some serious issues within our society and then laughs it off mere seconds later to the absurdity of someone actually saying that out loud. Even when it comes to confrontation, Reina manages to keep her cool, but rather than bottling up rage, she just saves it for later, yelling to herself or to her confidant, Kumiko, in a cute an endearing way. It\u2019s this side of her that makes her real, and truly likable as a character. \\n\\n\r\nAsuka Tanaka, while still being likable, is sort of the opposite of Reina, being warm and approachable on the outside, cold and spiteful on the inside (I assume). She\u2019s absolutely hilarious when we first meet her, and a little less so nearing the end of the season. I like her upfront and somewhat standoffish behavior, as well as her enthusiasm and sense of humor. \u201cI\u2019m Tubacabra. You were born to blow me.\u201d Her wit and confidence in delivery just blew me away. Plus, sexual innuendos are always funny. Other than her outwardly appearance however, we don\u2019t get to see much of what Asuka is like when she\u2019s alone. There are hints at something being hidden deep down, but I\u2019m afraid this season we didn\u2019t get to delve into what really makes Tanaka tick. But that\u2019s probably just being saved for the second season, and I think like we\u2019ve received more than enough Asuka to hold us over until then.\\n\\n\r\nOne last note on the music, I quite enjoyed the selection in this season. None of the musical pieces felt contrived or uninteresting, but that may have just been due to my lack of experience with the genre. In relation to another musical anime, I will say that Sound! Euphonium is a lot less about the music than Your Lie In April, which is great because it makes the show much more relatable to broader audience. Sound! Euphonium is loosely about enjoying music with your friends, and it hits on much harder themes that can resonate through many walks of life. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Sound! Euphonium and can\u2019t seem to find any reason to dislike it. In every single direction this anime is fantastic. It\u2019s seemingly just a show about a school band trying to make it to Nationals, but it manages to do so much more with such a small premise. Sound! Euphonium avoids hackneyed themes and conclusions like \u201cthe power of teamwork\u201d, and instead goes for something more real, subtle and thought-provoking. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s pretty cool.\\n",

            "content": "Hibike! Euphonium is a triumph of an anime. I'm typically an impatient watcher so it's rare that an atmospheric and slow-paced series manages to capture my attention for its entire duration, but Hibike! Euphonium proves to be exceptional in many ways. It uniquely handles one of the most prevalent themes in any anime with realism and insight: the theme of ambition. \r\nHere is my take on what the series is about: our main character is Kumiko Oumae, and we follow her on her journey to realise what it means to live purposefully. Kumiko starts the series living half a life: she has no discernible attachmentto her friends, no end goal for her time in high school (a high school she chooses solely based on how cute their uniform is), and her apathy towards her life and her choices is seemingly born out of a self-aware cynicism. Through very little free choice of her own, she is dragged into her school's brass band as a euphonium player, and thus begins Kumiko's journey to actualise her own ambition.\\n\\n\r\nMany other anime tackle the subject of ambition (it's a recurring theme in many sports anime, for example). However, Hibike! Euphonium is the first to treat it in such complexity. Through friendship and shared grief, Kumiko and the other members of the brass band learn what it means to pursue greatness. We see Kumiko overcome her own self-consciousness when faced with the earnest and unashamed aspiration of Kaori, a trumpet player who aims to be a musical virtuoso. And other characters have similar arcs that explore the soul-crushing difficulty, disappointment, and heartbreak that accompany, what is ultimately, a rewarding and character-building experience. \\n\\n\r\nIn this way, Hibike! Euphonium is a truly unique anime. Too often, series over-rely on the message: \"Just work really hard, and you will achieve greatness,\" without exploring more realistic experiences of how ego and internal self-conflict prevent us investing ourselves in what we truly desire. Hibike! Euphonium handles this with a signature subtlety and gentleness.   \\n\\n\r\nWhat is also admirable is the series' treatment of young women. In this way, Hibike! Euphonium is almost anti-'K-On!'. The girls in the brass band are always the dominant characters, and their personalities are refreshing. Kumiko is often cynical and insensitive, but learns to be emotionally intimate with herself and her friends. Reina is unapologetically determined and almost egotistical, but also develops to be more compassionate. All the girls in this anime are young and brash in their own way, and their charm comes from their believable immaturity rather than a condescending treatment of high school girls. Their inner lives are conveyed to be rich and profound, and we see them grow as characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is almost heart-wrenchingly beautiful\u2013 the colour and detail of the backgrounds are so vivid, paralleling the youthful intensity of its subject matter. At key moments, the understated soundtrack absolutely soars...\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is a truly wonderful anime.",

            "content": "First off let me just say that I am in band, specifically a marching band that has a competition part.  I absolutely loved this anime, although I may be biased. The thing that I absolutely loved about this anime was that it really took me back to when I was in band. It has a great nostalgic feeling of tension and enjoyment. For instance, when people are trying out for spots in band I had flashbacks of when I was trying out for band. I felt nervous, I always felt like my turn was neither long nor short, that itwas just in the present. Then again that's where people may get lost, since all my other friends who watch this were also in band.  I don't know what the outside opinion is if you are not in band.\\n\r\n    The writing is good, like free, but kyoani always does the whole narrating thing like Haruhi. Although, there is less of that this time. The plot may not be interesting if you aren't in band.\\n\r\n    I think that's what you can say about the show, it great if you are in band. If your not I don't know if you would be too invested in the story, or the characters actions and goals. However, the sound and visuals anyone can appreciate.\\n",

            "content": "Since Hibike! Euphonium is a slice of life anime, the main plot is simple without many twists. Nothing exciting here!\r\nThe art is clean, nice to look at, and some scenes are animated brilliantly (that hair flip/turn, anyone?) Pretty good. A few extra points for them animating the instruments correctly.\r\nSome of the characters that the show puts focus on has some sort of depth, but the main few characters have the most. We get a good idea of their struggles and their desires for the future. The interactions between different characters is interesting to watch unfold, and there are plenty of unique situations and dilemmas thatoccur that aren't cliche or recycled from other animes.\\n\\n\r\nThis being a music-focused anime, I had to rate the sound the highest. The OP is excellent, and the few pieces that are showcased in the anime are wonderfully and realistically presented. You can hear the intricacies of each different instrument, from Kumiko carefully articulating the notes of an unfamiliar part on her euphonium, to Reina's difficult octave jumps and gentle vibrato on trumpet. I mention these brass instruments because I played trumpet and horn in school. I'm not quite sure about the accuracies of the other band instruments, but from what I can tell, they're spot on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hibike! Euphonium focuses more on the lives of the students in the band and their struggles with practicing rather than on the actual music. I wish there was more of a focus on the music and more pieces played in general, but this is simply because I'm not a big fan of slice-of-life. To those of you who like slice-of-life and want to know what it's like to be in a concert band (or those who want to reminisce about it), this anime is perfect. After all, music is 99% practice, 1% performance.\\n\\n\r\nAn average plot with good characters and very good sound leaves Hibike! Euphonium with a score of 7.",

            "content": "I want to start off by just saying that this is not the resurrection of Kyoto Animation. You know why? Because Kyoto Animation never died in the first place. In the last 5 years or so we've seen gems such as Nichijou and Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Even some of their less refined works such as Amagi Brilliant Park and Musaigen no Phantom World were actually pretty decent in their own right. In saying that though it has been awhile since we've had a good character driven narrative show from them. The days of Clannad and the rather excellent K-ON! seem all too distant.So, can Hibike! Euphonium bring them back on track to their roots and give us that narrative driven show we've been waiting for at last? It's review time!\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is a music school show in which we follow the story of Kitauji high school's band on their mission to get to the nationals! Ah, such a beautifully simple narrative isn't it? We've seen it done hundreds of times before, both very well and shockingly. The whole 'get to the nationals' narrative is one that many people may describe as overdone but in its defence there's a reason it's so popular. It allows for an effective and dramatic narrative whilst still delivering a relatable and realistic experience to the prime demographic of anime (teens and young adults). There's little use in overly critiquing the basis of this plot as it is only there to encourage other elements of the show to flourish. That brings me onto my first big point in regard to this show.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is not a music show. Well, not really anyway. Yes, yes; they play musical instruments and, yes, the eventual goal is to reach a music related finals. So technically speaking the overriding plot is exclusively musical, but it's not really that simple. The musical setting only acts as a fundamental basis for the character's interactions to shine off of it. The plot's progression is driven by the characters, not the major plot points. For example at one point there is conflict over who should get what role. I'm keeping this vague to avoid spoilers by the way. The overcoming of this conflict is achieved by an individual realising what was best for the band. There is no forced narrative point that carries the plot but rather naturalistic characterisation to do so instead. It's the characters of the show that really allow Hibike! Euphonium to shine.\\n\\n\r\nSadly though for all the pros in regard to the characters themselves, their presentation is a bit more off-kilter. There were some points in the show where characters react so dramatically and emotionally that I honestly felt it completely broke their character's trends as a whole. I couldn't tell if Reina was meant to be the composed and professional type or the overly-emotional type. One moment she'd be acting all cool, giving a dramatic speech showing why she's a bit of a boss and then the next she'd be having an emotional breakdown because someone disagreed with her. Eh? There's absolutely nothing wrong with having three dimensional characters with flexible personalities but at times their behaviours are bordering on clinical multi-personality disorder. Honestly though, if what you are looking for is a very dramatic presentation of characters then this show does that fine. I might be over-analysing this but hey, that's a reviewer's job after all.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I get onto a Kyoto Animation show to review, I always know there's one bit I will get to praise. This is no exception. Actually, this is the rule itself. Hibike! Euphonium is a gorgeous show with both art and animation that is near-unparalleled in anime. Just looking up pictures online makes it so apparent how much talent has gone into this. There were some scenes where I genuinely paused the episode to just take in the beautiful lighting, stellar character design and generally angelic aesthetic that Euphonium presents. This is the best looking piece of art that KyoAni have put out to date and it could very easily claim the title as the best looking anime to date too. There's this one scene where Kumiko is running across a bridge screaming her desire to improve. The quality of animation in this scene is just staggering. It's not even as though it has a particularly high frame count either, it's just that everything and every little detail flows so smoothly. I just love how Kyoto Animation put this kind of effort into the small things. Other studios, cough A1 Pictures cough, should look down in shame at this kind of work. Kyoto Animation never fail to disappoint me in regard to the appearance of their shows.... no, their art.\\n\\n\r\nFor lovers of openings and soundtracks as a whole, you won't be let down. The opening didn't immediately grab me but I could tell it had potential to grow. I listened and watched it in every episode without a single skip (although to be honest I don't tend to skip openings very often anyway, so that isn't saying too much) and eventually came to the conclusion that it's a very good OP. It matches the show's tone to a peach and gives a lovely presentation of the main cast with 3D spinning images of their instruments in the background. After this we have a lot of slow shots portraying the determination and passion of the character cast, as these are very much reoccurring themes within Euphonium it fits well. The song itself, 'DREAM SOLISTER' by TRUE, is one for the iTunes library in my opinion. It's one of those songs for when you are feeling relaxed and want to hum along to something catchy. The remainder of the soundtrack mostly consists of diegetic music played by the band themselves. Think K-ON! but less pop and more brass. It's an acquired taste of music which probably appeals to those more interested in music as an art form than I am.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all then Hibike! Euphonium is a fine show. Don't be put off by the 'music' tag like I was for so long. Not watching this show is a bad mistake. You'll be missing out on a fine school drama show that showcases Kyoto Animation's abilities at their near-best. It's far from perfect and at times I felt it was trying too hard to be dramatic but what do you expect really? It's a 'drama' after all, I guess they tend to do that. In short ask yourself these three questions? Do you like Kyoto Animation? Do you like music? Do you like drama anime? If you answered yes to any of these three questions, well, then I guess you better get to work.",

            "content": "KyoAni is among my favorite studios, but most of the anime they choose to produce, particularly in the last few years, are exceedingly shallow. They became infamous for this with shows like K-On! and Free!, where the key appeal lies in the characters and their charm, with not much thought put into story, and certainly no intricacies such as symbolism or political overtones.\r\nThat doesn't mean that they don't surprise us with some deeper experiences every once in a while. The less-popular Hyouka stands out as a genuinely unique and exciting take on the high school slice-of-life genre. And then there's Hibike! Euphonium.\r\nAs a former bandgeek, I can't help but really, REALLY wish that I had been able to watch this show in middle or high school. I was an unexcited, unmotivated Alto Sax, always lingering in second or third chair, (rightfully) unappreciated by teachers. That being said, I could feel those nostalgic emotions being captured again and again as I moved through the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe tension of filing out onto an unfamiliar stage in front of a large audience. That ever-present fear of something, anything going wrong. Somebody's going to squeak. Somebody's gonna realize they forgot their mouthpiece. The soloist is going to choke.\\n\\n\r\nI never played in a band the caliber of the one depicted in Hibike!, and I was never motivated the way the characters in the show were by the end, but I could relate to all the little worries, all the frustration that they felt. I knew what it was like to play alone in front of a strict conductor's judging ears.\\n\\n\r\nEven minus all the band stuff, the characters were fantastic. Kumiko was a perfect main character, not too wacky or opinionated, for us to project ourselves onto while at the same time remaining interesting and lovable. Eccentric characters such as Sapphire and Asuka felt like real band geeks, with their strange personality quirks and undying love for their instruments. Taki-Sensei is the perfect, inspiring teacher we all wish we had guiding us. My only complaint would be the number of characters. I felt like I was mixing people up and losing track at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Reina. The yuri overtones in Hibike! were strong. Intentional or not, Reina and Kumiko felt like a real budding couple. The tension between Kumiko and Shuuichi stemming from their relationships with Reina and Hazuki was almost palpable. It's really a shame that KyoAni teases their viewers this way, especially knowing full well that there is an established canon they cannot change. I have argued with friends extensively about this topic, and I concede that they were right. What KyoAni instilled in the hearts of viewers for no particular reason was a dirty trick, dirty enough that I must condemn them for it.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, everything else about the show is top-notch. The animation is detailed, colorful, and beautiful. The music is enchanting. The band sounds realistic and un-exaggerated, always matching up to what the characters are saying, whether they be sharp or out of sync, or just plain unskilled with their instruments. The Opening and Ending are fun, creative, and just as well-animated as the rest of the show. KyoAni may have me heartbroken about the relationships in the show, but Hibike! Euphonium is still an absolutely fantastic anime, and it deserves a complete ten out of ten.",

So now the MC Kumiko wants to become a better euphonium player (the instrument she uses is the euphonium)  and wants to go to nationals and that becomes her goal.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the story was very good and well executed within the 13 episodes it had quite a bit of development in the characters and also had some funny moments along with some dramatic stuff but it was good overall but i cannot say it was amazing mainly because some of the dramatic moments and whats so ever are not elaborated on and seemingly just skipped people who have watched will know the confession episode and the 12th episode are 2 examples of what im talking about.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Amazing simply amazing beautiful colors everything is so vibrant the character designs sleek shiny beautiful it has a really great appeal to it kyoto animation for the win putting out amazingly animated and beautiful looking anime for some time. Nothing here i hate everything was just perfect my only gripe would be if people dont like the super shiny bright colourful artwork then its definitly not something you'll like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Its basically classical band choir music or something like that you get the wood winds, brass and some drums all the categories are split into the euphoniums, trumphets, drums, flutes i mean it has everything that would fit with the type of band that the students are in and i must say not alot of music to be 100% honest i thought the music scenes and or practice scenes would be majority of the anime but it wasnt but in the mean time the classical music was great to hear even if you dislike that type of music like myself but i appreciated it sounded great and also the op is one of the best ops in the spring anime season just a really catchy song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Some of the better characters ive seen in the entire anime season no matter the genre the main character if the anime kumiko honestly wasnt the star in my opinon that spot belongs to reina kousaka and the two of them go on to inspire and help eachother as well as build a friendship after their rocky ending in the past and also make for some beautifully done scenes throughout the anime and some of the most funny moments in the anime. You get a salty b**** excuse me for that but you get her just a bunch of randoms in the band and the characters who are minor but dont really add to the story but overall kumikos friends and her bandmates help her and just give a really good vibe. \\n\r\n(The two characters i mentioned were just the two i found best there are more characters that actually add to the story)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\\n\r\noverall- im giving this an 8/10 personally would give it like an 8.3/10 but rounding it so 8/10 it is or something along those lines it was a really good anime in my opinion one of the best looking anime of the spring season and very enjoyable after not hearing any hype or anything special about it until i actually watched it suprised me and was suprisingly really good.",

            "content": "[b]Disclaimer: This is only my second review on this website so it may not be the best but here's my opinion!\r\nP.S I'll try to keep i spoiler free as possible![/b]\r\nWhen I first heard about Hibike! Euphonium, I was not entirely excited. I've heard of how K-On wasn't much of a sight to behold (perhaps bias opinion) so when I heard this anime was going to be released, well my thoughts were that of...eh.\r\nWhat I got in the end was a surprise however. I was taken on a journey, one might say. Whilst having little knowledge about classical musical, I found I could quite easily understandthis anime. However, lets move on.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story:[/b] 9\\n\\n\r\nI felt the story in this anime was well-developed in the 13 episodes we were given. It was realistic whilst being well-paced; It didn't drag on, as you might say. The information in my opinion was not dumped on us, as many anime do. It was clear, concise and easy to understand especially if you are like myself and lack knowledge of the classical music genre. The story was well-rounded and gave us realistic perspectives from characters that didn't seem forced (however, I'll talk about characters later.) Overall, I rate the story a 9 due to the short amount of episodes and whilst I did say it was well-paced, I believe if it was longer, maybe 24 episodes, we may have seen more development in terms of the characters improving etc.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art:[/b] 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was quite outstanding. I don't have much more to say. The scenery was lovely; I especially love the scenes where it featured the shrines. They were gorgeous. It was bright and colourful, however in situations it still kept its colour whilst setting the tone. The only downfall I had was with character design. While I did like the characters looks, they were fresh and bold, I felt they were slightly unoriginal (but that'd be due to same companies working on it.) Overall, I rate the art 9 because the scenery was beautiful but the character designs to me seemed a bit lacking.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound:[/b] 10\\n\\n\r\nAn anime about music? You'd expect the sound to be good right? Well in this anime I felt it was indeed. From the classical music they were playing to the background tone, I felt as a viewer I was enticed by pleasant melodies we'd often hear. The instruments themselves seemed very clear and crisp, allowing, me again as a viewer, to feel like I was watching something more realistic. The sound helped me feel 'more in-depth' with the anime, giving the scenes nice ambiance. Overall I gave the sound a 10 due to my absolute love for it. I can't say much else.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Character:[/b] 10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say the characters in this exceeded my expectations. I was expecting it to be just 4 or 5 girls playing music and then winning a competition,  however it was not. It showed characters such as the protagonist, Kumiko Oumae, , and her growing passion and love for the instrument she played. The characters to me, seemed, within the given time-frame, well-rounded, developed characters with their own sense of personality I have not seen in many other characters. Among them,  Reina Kousaka had to have been my favourite as (possible spoiler) she was originally seen as being cold, however developed into a character with genuine feelings. Overall I gave the characters a solid 10 due to their development, personality and the way they interacted with each other. (Reina and Kumiko pls :P)\\n\\n\r\n[b]Enjoyment & Overall:[/b] Both 9s\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime was quite high. I watched all 13 episodes in one sitting xD I'd say it was a sweet anime, that was pleasantly surprising. My overall score is 9 due to just 9 being the majority score :P \\n\\n\r\nI'd say in the end this anime was well worth the watch, even if you're not interested in music. It's a short, pleasant anime (that needs a second season) that will please many viewers. \\n\\n\r\nHibiki! Euphonium: 9",

Story is progressing rather slowly but this part is inevitable not only because it gives us the additional backstory and character development but because the impact of second part wouldn'tbe nearly as effective as it is with it.\\n\r\nSecond part introduces us to the challenges each and every character has to overcome in their own unique way. At the end of the series we see them overcoming their flaws and reaching to their goal. The tension continues to build up as it makes viewers feel as if they are overcoming those obstacles themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is mostly presented from the perspective of protagonist Oumae Kumiko which is responsible for some of the best psychological scenes in this show. She fights her way through hard times and continues to give her all even after failing many times. The way she expresses her built up rage when she's feeling unsatisfied with herself is incredibly relatable.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium is a gem among slice of life series. The only reason why I couldn't give this show 10 was because of it's slow start and it being drastically different from the second part of anime, aside from that there are no other complains.\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to everyone who is looking for an immersive slice of life with many characters to explore and analyze.",

            "content": "Waiting for a 3rd season of K-ON! was pointless, so instead KyoAni gave us another music anime. K-ON! tells the story of 5 girls in a rock band, but Hibike! is about the people in an high school orchestra.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe plot, if only there was much more to it. Why end it at episode 13? It could have gone much further and I would have rated the story part higher if they could. A bit of the story is about the protag named Kumiko Oumae, trying to change herself in high school as a freshman. The wind brass club she wanted to avoid cannot beavoided because she was dragged by her new friends. She had experience with the euphonium, but she doesn't want to because it caused trouble for her old friend, Kousaka Reina. With this as a beginning, the flow went well and then it got quite cut off short because of it containing only 13 episodes. Still, it made out as a good slice of life and music anime, not losing to K-ON! (Sorry for the comparison to K-ON!, I just had to).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nYes, we know Kyoto Animation are very good with its animation, but with this one, damn it was serious eyegasm. The scenery, the fingering when holding the instruments, its just too damn good. I ain't much of a visual art person, but the animation was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI know my classical music. I don't know much about classical music played by orchestra, but the sound was good too. Especially when Reina had her turn to perform the trumpet solo, the sound just resonates my ears. It was really pleasant, and you can differentiate on how they played in the beginning compared at the end, because it shows the improvements they had.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWhat made me like Hibike! the most was its characters. Yes there were lots of mob characters, but the main 4 (Kumiko, Hazuki, Midori, Reina) they all had so much to them. I just love Reina although she can be depicted as someone mysterious. She's not a kuudere, she actually shows her emotions. Like the deep bond between Kumiko and Reina, that thing's glorious. I don't like yuri but every time their faces are so close to each other I feel like they have to kiss. The character development is serious. Kumiko and Reina became close after trying their best to be in the orchestra under the tutelage of Taki-sensei, the cute demon. Hazuki who had a thing for Shuuichi (Kumiko's childhood friend) was one of the things I liked and I saw it to the end. When Kumiko kept repeating \"I want to improve.\" that was the most shocking part in my opinion. The change in her to have motivation and in the anime the CV was really accurate, with the emotions being able to conveyed to us audience. I could do much more on characters, but it will end up as spoilers so I leave it to the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt's a must. It is a must to watch this beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nKyoAni did something amazing, and something of a masterpiece if only the anime had gone longer.",

            "content": "A lot of people say this anime was like K-on. I didn't think it was at all apart from moeness and music. I was kind of expecting a K-on type of thing but right from the first episode I knew it was going to be different. Maybe the manga is more like it, however I haven't read it. In my opinion, the music genre for this was rather unique because I haven't seen an anime where they mainly focus on a classical type of genre, which really made it stand out. And that was another thing why I was exited to watch this anime, tosee how they would take that type of thing on. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really delightful and the type you would want to see more of. At one point, I begin to not like a certain character but then grow to really enjoy watching them in this anime. This was mainly focused towards Kousaka Reina, who I didn't really like at first but then realised she's actually a pretty sweet person who was ready to go for her dream. The character of Oumae Kumiko was not what I expected. I was expecting much more of a cheerful energetic type of character, like Yui Hirasawa from K-on. But she turned out to be a kind of cool laid back character which I was glad about :)\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing I liked about this anime was the art style. It just made me go wow, the instruments were absolutely beautiful and so were the character designs. I especially loved the characters eyes, they really did stand out. Overall, I think this anime was a nice unique type of work that can really open up to a lot of people, especially if you were ever in a high school band.",

The animation is superb and the soundtrack is damn near flawless in my opinion. I also really enjoyed the characters. Despite the fact that this is ANOTHER highschool anime, it sets itself apart with endearing relationships and a surprisingly heartwarming story. I mean could I give a shit about highschool band? Apparently yes, yes I can. It's not particularly new territory, as far as plot goes. Teens banding together (get it?) to overcome the odds and learn to work together asa team to achieve their goals? Groundbreaking stuff. But seriously it didn't take me long to become emotionally invested. I thought the pacing was good and I never really felt bored.\\n\\n\r\nNow as far as that queer bait goes? Still so damn beautiful. Seriously. I cried twice watching two of Kumiko and Reina's romantic ass scenes. Both of which literally could not be portrayed as anything but homo as hell. I mean if they were intended on being straight, why bother giving them scenes in which they seem to be IN love with each other? To be dicks, that's why. \\n\\n\r\nYou will spend a good portion of time wondering why the cute girls aren't kissing in this anime, but the other 20% of the time you will probably really enjoy it.

            "content": "I don't know why out of all the many anime Kyoto Animation had to offer, I had to leave this one off till now. Here's the easy way to sum up my thoughts about Sound Euphonium: I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!\r\nLet's start off with straight up the best thing about this anime: The Visuals. Are you serious? This anime is so incredibly beautiful from the art style, the character designs and of course, the brilliant animation by the one and only Kyoto Animation. I'm gonna have to say it. This is hands down the most beautifully animated anime Ihave ever seen. It easily just tops Nagi No Asukara it's so good. I will have to admit that it was kind of hard to guess this was by Kyoto Animation at first but after watching it a while, it becomes very obvious. What gives it away are the character designs. They still retain very distinct similarities to many of what I like to call K-on character designs but they are made to be more detailed and refined. On top of that, you know the animation can't go wrong with Kyoto Animation. Again, it retains many similarities to the moe blob characteristics pioneered by the studio. And the overall backgrounds and all that sort of stuff are just beautiful to look at. If you don't believe me, just watch EP8 and I dare you to tell me otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nNow of course, Sound Euphonium is more than just a visual spectacle. Great attention is also given to the characters. With a band of about 50 or so characters, as much effort as possible is given to many of the side characters instead of just solely focusing on the main ones. And of course, not everyone gets a detailed focus and great amount of screen time. But it is such a relief that the anime at least addresses these characters. \\n\\n\r\nIf we were to look at the more focused characters, this is where it gets real interesting. Kumiko is the main character and it is so amazing to see her development throughout the course of the anime. From when she first started the band in highschool to the end, we see her drastic change in attitude towards music. It was definitely as inspiring as it can get. And on top of that, let's talk about the relationship between Kumiko and Reina. This was one of the most unique and adorable relationships I have ever seen in anime. Their chemistry is unbelievably great that (I know it sounds so weird) they could literally be a couple. It was definitely a highlight of the anime. Even some of the other characters like Sapphire I mean... Midori, Hazuki, Kaori, Haruka & even the Senpai-crazy Yuko turned out to be very interesting important characters just because the anime took the time to flesh out these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime is pretty straight forward though. It is basically a competition-driven anime with the band aiming to reach the nationals. It's a simple premise but this anime does not mess around. I can confidently say that this anime has no such thing as filler. It focuses so intently on the aspects of the band and how the members face trials and tribulations in order to improve themselves, to overcome conflict and to achieve their goal. That is what I wanted to see in so many others of such anime and this one delivered exceptionally well. And even during times when practice is over, it is backed up by interesting conversations between the characters and it can get funny every now and then in order to balance out the seriousness that goes on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if all that wasn't enough, we have the main theme of this anime: The Music. This anime has the advantage because music plays a big part in it. And it is during times like these that the soundtrack actually matters to me. If the music is done nicely, it can have an effective emotional impact on the audience. As for the theme songs, while I can easily say they are not the best things I've heard, they are both nice to listen to. This is especially true for the opening theme which after multiple times, it does start to hit me with emotions. That might probably be the result of the show itself though.\\n\\n\r\nWell of course, this anime isn't perfect. There are some teeny weeny problems I find here and there. I did find that the anime does try to rush certain scenes especially during the beginning where it wouldn't be weird to say that some clips lasted for only 5 frames or so. In this first season, we hardly get to know a lot about Asuka. I know that there is some interesting backstory behind this character and I wish to know more about it. And also, it was a really unsatisfying way that the anime ended. There definitely was more that needed to be covered. And that is exactly where the second season comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nI want to see the 2nd season so badly. I love this anime so much. I cannot stop thinking about it. But of course, I'm just gonna leave this series aside for now because there are others to be watched. And I have faith in Kyoto Animation with their reputable track record that they can actually use this 2nd season to the fullest. If they do it right, I know it is a bit too early to say this, but this anime could potentially end up in my Top 10. I will be anxiously praying that it actually happens. But until then, if you have not watched this, I DEFINITELY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",

            "content": "There are very few anime focusing on music. Among them, 80% is about idols and 19% is about small bands (usually rock bands). Then there is the final 1%, that is \"Hibike! Euphonium\", which is about an orchestra trying to make it into the Nationals.\r\nMade in KyoAni, this unique anime is not only beautiful, it also has a realistic touch to it: believable characters with natural behaviour and dramatic (but not over-the-top) stories.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised, although the first season ends quite abruptly, leaving me unsatisfied.\r\nSTORY\r\nWe follow a whole orchestra that trains in order to become competitive. Their goal: being selected for the Nationals. Theanime makes it clear that this goal will be hard to reach, and all the characters struggle to level up to the top, which makes the series tense. They also have to deal with their natural feelings and their relationships with the rest of the group.\\n\r\nFor the rest, not much events actually happen. Count only 2 competitive events in this first season. Of course it is normal, but it's still few...\\n\r\nThe rest of the events are not useless as it deepens the characters a bit, but I do feel like it's lacking something. Maybe the second season will make up to that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThis anime is a candy in the eyes... except when it tries to use 3D. The end of the opening is a perfect example of how not to use 3D, as it feels totally off and distorted.\\n\r\nFortunately they don't use that much 3D in the episodes, so it's still a minor sitback.\\n\\n\r\nThen, personally I have an issue with the colored highlights in the eyes. It is kind of moe, but as this anime is not actual moe stuff, it just feels off.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe music itself is very good, and it uses a classical style that fits the theme. Sadly... the OST doesn't always fit the scenes. I remember one particular scene which is supposed to be sad and dramatic, but a joyful sound plays that just breaks the drama...\\n\r\nSo objectively, the music is good, but sometimes it doesn't fit the scenes. To me, that's the most important point of an OST, and they definitely failed that sometimes. It's still nice to hear though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe orchestra counts over 60 characters. Of course most of them aren't very deep, even those who have some screentime.\\n\r\nBut they did manage to make the group believable. It definitely feels like following the life of such a big group, and seeing their organization was really inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the MC, she's unique just like this anime. She's one of the most believable characters I've seen in a long time, especially because of her struggling with her complicated feelings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\n\"Hibike! Euphonium\" is unique, and that alone made me enjoy it. The visuals are great most of the time, which is yet another good point. But the best part to me was how believable it felt. The characters are realistic, the events are realistic.\\n\\n\r\nI did feel like they shouldn't have tried to add 3D because it was not only bad, it was also unnecessary.\\n\r\nAlso, even though the music is great, I wish it would fit the mood a bit better, as it actually destroyed the impact of some scenes.\\n\r\nNow I just wish the second season will offer more, because in the end, I did feel like not much happened in this season 1.",

I have only watched the anime.\r\nI will watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nThe art is extremely good [when it wants to be].\r\nMany scenes have superb art. The characters look amazing, and their emotions come across in their facial expressions and body language. The close-ups are handled extremely well. The series successfully, infrequently changes to a comedic art style to express certain character emotions. The instruments look accurate and the reflections coming off of the brass instrumentslook great. The instruments seem to have their appropriate weights taken into consideration with regard to how their players handle them. The blinding lights on the stage are just how blinding stage lights can actually be.\\n\\n\r\nThe solos sound great.\\n\r\nWhen a single instrumentalist is playing, it's easier for me to focus on how they sound. Whenever there was a single person playing their instrument, it sounded great - not necessarily needing to be highly-skilled performances, but just needing to feel real. Certain solo performances in the series were imperfect on purpose, so those also get credit. I still have that one great trumpet solo stuck in my head.\\n\\n\r\nIt gives a good representation of what concert band is like.\\n\r\nThere's a focus on how daily practices are managed, with the students sometimes breaking off into sectionals instead of always practicing together as the entire band. Details like that made the environment they were in feel genuine. Also of note, the way the students conduct themselves while waiting in the wings [literally, not the phrase] seemed particularly realistic, and various parts of being at a competition, like waiting to go onstage, were shown, which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nIt gives a good representation of what high school concert band is like, while staying uplifting in the end.\\n\r\nThere's a focus on the political side of being in high school concert band, such as seniority dictating who gets the better parts. This isn't just another detail of the environment though - it gets a decent amount of focus in the series as something to consider, since the concert band set a high bar for themselves and they can't afford to sit back and settle on the usual ways of doing things. Throughout the series, there is also a focus on how players can sometimes just not care about being competitive and how it changes the mood of the entire band. I won't mention more here, but there are more ways that the story does a good job portraying high school concert band life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have good, meaningful ties that change during the series.\\n\r\nWe learn about individual characters in the series in a deep way through Oumae. The character interactions aren't just limited to her, though, which is what makes this positive stand out. Also, beyond the person-to-person level, we learn about the previous third-years and how they had a profound effect on the current members. We learn something about every attitude and remark throughout the series in an interesting way. Even though I disliked a few characters initially, as I learned more about them, I ended up liking and understanding all the characters by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great.\\n\r\nI only took note of the soundtrack during important moments in the series, but all those times had fitting songs that enhanced those moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe band performances were great [though maybe not for the reason you'd expect].\\n\r\nIn my experience, concert band compositions are dull and predictable. The compositions in this series did not disappoint [and that's actually a good thing]. Unlike Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso [which seemed to focus on entertaining compositions being better than technically challenging ones], Hibike! Euphonium's competition performances focus on the actual way those events are judged - by how challenging the chosen piece is and by how well the band performs the chosen piece, down to an almost nitpicky level. Your band can go play the most fun, bubbly song ever, but the judges will have no qualms about giving your band low marks if the piece wasn't challenging and/or the band's execution was poor. The result is mildly interesting compositions that have challenging sections that the band hopes to play excellently in order to earn gold in the competition, and those were the types of pieces in Hibike! Euphonium.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good all around.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fitting for every character in the series. As a slight oddity, Oumae was voiced extremely uniquely, but I feel that her character animations never quite matched her voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters pleasantly understand boundaries and work well to progress.\\n\r\nWhen characters don't understand boundaries, it's nice, but the series can never be emotionally deep. When characters over-respect boundaries [which happens a lot in series], you get spineless characters who juggle the entire series around miscommunications or lack of communications that never or poorly get resolved. The characters in Hibike! Euphonium understand boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily make a misstep ... they are just hesitant enough that we understand their problem and where all involved parties are coming from, but they eventually resolve their issues in good, wholesome ways that make me think that their past hesitant behavior was justified.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ends amazingly well.\\n\r\nWithout saying more, I think that the series, overall [both seasons] ends particularly well. It's bold and handled very well, on multiple levels that all get a focus in the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre [when it doesn't want to be excellent].\\n\r\nFirst of all, yes, when models are farther from the camera, they rightfully get downgraded artwork. This is fine. But because the excellent scenes just look so outstandingly good, and because there doesn't seem to be a definite cut-off point between the excellent art and the mediocre art, it degrades the experience of watching the series. Usually, the cut-off points for downgrading art happen by distance, total time in the scene, and/or importance of the characters/objects being drawn. Unfortunately, in Hibike! Euphonium, it seems that scenes involving main characters from the waist up can receive varying levels of quality and detail. There's no cut-off point because there are some mediocre close scenes and then there are some excellent scenes that are farther away.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No, but the art in excellent scenes was just so great that I'm going to irresponsibly state that the art overall is still amazing and this negative can be ignored if you spend enough effort while watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like there are infrequent 3D scenes [the bad sort of 3D present in this age].\\n\r\nI really want to say that some of the whole-band scenes and podium-and-chairs-on-stage scenes used 3D models [as a negative]. I can't picture Kyoto Animation doing this though, so I assume that those scenes were just bizarrely drawn and bizarrely animated for some reason. What makes a scene appear to be 3D for me: when far-away minor characters suddenly get way more animation frames than normal | when animation frames seem to be a robotic, non-human interpolation | when mostly solid, sometimes unnatural colors are used | when [lighting] shade looks too sharp and/or too-frequently updated | when people/objects have extremely thin drawn outlines | when people/objects look too perfect, accurate between frames, and/or symmetrical. In particular, scenes from the conductors point of view or farther back or higher up seemed to have this style, which led me to believe it was 3D animation.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Yes, because, although I wasn't counting, I feel that there were less than ten such scenes over the entirety of both seasons, and I'm just sensitive to 3D usage in anime series.",

            "content": "While concert bands are very popular in reality, you do not normally spot them in the medium of anime. However Kyoto Animation's Hibike! Euphonium proves that this concept can be very well worked in an anime series. I found Hibike Euphonium to be a fun treat for all those who play in a band whether it be at a school, a concert hall, or just having fun with your friends. \r\n  The main personal allure of Hibike Euphonium was that I myself am currently in band class at my school. I've been learning how to play trombone and I guess that was abig reason I had a significant enjoyment of Hibike! Euphonium. Well enough of my rambling, on with the review.\\n\\n\r\n Hibike! Euphonium, also known as Sound! Euphonium is a anime series based off the light novel of the same name. It follows a high school student who swore off music after middle school and how she meets the Kitauji high school concert band. She rejoins the concert band and them and the rest of the band with old and new friends now are trying to make it to nationals with help from a new band advisor. \\n\\n\r\n  So, let's get into the meat of what this series has to offer. The art and animation are absolutely stunning. The attention to detail when animating the actual instruments is very evident and the color and lighting were amazingly executed. I must also say that the background music is very good and all of the orchestral instruments melded together well. One complaint with the sound is that to me some of the voice actors sounded a bit annoyingly high pitched. I wouldn't really mind this with a couple of characters but this was a bit too much for my taste. I also must add that they got most of the instrument sounds down and the variety of instruments in the actual concert band is very large.\\n\\n\r\n  Story is a bit 50-50 in terms of quality and intrigue. The concept is pretty good because you don't usually see many anime with high school concert bands as the basis of a narrative. But I felt some aspects of this anime were a tad cliche such as setting. Another negative thing would be the pacing which I felt was off. The plot progression wasn't really that good though it wasn't as bad as in Rokka no Yuusha's case. But I did feel there were some episodes that did little for the plot. The drama and comedy were very good though at certain moments I felt the drama was a little forced though most of the time it was well executed. We do also get some insight on the past of the concert band and how they have had many ups and downs. \\n\\n\r\n  Characters are pretty good in this anime. There are some cliches present but the characters do have a good deal of fleshing out and they get built from these cliches into something so much more interesting. The character interactions were very dynamic and well executed especially with Kousaka and Kumiko. It is hinted to them being involved in a relationship and I respect that there is a homosexual relationship in this anime but it isn't executed poorly but executed very well. However I would like more relationship development in the second season which was announced. There were also some other great character interaction here which I hope are further developed in the second season. In general I also enjoyed how they highlighted the reality of a concert band. It also details how far people can go and how much people want to improve and get better. \\n\\n\r\n  I honestly out of all the characters present, found Taki-sensei to be the most interesting. He kind of brought the rest of the characters to life with their development and it seems that he truly knew what to do to bring the band to nationals. Other than him and the main trio, I found the rest of the characters to be good, but not great. I think some more character development would be very good for this anime. \\n\\n\r\n  So at the end what else is there to say? Hibike! Euphonium is very fun and treat for those who know about band. It can function as a learning experience for musicians and non-musicians alike. The narrative and characters are pretty solid, the animation is beautiful, and the music is awesome. So overall you should check this one out for a unique school life anime because I knew whenever I watched an episode, I wanted to just start playing my trombone.",

Once you get motivated you can reach the limits of yourself, the personal sky you own though you dont know yet.\r\nYou can get grabbed from the joy of improvement and the tears of your efforts.\r\nWinning or losing is the last thing you need to care about. Cause the happiness and pleasure of discovering your personal sky is an extraordinary and unique experience which can only be born in a journey. The destination is the goal. It matters. But in the end its you and yourself.\"\r\nThis is an anime that teaches this. An anime made tomotivate not only the people who love music but everyone who love something. Something that mean everything for each person's soul.\\n\r\nThis is an anime that offers all these feelings in a year (2015) when, even the amount of good anime series that got aired, only two managed this. And this is the one.\\n\\n\r\nI will now speak for each part and justifie my scores.\\n\\n\r\nStory : -8-\\n\r\nAmusing story, with a beginning that fill the audience with the necessary feelings as the plot is about to unfold.\\n\r\nMy -8- would be a -9- if every single episode could enfill you with need to watch the next. But this didnt happen as i wached the series in 3 days.\\n\r\nIts still a freaking nice story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: -9-\\n\r\nThere isn't much to tell about the art.\\n\r\nMusic is wonderfull, colors are attractive, and we are in a new anime age especially after 2014 so...\\n\\n\r\nSound: -9-\\n\r\nGreat opening, gread ending and perfect ost's. Its an anime about music anyways. The anime also achieves to present to the audience the world of some instruments like euphonium, trumpet, tuba and trombone that many would never figure out how difficult and beautiful can be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: -10-\\n\r\nThey act like they are in a band. They act exactly how someone would react if was part of real band. Cooperation among the band, tensions between the members, high goals and the dream of getting better and better. Spontaneity and pure love, uncoditional aid, pure friendships and real support. And of course motivation. Some data for the characters of this anime. Definetely a -10- .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: -9-\\n\r\nI never got bored, experienced funny moments, sad moments, moments i felt like i was part of this anime (as i also play music) and the most important thing. I loved my trumpet even more :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall : -8-\\n\r\nA nice review is providing objectivity.\\n\r\nAnd this one im sure it does. Cause i may bombed you with good comments, but i understand that im a music lover and i may got a bit more excited that some others may do.\\n\\n\r\nNever forget that the things that will change your life are little and are always next to you. The only thing that you have to do is to find these things and then find the person or the emotion that will motivate you to cultivate your love for them.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching Hibike! Euphonium ^_^\\n",

            "content": "as being a band geek as myself, I LOVED THIS ANIME. It was a fresh approach on something different, other than your basic school drama cliche, it stands out as focusing on concert band, which people overlook. There may be some flaws, but none of those are a deal breaker. Hibike! Euphonium is a great anime for anyone who loves not just music, but a fresh approach on a grand surface.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is simplistic, yet holds a lot more than meets the eye. There re so many key aspects to it. From the relationship of Kumiko and Reina, a connection of all the band membersas one, The band council, and so much more! And I believe that it unfolds perfectly, even though if I didn't agree much on one decision, but that doesn't break the deal. I also like how realistic band drama is, like how people get jealous, pressure, and the occasional break in the case. The story is well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium has some really great art pieces! The background design is absolutely gorgeous, the animation is great, which compliments the art, and OH MY GOD DO THE INSTRUMENTS LOOK ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The design and the realistic shine from the brass is very pretty and was one of the key aspects of the show. Even the woodwinds had that occasional shine! The art, truly stands out from many other animes!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFrom this being an anime around music, It still has that slice of life feeling, which in no way is bad. The background score has that simple charm to add into the mood, and is fairly quiet yet simplistic. And you don't necessarily want a loud and obnoxious feeling! However, the concert band songs, ARE GREAT! Especially the two songs they used for the competition, they gave me chills the whole entire time! So the soundtrack, is fairly great!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of Hibike! are very quirky and lovable. What I thought was really cool about this anime was that the background characters still uphold a lot of detail, yet the main characters stand out by many things by wearing different socks, hair tie, etc. and that is what makes me so happy, because band is for uniting and they do! Kumiko and her shyness to Reina is very cute and makes me giggle at some points but ASUKA IS AMAZING. She is perfect as being the vice president and section leader, yet still makes you laugh and be slightly aroused. She truly is the comedic act of the show and it shines! I love her role as for thee others and can't wait to see more!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you don't like slice of life, you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did, but if you are very musical, you will love it! As for me,  I really enjoyed it! This made me so happy about how realistic, and fun it was to watch! I loved everything about this show and I never wanted it to end!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hibike! Euphonium reaches a new pinnacle of music oriented anime and has given people like me the outstanding lift of something new and original. I am very looking forward to season two and hope to see more original animes like this come out fondly soon.",

            "content": "In a word: Band\r\nAs a band nerd (and someone who plays Euph), I must say that I started this anime almost exclusively because of the title. I didn't have any expectations going in, since I had not watched any KyoAni stuff before watching Hibike! Euphonium.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nOverall Plot:\r\nIn a word: Realistic\r\nThe plot of Hibike! Euphonium is rather down-to-earth, in my opinion. In the beginning, the band members and their director, Taki, set a goal to make it to the national competition. At the beginning, the band seems hopeless. They don't practice, they can't play together, their intonation is all over the place, etc. Taki refuses toensemble the band until they all can play better and take it more seriously. As the series goes on and the characters grow, so does the band. In the end, they compete at the regional competition.\\n\\n\r\nSubplot:\\n\r\nIn a word: Tasteful\\n\r\nThere is just the right amount of subplot in this anime to add depth, yet not overpower the main plot. Friendships strengthen, past conflict within the band gets uncovered, and Kumiko tries to come to terms with her past. For anyone who was told this is Yuri/Shoujo-Ai and hasn't watched this, I invite you to make that distinction yourself. I'm of the opinion that it is not, since that particular romantic subplot is just that, a subplot. It's not the main focus, and, in my opinion, is not all that important to the story. That's not to say I don't ship it. I do, but I don't think there's enough focus to put it in the Yuri/Shoujo-Ai category.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIn a word: Detailed\\n\r\nFocus blur, lighting, camera angles, flare, and so much detail was put into making this anime beautiful. I love the art style and really appreciate the time it must have taken to make Hibike! Euphonium stand out, art-wise. I think everything I'd like to say has already been said, so I'm not going to bother with this one that much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nIn a word: Euphonious\\n\r\n(Euphonious means having a beautiful sound) The sound is beautiful. Period.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nIn a word: Deep\\n\r\nI'd like to talk about two characters in particular: Kumiko and Taki.\\n\r\nKumiko: A euphonium player who said something stupid to Reina in middle school. The memory haunts her, and she wants to quit band going in to high school. She doesn't quit due to Hazuki and Midori urging her to join, and she ends up coming face to face with Reina. She has to come to terms with the incident in middle school, and that drives the subplot for the first bit.\\n\r\nTaki: As a high school band member, I can draw quite a few parallels between Taki and my band director. For starters, both set a goal and an expectation that we will attempt to reach that goal. While Taki has the students \"choose\" the goal, and my band director creates our goal, I think the goal-oriented nature of both directors is apparent. The expectations set by both Taki and my director drive the work ethic of the students, and in the Hibike!'s case, the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIn a word: Biased\\n\r\nI'm a band nerd, I play euphonium, I'm biased. I saw a lot of things I related to because I'm in band. I saw a lot of things I liked because I'm in band.\\n\r\nBut\\n\r\nJust because that bias exists doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you aren't in band. It's engaging and it has some really good writing, art, sound, and characters. It feels real and makes for a great watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10\\n\r\nIn a word: Recommended\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to anyone who is in or has been in band, anyone looking for a slice-of-life that is in the middle between light and dramatic, and anyone who wants to try slice-of-life.",

I'm not good at expressing myself, but if you are asking yourself, to watch or no to no watch this series, this may help.\r\nHibike! Euphonium is great series, one of the best that I've seen in this season. Music is a theme for which I am fascinated, so this anime came like no other. \r\nI really enjoywatching the series 9/10, for everything:\\n\r\nThe art was incredible in each episode, I really like the drawing style for both characters to landscapes, completely awesome.\\n\r\nI think the story could be better, but I'm not complaining, it's kinda slice-of-life anime, so I know what to expect. Unlike other slice-of-life, it is going at a nice pace, not too fast, not too slow, and always there is something in the screen that makes you wanna watch.\\n\r\nIn summary, Hibike! Euphonium is a great series to watch, it has a bit of everything for all tastes. You would enjoy it, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nExtra: It's a spin-off of PMMM! (May contain a minor spoiler)\\n\r\nHahaha, well, not really, but do you ever notice the similarities of the characters, I mean, attitude and appearance are similar to each other.\\n\\n\r\n-Reina Kousaka = Akemi Homura\\n\r\nBoth distant and cold, but with a great heart. Also black hair and purple eyes.\\n\\n\r\n-Oumae Kumiko = Kaname Madoka\\n\r\nInnocent and always trying to be friends with anyone. Even she felt useless once.\\n\\n\r\n-Katou Hazuki = Miki Sayaka\\n\r\nOur \"genki\" girl, always smiling and never let anything get her down, except... their chrush.\\n\\n\r\n-Nakagawa Natsuki = Sakura Kyouko\\n\r\nVeteran in the group, and she seems too often to have a carefree attitude, but we all know that's not entirely true. Is a person in who you can trust.\\n\\n\r\n-Ogasawara Haruka = Mami Tomoe\\n\r\nThird year student both, a reliable senpai, but at some point she have to leave. Twintails!\\n\\n\r\n-Kawashima Saphire (Midori) = Nagisa Momoe\\n\r\nCute and sweet, but don't let she fool you. she knows exactly what's she doing.",

            "content": "I was pretty involved in a concert band during my time in high school, so I could relate to a lot of what was going on in this show from personal experience. I found that a lot of the drama was pretty realistic to what happens in real bands, so I was a little bored watching things that I've pretty much seen before. \r\nThough personally I felt that the season was pretty boring, there were some moments that were absolutely beautiful which made it worth checking out I guess.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nLike I said, most of the drama in Euphonium is pretty realistic, so I had alreadyexperienced those kind of moments before. Especially the merciless verbal abuse from the conductor. For many hours. I used to play in my province's honour band, so the band room is very familiar to me. Don't get me wrong; I would be content rehearsing with a band forever, but frankly watching the band room in cartoon version was kind of dull for me. The drama with auditions, the anxiety on stage, drama with who gets to play the solos (well I was the best in a section of about 5 or  played every solo) , I had experienced all of that in real life, so I guess it was interesting to watch, but story-wise not very strong for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI believe the art is by far the strongest aspect of Euphonium. The characters are so well drawn they look shiny. The sunset through the windows, reflection from objects that cast light into the shade on a sunny day, the lights from the street lamps and cars on a street at night, the starlight mixed with the cityscape view from the mountain, the art was all mind-blowingly well done. It was so beautiful that it made my heart hurt. Strangely the most beautiful scenes were always centred around Kousaka but I'll talk about her in the characters section later. Even if you don't care for anything that was happening in the band, enjoy the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nYou probably don't need to be told this but the anime Hibike!(Sound!) Euphonium is about sound. Consequently the effort put into sound in the production was pretty amazing.\\n\r\nThere was one moment in the anime (this might be a spoiler, but not really. I'm trying to give you adequate time to consider whether or not you will consider this a spoiler or not before you read on) where Kousaka and Kimiko climb a mountain and play a duet with the backdrop of the city's night skyline. I think this moment in the show made it worth watching for me because it was really beautiful. The duet wasn't especially complicated......it was just a really simple duet, but I found it really special and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nI wasn't really a fan of most of the characters in the series. I found Kousaka to be a pretty interesting character, and after a little while Kimiko caught her interesting-ness.......if that makes any sense.\\n\r\nKousaka was kind of a controversial character within her band. Because she was so good, there were people who hated her as well as loved her, but she really didn't care about any of them. She also said some.....controversial things and I'm still deciding on my understanding of her sexual preferences. I really liked how decisive and strong her personality was and I think every scene with her in it was some kind of beautiful. There were two scenes in the series that were so beautiful that they're hard to forget, and both of them involve Kousaka. The first was the scene I described above on the mountain. The second was a scene where Kousaka turns around to face Kimiko on a city street at night, and smiles for once. It was only a couple seconds long, but it was animated insanely well: the first time we see her smile, the night lights reflecting off her face, sparkling eyes, it was just amazing to watch. I feel like the creators put a little extra work when making her if you know what I mean.\\n\r\nKimiko started off as kind of a indecisive person. It was pretty realistic how on the fence she was about everything, but as the story progressed she picked up on some of Kousaka's......absoluteness? I guess I was a little interested watching her become stronger.\\n\r\nI'm glad with what the creators did with Kousaka and Kimiko because they are so distinctly different from any other characters in anime, but other than that I didn't really see much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, I was a little bored by the band room scenes which take up most of the time, but seeing Kousaka be beautiful made it worth it for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI feel like this was better than the average anime because of its incredible quality of production. Without showing off with action-packed fighting scenes Euphonium still tops as one of the most well animated shows I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say this was a \"must-watch\", but those couple moments of beauty made the whole series worth it. I admit that it made me a little nostalgic and I did spontaneously run upstairs a couple times to blast a few notes on my trombone.",

Thus this anime is focused on a music genre.\r\nThe part where it makes this anime similar to Tamako Market is how the coupling works however for this series there's a little twist that was; if I may say SUPER UNEXPECTED (I mean viewers may have already started shippings after episode 1 or 2 but DAMN that twist wasUNEXPECTED).\\n\\n\r\nThere are very surprising moments after watching episode 8 of the series, explaining would just spoil it so I would suggest you to just watch it and you will understand what I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is interesting and I look forward to a second season (Hopefully they do deliver a second season unlike Tamako Market :/ )\\n",

Hibike! Euphonium is that gem and could easily be the best anime of Spring 2015 and maybe even best of 2015.\r\nAs it turns out, Hibike! Euphonium does in fact seem a little bland at first glance from the synopsis having being a school life story with an emphasis on music. Its been done- time and time again for example series such as K-ON!, Love Live!,and Tari Tari. What will win you over however, is the depth of the main characters, the flow of the story, and the overall animation.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium builds a wonderful story from the ground up with a solid foundation of characters which develop over the 13 episode series along with the main plot which unfolds just as nicely. Each episode has meaning and leaves you with more than enough to keep you hooked and wanting more. By the end of the season, Hibike! Euphonium does more in 13 episodes than many anime series can do in 24. In the event that Hibike! Euphonium does not have a second season, you are still left with some closure and it doesn't make you feel like you wasted your time.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, whether you are a picky anime viewer or someone pondering on what series to watch in Spring 2015, Hibike! Euphonium will not  be a disappointing choice.",

The third looks, acts and even has the eyebrows like Tsumugi and the last one is way too similar to Ritsu being all two-sided and impulsive. But after a few episodes I just ignored that and enjoyed the anime so much! I loveorchestral/brass music since I make it myself and this anime slams it out of the field with solo pieces, duo pieces and even ensembles.

Having been a musician in that scenario before, I can somewhat relate to it. However, I would say that this anime is in no way the reality of band life. \r\nStory: 4. This story is an over-romanticized version of band. The main problem I had with this is that the improvement of all the students was just unreal. How can a bunch of clarinets and bass clarinets somehow tongue at 144 with just two years of experience? I can't at least,and I've been playing a wind instrument three times as long as them. To give some background, I am a bassoonist who has been in the concert band and symphony orchestra life, but now basically only in the symphony orchestra.\\n\r\nArt. 10. Who gets the keys on an oboe exactly? Kyo-ani. Amazing job; I'm honestly very impressed that they nailed it because oboe keywork is pretty complicated. \\n\r\nSound: 5. Honestly the soundtracks were just okay. They weren't very expressive in any way, and oh man did that bassoon solo in the last episode make me cringe.\\n\r\nCharacters: 6. The characters are you standard shoujo manga girls who get into petty drama etc. etc. etc. They don't really show any major character development nor any musical development. Case and point being the perpetual mindset music music and more music and I need to practice and get better so that I can get the solo etc. Being a musician, I can attest to the practicing part, but these people need to get a life. \\n\r\nOverall: 7. It was okay. I wouldn't watch this again. It's just okay, but if you're into the whole band thing I guess you'd like it.",

It then progresses into her high school life where you see her grow as a musician and as a person, as well as her meeting new friends and watching them grow into better musicians.The entire plot is basically a huge progression to win their next competition. But they do it in a way that made me want to keep watching, even though at times it did get boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are absolutely amazing. I can't say I've seen another anime that was so well done in these departments, but this one has some stunning visuals, and sound design.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the characters, which at first have a pretty basic premise that you would probably see in most other anime. Thing about these characters that makes them unique is the progression I was talking about. They make the characters pretty basic in the beginning of the show, but gradually you see them all grow into amazing musicians. They demonstrate that hard work and determination is the key to making it. And honestly all the characters were pretty interesting (at least the ones that have a lot of screen time).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this one, at first, was kinda boring. I did however start to gravitate toward's this anime more as it progressed. There's something about this one that just keeps having you come back and see what might happen next. Also, I would love to point out how I love the product placement we get to see (Yamaha being one of them). It's always cool to see real life products being used in an anime. And being a musician myself, I can admit that the struggles the characters were feeling, were 100% genuine. Musicians really do feel like screaming in the street when their songs don't get released on that big label.\\n\\n",

(The art is good)\r\n(+)The music is much more than exceptional.\r\n(+)Credit to the character designer.\r\n(+)Gets a really good message across.\r\n(-)Bit slow for my liking.\r\nThe Story (8/10): You, the person reading this, has probably been a part of a club or team at some point. One of the things that probably ran through your mind at some point when you were part of said club or team was, \u201cWhat do I want from this?\u201d Do you want to merely have fun with the team, or do you want to gofor gold? That line of thinking is more or less the reason this show exists. We start by following the MC, whose part of a concert band club, and not 5 minutes into the first episode someone says, \u201cWeren\u2019t we trying for nationals?\u201d After the club gets first place but doesn\u2019t perform well enough to advance. Then we have the high school club asked the question above, they want to go for nationals, and then they realize how hard they\u2019re going to have to work to get there. From that point onwards we follow the MC and her friends in their journey to GIT GUD.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (8/10): Do you like various archetypes of cute girls? Then you\u2019ll like most of the characters in this show\u2026.. Well that was a short section.\\n\\n\r\nHazuki Katou: The tuba player and the eccentric one of the core characters.\\n\\n\r\nSapphire \u201cMidori\u201d Kawashime: Contrabass and the curly headed one.\\n\\n\r\nReina Kousaka: Trumpet and the hardest working.\\n\\n\r\nKumiko Oumae: Euphonium of the title and the main character.\\n\\n\r\nAgain as I said above if you like cute girls this show has got you covered. However there is another character that is pretty monumental throughout the show and that\u2019s the club adviser Noburo Taki who basically adopts the outlook of, \u201cSit down and shut up you little shits you told me you wanted to win nationals, I\u2019m going to make that happen and it\u2019s sink or swim for all of you at any point.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe Art & Sound (9/10) & (8/10): The art is really good, visual quality is awesome, but the detail of most things that aren\u2019t the instruments is kinda lacking, and all of the characters look like they\u2019ve dumped their faces into a basin of vegetable oil.\\n\\n\r\nThis being an anime about a concert club, I expected the sound to be really good. Except it turned out to be really really good. Even when the band first gets together to play an ensemble you can tell the difference between then and the next time they play, they genuinely improve over the course of the show and that\u2019s a very positive point for the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nDo you want a detox from all of the full paced anime out there? Then do I have the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes. Go watch it.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren,  see you in the next one.",

            "content": "KyoAni does it again(after small mishaps)! Let's get right down to it!\r\n=== STORY: 7 = \r\nWhile it's not anything out of the ordinary for a slice of life anime - especially with such a narrow focus - the pacing was perfect. The amount of side dishes we had on top of the main dish - school band practice - was just right. It was obvious what was the story about and what was a \"bonus\". No sidesteps - pure focus on the main story.\r\nIn short - an ok story that you'd expect from Slice of Life told in an ok way.\r\n=== ART: 7 ===\r\nThe animation,the characters, the hair physics, the backgrounds, the shading, the play on light... It was all executed perfectly. The amount of details from first few episodes began to diminish over time until we hit the rock bottom at the finale; don't get me wrong it was still well and above 90% of stuff I've watched so far - the first 6 episodes just spoiled me a little too much. The amount of effects felt a little over the top at some moments - 2 scenes to be exact - but other than that it was all well done.\\n\\n\r\nIt's beautiful, it's well done, it felt crisp and alive. It was nowhere close to Makoto Shinkai's photorealism, though. It would be an 8 if the amount of details was the same throughout all 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n=== SOUND: 8 ===\\n\r\nIt was really good. Instrumental flukes were captured perfectly, voice acting was pretty much perfect, the ambient in most scenes was ok, but the music... Music felt flat for some reason - I've even rewatched the musical parts on studio-grade equipment and it still felt flat. I'd give 7 for sound but the flukes in the practice scenes(sound acting?) and voice acting raised the grade to 8.\\n\\n\r\n=== CHARACTER: 8 ===\\n\r\nCharacters were good. They were not flat, their struggles and emotions were shown. Their designs made it easy to distinguish them from each other - every single one of the ~70 members of the band had some features unique to them - despite the fact that most did not even matter when it came to the story of the main heroine(And that bunch was not the only group portrayed!). Their behavior felt so natural and each had so little screen time that it's hard to even talk about archetypes and such - 13 episodes we were given felt like a glimpse on a small part of the cast's lives. \\n\\n\r\n8 for the huge quantity of differing characters, talking about quality of such small samples feels like a waste of time. The only character we got to see fully was the Main Heroine. BUT this is not psychological drama and we don't need to know the full story of every single band member so it's all good.\\n\\n\r\n=== ENJOYMENT: 10 ===\\n\r\nThere's not much I can say about this one - I really enjoyed this series and I don't regret even a single minute spent(rarely happens!). I did not even yawn once! Watched with my eyes glued to the screen, and my heart was pounding by the finale. 10/10!\\n\\n\r\n===== OVERALL: 9 =====\\n\r\nIt does what it had to do great - despite the story being simple, despite the small mishaps, despite this and that - I really enjoyed the anime and that's all that really matters. It's eyecandy and a balm for the soul - especially after that monstrosity that is Owari no Seraph ;_; WATCH THIS IF YOU DO NOT LIKE OVERLY COMPLICATED STORIES AND LIKE YOUR THINGS HAPPY!",

            "content": "I have a complicated relationship with Kyoto Animation. Their art and the quality of animation are very good, but, unfortunately, most of their shows or TV adaptations start to go downhill after a few episodes and I only ended up enjoying Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu and Nichijou, K-On! was passable and I failed to sit through one of their biggest hits, Free!. Perhaps, it is a bit unfair, but let's be honest, if I cannot bring myself to watch at least one episode, why should I force myself to continue watching something that failed to keep me interested for at least 20 minutes?\r\nI decided towatch this because I wanted something short and slice-of-life-esque and because I tried to watch it once but got distracted. And I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let's talk about this show's strong and weak sides, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nPros.\\n\r\nAnimation and art are, without a doubt, beautiful and colorful. The story is more complicated than it seems to be at the beginning and its main idea is a breath of fresh air in comparison to shows about bands in the Pop Music genre and/or idols with music and songs that are easy to forget. An orchestra club is a very unusual theme for an anime about ordinary school days, and seeing how determined and enthusiastic the characters are makes you feel kind of proud. They set a goal and they work hard to achieve it, overcoming obstacles and hardships in the process. Characters are flawed, they have their issues and secrets, they make mistakes yet their determination and love for music are inspiring. If I may compare it to K-On, Hibike! Euphonium is more music-centered, I enjoy this aspect very much because I am not quite fond of watching characters beating about the bush while eating sweets and drinking tea all the time. This show is about working and working real hard in order to make it to the contest and win. I think it's nice that a slice of life story has a clear plot instead of each episode being a bunch of unrelated stories. Not that I dislike this type of storytelling, but it's nice to see something different for a change.\\n\\n\r\nCons.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it can be hard to become attached to different characters or genuinely care for them. I was proud of the club as a whole, but, unfortunately, failed to root for a particular character. They're not bad, but, despite their good qualities and flaws, they may seem a bit bland sometimes. They just... exist. It took me a while to find a character I could consider my favorite and I treated them all equally without any emotions or feelings towards them. Maybe this equality is not bad, but I personally like characters I can worry cheer for and worry about (for example, I care a lot for Azusa from K-On!). Eventually, I started liking Natsuki Nakagawa, she is still my favorite. I suppose they could be a bit brighter because no one really stands out and I still have a hard time remembering their names. Also, the characters work hard. Very hard. And it's admirable. As a result, make sure you're ready to listen to the same tunes over and over again to the point where they start getting on your nerves a bit. This is how it's supposed to be, given that they cannot just hop from one song to another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is enjoyable, and if you think that the flaws I have mentioned above can be overlooked (who knows, maybe you're going to feel differently about characters and the story), go ahead and watch it and I believe you won't be disappointed. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's a nice experience.",

            "content": "Brief synopsis\r\nAfter a traumatic experience in middle school, Kimiko is reluctant to have anything to do with music and upon entering high school seeks a fresh start. Nevertheless, she finds herself inexplicably pulled back into the world of music. With new friends in tow, Kimiko faces many trials to compete with the concert band to reach the Nationals.\r\nStory\r\nWhilst the premise of the show is simple enough (and by no means original) that does not stop it from being enjoyable. Something about striving towards a goal that you are incredibly passionate about with all of the energy and resilience that youth affords you, with equally passionatefriends, overcoming trials along the way and growing all the more stronger for it, resonates deep within me. Shows like this never fail to move me. And, indeed, there was more than one occasion when I was moved while watching this show. This show\u2019s themes \u2013 a passion for music, friendship, and hard work \u2013 combined with its art and beautiful music to make me feel this way.\\n\\n\r\nI was glad that the theme of romantic love took a back seat to the above themes, as that allowed the viewer to focus on the beauty and earnestness of the friendship between the main characters.\\n\r\nMy only criticism would be with the pacing of the show. After its completion, the band\u2019s journey towards the Nationals had still only just begun. Whilst I understand that there is a second season, I would have liked to have seen this journey progress much further than it did.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nStunning animation and art, as per the norm for KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nPleasant. My only criticism would be that there wasn\u2019t more of it. The concert band only played a handful of pieces throughout the entire show and these were played over and over again as they practiced them. I don\u2019t know how the show could have overcome this issue, however, as practice is a necessary part of playing in a band\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacters  \\n\r\nThis show had a strong cast of both main and supporting characters. Each character was interesting and had their own unique set of characteristics and quirks. I particularly liked the relationship between Kimiko and Reina. It was a touch obsessive and both put the other on a pedestal, but I think that this reflects the intensity that is often characteristic of the friendships that you make as a young adult, friendships where you desperately seek the validation of another (seemingly cooler) person as you wrestle with who you are as a person.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium had numerous strengths, including its music, its story \u2013 with its themes of friendship, hard work, and a passion for music \u2013 its art, and its likeable, believable characters. In fact, I struggle to think of any major flaws, therefore, I\u2019d say that I enjoyed it immensely and would definitely recommend watching it.",

            "content": "Personal Rating- 9\r\nActual- ~9.5\r\nSound! Euphonium was fantasic for myself because I could relate to it so much as a band person (#Percussion). Every part of the anime was executed smoothly and was well done. There weren't many mistakes in my opinion and the ones that were present were not Major and were minor.\r\nSTORY- 9.5\r\nThe story was enthralling because I myself am part of a wind band and I'm extremely passionate as a member. The show really appealed to me using a story of a trashy-band that transforms into a top-tier band was a great move instead of just focusing on 1 player/instrument (As the titlesuggests). \\n\\n\r\nExecution-9\\n\r\nExecution wise it was great. The story was cleanly executed without large gaping plot holes and the transitions between events were also smooth. I wouldn't say it was completely perfect though, but the mistakes are not important in affecting the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality- 10\\n\r\nThere have been many shows based on music, but Sound! Euphonium was completely unique using a wind band as a music focus versus the many piano, violin, and pop band focus. There haven't been any shows (That I've heard of) that are based on a wind band which makes this 100% original.\\n\\n\r\nQUALITY- 9.66\\n\r\nThe overall quality was phenomenal in both the animation studio and the sound department. Both combined with the characters to create a beautiful anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-10\\n\r\nThe animation was extravagant. The lighting and shading was marvelous and created many scenes that would make create background images. There was also proper usage of special effects that emphasized a character or a scene. The instruments were as well animated realistically and beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nThe sounds of the instruments were completely real and the players that recorded them were seasoned musicians. I could clearly hear the articulation and double-tongue in quick-succesive notes and the vibrato in lyrical phrases (for example Reina's solo). The OST and musical selections were also outstanding. Crescent Moon Dance was a beautiful piece that I would like to perform now and the background songs suited the scences. The OP and ED were also catchy and I never skipped them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9 \\n\r\nThe characters were not too cliche or predictable. The characters were well developed and realistic. One could describe each character fully without having any trouble. Some characters were left undeveloped or just not fully developed, for example Aoi. She seemed fairly important but when she quit, the explanation was there but was not explained clearly. Overall the characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9 \\n\r\nAs a band geek and music enthusiast, there's no way that I couldn't enjoy this show. It portrayed band pretty accurately but I will rant on a minor detail-\\n\r\n/* Rant start\\n\r\nI honestly still nitpick those marching keyboards, specifically the xylo -like nobody does that because it's extremely heavy and difficult to play without looking down, and to add on top of that it was a fragile-looking girl marching it. To add the cherry and cream, there's a thing called \"Front Ensemble\" for all the keyboards, in a street parade there would not be a front ensemble or keyboards (excluding glockenspiel at a rare chance.)\\n\r\n*\\ Rant end\\n\r\nOtherwise from that, I enjoyed this show completely.",

            "content": "This anime really exceeded my expectations. It was one of the best proposals for an anime but as they say: You can not judge a book by its cover.\r\nAt first I thought the middle unmotivated protagonist (as always have that disagreement in the past), was solved very easily because Reina did not hurt, she just decided to improve and improve to be '' special ''.\r\nThe character development in general is very good, the anime revolves not only around Kumiko, shows how is the current situation of the characters, the house of them has a frustration something that bothers them, I think it's very good becauseI want to know what you want they feel, their opinions and that's what they did not let any of it go, that feeling of them nervous and anxious I could feel real.\\n\r\nThe music is spectacular, they may have started bad but were overcoming every obstacle, I think there at that club again and many tried to give up (as well as Aoi-chan) but I think the feeling of reaching the National was stronger, some did not like others, others needed more training, but never gave up their goals !! And it had a great help from the teacher, he was very rude but it all had a purpose, was not an act in vain. And I can say that much worth the rudeness of it.\\n\r\nKumiko and Reina, I do not really like them both together as a couple, but I see them as best friends, one helping the other in difficult times (although I suspect the only Reina like the Taki same sensei). But their relationship has improved a lot since the first episode there was forming a loop (perhaps friendship or love) music formed the music joined the two, it is very beautiful!\\n\r\nIn terms of animation KyoAni left me more impressed than in other animes it.\\n\r\nMy favorite scenes are the night, are incredibly beautiful, I can not say much more it seems they highlight the light and the effect is very good, love the desing of the characters as well. And especially the soundtrack!\\n\r\nWell, from what I saw it was resolved by the friendship and music and they managed to get where they wanted to, overall everyone had a good development and ended better than I expected, really this was an anime very, very beautiful and I am very anxious to the second season to be coming!\\n\r\nStory: 8. Art: 9 Sound: 9. Character: 7. Enjoyment: 8 Overall: 8\\n\\n\r\nBonus: The Kumiko is very beautiful tied hair",

The character development was outstanding, not even mentioning how beautifull the art and music were. I'm in love with this series and i enjoyed every second of it. I highly reccomend watching it. The story ending was very satisfying and nice. \r\nI loved this series mainly because of the relationship growing between Kumiko and Reina, this might also be the main reason why i was watching this show in the first place, but that aside. \r\nOverall, goodstory, good character development, Beautifull BGM and art.

            "content": "A show about a high-school band from Kyoto Animation\u2026hmm, where have I heard this before?  In all seriousness though, Hibike! Euphonium has become one of my favorite TV shows of all time.  It\u2019s the rare show where I have to pause multiple times an episode because I\u2019m so overwhelmed by how good it is, but that\u2019s the experience I had watching Euphonium.  \r\nLet me start with an understatement: Euphonium\u2019s animation is gorgeous.  KyoAni outdid itself with this series, particularly with respect to the instrument details (though admittedly, I was never a band geek in high school or college so if thedetails were wrong I wouldn\u2019t be the wiser).  Certain scenes even rival Hyouka, another KyoAni title that I personally consider to have the best art direction of any show I\u2019ve watched.  And like in Hyouka, Euphonium\u2019s high school setting exhibits an incredible degree of verisimilitude; it not only looks like a real high school, the teachers and students behave like real teachers and students.  As someone who has come to expect depictions of high school in anime to be rather \u201cfantastical\u201d\u2014ranging from the magical intrusions in Clannad to the ridiculous insanity of Kill la Kill\u2014Euphonium was a refreshing change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nI have a deep appreciation for realism in storytelling; this is particularly true with respect to animated works, given that they are inherently one step removed from reality and thus constantly have to work harder to achieve an effect comparable to a live-action production.  That being said, everything in Euphonium feels real and true-to-life; for me, it is one of the show's biggest draws, setting it apart (and above) all other high-school-set shows I've seen up to this point.  Euphonium absolutely nails what being in high school is like: the relationships, the rivalries, the anxieties, and the disappointments.  The show's depiction of band politics is especially on the nose, showcasing the practical difficulties in uniting 50+ high-school students, each with their own egos and motivations, behind a common goal.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is rather straightforward\u2014a dysfunctional high-school band rallies behind their up-and-coming superstar music teacher to compete for a trip to the national tournament\u2014but what makes the show truly great are the characters and their interactions with each other.  The cast is extremely likeable, and despite having a relatively large ensemble the show does a good job juggling the screentime each character receives so that even minor characters get a chance to shine.  Moreover, the relationship that emerges between Kumiko (the awkward protagonist who plays the euphonium) and Reina (her passionate foil who plays the trumpet) is one of my favorites in all of anime.  Special mention also goes to Natsuki, a second-year euphonium player who starts out as an indifferent slacker but, over the course of the series, makes strides to become Kumiko\u2019s friend and role model.\\n\\n\r\nHibike! Euphonium has edged The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya as my favorite work from KyoAni, and like Disappearance it gets an easy 10/10.  I can\u2019t recommend this show enough; it was a joy to watch from beginning to end, and I eagerly await the debut of its Season 2 to see how the story continues.",

            "content": "Might include minor spoilers, I'm not sure what kind of spoilers are worth being called spoilers for slice of life anime.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story revolve around a lot of pratice sessions, and the club's internal problems regarding the upcoming competition. Afterall, this anime is about improving their music play.\r\nRant: The bad score doesn't signify a bad plot or a lack of it, instead I think this anime had a lot (maybe even too much) of the plot. Having a 'Music' genre stamped to it, I reallt hoped I could have even more awesome musics being played rather than the story. But IMO this anime is focusingmore on the story and internal problems in the ensemble team rather than actually playing music. Well maybe I'm wrong, but in total there are only 2 piece of music being played (actually make that 1 because the 1st one is not being played fully, only lasting for a few minutes). But they also have practice session which include some section of the music sometimes. Well, compared to Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, that have like 6 (I forgot the count) pieces of music being played fully, it lost in comparison. Maybe it was the plot pacing's fault, if the pacing was stepped up a bit, we might even cover more competitions and and more awesome orchestral music's play. While I'm on it, the agata festival episode really felt out of the place.\\n\\n\r\nBut that might be just me, for people that doesn't mind the pacing, it might be perfect for them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nGreat art, really awesome and good looking, it's almost perfect. What really amazes me was how it had depth of perception in every scenes possible, which we rarely even see in anime. The only downfall for me was the character design, don't get me wrong, I really like the character designs, a lot, what I don't like was the everpresent weird blush on the girls, feels off-putting sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nDespite what I said about lacking any actual full musics playing, the quality of the musics was great, it also depicts the training sessions beautifully. I just need more. Well, maybe hiring a wind ensemble to record the sounds was pricy for the anime productions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nI think the characters are great. I really love their personalities. They're not your standard moe chara. Despite how it looks real cute (as expected kyoani) a lot of them had some difficult personalities. Like how Kumiko looked like she had a generic good-girl personality, but constantly throwing her retorts of the things happening around her. And how Asuka have this I-don't-give-a-shit aura around her despite how friendly she looks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nIf you liked slow pacing anime then this might be good for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuri (10/10)\\n\r\nYuri is one of the aspect that made this anime great (for me at least). I loved how its treading between heartwarming-comedic-girl-friendship yuri and sakura trick level yuri.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\ntl;dr Expect moe with a lot of wind ensemble team musical practice.",
