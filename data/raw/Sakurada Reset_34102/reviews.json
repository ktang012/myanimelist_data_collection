            "content": "Don't let the scores this show received on previews deceive you. this show is actually a Hidden gem among all the anime between this and spring season. is sad that this show received such a harsh treatment from many people with different opinions, like the show being slow, emotionless, boring, uninteresting, etc. but when it comes to its own merits, Sakurada Reset shines for being an Anime that does things well, yeah that's right, you won't see that many anime having a great plot without forgetting things they said and then doing otherwise. in Sakurada Reset case, it manages to stick to its own Ideaand expand it and manages to explain at least almost everything within time, the main problem is that the first half is a bit slow and the characters lacks a bit of emotions (well that's a kuudere for you) yet, that \"main problem\" is called development and slow pace, so that pretty much sums up for the things that scared people away, because its seen everywhere, you will see inpatient people that wants things to be fast, but when they get their explanation they either call it bullshit or probably gave up on the show a while ago. it makes me think that they would insta drop a long run Anime of more than 100 episodes just because the main character doesn't develop like they wanted in 4 episodes. even tho that some of these anime that goes further than 200 might end up sucking or transforming into the Dragon Ball formula of seeing who has the biggest dick. but judging an anime within the first episodes of a show that has more than 12 episodes is just plain nonsense, there are special cases where it can be right to bash over an anime in the beginning, for example a Generic Anime that you would know from the very beginning how will it end. but we are not here to talk about when to or when to not give up on a show so lets get started. there might be spoilers ahead, better be warned than get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of this anime happens on a City that goes by the name of Sakurada, which is special because the habitants of Sakurada has \\n\r\nsupernatural abilities, and very unique ones I must say, at least, there are somes that I consider unique. now, if people leaves the town of \\n\r\nSakurada, they will forget that they had an ability and everything related to abilities inside of Sakurada. (even though it might seem otherwise, this has an explanation)\\n\\n\r\nWe get to meet our main Characters: Asai Kei, Haruki Misora and Sumire Souma. they have powers that may be great if the three of them worked together, Asai Kei has the power of remember everything he sees and hear, Haruki Misora has the power to get back in time to a point where she saved. her power has some restrictions: she has to \"save\" a \"moment\" in time, once she reset, she is not able to save again unless 24 hours has passed from the last save point (preventing you from abusing this power) and in order to reset, she used to activate her power when she saw someone crying, but this changes later on. and we have Sumire Souma, her ability is a bit painful actually, since she can foresight things that might happen. by using this power, she made Kei and Misora meet each other, because she knew that they would make a good team/couple, mostly because Misora will not remember anything when she resets, she and every Sakurada Reset ability user that isn't Kei (and other exceptions), this way Kei would be the master key in order to fix the problem that made Misora reset. but even knowing what was the problem, that doesn't mean it will be easy to fix.\\n\\n\r\non the first half our duo will help people in need while they find answers on why Souma Died, they also will try to find more about them as persons (because them being almost emotionless, were one of the reasons why people gave up on this show so easily) this while confronting other ability users (I can feel the Influence of JoJo on this anime by the hands of David Productions, there are abilities that reminds me of some parts of the JoJo series) now, on the second half, is where this show goes all in revealing most of Sakurada's secrets, developing their characters on a really great way while solving certain cases that are very philosophical (one of the strongest things on this anime) as you might have noticed this anime requires very deep thinking, otherwise you would feel very lost if you don't pay attention. Because of how great Sakurada Reset manages to pull all together within the 2nd half and how great it manages to develop everything at the end, I'll give story an score of: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll combine Art and the Soundtrack into one section since there isn't much to say here. The animation is quite good overall, there are scenes that has a really deep impact while having a good harmony with the soundtrack, the show successfully manages to give you the right atmosphere on certain scenes that manages to hook you even more, mostly on the second half. tho it is completely worth it  because involves the characters while they are developing and showing how worth their development is. so for Art and Soundtrack, both goes by the score of: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLets head into one of the strongest things on this anime, the Characters. Even if they show themselves quite emotionless, they manage to develop really well in a very surprising way. they start getting more emotional within time while dealing with very philosophical and psychological events that will help them understand more about themselves, the story of Sakurada and the ability users. Asai Kei is a Mastermind when it comes to plans, even if his development sacrifices the development of the other characters (this since the resets of Misora will erase the development of the other characters that aren't Kei) he manages to go 7 steps ahead of everyone, he never ceases to amaze me when it comes to his risky but successful plans. Certainly, I wouldn't want him as a Villain, would be as smart as Aizen from Bleach. the other characters are still good, they will still develop, even if their progress get reset'd a couple of times. at least that development doesn't go to trash like for example in re:zero, where Subaru instead of growing into the right side, he lost his mind and pretty much destroys any development of everyone and himself (that until a blue haired person that I don't remember gets him some doses of \"Ubicatex\" (this is a spanish play word that means \"snap out of it\") so for the great development of these characters and their events, I'll give the characters\\n\r\na Score of: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nas for Enjoyment, if you aren't into a slow paced story with characters that will develop quite slowly, this show certainly might not be for you. but if you are patient enough, certainly this anime will keep you hooked and will reward those that sticks to the end. The more weeks I spent waiting for this show, the more worth it became. so within all that this show had to offer, my Enjoyment will be a score of: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.8/10 (9): an Anime that rewards those that explores deeply into the secrets this show has, Characters that develop greatly, and events that will keep you hooked with Philosophical and psychological touchs. quite underrated and overlooked by unpatient people.\\n",

            "content": "Considering that an article on this very site, written somewhere around the end of last season, has already declared this show to be a \"miss\" at its halfway point (real professional work there, guys, next time you should just rank animes based on their announcement PVs), and that most viewers have already decided  to drop the series in favour of the latest pseudo-hentai, harem LN adaptation, it might be far too late for me to write a review about this piece of work, killed before it ever had the chance to show its values, but I believe that Sakurada Reset deserves better.\r\nFirst, let's acknowledgereality, the show is not the second coming of your local salvation-based deity, it is definitely not for everyone. If you believe that anime, as a genre, should be solely about unadulterated entertainment of the most vulgar degrees, little girls fighting each other to the death, cow-titted, blonde onee-sans snuggling up to virginal heroes of godlike powers, or whatever the fuck you people see in those Eromanga-senseis and whatnot, then you'd do best avoiding this series, you will only be disappointed and will possibly whine about it being boring, confusing and seriously lacking in infantile erotic tension.If you, however, think that this is one of the greatest mediums to give an experience equally stimulating visually and intellectually, capable of opening your eyes to completely different points of view, then I highly recommend the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is about presenting the numerous way the people of Sakurada relate to other's and their own abilities, and how encounters with one another influence personal growth. It's not a world-changing great adventure or a hard struggle between embodiments of good and evil, even the larger scale events are given a personal grasp, as they are significant to the individual, but only mere episodes for the world in which those individuals exist.\\n\r\nAnd that's where the main focus lies, the characters. Again, if you are looking for the usual character tropes and typical over-the-top voice acting you get from My Little Tsundere Princess Sister And The Magical Academy Of Lightshow Battles, then you will most definitely find all the characters boring and empty. Each and every member of the cast is constructed in a layered fashion, first only providing the means for a surface-level understanding of their personalities (and that's the point where most viewer gave the series a 2/10 and quit), only to open up for us as our eyes into their world, Kei, begins to unravel the circumstances that lead them to this point in their lives, our encounter with them changing their views significantly, later appearances showing glances of their growths by the end of the series.\\n\r\nIn tandem with the aforementioned narrative focus, the characters of Sakurada Reset all act and emote in very human ways, they show subtle expressions while talking with normal tonality, the same way as any of us would in given conversations. Hell, one of the main point of the series is how the characters develop as they interact with others, the dialogues' unfolding nature serves this purpose perfectly, especially in Haruki's case, who goes from an extremely cold and emotionless presentation to become one of the most vibrantly expressive characters of the series.\\n\r\nSpoken lines do tend to be somewhat slow-paced and very philosophical in their nature, the characters often discuss thought experiments and theories in detail, and that too might be one of the reasons for the hasty abandonment of the series by those who mainly use philosophy books (provided that they ever held one in their hands) to find every single mention of a phallus, but in my opinion, they work in context, expand the narrative and fit the more contemplative tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother complaint aimed at the show was its visuals. Without going on a rant or a needlessly long-winded analysis (like I kinda did in the last section), it seems to me that these arguments could be connected to, yet again, the large masses' expectations. This is neither the diabetic world of moe animes, neither the visual orgies of a Shinkai Makoto or ufotable project, the colour scheme is a very relaxing one and the designs are in no way flashy or complicated. Despite all that, I can state with all honesty that the visuals are perfectly satisfactory. They don't draw attention away from the dialogues, are pleasant to look at and even without jaw-dropping animation, the proficient work of David Production often manages to create captivating imagery through the simplistic beauty found in the carefully composed frames.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more to talk about when it comes to this series, but I don't think my dreary essay here is not the right way to approach the matter. Rather than that, I would like to encourage every single person who took their time to read this review to join the conversation and discuss this anime. I've been tastelessly positive in these (not so) brief paragraphs, there are many positives and negative to be found here, far more than I ever cared to mention, but I believe that all of that should be said and seen by many more than the few who humoured this narcissistic nerd for the time of a review.\\n\r\nIf I could ask one thing from you, dear reader, I would like you to look beyond the premature denouncement and check out this anime, form your own opinion about it based on what you actually get and not on the popular trends that exist on an entirely different side of the medium!\\n\\n\r\nGive Sakurada Reset the chance it never got, the chance to give its audience the experience it meant to!",

            "content": "Hey, do you know that show called Monogatari? If you do, try to imagine Monogatari, that show which is full of dialogue and most of its big moments are also dialogues, that show that bended the \"show don't tell\" rule and made it its bitch, and then take every person from the staff that worked on it, including Nisiosin, Akiyuki Shinbou, everyone that had any creative input in it, and give it to people who can't comprehend how to make it interesting at all. Oh, and don't forget to also get Takayama Katsuhiko to do the series composition. You know, the guy who wrote thescript for Boku No Pico, and whose last big project was Big Order.\\n\r\nI have no legitimate idea who thought that this is the team that can be creative enough, to turn a light novel story, that's really heavy on exposition, slow and hard to consume on its own for sure, into a story inside of a visual medium, but let me tell you, they were wrong in all the worst ways imaginable.\\n\r\nLadies, gentlemen, I present this review which I humbly wrote about a series, that I'm pretty sure had less passion while being developed, than I had while writing this analysis.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers past this section*\\n\\n\r\nSuperpowers aren't a new idea, neither is one of them being controlled by the government, but there are titles coming out each year that are able to do some good with such topics. My Hero Academia, Captain America: Winter Soldier and the X-Men comics are just a few that immediately come to my mind. All of them have found a way to create worlds around such ideas and adapt their plot to play to its strengths. Sakurada Reset attempts to do it, but it fumbles at every point and every corner, creating a huge jumble of ultimate nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in Sakurada, that has been a place where all sorts of powers have sprouted out of nowhere and have been taking the place by storm. The things have been calmed down and controlled by the Administration Bureau, that has been controlling and ministering over the area. Thanks to that, Sakurada is able to continue with its everyday flow and the abilities become a common thing, a part of an everyday life. However, the trick is, the abilities do not spread, they're contained within Sakurada and everyone who walks outside of its boundary immediately loses all memories of them even existing.\\n\r\nOne day, a boy by the name Asai Kei enters Sakurada, and it turns out that his ability is ultimate memory, which allows him to remember everything no matter how his memories are altered. Years pass, and one day, during school, he meets a girl - Haruki Misora - that can reset the world to the state at the time when she has last \"saved\". Combined, they are able to do great things, as Kei is able to plan out and fix problems that arise due to his perfect memory. Their story leads them to a lot of pain, a death of a friend, a fight against those who despise powers, but also joy that they see through helping the community and the happiness they find in each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's problems are somewhat weird, especially pacing-wise. It begins two years before the actual events, when Kei, Haruki and Sumire Souma meet and solve their first case together, which later one becomes a basis for them helping other people out. The pacing in those first episodes is extremely fast and unapologetic, it doesn't care if you didn't catch something, you're just supposed to have understood everything in between the stupidly fast transitions. Considering that those beginning moments of the show are supposed to introduce you to the concept of powers and set up the entire drama later on, I don't think I need to say much more about why that is a bad thing.\\n\r\nBut to add salt to the injury, every problem that the show struggles with in general is present this early on as well, which is both weird and sort of funny at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThat's because despite the fast transitions and scenes generally passing by like flies, the show is surprisingly slow in the delivery of each line. You can spot awkward pauses everywhere, there are those empty, 5-10 seconds breaks during dialogues. They really become apparent in the third and fourth arc, but they're there from the beginning, and they're quite hurtful to the flow of the conversation and the general pace of the anime. It feels like they're there to sort of fill out the time instead of doing something meaningful. You might ask \"How is it possible that the early scenes go by so fast if the scenes themselves are so slow?\". It's simple, the scenes are slow, but they're just short early on, and it's only later that it becomes a serious issue, when they start becoming longer. And what makes it worse, there's a distinct lack of anything interesting going on with the show's visuals.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very beginning of this review I mentioned Monogatari, and I did that for the purpose of making you, the reader of this review understand something. If you've watched Monogatari you've obviously noticed its style, its distinct way with visuals and how it enhances dialogue that would normally feel dreadful and boring. There's tons of visual gags, characters screw around in the background, the art style changes on a lot of occasions, most metaphors are visualized and generally the show is just interesting to look at, even though most of the information you get is through the characters talking. Despite the silliness however, it's still able to maintain the  seriousness and groundedness that Sakurada tries so hard to achieve with its \"serious conversations\" or the \"focused visuals\". You know why that is? Because its writing is good enough so that it's able to create those serious scenes whenever it wants to. Sakurada Reset feels like it doesn't believe in its writing or characterization enough for the viewer to continue following them through if there's something else going on on the screen. That wouldn't even be that bad, but the show looks horrendous. Everything is plain, the designs are boring and have absolutely nothing to them, the background art is often nonexistent or cut out due to the camera placement. The animation for what I'd say is over 60% of the show consists of still shots and characters with their moving mouths.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show's so boring to look at, my questions is: why is it an anime? Why did this story have to be recreated in this medium? If the director has no inspiration to add any personality, humanity or individuality to the show, if the background artists are doing only what's necessary, if the show doesn't have anything special going for it visually, the what's the point of LOOKING at the show? Hell, this adaptation goes even further, as it HURTS the plot with the previously mentioned awkward, soundless pauses, the lack of emotions on character's faces, and the mostly uninspired designs of everything you look at. It just throws you off from the start and never draws you in again.\\n\\n\r\nBut those are technical things, those don't matter right? Let's talk about....\\n\\n\r\nNO!\\n\\n\r\nPeople! Stop undervaluing the influence of the things you look at in anime. If the thing you're looking at does nothing to even attempt to adapt to the medium that IT CHOSE, then why should you, as a viewer, adapt to the the way it's presented to even digest it? Goddamn Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979, freaking Serial Experiments Lain from 1998, name any other show from god knows how long ago, and all of them, despite looking like they're drawn in Microsoft Paint at times, are able to create style, atmosphere and designs that integrate into the experience, creating a distinct feeling to them. Sakurada Reset is content with being the most limited and basic version of itself imaginable. It's fine with the bare minimum if it just means it can tell a story. Where's the passion? Where's the love for the project that you're working on? This show feels like it was more of a chore to make rather than something that anyone wanted to work on. It's disgusting, repulsive even. While watching, you can basically feel as if nobody wanted this project to work out. Well, maybe there's someone...\\n\\n\r\nI'd argue that if someone feels like they tried it's the original creator. This is light novel writing through and through, and every amateur mistake is there. From the lazy exposition where Kei or others go out of their character to explain things to the viewer; the lack of proper explanation of the powers, that leaves up countless possibilities, which end up feeling like conveniences; and the clear struggles of the author as he tries to get from point A to point B, desperately setting things so his vision can finally take place. He clearly had ideas and did some research, but he's just not a good writer. He lacks subtlety and understanding of the people he's catering to. He believes that if he didn't understand something before writing about it, then we also won't, so he forces explanation into the plot, be that either some storytelling term or a psychological one. He doesn't use those dialogues to contextualize the world or the characters, the most you'll get is that Kei reads philosophy, apparently. The author also ends up making the characters, especially the side cast, feel like devices to fit the finale rather than the fully realized ones. He gives them those mini-arcs that, he thinks, are enough to justify the characters' existence, but that's not true. It's hard to say if it's a case of lackluster experience, lack of time, or anything else, but even though the plot is a mess, you can't say it lacks ideas or creativity in what it ended up being. It's just the execution that sucks. Nobody thought about working out those issues.\\n\\n\r\nLet me go back a little bit and talk about the way this show uses its characters. What I mentioned is unfortunately true to the core. Characters end up feeling like they exist just so that their power can be in the story, and the writer gave them interactions and moments so they won't be considered as plot devices. Bad news: they are still plot devices.\\n\r\nDespite quite a few characters that the show attempts to get through something, there are pretty much no implications for them before, during, or after they're done with the things they need to do. Their shown only when they're absolutely needed, in situations where it's necessary for them or their powers to exist. When Haruka needs to express emotions that she can't show to Kei, she talks with the cat girl that she met before. She never really seems to have any internalized monologues, none of the characters do, they have to express it out unless it's something that has to be explained to the viewer. Most lack stances on the world, they lack personalities and reasons to exist, it's impossible to see them actually live inside that world, outside of the events that the show presents. They're puppets, moving when they are picked up and put down when another puppet has to step in. Can you tell me what life does Ukawa lead? Can you tell me what personality does she showcase in conversations? What about Murase? Oka Eri? You can't. As I said, they are puppets, they're not characters, but the show pushes in this bullshit narrative and character arcs for each of them as if they were meant to be. They exist so that their powers can be used in the finale, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nI said that the characters don't feel like they couldn't fit in casual situations, but are there situations like that in this show? To be honest, not at all, but the show tries to hide that fact. The problem is, it does it really poorly. I'd compare it to someone who's really fat trying to hide behind a pole. There's obviously a large part of his body sticking out. same goes for those \"casual\" conversations in Sakurada. They try to showcase those dialogues between Kei and Haruka, but all they, or anyone in fact talk about are psychological scenarios and terms. Let me show you two supposedly laid-back conversations from this show:\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey, what are you thinking about\"\\n\r\n\"Have you heard of the Swampman?\"\\n\r\n\"No, what is that?\"\\n\r\nProceeds to explain the entire idea of the Swampman\\n\\n\r\n\"Your notebook was new today\"\\n\r\n\"Yeah\"\\n\r\n\"It's almost like as if a new world was born today\"\\n\r\n\"You mean like the Five-minute Hypothesis?\"\\n\r\n\"Yes. It's a thought experiment....\"\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them are clear and lazy attempts at explaining the viewer a concept that will appear, or has already appeared in the story, NOT casual conversations that those two characters would have. I heard so many times that this show is good at foreshadowing or that it requires lots of thought to understand, but I can't phatom anyone thinking that this is well written in. The main character explains everything before you can even think, like that time when a monster appeared representing some character, and the MC just, straight up, explained his design. That design was probably the most creative thing that happened in this show ever since they introduced the concept of powers, but nope, you don't get to understand it, the show understands it for you. It's aggravating to me as the viewer, the show doesn't have to implement those explanations into the narrative, nobody needs to hear about what they're called unless the characters can develop perspectives on them, which in turn can lead to several narrative uses or make for interesting character studies. Of course this show doesn't use them that way. Ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo if the casual conversations are ruined, and you can't enjoy thinking about the show since it's done for you, can you at least follow the mystery properly? No. The powers haven't been explored or given enough room for that to be available. Can you at least look at the things as they uncover, since the plot has some heart? Well, seems like you forgot that looking at it isn't fun at all too. Well, I think I can say this show is worthless now.\\n\\n\r\nI said all that I needed to about Sakurada Reset in the last paragraph alone, there's very little that I can add to it. If something, I guess I have to commend it that it capitalizes off of the characters and lets them grow with the story, but again, that's only noticeable because the show decides \"Oh well, they're different people now\", not because it's something that comes naturally, that you can see for yourself through their choices and interactions. There's nothing in their behavior or thought process that changes, even though they underwent this \"big\" change. The same tone, the same facial expressions, the same mannerisms, the same thinking process, all remains just as it was. It's just that now, they apparently have a different opinion on something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show lacks any sort of real value, both as an experience and as a piece of art, if you can even call it that. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm done.\\n\\n\r\nAs always this is purely my opinion, but I can't encourage you to develop your own. Watch at your own risk.",

            "content": "Every season has its crop of shows that just simply aren't up to snuff, and Spring 2017 is no different. Sakurada Reset, however, manages to blow all the other bad shows out of the water with just how awful it is. It attempts to lure you in with a fairly interesting gimmick about time travel and super powers, but once you actually start watching it's all downhill from there.\r\nEpisode 1: Right away you can tell that something is wrong with this show. For one, the characters do not feel like actual people. You can count the amount of time that the MC blinks on asingle hand, and all camera shots are static without any feeling or depth to them. The way the characters robotically say their lines as if reading off of a script provides no entertainment for the viewer. The episode drags on endlessly due to its slow pacing and massive amounts of just dialogue. However, the first episode is just the tip of the iceberg. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2: Reset was fairly mediocre during its first episode, with the concept of different abilities carrying the show quite heavily. But even an interesting concept can't carry the show through the absolute garbage it's about to slog through. The previous problems of the first episode only intensify, and often there are moments where absolutely nothing happens and the two characters are just staring at each other in silence. Two new characters are brought in whose powers are extremely plot convenient and lazy. Logic that no human would ever think of is used to solve the episode's problems, all while the main characters stare blankly into space with no hint of emotion. The convoluted plot progression is extremely hard to follow and makes for a confusing watch. Not to mention that the episode is horribly paced and drags on like the previous episode. \\n\\n\r\nDoes Reset have the potential to pick itself back up? Honestly at this point it's extremely hard to tell. Even as someone who has begrudgingly followed the show for the past four weeks, I still don't know what exactly this show is and what it wants to do.\\n\\n\r\nAt some points you will start laughing not because of what's happening in the show, but rather the absurdity of the character's decisions and the irregularity of the show's art and animation. As such, I'd only advise watching this show if you're extremely starved for a series about time-travel and/or you're a masochist who likes watching bad shows. If my thoughts on this show change in the coming weeks I'll come back and revise my opinion, but that possibility is extremely unlikely.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 edit: Hasn't been as garbage as the first two episodes, but still has not  improved enough to change my opinion.",

            "content": "\"Who owns the McGuffin will control all the abilities in Sakurada\" Don't worry, the McGuffin meaning is complicated, but at the end, we could understand it ... or not.\r\nThe weighted score and negative reviews scared a lot of the persons around. The complexity in the first episodes was the escape route for a lot of individuals. Gladly, I decided to continue with the story, and I am not disappointed. \r\nI consider this story very complicated, and you need to pay extra attention to the details. That is the reason why at first in the building, several users complained about the pacing and the boredom. \r\nThestory. All the persons in a city (Sakurada or Sagrada) were born with some power. Kei Asai has a particular power, he can remember everything and with the help, Haruki Misura that can restore the time back to some days, work as a team to help the persons of the city with complicated matters and situations that affect their world. If a person leaves, the city will forget that has power, but it isn't the case of Kei. He can't forget anything. \\n\\n\r\nIn the development of the story, there are several changes, conspirations, situations, actions, a twist of the story, unexpected correlations, new powers, cats, etc. I decided not telling more because the most positive aspect of this animation is the story, \\n\\n\r\nThe characters. The complexity of each character is great. In this story, we don't have a generic nature. All of them are needed in a certain way to maintain the balance in the whole story. Each character has different powers, but not in the way that are OVERPOWERED. They have a single power that could affect the environment but needs the support of other characters to do it. In other words, a simple being can't alter the story. The personality of them is flawless. Each character has needs, and take decisions based on that needs, has doubts and ideas. The building of each person that appeared in the story could be complex, but it is in a right way. Each arc will affect a group of characters, but you need to pay attention to the details because in the next episodes all that information is going to be needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art maybe is considered average. It is passable, and I am sure that the art group didn't care about it because they focused on the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. All the ED (1, 2) and OP (1, 2) are good. However, I liked the first OP and the second ED. The sound mix is standard. They don't need a complex mix here, so they did good work. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I understand that the first episodes are complex. The story could seem tedious, but after some episodes, all start changing. We will know the reason for all the details. Sakurada is like Charlotte, and we won't understand what is happening until the end. If you like good stories that aren't predictable, then this anime is a good option. If you are seeking fights, several actions and excessive use of powers, then you should just skip it. This animation isn't for everyone.  \\n",

            "content": "Here's a quick summary: The first 2 episodes suck ass, judge it after watching episodes 3 and 4. Episode 4 is where it starts to get real, the characters seem lifeless but they will get better.\r\nStory: (9/10) (it only says 10/10 because that 6.66 is bs)\r\n    Sakurada is a town that is disconnected from the rest of the world where everyone living their openly show their powers yet no one outside knows about this.\r\n   It starts of with Haruki a girl who can turn back time for 3 days but is useless since her memories revert back as well, Keithe guy who has picture perfect memory and is able to affect Haruki's reset. If it seems interesting now stick to that feeling cause you're in for a really shitty first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n    While it is a super power anime it more so focuses on out smarting you opponent rather than blasting him to pieces and the way their powers interact with one another and how they use it to their advantage is something to note.\\n\\n\r\n   The story telling while it may seem very poor at first it gradually improves over time and at a certain point everything that takes place will make sense, especially everything that Souma has been referencing up to this point. \\n\\n\r\n   The main reason why everyone has been dropping this anime is because of the atrocious first few episodes. Feeling rushed and unpolished, leaving no room for logical thinking cause they literally straight up tell you what their powers are and what the specifics are instead of determining that for yourself and also these random ass quotes (that will make sense in the future) that try too make it sound cool.\\n\\n\r\n   I as well felt that the story telling was trash almost even dropping it. But it makes up for the next few episodes where they tie things up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n   The characters seem lifeless with no emotions, speaking in monotones and a boring personality it's very obvious.\\n\\n\r\n   But their character do develop, it might not be a very drastic (like Midoriya from BNHA) but you know they are improving you just have to look closer, in how they speak in how they interact with one another and their gestures. \\n\\n\r\n  They may not break down crying when their sad or clench their teeth and grip their fist when their furious but you can still feel them.\\n\\n\r\n   Like Haruki's motionlessness and slight pulsing of the eyes when she felt extreme sadness or Kei's, when he's sad is a bit more submissive and speaks his mind less and is lost in thought. These slight nuances make their character.\\n\\n\r\n   Their development while kind of obvious some people miss, like when Haruki's is in complete distrust with Kei due to the fact that he can use her ability to his advantage and eventually instead of not trusting she doesn't follow anyone but him. There's a lot more to talk about, but then I'd be spoiling it.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\n   The art is beautiful and the VA's and SFX do a great job. Even while speaking in monotones they never seem \"unlike\" the character and the slight nuances to the way they speak also shapes the characters really well.\\n\\n\r\n   You can really tell they spent a great deal of time in this, especially to the animation (even more specifically to that wave scene, must've taken half their budget for that)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\n   While it may seem like shit at first they really fix things up in the later episodes. This is also quickly becoming one of my favorite Mystery anime of all time (maybe even better than Another, Shiki, Hyouka). \\n\\n\r\n  What you have to do is stick to that synopsis and how good it sounds, but most important of all is keep an open mind because even a piece of gold is shit if you keep perceiving it like shit.",

Because the story unravel at episode 6, and at episode 10 the story actually begin and more engaging. \r\nYes the first time you watch this anime the character is boring, the story didn't really tell, and so on. I have the same thought when i watch those first three episode. But the more episode i watch the more engaging the story has become. \r\nI think sakurada reset isn't for anyone,if you watch anime for fun or want \"normal\" approach. If i make comparison with other anime it isn't charlotte but \"Subete Ga F ni Naru\". The story didn't immediately start, it take some time with small hints here and there. I think watching this anime on weekly basis is a torture. I recommend to watch this anime when it Completed. \\n",

But it may not be a master piece, and I also have to wait for the rest of the four episode.\r\nThis anime is plot heavy, it involves a lot of dialogues but not very much action scenes. It has a large amount of dialogues because it needs them to explain the motivation of each character and how the abilities are working together to create the result. I was notpaying full attention when I watched the first three episodes and already feel falling behind the plot, therefore I go back and re-watched the first three, and never put my attention on other things when I watched the later episodes. Even with my full attention I still need to pause the anime to let the plot digest a bit from time to time, and so far everything is making sense to me, and sometimes even trigger me to think about the philosophy it is trying to express.\\n\\n\r\nTo avoid each part of the story being stretched too long for the audience to keep track with, the anime separate itself into different \"small\" stories or events. This is the first time I've seen an anime presented in this style, and for me it works pretty well. At the beginning of each new story, it will tell you how many episodes this story will last, and therefore give you an overall sense of how complex this story is going to be. Normally telling the audience when the current event is going to end won't work very well, because most of the stories in anime are not very deep. However, this design works well with this particular anime because the plot is deep already, and telling the audiences how long the story is going to last will keep the entire season at a steady pace. And even you already know how long this story is going to last, you still won't guess what will happen in the last episode, so knowing which episode is going to be the end of the current event actually make me more exciting and anticipating for the final showdown.\\n\\n\r\nRight now, too many animes are filled with service scenes for both male and female audiences, and the stories are often too boring to be bothered. A lot of people are complaining about this phenomenon yet here is an anime with a real story and people are giving it a low score because they didn't really use their brain to watch it? It just makes me feel like we deserve all those trash animes because when there is finally a great anime, we are not appreciating it.\\n\\n\r\nLast word: if you don't understand a thing, don't rate it.",

            "content": "After the first 3 episodes of this show, I was ready to pick apart every single flaw and problem that this show had. I was so enraged at the lack of quality that had made up the first three episodes. This was going to be my magnum opus review where I shredded apart this show and exposed it bare for the lack of quality that it was. \r\nBut then something happened. It suddenly stopped sucking. Maybe it was Amazon treating the subs better or maybe it was the show having a clearer idea of what it was doing. Either way it got better. Not good,but better. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then came the last arc in which finally Sakurada Reset finally knew what it was doing and turned itself into an enjoyable and actually good show. \\n\\n\r\nFor one arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad fact is, besides the one arc the show is still overall sub par. Even in its best arc the direction is still lacking and the art is so bland and featureless that it adds nothing to the show. Often times it looks like they aren't even trying as there are no real directing cues, or moments with more than bland featureless art. It's all the same dull looking and unexpressive views that don't add anything over and over again. The voice acting as well as too monotone and while it does lead to a certain atmosphere, it also hinders the emotional impact of the work, and also conflicts with one of the shows biggest problems: Convolution.\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset is a fan of Convolution. It likes to make nothing simple. If there ever where a simple answer, Sakurada Reset would find some way to go around it. There is one lady whom one has to phone 5 times just to get her to pick up and talk. Why is this done? Convolution. They talk in metaphors and in psychology more than they talk one on one. And while that can be interesting at times. When done too much it gets overdosed and ends up saturating the show with too much of that. It makes the connection between the characters feel less human and feel less realistic. It makes the characters themselves feel less realistic They don't feel like humans anymore rather like machines or some other entity. It makes the show fall apart. \\n\\n\r\nAdded to that is a script that is awful at best. The line \"If you ask me, I'd say I'm on the talkative side, and I'm pretty expressive. My name is Kei Asai.\" sums up its problems very well. First off that's a lie. He's not expressive, and if the show thinks he is then they've failed at expressing that. Second off, no one talks like that. The formatting is all wrong and doesn't make much sense. Third off he's telling this to one of his best friends (whom promptly matters very little afterwards) not a stranger. It comes off as a poor attempt to explain the characters to us even though it makes no sense in context. Characters are best built by actions not poor explanations like this. The worst of the lot was when a character said, \"I'm not sad. You're the one who's sad., I'm crying because you're sad.\" after an event that was very impactful on their own life. It was so completely out of left field and unnatural that it was hard to take the show seriously after that. If someone is really going to play that card after the serious event that happened, then that person is lacking in humanity.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of these traits the characters don't really develop until the end. Even then the development is quite confusing. The characters are so convoluted themselves that it's hard to take anything at face value. Sometimes I feel like simplicity is underrated. One can get across clear strong messages easily by going for something simple, clear, and definitive. But since Sakurada doesn't like any of that. It makes a game of trying to figure out everything from the statements that are made and the ways that the characters talk to each other. Not to mention a lot of what actually is there isn't anything that interesting. Most of it ends up in characters that love the MC, which isn't really well written. One character is defined by her love for the MC and basically does everything for him and because of him. It's shallow characterization and it's annoying to see a one-dimensional character devoid of development even throughout 24 episodes. While it does actually get put in depth later and does have some merit, for most of the show it's shallow and boring.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all of the information that Sakurada Reset gives and among all its conversations, it's very boring and hard to follow due to those convolutions, a lack of directness and a lack of expression in the art, direction, and sound. It takes a lot of effort to watch for no real reward and overall it just isn't any good. The worst of which is episode 11 which has to be one of the worst episodes I've ever watched, due to how boring and frustrating it was.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that last arc does work well. The script did get a bit better over time, and as soon as it shifted into mindgame time the show actually worked. It was still confusing but at least there was a pay off for its confusing moments. There was a reason to follow their lines of logic and there was a reason for the characters to code their messages more. While there were mindgames before none were as direct as they were in the last arc and they never worked as well as in the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the last arc worked well, sadly a final arc can't save a show. For the most of it's run it wasn't any good and was a pain to watch. Just because the last 5 episodes are decent doesn't make the first episodes worth it anymore. Even though I did like those last episodes I still wouldn't recommend it to others because to get to them one would have to wade through a lot of crap. And frankly, it's not worth it. If you like overly convoluted and dialogue heavy works you might like this. However if you can't stand boring visuals or can't put up with trying to decode everything including the mangled thing they called a script, it's not worth your time and you're best off not watching it.",

            "content": "in watching sakurada reset, i found myself reminded of works by james joyce, franz kafka, and arthur conan doyle. like joyce's works, information in sakurada reset is presented on several different levels simultaneously and does require a bit of effort to unravel, which [depending on your point of view] could either be refreshing, or simply make your head hurt.\r\ni also found several points in common with other anime, such as steins;gate, occultic;nine, the kubikiri cycle, and others of the genre. sakurada reset is, at its most basic, a mystery. if you like puzzles and thinking about things, and won't complain if there's no fanservice, ecchi,or action scenes, then this anime may appeal to you. since the progress of the anime is driven almost exclusively by dialog, you may get bored if you prefer anime that are action-driven, but you'll most likely enjoy it if you get into character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nlike the other anime i mention above, sakurada reset involves a level of intellectual abstraction that leads to a certain mood. the characters' dialog, plot development, even the visual composition tend away from the concrete and toward the symbolic and metaphorical, following methods similar to those commonly used in existential and surrealist literature. indeed, many times in sakurada reset, i was reminded of kafka's 'der proze\u00df' -- not from the way the plot developed, but rather due to the interactions of the characters ; often, they simply accept at face value what is happening to them [or the answers others give their questions] -- never really fighting it, or even questioning deeply at all, but rather blindly going along, surrendering their own power to vague, ambiguous, anonymous forces hidden from us behind amorphous names like 'the bureau'. even people who work for the bureau are doing this, so we are left wondering ... 'who' is ultimately responsible ?\\n\\n\r\nthere is also a sort of 'absurdism' in sakurada reset that reminds me of kafka's 'die verwandlung'. the salesman in 'die verwandlung' simply accepts his strange mutation without looking deeper. simiarly, in sakurada reset, once again, many of the characters just sort of accept some very strange circumstances or people's behaviours without looking deeper, as though it were somehow 'obvious'. furthermore, often the characters in sakurada reset speak completely openly and plainly, without any hint of self-protective evasion or pretense -- even when doing so would quite obviously place them in danger -- which adds to the absurdist feel. all of this serves to create a mood which is sometimes very strange, but also charming, in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nalso like the other anime i mention, the main story acts as a vehicle for a philosophical viewpoint [which i won't spoil here... ;) ]. it's unfortunate that there typically isn't a 'philosophical' category in the genre listings, these would all most likely have that tag.\\n\\n\r\nalthough there is a superficial similarity to other anime where the characters have extraordinary powers [such as 'charlotte', for example], that's really about as far as that goes. instead, i get a distinct surrealist vibe woven intricately into a long story with many apparent contradictions that aren't resolved until much later.\\n\\n\r\nspeaking from a technical standpoint, there's nothing earth-shattering here ; both the art and sound are respectable, and about what you should expect.\\n",

The plot twist that happened in order to explain the connection that everything had was just plain fenomenal.\r\nThis show started really slow but it suddently improved a lot by keeping this mystery alive, Soma Sumire had to be one of the best plot triggers I have ever seen in an anime.\r\nThe main caracter AsaiKei is just plain smart and has a really nice line of thought in the whole series. The other main caracter, the girl \"Haruki Misora\" comes off as the plain type of girl but i do feel things will change as the series goes on.\\n\r\nRight now im very satisfied with the whole developtment of the series so far and i hope things will keep on getting more and more interesting.\\n\r\nI'd rate an 8 overall but things might change for better or worse as time goes by.\\n\r\nIf you've dropped this series be sure to pick it back up cause i'm sure you won't regret it.

            "content": "Damn the current description on MAL really sucks. Can someone accept my translation of the official synopsis that I submitted a few days ago? Because I feel like with that description, being what many people see before they watch the show, really screws up people's expectations on it.\r\nSo, the premise of this story is that a friend (Sumire here on) of our protagonist(s) (Kei and Haruki) has set up a mystery, and they are going to figure it out because that friend killed herself, and solving that mystery eventually (sort of) resurrects her. NOT \"guy uses superpower to overthrow the authority in a town ofsuperpowers\", or \"club solves problems issued by the authority\"!\\n\\n\r\nFirst three episodes are focused on setting things up, showing the world to the viewer, and establishing a reason to care about Sumire's death in ep3. The rest of the first half is where some seemingly random things happen, and they end up having a chance to sort of resurrect Sumire.\\n\\n\r\nSecond half explores what Sumire's plan actually was, and more and more things clear up about her, and probably Kei's past as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story requires people to have enough interest to stay until they realize Sumire is able to see the future and munipulate it to some point. And that everyone apart from Kei and Haruki has vivid emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is at times quite dull though. Really, there are a few 5+ second still frames of just, say, Kei's face. Sure that shot is still, but they could've at least added a bloody blink or a bit of wind or even a slight camera movement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. in my opinion, music is nice, story is great and would be agreed if it wasn't a weekly show, characters are interesting if you're willing to think a bit, and I enjoy it a lot.",

            "content": "\u201cBoring story, unrealistic characters, and too much dialogue.\u201d\r\nThese complaints are thrown around a lot when it comes to this show (the former two more than the latter), and while you can easily substitute those complaints with \u201dslow-burning\u201d, \u201cstoic\u201d and \u201cdialog-heavy\u201d, the 6.63 it got on here makes it obvious that there is something about this show that just doesn\u2019t click with the audience.\r\n   Now, I\u2019m not here to tell you that those complaints are invalid (because they aren\u2019t) all I\u2019m trying to do here is explain why those aspects aren\u2019t hindering my enjoyment.\r\nI\u2019ll start by addressing the pacing, from there on I canaddress the other two complaints.\\n\r\n   This show is an incredibly slow-burn, and it\u2019s easy to see how this puts off a lot of viewers. But what made me like this pacing has to do with the characters. It\u2019s immediately clear that something is off about them; the pseudo-philosophy, static demeanour and emotionless voices- this is what got me interested. \\n\r\n   One of the questions presented in the first episode is if a machine with human aspects should be considered a human. At first, I thought it was just trying to shoehorn in as much philosophy in its 24-minute runtime, but as I got further into the series I started to realise what they meant by it. \\n\r\n   You should not see these people as real humans. That will only leave you with disappointment. Instead, you should see them as characters, and it\u2019s your job to pick out the human parts to latch onto.\\n\r\n   This may just sound like a bad excuse for badly written characters, and yeah, maybe it is. But for me, it\u2019s something special, something I can look forward to every week.\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019m done with my little soapbox speech, I\u2019ll start with the more objective aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, about what you\u2019d expect from anime in 2017, but the lack of movement may be a deal-breaker for you if the dialogue isn\u2019t enough to keep you watching. And some characters were off-model in the last episode (13).\\n\r\n   The sound is excellent for what it is. It\u2019s used very conservatively, and that works in its favour. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my ramblings. I\u2019m not good at putting my thoughts into words, and this was my first attempt at writing a review, so please do not hesitate to tell me your criticisms. \\n",

            "content": "I am just copy pasting my reddit post instead of writing a new review. This review will spoil the first episode of the anime: \r\nI believe that the synopsis of the series makes **Sakurada Reset** seem like a high school superpower show while the first few episodes of the series makes it seem like a show where very very boring and dull characters solve other people's problems (like finding a cat) with the help of their abilities. T Both the synopsis and the first few (mini) arcs of the anime give the wrong impression of what this anime is really about. To anyone considering givingit a watch : it is in no way similar to Oregairu just because it has a \"service\" club, neither is it similar to Charlotte because it features teenagers with \"superpowers\". \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere are the things I really liked about Sakurada Reset: \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n#Thought experiments that might seem meaningless at first but are actually central to the overarching plot of the show:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first 2 arcs of the story, **Sakurada Reset** will often bore you with its long and \"boring\" (duh!) dialogues. What makes it \"worse\" is the fact that the main characters *Haruki Misora* and *Asai Kei* are very monotonous and show almost no emotions at all when talking. But I can assure you that every dialogue however meaningless it may seem has a significance in the long run. You often have to listen and follow the dialogues carefully to understand what they actually discuss and even then the reason to why they are even discussed might not make sense. **At first**. But as the story progresses you understand bit by bit what those boring conversations with out of place thought experiments actually implied, and that is when everything starts to make sense. What **Sakurada Reset** excels in is to actually make those philosophical ideas central to the story, instead of just mentioning them to seem smart *Cough* Anthropologist *Cough*.  Another aspect **Sakurada Reset** excels in is that the author doesn't try to insert his own views in the show and give his answers to those said thought experiments. Instead he lets the viewer come up with an answer of their own. One of these philosophical thought experiments is the famous Swampman experiment introduced by Donald Davidson in 1987: \\n\\n\r\nSuppose Davidson goes hiking in the swamp and is struck and killed by a lightning bolt. At the same time, nearby in the swamp another lightning bolt spontaneously rearranges a bunch of molecules such that, entirely by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form that Davidson's body had at the moment of his untimely death. This being, whom Davidson terms \"Swampman,\" has, of course, a brain which is structurally identical to that which Davidson had, and will thus, presumably, behave exactly as Davidson would have. He will walk out of the swamp, return to Davidson's office at Berkeley, and write the same essays he would have written; he will interact like an amicable person with all of Davidson's friends and family, and so forth.\\n\\n\\n\r\n **Sakurada Reset** takes a lot of different approaches to introduce this thought experiment. At first it is introduced by Souma Sumire - the deuteragonist of the story. She challenges Kei and Haruki with the question \"Who is the android?\" which the series will eventually give an answer to, while the viewer can come up with a totally different but equally correct answer. Later in the (first) same episode Kei is challenged by Souma Sumire with yet another question:\\n\\n\r\nSouma : \"God placed a curse on a young man. It was a curse that shot pain through the man's entire body when he came across a sad person. To avoid his pain the young man reached out to the sad people... Next, God made a fake copy of the young man. The copy had no will of its own, so it did the same thing the real young man did. The fake also reached out to the sad people. God gave the young man and the fake each, names of their own. \u5584(Zen) - Good/Goodness for one and \u507d\u5584(Gizen) - Hypocrisy for the other. Which one is 'Zen' and which one is 'Gizen'?\" \\n\\n\r\nWhile this might seem like an easy question what actually bewilders me is how central to the plot of the series this thought experiment is. It might seem like this question is only of importance to the first arc of the story, but is actually part of much more grand and tragic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are far more philosophical thought experiments in the series like \"Plank of Carneades\" and more revolving around the idea of a Swampman. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\n#The symbolic characters of Sakurada Reset\\n\\n\r\nHaruki Misora - one of the three main characters of the series has the ability to reset/rewind the world back(the universe/space itself gets rearranged into its prior state rather than time itself being rewound) to a certain point in time - longest three days prior. Every time she sees someone crying she uses her ability and resets time. She is overly empathetic and feels the sadness of the whole world. This has led to her losing her sense of self. In order to make the right choices she has given up on her emotions and sense of self. She is the personification of \u5584(Zen) - Goodness. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAsai Kei - the male lead of the series has the ability to recall everything he has experienced in detail, which also means that he can retain his memories when Haruki resets the world, although even she herself forgets everything. His powers combined with Haruki's ability basically gives them the ability to \"travel in time\"(There will be a ton of creative ability combinations in the series). Haruki Misora - the \u5584(Zen) is his ideal. He wishes to be all good, but all he can become is \u507d\u5584(Gizen). While seeing Haruki as an all good, a perfect being, he wishes for her to have an ordinary life - thus destroying the very thing he believes is beautiful. This act while being a \"betrayal\" against his ideals, is also righteous as he values a stranger's happiness more than his own ideals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSouma Sumire  is the deuteragonist of the story. While the story mainly revolves around the protagonists - Asai Kei and Haruki Misora, she sets up the conditions for their meeting. Her role is very central to the plot. I believe it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that she symbolises the God who creates the fake copy and sets him off on his predetermined journey. \\n\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\\n\r\n#You should watch Sakurada Reset IF...\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want a story that will challenge you with its intelligent questions and \"plays\".** Sometimes the abilities of Sakurada's citizens might be combined in brilliant yet very unexpected ways, and it might take a while for the viewer to understand how exactly a certain scene played out. In short, it is a story that will make you think. \\n\\n\r\n* **...you are tired of all those evil just for the sake of being evil antagonists.** **Sakurada Reset** will present you with 3 dimensional antagonist(s). You can actually empathise with the \"main\" antagonist of the series even though he is introduced really late in the story and entirely opposes the protagonist. There are even times where you might consider if the said main antagonist is actually the \"good guy\" of the story while the opposing force - the protagonist of the story is actually the \"bad guy\".\\n\\n\\n\r\n* **... you like time travel shows.** While being completely different in tone compared to most other time travel shows, there is a lot of \"resetting\" happening in Sakurada Reset which is essentially a type of time travel. Plenty of time travel shows use overlap of 2 timelines to tell a more thrilling story, showing characters go through events once then later coming back and doing them a 2nd time while avoiding overlap. But Sakurada Reset overlaps 3 timelines at times making for very complex manuvers made in order to acheive victories in cases.\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want a mystery show with a lot of twists, mature characters and a romantic subplot.** The romantic subplot of the story is mature similarly to the characters of it. The romance is not the usual \"will they, won't they?\" with tons of shenanigans that never lead anywhere in the end. The main characters although almost devoid of emotions are very open about the few emotions they do have. **Sakurada Reset** doesn't use \"shock effect\", so it is sometimes subtle when presenting its twists. Meaning you might even miss one of the said twists. It doesn\u2019t over explain details, but instead lets the viewer think about what actually went down. You might sometimes get flash forwards without realizing and that can make someone very confused. One of them happens in the beginning of episode 13, just after the opening. It is a flash forward to the final arc of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\\n\r\n#You probably won't enjoy Sakurada Reset IF...\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want a show with top of the notch animation**. **Sakurada Reset** is a low budget light novel adaptation. But even with that low budget David Production did wonders. The art itself can be quite beautiful and the animation is decent enough but it is nothing special compared to most of the other anime airing this year. \\n\\n\\n\r\n* **...you are not fine with a slow burner especially one without any action or fan-service at all.** Aside from being a slow burner that takes its time setting up different plot points and developing characters, it doesn't have anything fancy to make the viewer interested. Watching through the early parts of **Sakurada Reset** takes even more commitment than getting through the first cour of **Steins; Gate** (I enjoyed both cours to be honest). That is because while the first cour of Steins; Gate doesn't have many twists and isn't much of a thriller rather more like a slice of life instead, it has a lot of other elements to keep the viewers interested. Cute girls, cute traps, a chuunibyou male lead, fat weeb best friend for the us lonely weebs with boring lives to self-insert, a great comedy and much more. **Sakurada Reset** lacks all of these. It is an entirely different type of show while the two do have some similarities.\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want something where you can turn your brain off and enjoy.** Unless you carefully listen to what is actually being said in Sakurada Reset, you will be very confused and bored thus end up hating it. It is not \u201cslice-of-life\u201d kind of boring where you can just relax and enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset has really good EDs and OSTs in my opinion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n#My complaints with Sakurada Reset\\n\\n\r\nMy first complaint is how the director chose to adapt the source material. Instead of going with a usual order of the novel series, he started the anime with the third volume. The third volume of the novel series containing the \u201cMemory in Children\u201d arc got adapted into three episodes - episode 1, episode 2 and episode 10. The actual first arc of the story \"Cat, Ghost and Revolution Sunday\u201d doesn\u2019t start until the third episode. As you can see even the synopsis of the story is an introduction to \"Cat, Ghost and Revolution Sunday\u201d arc rather than \u201cMemory in Children\u201d. I can somewhat understand why the director decided to adapt it the way he did but I can\u2019t say it was a good move. Plot of **Sakurada Reset** is very complex and adapting it this way only made it harder for the viewer to understand. As a comparison you could say that it is like watching Kizumonogatari movies before watching Bakemonogatari series. It can be done, but it is probably not a good idea. \\n\\n\r\nMy second complaint with it is the subs\u2026 The subtitles for **Sakurada reset** can be really awful sometimes. It sometimes feels like the translator didn't even try. The translations of the lines often have no \u201cflow\u201d. It is as if it was machine translated and then edited to make sense. This is where **Sakurada Reset** really suffers in my opinion. As a heavily dialogue driven story it deserves much better subtitles. They even sometimes \u201ctranslate\u201d the names incorrectly. There were times when Souma was written as Soma instead. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have it as Soma unless you have a macron on \u2018o\u2019. The subtitles also confused me a few times. Check out the following sentence from the subs - \u201cGod made a copy of the young man and created a fake\u201d. This is a grammatically correct translation but it is also very confusing. So did he make a copy AND create a fake? Obviously the fake man is the copy but it could have made clearer with a better phrasing such as \u201cGod created a fake copy of the man\u201d or something of the sort. Another case of a horrible translation is from episode 10 where the question \u201cDid you hear the voice?\u201d (the context is that someone will either hear the voice or won\u2019t) is asked, and it gets answered with a \u201cWhich one do you want to meet?\u201d which makes absolutely no sense even knowing the full context. The actual question is \"\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067\u5408\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\" which has the same reading as \u201c\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u201d which means \u201cWhich one do you want to meet?\u201d while the original \"\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067\u5408\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\" means \u201cWhich one do you want it to be\u201d - meaning do you prefer if I hear it or not. I could have forgiven this mistranslation if there wasn\u2019t a context which the translator could have used. I am back to my original point - which also answers Souma\u2019s question \u201cWho is the android?\u201d. The damn translator is an android. Another mistranslation I remember is the translation \"You won't take action unless you want an ability.\" from episode 4. The correct translation would be something along the lines of \"Abilities won't activate unless you want them to\", I believe. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to mention that the subs did somewhat improve after the first cour of the anime. As an example when the same scene from episode 10 was shown in episode 12, the translation was correct. \\n\\n\\n\r\n# TLDR;\\n\\n\r\n Watching Sakurada Reset is like putting a puzzle together. It starts out as a hard  task but gets easier as you put more pieces together. Sakurada Reset might not make any sense in the beginning but everything is part of something grand that you can only obtain by putting those small pieces together to see the big picture. If you are ready for that, give this unique anime a watch. Start binging it now and you will have caught up before the finale airs. \\n",

(or that is my take on what I saw, where some may say I am giving too much depth to how things are in reality)\r\nOnly to observe how feelings emerge from the \"heartless\" characters.\r\nIt's not your typical anime, it doesn't lack emotion, it's not for everyone, it makes you think about life, death, love (love triangle), morality.\r\nCharacters are, as some people say, \"robotic\" at first, wherethey seem to lack emotion, maybe have a riddled way of speaking. I personally think no one can empathize with any of them, but here is my take on it, that is the best part of the show. This creates characters that speak in a weird way for their age, that no normal teen would use, and gives freedom to the questioning of human problems in a detached way.\\n\\n\r\nThe transformation of their personality and the way their emotions begin to arise is what got me hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting, but the way it is told may get confusing because of so many special powers, timelines etc...\\n\\n\r\nMusic was ok, did not pay too much attention to it, maybe it did not spark my interest, but I can say it stayed in form with what was happening around, meaning it did not feel out of place, unlike truly awfully other examples I saw in different anime. At the same time, could've been better.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is normal, with some moments that will forever stay in my memory, so I will give it two points above average.\\n\\n\r\nA psychological, philosophical anime, and even a slight romantic one that I really, really enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI am truly sorry if anyone thinks my review is not appropriate, I hope people will get some information about the anime, and I hope anyone who decides to watch it will get the enjoyment that I got, maybe even better.",

Not only is it more boring than watching paint dry, it is trying to become a new level of trash, and each episode just keeps one-upping the previous in doing so. Every single character in the show is extremely boring, lifeless and robotic, has absolutely no human emotions, and makes illogical decisions for no reason. The characters have had zero character development over the last 13 episodes I have seen, even less than Sword Art Online, which as far as I'm concerned, takes a mastermind to pull off. The plot is inconsistent, makes no sense,and many important things are not explained properly. The forced melancholy mood on top of everything just serves to make the show more painful to get through.\\n\\n\r\n1/10",

            "content": "\"I like hearing wind chimes when I least expected it. Like finding a rainbow.\" Sakurada Reset; episode 3\r\n\"Please, Tomoki. It's like a ritual...like exchanging rings becasue you pledge your everlasting love to God.\" Sakurada Reset; episode 16\r\n\"Thank you, I wouldn't want the ice cream to melt.\" Sakurada Reset; episode 18\r\n\"Grab her by the p*ssy\" Sakurada Reset; episode 25\r\nSakurada Reset is an anime that grabbed my attention months before it started airing. The story's main gimmick- the reset ability- is an interesting concept that has been explored well in literature and other anime but with this anime promising a young duo using clever tactics and witin conjunction with the reset ability, it looked to be a good addition to the string of bad thriller anime that have been pervading the last few years. It was very unfortunate, then that I carelessly ignored checking up on the staff on this anime. And I payed for it.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE ANIME\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset is a flat, shallow, farcical anime that whole-heartedly thinks its a serious show. It's a tragic example of a good idea done completely wrong. Sakurada Reset's problems go way beyond simple bad writing and bad direction- it's a mix of so many terribly done aspects that it's actually possible they have no connection to each other. In other words, everything is individually bad and not becasue one part of the anime affects the other. It's an additively, not multipely, bad anime. This makes it more annoying than normal bad anime since those at least have things tied together to the point one bad thing affects everything.\\n\\n\r\nFist off, the characters. All the characters are boringly written with very little to actually develop them. Their dialogue is bad (more on that in a latter paragraph) and all of them except the main characters merely exist as plot conveniences whenever the main character needs a handy ability around. The main character himself- Asai Kei- is an omniscient and omnipotent God who simply cannot lose because he's always right. Not my words, mind you, the other characters all treat him like he's the Messiah coming down from heaven in a wave of majesty. He's incomprehensible. His entire backstory is incomprehensible. The other characters are just bland as heck. Most of them are introduced in small arcs in the 2nd act (eps 3-12) of the anime and all of them suck. The arc has them play as minor villains who, in the end, become allies for the main character in the final arc of the show. Damn this anime make them incomprehensible. I'll try and explain the main arcs in order.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc had the character- Murase Youka- have a terrible excuse in that she wanted to save a cat and you can clearly see the anime pad out the runtime with pointless dialogue and events that make no sense. But its climax was where she literally tried to kill Kei. She has literally zero reason to kill him but the anime was written to have her be crazy and stupid enough to do so. Not one character talked any sense during this confrontation or even before. In the end, she just pisses off until she is needed again by the show. Next arc we have Oka Eri as our Scooby Doo villain of the week. She's a character who for some reason holds antagonistic feelings towards our hero and wants to \"beat\" him. That would be great if the anime actually showed us any motivation for her. It's offhandedly explained in some throwaway dialogue but this girl has no reason to be as bitchy as she is. The arc also has her do F*CKING NOTHING at all. Seriously, she just shows up, bitches about things, and pisses off to wait until the anime needs her again. Also in this arc there's something about a Witch and shit which I'm sure is important but was so boringly done I forgot most of it. Oh yes we are also introduced to some bloke who can transfer abilities from one to another through touch. He'll be a super important bland character later. Oh yeah, we also have WhatsApp guy. I mean Tomoki. He's a friend. I think. The anime doesn't exactly show him unless it needs him. Funny...I'm seeing a trend here...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the main problem with all these characters is that they're just so boring. The main characters (Kei and Misora) have the exact personality of an unpainted brick wall. I don't get how anyone can get behind their relationship because, unique as it is in anime, it's a very poorly handled relationship. There's a fair bit of emotional scenes in this anime and all of them fail due to the fact that these are badly written characters. Much of the development is rushed (ironically in such a slow show) and ham-fisted and the emotional scenes get in the way of much of the show instead of weaving itself closely. This is done much better in the final act of the show where I could see the anime sort of trying to give proper development but its let down by bad pacing and direction. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character I was even half impressed with was Souma Sumire- the only character to carry this show from \"unrelentingly horrendous\" to simply being \"really terrible\". She's a walking plot device. Not kidding, she even describes herself as such. She is, however, the only character with even half-reasonable motivations and explanations for what she does. She has an actual interesting character arc and sees more development than all other characters combined. She's also the only character we see being subtle in her methods and you can see faint threads throughout the story that she leaves behind- meaning she has a genuine presence within the show (for example, setting up the McGuffin so that Kei can meet up with Youko. I think that was one of the reasons. Though it still doesn't give any reason for Youko to be so bitchy about things). Helped A LOT that she was voiced by a top form Aoi Yuuki who puts everyone else to shame (not too difficult though since they're all as engaging and relatable as sandpaper). All other characters in this show do not matter. They're all plot conveniences used by the main character to look smart and show his omniscience. \\n\\n\r\nThen finally, we have our villain- introduced in the second half of the show and wants to erase all abilities from Sakurada town. He's a villain so bad he puts the villains from ERASED, Chaos;Head and Guilty Crown to shame. I literally know nothing about him. The anime does such a poor job of building him up as a character and thinks flashbacks and sinister smiles are enough to make him imposing in any way. The anime tries so hard to tell you he's a smart guy with an excellent plan that they fail to actually show him being smart and doing excellent things. All he really does is get driven around in a badly rendered CG car, writing notes and talking about how angsty his childhood was. The anime does a sloppy job giving him any motivation to why he wants to erase abilities from Sakurada. This creates a problem in the main conflict of the show. There's supposed to be this grand conflict of ideologies in this show about how Kei wants to keep abilities (also very poorly shown) and direclty opposes bad guy's desire to erase abilities. For all the anime trying to sound smart it doesn't give us anything tangible as to why we should support any of these characters. The themes that run through the arcs are poorly carried over and lost in the bad dialogue near the end of the show. This anime has very little to offer in challenging the viewer's views as it can't even present the opposing viewpoints of the characters very well. Also, the 2 side goons of the main villain have no personality at all. But that's not surprising. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about as incomprehensible as the characters. It's mostly all over the place with numerous plot holes that pop up whenever a character opens their mouth to explain something (which is frequent).The show also tries to do these really \"clever\" twist showing Kei's intelligence but these twist are shown in such an infuriating way its impossible to take seriously. The anime gives us so little information up until the twist that when it does come we're just left standing confused at what is going on. This mostly happens near the end of the show when they're wrapping things up but a good example would be in the penultimate episode with the bad guy in the car talking with Kei (btw episode 23 is one of the worse episodes of the show which says something). It's revealed that KEI ACTUALLY HAD A TALK WITH THIS GUY IN THE OTHER TIMELINE WHEN THERE WERE NO ABILITIES. What a cop-out. We got shown none of this nor was anything done to allude to the possibility that this happened, Kei just kind of says \"Yeah. So I got you to talk in that timeline. Now I know everything because I'm the main character.\". Not all the twist are as badly done as that but it definitely contributes to the overall incomprehensibility of the story. If you want more details of plot holes from Sakurada Reset pm me and I'll find some (its such a bad anime I have to research into why it is so bad). For the most part the story is only about as bad as the characters get though due to much of it being people sitting around talking about stuff. \\n\\n\r\nNow we go on to the crux of this show's problem. Every problem this show has traces back to one thing- the dialogue. The dialogue in this anime would make M Night Shayamalan proud. Its terrible. I can't begin to describe how badly written the dialogue is. It's like it was written by a robot who doesn't know how normal human interactions are like. This makes the writing feel mechanical. Too flowing. Too unnatural. The show is pervaded by this kind of dialogue. Every character, with no exception, speaks in parables, Aesops, thought experiments or metaphors. I thought it was only the 2 main characters but no its everyone. There's so many examples I could show you but I'll take one from near the end of the show. Kei goes back to where he was born and raised and meets his mother who has had her memories rewritten so Kei can stay in Sakurada. A simple dialogue between a mother and her son whom she has forgotten about should be an emotional gripper with subtlety. But no. They speak like robots. The dialogue is so unfitting of the real emotional music played around it its jarring. This is an extreme example of where the dialogue messes up but this ENTIRE SHOW has dialogue like it. The quotes in the beginning of this review are mere dabs of taste of what this show actually does. I watched it subbed like everyone but I know a fair bit of Japanese so I can safely say the subs are actually less silly than what the poor voice actors had to say at some parts. It ruins every interaction, makes everyone bland and shows how little the main characters develop (even in the personal monologue scenes.). It's dialogue that doesn't make them sound anything human. I know the point of the show is to show how detached many of the characters are but when everyone speaks like Shakespeare all the time its unnerving. It boggles my mind to think how anyone could approve of this sort of writing. The director and writer must have both agreed to have dialogue like this to be in the anime. You honestly have to watch the show to hear some of the dialogue that is being said. Its the main reason the story and characters are incomprehensible. They cannot express themselves naturally. The show has obviously done this to sound more mature but it only serves to disengage and confuse the viewer. I stress with no small experience that Sakurada Reset has the absolute worse dialogue I have ever seen in anime. Some of it is self-destructive to the story. Much of it is pointless. And all of it is  brain-melting. I repeat THE DIALOGUE SUCKS.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing in this review is something that is not as bad as the dialogue but much more annoying- the direction and art and animation. The director isn't particularly well known but has directed stuff like Non non boyori and Kokoro Connect. Sakurada Reset has a slow pacing with many stills like those anime but its so...boring. Nothing of interest happens in the shots, the lighting is undramatic for much of the show, the shot composition and angles are bland and uninspired and there is no subtle changes in things like character expressions or body language. It really is just people standing around and talking to  a flat, level, mid-shot camera position. Its one of the most boring directed anime I've watched. Art direction is also flat with the aforementioned lighting but also has crappy colour design, bland backgrounds, unexpressive character designs (except Souma Sumire and maybe even Chiruchiru), REALLY BAD CGI and a general blandness in the settings. There's such and overuse of white and light colours in the show that SJWs might protest it. So many scenes could have been directed better and therefore made better. There's a scene in episode 16 where  the show has very real potential to build up on a romantic relationship between Kei and Misora where Kei ask Misora in a message to meet him on the roof. The scene was directed blandly with unnecessary cuts of Misora WALKING to the roof. It would be far more effective to simply focus on Misora herself with some slight change in expression and body language to just display some of her thoughts and inner turmoil (its episode 16, she should be at least somewhat developed by now) and have the camera linger on her from a high angle show framing her in the bottom right or left. But no. I guess walking is more important to show. \\n\\n\r\nOther problems I have with this show...They almost ruined KanaHana's and Ishikawa Kaito's careers by forcing them to do bland deliveries of bad dialogue. The anime has terrible sense of time and location. In one instance a month had passed from the beginning of an episode but it really felt like a few days at most. The Bureau is a rubbish organisation on par with the Orbital Knights from Aldnoah Zero and Daath from Guilty Crown. The other characters I didn't mention like Ukawa and the teacher being completely stupid and changing motivations on a dime for reasons I fail to understand. The abilities being poorly explained or shown in general with few exceptions and the fact that the only actual abilities being shown are only shown to become tools for the main character to use (Except for the ghost girl thing. That was entire pointless and will take a team of scientist at least 5 years to understand why the writers even included it). The anime looks rubbish even though its the same studio that made Jojo. Things I liked? Ehhhhhh the music was pretty?\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset is an anime that had suckers falling for it with its supposed intelligence. What it really is is Kami sama no memochou except that it sucks. The characters are so badly written and bland its difficult to see any meaningful development. They're so unexpressive it makes me cry. If you want to see a show that is actually smart with clever dialogue and narrative twist as well as being well directed and beautiful to look at, watch Kino's Journey. If you want a show that does a mystery thriller better, Gosick is your answer. The Raildex series are infinitely superiour in terms of a place with abilities and using abilities to save people (as well as being a much better in-depth character piece). All in all, avoid watching this show and if you have watched it for fun and not for academics like me, I feel so bad for you since there's just so much better stuff out there.",

            "content": "Watching Sakurada Reset felt like watching various popular shows at the same time:\r\n~ Take a setting like that of \"Charlotte\" where people have special powers,\r\n~ but make the story revolve around few characters with time reversal like \"STEINS;GATE\",\r\n~ bring in an MC who has logic and intelligence like Ayumu from \"Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna\", \r\n~ Making the conversations long like \"HYOUKA\" or \"MONOGATARI series\" and\r\n~ finally most importantly add the philosophy like that of \"MAWARU PENGUINDRUM\" whose true essence never came out and there you get \"Sakurada reset\"\r\nSo basically, the story is simple, a town having people with special abilities and there is a mysteriousAdministration Bureau which controls how the things work, but our MC tries to help them but also tries to uncover the secrets behind the organization.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with this series is that, it tried to put 24+12 episodes of content in 24 episodes which made it seem little less lively but that doesn't mean the series is worthless like the rating shown, but to be honest the content of the story is on par with all the names of anime I have mentioned earlier. As the story covers events of elementary, middle and high school life in just this short span.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has one of the best written stories because when it states the rules of a person's abilities, it strictly sticks to it and also gives us insight of how it can be used various other things, which you might not expect when you aren't thinking out of the box, which shows like \"Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works\" failed miserably, as they don't give any proper reason for rules being bent for the sake of story.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing which I've found interesting in this series is the \"Philosophical thoughts\" which were really well written and analyzed and no doubt they are even applicable in our real world.\\n\\n\r\nComing to characters, its the main drawback of the series, I mean mostly only 3 characters are developed and that too you wouldn't know much of their backstory about why they were being emotionless. That's what makes people hate this show, i.e., you can't say which character you like the most or whose behavior you liked, but you can only just say that the ending is beautiful and a story worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC Asai Kei might not be cool, but he is definitely one of the smartest characters in anime history. Its just that he is not someone who you might take for a favorite person, but he has good ideas, also he is someone who tries to reach everyone needs, which is as if he is trying to be a God but if you just skip that part of his na\u00efve ideal rest assured is good.\\n\\n\r\nComing to soundtracks, there aren't any noteworthy soundtracks, but the op and ed songs are good to listen.\\n\\n\r\nArt is very common, which isn't much appealing to see but it's alright to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWell that being said, this series might not be something great, but it definitely underrated and has one of well-written story and philosophy, so watch it with patience as the ending is worth the watch. It doesn't have cool fights but it has some really interesting battle of wits. I know people dropped it because waiting for week for a single episode is a real pain, but now you can binge watch it and taste the true essence of a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Don't let the scores this show received on previews deceive you. this show is actually a Hidden gem among all the anime between this and spring season. is sad that this show received such a harsh treatment from many people with different opinions, like the show being slow, emotionless, boring, uninteresting, etc. but when it comes to its own merits, Sakurada Reset shines for being an Anime that does things well, yeah that's right, you won't see that many anime having a great plot without forgetting things they said and then doing otherwise. in Sakurada Reset case, it manages to stick to its own Ideaand expand it and manages to explain at least almost everything within time, the main problem is that the first half is a bit slow and the characters lacks a bit of emotions (well that's a kuudere for you) yet, that \"main problem\" is called development and slow pace, so that pretty much sums up for the things that scared people away, because its seen everywhere, you will see inpatient people that wants things to be fast, but when they get their explanation they either call it bullshit or probably gave up on the show a while ago. it makes me think that they would insta drop a long run Anime of more than 100 episodes just because the main character doesn't develop like they wanted in 4 episodes. even tho that some of these anime that goes further than 200 might end up sucking or transforming into the Dragon Ball formula of seeing who has the biggest dick. but judging an anime within the first episodes of a show that has more than 12 episodes is just plain nonsense, there are special cases where it can be right to bash over an anime in the beginning, for example a Generic Anime that you would know from the very beginning how will it end. but we are not here to talk about when to or when to not give up on a show so lets get started. there might be spoilers ahead, better be warned than get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of this anime happens on a City that goes by the name of Sakurada, which is special because the habitants of Sakurada has \\n\r\nsupernatural abilities, and very unique ones I must say, at least, there are somes that I consider unique. now, if people leaves the town of \\n\r\nSakurada, they will forget that they had an ability and everything related to abilities inside of Sakurada. (even though it might seem otherwise, this has an explanation)\\n\\n\r\nWe get to meet our main Characters: Asai Kei, Haruki Misora and Sumire Souma. they have powers that may be great if the three of them worked together, Asai Kei has the power of remember everything he sees and hear, Haruki Misora has the power to get back in time to a point where she saved. her power has some restrictions: she has to \"save\" a \"moment\" in time, once she reset, she is not able to save again unless 24 hours has passed from the last save point (preventing you from abusing this power) and in order to reset, she used to activate her power when she saw someone crying, but this changes later on. and we have Sumire Souma, her ability is a bit painful actually, since she can foresight things that might happen. by using this power, she made Kei and Misora meet each other, because she knew that they would make a good team/couple, mostly because Misora will not remember anything when she resets, she and every Sakurada Reset ability user that isn't Kei (and other exceptions), this way Kei would be the master key in order to fix the problem that made Misora reset. but even knowing what was the problem, that doesn't mean it will be easy to fix.\\n\\n\r\non the first half our duo will help people in need while they find answers on why Souma Died, they also will try to find more about them as persons (because them being almost emotionless, were one of the reasons why people gave up on this show so easily) this while confronting other ability users (I can feel the Influence of JoJo on this anime by the hands of David Productions, there are abilities that reminds me of some parts of the JoJo series) now, on the second half, is where this show goes all in revealing most of Sakurada's secrets, developing their characters on a really great way while solving certain cases that are very philosophical (one of the strongest things on this anime) as you might have noticed this anime requires very deep thinking, otherwise you would feel very lost if you don't pay attention. Because of how great Sakurada Reset manages to pull all together within the 2nd half and how great it manages to develop everything at the end, I'll give story an score of: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll combine Art and the Soundtrack into one section since there isn't much to say here. The animation is quite good overall, there are scenes that has a really deep impact while having a good harmony with the soundtrack, the show successfully manages to give you the right atmosphere on certain scenes that manages to hook you even more, mostly on the second half. tho it is completely worth it  because involves the characters while they are developing and showing how worth their development is. so for Art and Soundtrack, both goes by the score of: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLets head into one of the strongest things on this anime, the Characters. Even if they show themselves quite emotionless, they manage to develop really well in a very surprising way. they start getting more emotional within time while dealing with very philosophical and psychological events that will help them understand more about themselves, the story of Sakurada and the ability users. Asai Kei is a Mastermind when it comes to plans, even if his development sacrifices the development of the other characters (this since the resets of Misora will erase the development of the other characters that aren't Kei) he manages to go 7 steps ahead of everyone, he never ceases to amaze me when it comes to his risky but successful plans. Certainly, I wouldn't want him as a Villain, would be as smart as Aizen from Bleach. the other characters are still good, they will still develop, even if their progress get reset'd a couple of times. at least that development doesn't go to trash like for example in re:zero, where Subaru instead of growing into the right side, he lost his mind and pretty much destroys any development of everyone and himself (that until a blue haired person that I don't remember gets him some doses of \"Ubicatex\" (this is a spanish play word that means \"snap out of it\") so for the great development of these characters and their events, I'll give the characters\\n\r\na Score of: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nas for Enjoyment, if you aren't into a slow paced story with characters that will develop quite slowly, this show certainly might not be for you. but if you are patient enough, certainly this anime will keep you hooked and will reward those that sticks to the end. The more weeks I spent waiting for this show, the more worth it became. so within all that this show had to offer, my Enjoyment will be a score of: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.8/10 (9): an Anime that rewards those that explores deeply into the secrets this show has, Characters that develop greatly, and events that will keep you hooked with Philosophical and psychological touchs. quite underrated and overlooked by unpatient people.\\n",

            "content": "Considering that an article on this very site, written somewhere around the end of last season, has already declared this show to be a \"miss\" at its halfway point (real professional work there, guys, next time you should just rank animes based on their announcement PVs), and that most viewers have already decided  to drop the series in favour of the latest pseudo-hentai, harem LN adaptation, it might be far too late for me to write a review about this piece of work, killed before it ever had the chance to show its values, but I believe that Sakurada Reset deserves better.\r\nFirst, let's acknowledgereality, the show is not the second coming of your local salvation-based deity, it is definitely not for everyone. If you believe that anime, as a genre, should be solely about unadulterated entertainment of the most vulgar degrees, little girls fighting each other to the death, cow-titted, blonde onee-sans snuggling up to virginal heroes of godlike powers, or whatever the fuck you people see in those Eromanga-senseis and whatnot, then you'd do best avoiding this series, you will only be disappointed and will possibly whine about it being boring, confusing and seriously lacking in infantile erotic tension.If you, however, think that this is one of the greatest mediums to give an experience equally stimulating visually and intellectually, capable of opening your eyes to completely different points of view, then I highly recommend the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is about presenting the numerous way the people of Sakurada relate to other's and their own abilities, and how encounters with one another influence personal growth. It's not a world-changing great adventure or a hard struggle between embodiments of good and evil, even the larger scale events are given a personal grasp, as they are significant to the individual, but only mere episodes for the world in which those individuals exist.\\n\r\nAnd that's where the main focus lies, the characters. Again, if you are looking for the usual character tropes and typical over-the-top voice acting you get from My Little Tsundere Princess Sister And The Magical Academy Of Lightshow Battles, then you will most definitely find all the characters boring and empty. Each and every member of the cast is constructed in a layered fashion, first only providing the means for a surface-level understanding of their personalities (and that's the point where most viewer gave the series a 2/10 and quit), only to open up for us as our eyes into their world, Kei, begins to unravel the circumstances that lead them to this point in their lives, our encounter with them changing their views significantly, later appearances showing glances of their growths by the end of the series.\\n\r\nIn tandem with the aforementioned narrative focus, the characters of Sakurada Reset all act and emote in very human ways, they show subtle expressions while talking with normal tonality, the same way as any of us would in given conversations. Hell, one of the main point of the series is how the characters develop as they interact with others, the dialogues' unfolding nature serves this purpose perfectly, especially in Haruki's case, who goes from an extremely cold and emotionless presentation to become one of the most vibrantly expressive characters of the series.\\n\r\nSpoken lines do tend to be somewhat slow-paced and very philosophical in their nature, the characters often discuss thought experiments and theories in detail, and that too might be one of the reasons for the hasty abandonment of the series by those who mainly use philosophy books (provided that they ever held one in their hands) to find every single mention of a phallus, but in my opinion, they work in context, expand the narrative and fit the more contemplative tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother complaint aimed at the show was its visuals. Without going on a rant or a needlessly long-winded analysis (like I kinda did in the last section), it seems to me that these arguments could be connected to, yet again, the large masses' expectations. This is neither the diabetic world of moe animes, neither the visual orgies of a Shinkai Makoto or ufotable project, the colour scheme is a very relaxing one and the designs are in no way flashy or complicated. Despite all that, I can state with all honesty that the visuals are perfectly satisfactory. They don't draw attention away from the dialogues, are pleasant to look at and even without jaw-dropping animation, the proficient work of David Production often manages to create captivating imagery through the simplistic beauty found in the carefully composed frames.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more to talk about when it comes to this series, but I don't think my dreary essay here is not the right way to approach the matter. Rather than that, I would like to encourage every single person who took their time to read this review to join the conversation and discuss this anime. I've been tastelessly positive in these (not so) brief paragraphs, there are many positives and negative to be found here, far more than I ever cared to mention, but I believe that all of that should be said and seen by many more than the few who humoured this narcissistic nerd for the time of a review.\\n\r\nIf I could ask one thing from you, dear reader, I would like you to look beyond the premature denouncement and check out this anime, form your own opinion about it based on what you actually get and not on the popular trends that exist on an entirely different side of the medium!\\n\\n\r\nGive Sakurada Reset the chance it never got, the chance to give its audience the experience it meant to!",

            "content": "Hey, do you know that show called Monogatari? If you do, try to imagine Monogatari, that show which is full of dialogue and most of its big moments are also dialogues, that show that bended the \"show don't tell\" rule and made it its bitch, and then take every person from the staff that worked on it, including Nisiosin, Akiyuki Shinbou, everyone that had any creative input in it, and give it to people who can't comprehend how to make it interesting at all. Oh, and don't forget to also get Takayama Katsuhiko to do the series composition. You know, the guy who wrote thescript for Boku No Pico, and whose last big project was Big Order.\\n\r\nI have no legitimate idea who thought that this is the team that can be creative enough, to turn a light novel story, that's really heavy on exposition, slow and hard to consume on its own for sure, into a story inside of a visual medium, but let me tell you, they were wrong in all the worst ways imaginable.\\n\r\nLadies, gentlemen, I present this review which I humbly wrote about a series, that I'm pretty sure had less passion while being developed, than I had while writing this analysis.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers past this section*\\n\\n\r\nSuperpowers aren't a new idea, neither is one of them being controlled by the government, but there are titles coming out each year that are able to do some good with such topics. My Hero Academia, Captain America: Winter Soldier and the X-Men comics are just a few that immediately come to my mind. All of them have found a way to create worlds around such ideas and adapt their plot to play to its strengths. Sakurada Reset attempts to do it, but it fumbles at every point and every corner, creating a huge jumble of ultimate nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in Sakurada, that has been a place where all sorts of powers have sprouted out of nowhere and have been taking the place by storm. The things have been calmed down and controlled by the Administration Bureau, that has been controlling and ministering over the area. Thanks to that, Sakurada is able to continue with its everyday flow and the abilities become a common thing, a part of an everyday life. However, the trick is, the abilities do not spread, they're contained within Sakurada and everyone who walks outside of its boundary immediately loses all memories of them even existing.\\n\r\nOne day, a boy by the name Asai Kei enters Sakurada, and it turns out that his ability is ultimate memory, which allows him to remember everything no matter how his memories are altered. Years pass, and one day, during school, he meets a girl - Haruki Misora - that can reset the world to the state at the time when she has last \"saved\". Combined, they are able to do great things, as Kei is able to plan out and fix problems that arise due to his perfect memory. Their story leads them to a lot of pain, a death of a friend, a fight against those who despise powers, but also joy that they see through helping the community and the happiness they find in each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's problems are somewhat weird, especially pacing-wise. It begins two years before the actual events, when Kei, Haruki and Sumire Souma meet and solve their first case together, which later one becomes a basis for them helping other people out. The pacing in those first episodes is extremely fast and unapologetic, it doesn't care if you didn't catch something, you're just supposed to have understood everything in between the stupidly fast transitions. Considering that those beginning moments of the show are supposed to introduce you to the concept of powers and set up the entire drama later on, I don't think I need to say much more about why that is a bad thing.\\n\r\nBut to add salt to the injury, every problem that the show struggles with in general is present this early on as well, which is both weird and sort of funny at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThat's because despite the fast transitions and scenes generally passing by like flies, the show is surprisingly slow in the delivery of each line. You can spot awkward pauses everywhere, there are those empty, 5-10 seconds breaks during dialogues. They really become apparent in the third and fourth arc, but they're there from the beginning, and they're quite hurtful to the flow of the conversation and the general pace of the anime. It feels like they're there to sort of fill out the time instead of doing something meaningful. You might ask \"How is it possible that the early scenes go by so fast if the scenes themselves are so slow?\". It's simple, the scenes are slow, but they're just short early on, and it's only later that it becomes a serious issue, when they start becoming longer. And what makes it worse, there's a distinct lack of anything interesting going on with the show's visuals.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very beginning of this review I mentioned Monogatari, and I did that for the purpose of making you, the reader of this review understand something. If you've watched Monogatari you've obviously noticed its style, its distinct way with visuals and how it enhances dialogue that would normally feel dreadful and boring. There's tons of visual gags, characters screw around in the background, the art style changes on a lot of occasions, most metaphors are visualized and generally the show is just interesting to look at, even though most of the information you get is through the characters talking. Despite the silliness however, it's still able to maintain the  seriousness and groundedness that Sakurada tries so hard to achieve with its \"serious conversations\" or the \"focused visuals\". You know why that is? Because its writing is good enough so that it's able to create those serious scenes whenever it wants to. Sakurada Reset feels like it doesn't believe in its writing or characterization enough for the viewer to continue following them through if there's something else going on on the screen. That wouldn't even be that bad, but the show looks horrendous. Everything is plain, the designs are boring and have absolutely nothing to them, the background art is often nonexistent or cut out due to the camera placement. The animation for what I'd say is over 60% of the show consists of still shots and characters with their moving mouths.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show's so boring to look at, my questions is: why is it an anime? Why did this story have to be recreated in this medium? If the director has no inspiration to add any personality, humanity or individuality to the show, if the background artists are doing only what's necessary, if the show doesn't have anything special going for it visually, the what's the point of LOOKING at the show? Hell, this adaptation goes even further, as it HURTS the plot with the previously mentioned awkward, soundless pauses, the lack of emotions on character's faces, and the mostly uninspired designs of everything you look at. It just throws you off from the start and never draws you in again.\\n\\n\r\nBut those are technical things, those don't matter right? Let's talk about....\\n\\n\r\nNO!\\n\\n\r\nPeople! Stop undervaluing the influence of the things you look at in anime. If the thing you're looking at does nothing to even attempt to adapt to the medium that IT CHOSE, then why should you, as a viewer, adapt to the the way it's presented to even digest it? Goddamn Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979, freaking Serial Experiments Lain from 1998, name any other show from god knows how long ago, and all of them, despite looking like they're drawn in Microsoft Paint at times, are able to create style, atmosphere and designs that integrate into the experience, creating a distinct feeling to them. Sakurada Reset is content with being the most limited and basic version of itself imaginable. It's fine with the bare minimum if it just means it can tell a story. Where's the passion? Where's the love for the project that you're working on? This show feels like it was more of a chore to make rather than something that anyone wanted to work on. It's disgusting, repulsive even. While watching, you can basically feel as if nobody wanted this project to work out. Well, maybe there's someone...\\n\\n\r\nI'd argue that if someone feels like they tried it's the original creator. This is light novel writing through and through, and every amateur mistake is there. From the lazy exposition where Kei or others go out of their character to explain things to the viewer; the lack of proper explanation of the powers, that leaves up countless possibilities, which end up feeling like conveniences; and the clear struggles of the author as he tries to get from point A to point B, desperately setting things so his vision can finally take place. He clearly had ideas and did some research, but he's just not a good writer. He lacks subtlety and understanding of the people he's catering to. He believes that if he didn't understand something before writing about it, then we also won't, so he forces explanation into the plot, be that either some storytelling term or a psychological one. He doesn't use those dialogues to contextualize the world or the characters, the most you'll get is that Kei reads philosophy, apparently. The author also ends up making the characters, especially the side cast, feel like devices to fit the finale rather than the fully realized ones. He gives them those mini-arcs that, he thinks, are enough to justify the characters' existence, but that's not true. It's hard to say if it's a case of lackluster experience, lack of time, or anything else, but even though the plot is a mess, you can't say it lacks ideas or creativity in what it ended up being. It's just the execution that sucks. Nobody thought about working out those issues.\\n\\n\r\nLet me go back a little bit and talk about the way this show uses its characters. What I mentioned is unfortunately true to the core. Characters end up feeling like they exist just so that their power can be in the story, and the writer gave them interactions and moments so they won't be considered as plot devices. Bad news: they are still plot devices.\\n\r\nDespite quite a few characters that the show attempts to get through something, there are pretty much no implications for them before, during, or after they're done with the things they need to do. Their shown only when they're absolutely needed, in situations where it's necessary for them or their powers to exist. When Haruka needs to express emotions that she can't show to Kei, she talks with the cat girl that she met before. She never really seems to have any internalized monologues, none of the characters do, they have to express it out unless it's something that has to be explained to the viewer. Most lack stances on the world, they lack personalities and reasons to exist, it's impossible to see them actually live inside that world, outside of the events that the show presents. They're puppets, moving when they are picked up and put down when another puppet has to step in. Can you tell me what life does Ukawa lead? Can you tell me what personality does she showcase in conversations? What about Murase? Oka Eri? You can't. As I said, they are puppets, they're not characters, but the show pushes in this bullshit narrative and character arcs for each of them as if they were meant to be. They exist so that their powers can be used in the finale, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nI said that the characters don't feel like they couldn't fit in casual situations, but are there situations like that in this show? To be honest, not at all, but the show tries to hide that fact. The problem is, it does it really poorly. I'd compare it to someone who's really fat trying to hide behind a pole. There's obviously a large part of his body sticking out. same goes for those \"casual\" conversations in Sakurada. They try to showcase those dialogues between Kei and Haruka, but all they, or anyone in fact talk about are psychological scenarios and terms. Let me show you two supposedly laid-back conversations from this show:\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey, what are you thinking about\"\\n\r\n\"Have you heard of the Swampman?\"\\n\r\n\"No, what is that?\"\\n\r\nProceeds to explain the entire idea of the Swampman\\n\\n\r\n\"Your notebook was new today\"\\n\r\n\"Yeah\"\\n\r\n\"It's almost like as if a new world was born today\"\\n\r\n\"You mean like the Five-minute Hypothesis?\"\\n\r\n\"Yes. It's a thought experiment....\"\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them are clear and lazy attempts at explaining the viewer a concept that will appear, or has already appeared in the story, NOT casual conversations that those two characters would have. I heard so many times that this show is good at foreshadowing or that it requires lots of thought to understand, but I can't phatom anyone thinking that this is well written in. The main character explains everything before you can even think, like that time when a monster appeared representing some character, and the MC just, straight up, explained his design. That design was probably the most creative thing that happened in this show ever since they introduced the concept of powers, but nope, you don't get to understand it, the show understands it for you. It's aggravating to me as the viewer, the show doesn't have to implement those explanations into the narrative, nobody needs to hear about what they're called unless the characters can develop perspectives on them, which in turn can lead to several narrative uses or make for interesting character studies. Of course this show doesn't use them that way. Ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo if the casual conversations are ruined, and you can't enjoy thinking about the show since it's done for you, can you at least follow the mystery properly? No. The powers haven't been explored or given enough room for that to be available. Can you at least look at the things as they uncover, since the plot has some heart? Well, seems like you forgot that looking at it isn't fun at all too. Well, I think I can say this show is worthless now.\\n\\n\r\nI said all that I needed to about Sakurada Reset in the last paragraph alone, there's very little that I can add to it. If something, I guess I have to commend it that it capitalizes off of the characters and lets them grow with the story, but again, that's only noticeable because the show decides \"Oh well, they're different people now\", not because it's something that comes naturally, that you can see for yourself through their choices and interactions. There's nothing in their behavior or thought process that changes, even though they underwent this \"big\" change. The same tone, the same facial expressions, the same mannerisms, the same thinking process, all remains just as it was. It's just that now, they apparently have a different opinion on something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show lacks any sort of real value, both as an experience and as a piece of art, if you can even call it that. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm done.\\n\\n\r\nAs always this is purely my opinion, but I can't encourage you to develop your own. Watch at your own risk.",

            "content": "Every season has its crop of shows that just simply aren't up to snuff, and Spring 2017 is no different. Sakurada Reset, however, manages to blow all the other bad shows out of the water with just how awful it is. It attempts to lure you in with a fairly interesting gimmick about time travel and super powers, but once you actually start watching it's all downhill from there.\r\nEpisode 1: Right away you can tell that something is wrong with this show. For one, the characters do not feel like actual people. You can count the amount of time that the MC blinks on asingle hand, and all camera shots are static without any feeling or depth to them. The way the characters robotically say their lines as if reading off of a script provides no entertainment for the viewer. The episode drags on endlessly due to its slow pacing and massive amounts of just dialogue. However, the first episode is just the tip of the iceberg. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2: Reset was fairly mediocre during its first episode, with the concept of different abilities carrying the show quite heavily. But even an interesting concept can't carry the show through the absolute garbage it's about to slog through. The previous problems of the first episode only intensify, and often there are moments where absolutely nothing happens and the two characters are just staring at each other in silence. Two new characters are brought in whose powers are extremely plot convenient and lazy. Logic that no human would ever think of is used to solve the episode's problems, all while the main characters stare blankly into space with no hint of emotion. The convoluted plot progression is extremely hard to follow and makes for a confusing watch. Not to mention that the episode is horribly paced and drags on like the previous episode. \\n\\n\r\nDoes Reset have the potential to pick itself back up? Honestly at this point it's extremely hard to tell. Even as someone who has begrudgingly followed the show for the past four weeks, I still don't know what exactly this show is and what it wants to do.\\n\\n\r\nAt some points you will start laughing not because of what's happening in the show, but rather the absurdity of the character's decisions and the irregularity of the show's art and animation. As such, I'd only advise watching this show if you're extremely starved for a series about time-travel and/or you're a masochist who likes watching bad shows. If my thoughts on this show change in the coming weeks I'll come back and revise my opinion, but that possibility is extremely unlikely.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 edit: Hasn't been as garbage as the first two episodes, but still has not  improved enough to change my opinion.",

            "content": "\"Who owns the McGuffin will control all the abilities in Sakurada\" Don't worry, the McGuffin meaning is complicated, but at the end, we could understand it ... or not.\r\nThe weighted score and negative reviews scared a lot of the persons around. The complexity in the first episodes was the escape route for a lot of individuals. Gladly, I decided to continue with the story, and I am not disappointed. \r\nI consider this story very complicated, and you need to pay extra attention to the details. That is the reason why at first in the building, several users complained about the pacing and the boredom. \r\nThestory. All the persons in a city (Sakurada or Sagrada) were born with some power. Kei Asai has a particular power, he can remember everything and with the help, Haruki Misura that can restore the time back to some days, work as a team to help the persons of the city with complicated matters and situations that affect their world. If a person leaves, the city will forget that has power, but it isn't the case of Kei. He can't forget anything. \\n\\n\r\nIn the development of the story, there are several changes, conspirations, situations, actions, a twist of the story, unexpected correlations, new powers, cats, etc. I decided not telling more because the most positive aspect of this animation is the story, \\n\\n\r\nThe characters. The complexity of each character is great. In this story, we don't have a generic nature. All of them are needed in a certain way to maintain the balance in the whole story. Each character has different powers, but not in the way that are OVERPOWERED. They have a single power that could affect the environment but needs the support of other characters to do it. In other words, a simple being can't alter the story. The personality of them is flawless. Each character has needs, and take decisions based on that needs, has doubts and ideas. The building of each person that appeared in the story could be complex, but it is in a right way. Each arc will affect a group of characters, but you need to pay attention to the details because in the next episodes all that information is going to be needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art maybe is considered average. It is passable, and I am sure that the art group didn't care about it because they focused on the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. All the ED (1, 2) and OP (1, 2) are good. However, I liked the first OP and the second ED. The sound mix is standard. They don't need a complex mix here, so they did good work. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I understand that the first episodes are complex. The story could seem tedious, but after some episodes, all start changing. We will know the reason for all the details. Sakurada is like Charlotte, and we won't understand what is happening until the end. If you like good stories that aren't predictable, then this anime is a good option. If you are seeking fights, several actions and excessive use of powers, then you should just skip it. This animation isn't for everyone.  \\n",

            "content": "Here's a quick summary: The first 2 episodes suck ass, judge it after watching episodes 3 and 4. Episode 4 is where it starts to get real, the characters seem lifeless but they will get better.\r\nStory: (9/10) (it only says 10/10 because that 6.66 is bs)\r\n    Sakurada is a town that is disconnected from the rest of the world where everyone living their openly show their powers yet no one outside knows about this.\r\n   It starts of with Haruki a girl who can turn back time for 3 days but is useless since her memories revert back as well, Keithe guy who has picture perfect memory and is able to affect Haruki's reset. If it seems interesting now stick to that feeling cause you're in for a really shitty first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n    While it is a super power anime it more so focuses on out smarting you opponent rather than blasting him to pieces and the way their powers interact with one another and how they use it to their advantage is something to note.\\n\\n\r\n   The story telling while it may seem very poor at first it gradually improves over time and at a certain point everything that takes place will make sense, especially everything that Souma has been referencing up to this point. \\n\\n\r\n   The main reason why everyone has been dropping this anime is because of the atrocious first few episodes. Feeling rushed and unpolished, leaving no room for logical thinking cause they literally straight up tell you what their powers are and what the specifics are instead of determining that for yourself and also these random ass quotes (that will make sense in the future) that try too make it sound cool.\\n\\n\r\n   I as well felt that the story telling was trash almost even dropping it. But it makes up for the next few episodes where they tie things up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n   The characters seem lifeless with no emotions, speaking in monotones and a boring personality it's very obvious.\\n\\n\r\n   But their character do develop, it might not be a very drastic (like Midoriya from BNHA) but you know they are improving you just have to look closer, in how they speak in how they interact with one another and their gestures. \\n\\n\r\n  They may not break down crying when their sad or clench their teeth and grip their fist when their furious but you can still feel them.\\n\\n\r\n   Like Haruki's motionlessness and slight pulsing of the eyes when she felt extreme sadness or Kei's, when he's sad is a bit more submissive and speaks his mind less and is lost in thought. These slight nuances make their character.\\n\\n\r\n   Their development while kind of obvious some people miss, like when Haruki's is in complete distrust with Kei due to the fact that he can use her ability to his advantage and eventually instead of not trusting she doesn't follow anyone but him. There's a lot more to talk about, but then I'd be spoiling it.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\n   The art is beautiful and the VA's and SFX do a great job. Even while speaking in monotones they never seem \"unlike\" the character and the slight nuances to the way they speak also shapes the characters really well.\\n\\n\r\n   You can really tell they spent a great deal of time in this, especially to the animation (even more specifically to that wave scene, must've taken half their budget for that)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\n   While it may seem like shit at first they really fix things up in the later episodes. This is also quickly becoming one of my favorite Mystery anime of all time (maybe even better than Another, Shiki, Hyouka). \\n\\n\r\n  What you have to do is stick to that synopsis and how good it sounds, but most important of all is keep an open mind because even a piece of gold is shit if you keep perceiving it like shit.",

But the more episode i watch the more engaging the story has become. \r\nI think sakurada reset isn't for anyone,if you watch anime for fun or want \"normal\" approach. If i make comparison with other anime it isn't charlotte but \"Subete Ga F ni Naru\". The story didn't immediately start, it take some time with small hints here and there.

But it may not be a master piece, and I also have to wait for the rest of the four episode.\r\nThis anime is plot heavy, it involves a lot of dialogues but not very much action scenes. It has a large amount of dialogues because it needs them to explain the motivation of each character and how the abilities are working together to create the result. I was notpaying full attention when I watched the first three episodes and already feel falling behind the plot, therefore I go back and re-watched the first three, and never put my attention on other things when I watched the later episodes. Even with my full attention I still need to pause the anime to let the plot digest a bit from time to time, and so far everything is making sense to me, and sometimes even trigger me to think about the philosophy it is trying to express.\\n\\n\r\nTo avoid each part of the story being stretched too long for the audience to keep track with, the anime separate itself into different \"small\" stories or events. This is the first time I've seen an anime presented in this style, and for me it works pretty well. At the beginning of each new story, it will tell you how many episodes this story will last, and therefore give you an overall sense of how complex this story is going to be. Normally telling the audience when the current event is going to end won't work very well, because most of the stories in anime are not very deep. However, this design works well with this particular anime because the plot is deep already, and telling the audiences how long the story is going to last will keep the entire season at a steady pace. And even you already know how long this story is going to last, you still won't guess what will happen in the last episode, so knowing which episode is going to be the end of the current event actually make me more exciting and anticipating for the final showdown.\\n\\n\r\nRight now, too many animes are filled with service scenes for both male and female audiences, and the stories are often too boring to be bothered. A lot of people are complaining about this phenomenon yet here is an anime with a real story and people are giving it a low score because they didn't really use their brain to watch it? It just makes me feel like we deserve all those trash animes because when there is finally a great anime, we are not appreciating it.\\n\\n\r\nLast word: if you don't understand a thing, don't rate it.",

            "content": "After the first 3 episodes of this show, I was ready to pick apart every single flaw and problem that this show had. I was so enraged at the lack of quality that had made up the first three episodes. This was going to be my magnum opus review where I shredded apart this show and exposed it bare for the lack of quality that it was. \r\nBut then something happened. It suddenly stopped sucking. Maybe it was Amazon treating the subs better or maybe it was the show having a clearer idea of what it was doing. Either way it got better. Not good,but better. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then came the last arc in which finally Sakurada Reset finally knew what it was doing and turned itself into an enjoyable and actually good show. \\n\\n\r\nFor one arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad fact is, besides the one arc the show is still overall sub par. Even in its best arc the direction is still lacking and the art is so bland and featureless that it adds nothing to the show. Often times it looks like they aren't even trying as there are no real directing cues, or moments with more than bland featureless art. It's all the same dull looking and unexpressive views that don't add anything over and over again. The voice acting as well as too monotone and while it does lead to a certain atmosphere, it also hinders the emotional impact of the work, and also conflicts with one of the shows biggest problems: Convolution.\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset is a fan of Convolution. It likes to make nothing simple. If there ever where a simple answer, Sakurada Reset would find some way to go around it. There is one lady whom one has to phone 5 times just to get her to pick up and talk. Why is this done? Convolution. They talk in metaphors and in psychology more than they talk one on one. And while that can be interesting at times. When done too much it gets overdosed and ends up saturating the show with too much of that. It makes the connection between the characters feel less human and feel less realistic. It makes the characters themselves feel less realistic They don't feel like humans anymore rather like machines or some other entity. It makes the show fall apart. \\n\\n\r\nAdded to that is a script that is awful at best. The line \"If you ask me, I'd say I'm on the talkative side, and I'm pretty expressive. My name is Kei Asai.\" sums up its problems very well. First off that's a lie. He's not expressive, and if the show thinks he is then they've failed at expressing that. Second off, no one talks like that. The formatting is all wrong and doesn't make much sense. Third off he's telling this to one of his best friends (whom promptly matters very little afterwards) not a stranger. It comes off as a poor attempt to explain the characters to us even though it makes no sense in context. Characters are best built by actions not poor explanations like this. The worst of the lot was when a character said, \"I'm not sad. You're the one who's sad., I'm crying because you're sad.\" after an event that was very impactful on their own life. It was so completely out of left field and unnatural that it was hard to take the show seriously after that. If someone is really going to play that card after the serious event that happened, then that person is lacking in humanity.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of these traits the characters don't really develop until the end. Even then the development is quite confusing. The characters are so convoluted themselves that it's hard to take anything at face value. Sometimes I feel like simplicity is underrated. One can get across clear strong messages easily by going for something simple, clear, and definitive. But since Sakurada doesn't like any of that. It makes a game of trying to figure out everything from the statements that are made and the ways that the characters talk to each other. Not to mention a lot of what actually is there isn't anything that interesting. Most of it ends up in characters that love the MC, which isn't really well written. One character is defined by her love for the MC and basically does everything for him and because of him. It's shallow characterization and it's annoying to see a one-dimensional character devoid of development even throughout 24 episodes. While it does actually get put in depth later and does have some merit, for most of the show it's shallow and boring.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all of the information that Sakurada Reset gives and among all its conversations, it's very boring and hard to follow due to those convolutions, a lack of directness and a lack of expression in the art, direction, and sound. It takes a lot of effort to watch for no real reward and overall it just isn't any good. The worst of which is episode 11 which has to be one of the worst episodes I've ever watched, due to how boring and frustrating it was.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that last arc does work well. The script did get a bit better over time, and as soon as it shifted into mindgame time the show actually worked. It was still confusing but at least there was a pay off for its confusing moments. There was a reason to follow their lines of logic and there was a reason for the characters to code their messages more. While there were mindgames before none were as direct as they were in the last arc and they never worked as well as in the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the last arc worked well, sadly a final arc can't save a show. For the most of it's run it wasn't any good and was a pain to watch. Just because the last 5 episodes are decent doesn't make the first episodes worth it anymore. Even though I did like those last episodes I still wouldn't recommend it to others because to get to them one would have to wade through a lot of crap. And frankly, it's not worth it. If you like overly convoluted and dialogue heavy works you might like this. However if you can't stand boring visuals or can't put up with trying to decode everything including the mangled thing they called a script, it's not worth your time and you're best off not watching it.",

            "content": "in watching sakurada reset, i found myself reminded of works by james joyce, franz kafka, and arthur conan doyle. like joyce's works, information in sakurada reset is presented on several different levels simultaneously and does require a bit of effort to unravel, which [depending on your point of view] could either be refreshing, or simply make your head hurt.\r\ni also found several points in common with other anime, such as steins;gate, occultic;nine, the kubikiri cycle, and others of the genre. sakurada reset is, at its most basic, a mystery. if you like puzzles and thinking about things, and won't complain if there's no fanservice, ecchi,or action scenes, then this anime may appeal to you. since the progress of the anime is driven almost exclusively by dialog, you may get bored if you prefer anime that are action-driven, but you'll most likely enjoy it if you get into character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nlike the other anime i mention above, sakurada reset involves a level of intellectual abstraction that leads to a certain mood. the characters' dialog, plot development, even the visual composition tend away from the concrete and toward the symbolic and metaphorical, following methods similar to those commonly used in existential and surrealist literature. indeed, many times in sakurada reset, i was reminded of kafka's 'der proze\u00df' -- not from the way the plot developed, but rather due to the interactions of the characters ; often, they simply accept at face value what is happening to them [or the answers others give their questions] -- never really fighting it, or even questioning deeply at all, but rather blindly going along, surrendering their own power to vague, ambiguous, anonymous forces hidden from us behind amorphous names like 'the bureau'. even people who work for the bureau are doing this, so we are left wondering ... 'who' is ultimately responsible ?\\n\\n\r\nthere is also a sort of 'absurdism' in sakurada reset that reminds me of kafka's 'die verwandlung'. the salesman in 'die verwandlung' simply accepts his strange mutation without looking deeper. simiarly, in sakurada reset, once again, many of the characters just sort of accept some very strange circumstances or people's behaviours without looking deeper, as though it were somehow 'obvious'. furthermore, often the characters in sakurada reset speak completely openly and plainly, without any hint of self-protective evasion or pretense -- even when doing so would quite obviously place them in danger -- which adds to the absurdist feel. all of this serves to create a mood which is sometimes very strange, but also charming, in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nalso like the other anime i mention, the main story acts as a vehicle for a philosophical viewpoint [which i won't spoil here... ;) ]. it's unfortunate that there typically isn't a 'philosophical' category in the genre listings, these would all most likely have that tag.\\n\\n\r\nalthough there is a superficial similarity to other anime where the characters have extraordinary powers [such as 'charlotte', for example], that's really about as far as that goes. instead, i get a distinct surrealist vibe woven intricately into a long story with many apparent contradictions that aren't resolved until much later.\\n\\n\r\nspeaking from a technical standpoint, there's nothing earth-shattering here ; both the art and sound are respectable, and about what you should expect.\\n",

The plot twist that happened in order to explain the connection that everything had was just plain fenomenal.\r\nThis show started really slow but it suddently improved a lot by keeping this mystery alive, Soma Sumire had to be one of the best plot triggers I have ever seen in an anime.\r\nThe main caracter AsaiKei is just plain smart and has a really nice line of thought in the whole series. The other main caracter, the girl \"Haruki Misora\" comes off as the plain type of girl but i do feel things will change as the series goes on.\\n\r\nRight now im very satisfied with the whole developtment of the series so far and i hope things will keep on getting more and more interesting.\\n\r\nI'd rate an 8 overall but things might change for better or worse as time goes by.\\n\r\nIf you've dropped this series be sure to pick it back up cause i'm sure you won't regret it.

            "content": "Damn the current description on MAL really sucks. Can someone accept my translation of the official synopsis that I submitted a few days ago? Because I feel like with that description, being what many people see before they watch the show, really screws up people's expectations on it.\r\nSo, the premise of this story is that a friend (Sumire here on) of our protagonist(s) (Kei and Haruki) has set up a mystery, and they are going to figure it out because that friend killed herself, and solving that mystery eventually (sort of) resurrects her. NOT \"guy uses superpower to overthrow the authority in a town ofsuperpowers\", or \"club solves problems issued by the authority\"!\\n\\n\r\nFirst three episodes are focused on setting things up, showing the world to the viewer, and establishing a reason to care about Sumire's death in ep3. The rest of the first half is where some seemingly random things happen, and they end up having a chance to sort of resurrect Sumire.\\n\\n\r\nSecond half explores what Sumire's plan actually was, and more and more things clear up about her, and probably Kei's past as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story requires people to have enough interest to stay until they realize Sumire is able to see the future and munipulate it to some point. And that everyone apart from Kei and Haruki has vivid emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is at times quite dull though. Really, there are a few 5+ second still frames of just, say, Kei's face. Sure that shot is still, but they could've at least added a bloody blink or a bit of wind or even a slight camera movement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. in my opinion, music is nice, story is great and would be agreed if it wasn't a weekly show, characters are interesting if you're willing to think a bit, and I enjoy it a lot.",

            "content": "\u201cBoring story, unrealistic characters, and too much dialogue.\u201d\r\nThese complaints are thrown around a lot when it comes to this show (the former two more than the latter), and while you can easily substitute those complaints with \u201dslow-burning\u201d, \u201cstoic\u201d and \u201cdialog-heavy\u201d, the 6.63 it got on here makes it obvious that there is something about this show that just doesn\u2019t click with the audience.\r\n   Now, I\u2019m not here to tell you that those complaints are invalid (because they aren\u2019t) all I\u2019m trying to do here is explain why those aspects aren\u2019t hindering my enjoyment.\r\nI\u2019ll start by addressing the pacing, from there on I canaddress the other two complaints.\\n\r\n   This show is an incredibly slow-burn, and it\u2019s easy to see how this puts off a lot of viewers. But what made me like this pacing has to do with the characters. It\u2019s immediately clear that something is off about them; the pseudo-philosophy, static demeanour and emotionless voices- this is what got me interested. \\n\r\n   One of the questions presented in the first episode is if a machine with human aspects should be considered a human. At first, I thought it was just trying to shoehorn in as much philosophy in its 24-minute runtime, but as I got further into the series I started to realise what they meant by it. \\n\r\n   You should not see these people as real humans. That will only leave you with disappointment. Instead, you should see them as characters, and it\u2019s your job to pick out the human parts to latch onto.\\n\r\n   This may just sound like a bad excuse for badly written characters, and yeah, maybe it is. But for me, it\u2019s something special, something I can look forward to every week.\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019m done with my little soapbox speech, I\u2019ll start with the more objective aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, about what you\u2019d expect from anime in 2017, but the lack of movement may be a deal-breaker for you if the dialogue isn\u2019t enough to keep you watching. And some characters were off-model in the last episode (13).\\n\r\n   The sound is excellent for what it is. It\u2019s used very conservatively, and that works in its favour. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my ramblings. I\u2019m not good at putting my thoughts into words, and this was my first attempt at writing a review, so please do not hesitate to tell me your criticisms. \\n",

            "content": "I am just copy pasting my reddit post instead of writing a new review. This review will spoil the first episode of the anime: \r\nI believe that the synopsis of the series makes **Sakurada Reset** seem like a high school superpower show while the first few episodes of the series makes it seem like a show where very very boring and dull characters solve other people's problems (like finding a cat) with the help of their abilities. T Both the synopsis and the first few (mini) arcs of the anime give the wrong impression of what this anime is really about. To anyone considering givingit a watch : it is in no way similar to Oregairu just because it has a \"service\" club, neither is it similar to Charlotte because it features teenagers with \"superpowers\". \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere are the things I really liked about Sakurada Reset: \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n#Thought experiments that might seem meaningless at first but are actually central to the overarching plot of the show:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first 2 arcs of the story, **Sakurada Reset** will often bore you with its long and \"boring\" (duh!) dialogues. What makes it \"worse\" is the fact that the main characters *Haruki Misora* and *Asai Kei* are very monotonous and show almost no emotions at all when talking. But I can assure you that every dialogue however meaningless it may seem has a significance in the long run. You often have to listen and follow the dialogues carefully to understand what they actually discuss and even then the reason to why they are even discussed might not make sense. **At first**. But as the story progresses you understand bit by bit what those boring conversations with out of place thought experiments actually implied, and that is when everything starts to make sense. What **Sakurada Reset** excels in is to actually make those philosophical ideas central to the story, instead of just mentioning them to seem smart *Cough* Anthropologist *Cough*.  Another aspect **Sakurada Reset** excels in is that the author doesn't try to insert his own views in the show and give his answers to those said thought experiments. Instead he lets the viewer come up with an answer of their own. One of these philosophical thought experiments is the famous Swampman experiment introduced by Donald Davidson in 1987: \\n\\n\r\nSuppose Davidson goes hiking in the swamp and is struck and killed by a lightning bolt. At the same time, nearby in the swamp another lightning bolt spontaneously rearranges a bunch of molecules such that, entirely by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form that Davidson's body had at the moment of his untimely death. This being, whom Davidson terms \"Swampman,\" has, of course, a brain which is structurally identical to that which Davidson had, and will thus, presumably, behave exactly as Davidson would have. He will walk out of the swamp, return to Davidson's office at Berkeley, and write the same essays he would have written; he will interact like an amicable person with all of Davidson's friends and family, and so forth.\\n\\n\\n\r\n **Sakurada Reset** takes a lot of different approaches to introduce this thought experiment. At first it is introduced by Souma Sumire - the deuteragonist of the story. She challenges Kei and Haruki with the question \"Who is the android?\" which the series will eventually give an answer to, while the viewer can come up with a totally different but equally correct answer. Later in the (first) same episode Kei is challenged by Souma Sumire with yet another question:\\n\\n\r\nSouma : \"God placed a curse on a young man. It was a curse that shot pain through the man's entire body when he came across a sad person. To avoid his pain the young man reached out to the sad people... Next, God made a fake copy of the young man. The copy had no will of its own, so it did the same thing the real young man did. The fake also reached out to the sad people. God gave the young man and the fake each, names of their own. \u5584(Zen) - Good/Goodness for one and \u507d\u5584(Gizen) - Hypocrisy for the other. Which one is 'Zen' and which one is 'Gizen'?\" \\n\\n\r\nWhile this might seem like an easy question what actually bewilders me is how central to the plot of the series this thought experiment is. It might seem like this question is only of importance to the first arc of the story, but is actually part of much more grand and tragic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are far more philosophical thought experiments in the series like \"Plank of Carneades\" and more revolving around the idea of a Swampman. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\n#The symbolic characters of Sakurada Reset\\n\\n\r\nHaruki Misora - one of the three main characters of the series has the ability to reset/rewind the world back(the universe/space itself gets rearranged into its prior state rather than time itself being rewound) to a certain point in time - longest three days prior. Every time she sees someone crying she uses her ability and resets time. She is overly empathetic and feels the sadness of the whole world. This has led to her losing her sense of self. In order to make the right choices she has given up on her emotions and sense of self. She is the personification of \u5584(Zen) - Goodness. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAsai Kei - the male lead of the series has the ability to recall everything he has experienced in detail, which also means that he can retain his memories when Haruki resets the world, although even she herself forgets everything. His powers combined with Haruki's ability basically gives them the ability to \"travel in time\"(There will be a ton of creative ability combinations in the series). Haruki Misora - the \u5584(Zen) is his ideal. He wishes to be all good, but all he can become is \u507d\u5584(Gizen). While seeing Haruki as an all good, a perfect being, he wishes for her to have an ordinary life - thus destroying the very thing he believes is beautiful. This act while being a \"betrayal\" against his ideals, is also righteous as he values a stranger's happiness more than his own ideals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSouma Sumire  is the deuteragonist of the story. While the story mainly revolves around the protagonists - Asai Kei and Haruki Misora, she sets up the conditions for their meeting. Her role is very central to the plot. I believe it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that she symbolises the God who creates the fake copy and sets him off on his predetermined journey. \\n\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\\n\r\n#You should watch Sakurada Reset IF...\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want a story that will challenge you with its intelligent questions and \"plays\".** Sometimes the abilities of Sakurada's citizens might be combined in brilliant yet very unexpected ways, and it might take a while for the viewer to understand how exactly a certain scene played out. In short, it is a story that will make you think. \\n\\n\r\n* **...you are tired of all those evil just for the sake of being evil antagonists.** **Sakurada Reset** will present you with 3 dimensional antagonist(s). You can actually empathise with the \"main\" antagonist of the series even though he is introduced really late in the story and entirely opposes the protagonist. There are even times where you might consider if the said main antagonist is actually the \"good guy\" of the story while the opposing force - the protagonist of the story is actually the \"bad guy\".\\n\\n\\n\r\n* **... you like time travel shows.** While being completely different in tone compared to most other time travel shows, there is a lot of \"resetting\" happening in Sakurada Reset which is essentially a type of time travel. Plenty of time travel shows use overlap of 2 timelines to tell a more thrilling story, showing characters go through events once then later coming back and doing them a 2nd time while avoiding overlap. But Sakurada Reset overlaps 3 timelines at times making for very complex manuvers made in order to acheive victories in cases.\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want a mystery show with a lot of twists, mature characters and a romantic subplot.** The romantic subplot of the story is mature similarly to the characters of it. The romance is not the usual \"will they, won't they?\" with tons of shenanigans that never lead anywhere in the end. The main characters although almost devoid of emotions are very open about the few emotions they do have. **Sakurada Reset** doesn't use \"shock effect\", so it is sometimes subtle when presenting its twists. Meaning you might even miss one of the said twists. It doesn\u2019t over explain details, but instead lets the viewer think about what actually went down. You might sometimes get flash forwards without realizing and that can make someone very confused. One of them happens in the beginning of episode 13, just after the opening. It is a flash forward to the final arc of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\\n\r\n#You probably won't enjoy Sakurada Reset IF...\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want a show with top of the notch animation**. **Sakurada Reset** is a low budget light novel adaptation. But even with that low budget David Production did wonders. The art itself can be quite beautiful and the animation is decent enough but it is nothing special compared to most of the other anime airing this year. \\n\\n\\n\r\n* **...you are not fine with a slow burner especially one without any action or fan-service at all.** Aside from being a slow burner that takes its time setting up different plot points and developing characters, it doesn't have anything fancy to make the viewer interested. Watching through the early parts of **Sakurada Reset** takes even more commitment than getting through the first cour of **Steins; Gate** (I enjoyed both cours to be honest). That is because while the first cour of Steins; Gate doesn't have many twists and isn't much of a thriller rather more like a slice of life instead, it has a lot of other elements to keep the viewers interested. Cute girls, cute traps, a chuunibyou male lead, fat weeb best friend for the us lonely weebs with boring lives to self-insert, a great comedy and much more. **Sakurada Reset** lacks all of these. It is an entirely different type of show while the two do have some similarities.\\n\\n\r\n* **...you want something where you can turn your brain off and enjoy.** Unless you carefully listen to what is actually being said in Sakurada Reset, you will be very confused and bored thus end up hating it. It is not \u201cslice-of-life\u201d kind of boring where you can just relax and enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset has really good EDs and OSTs in my opinion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n#My complaints with Sakurada Reset\\n\\n\r\nMy first complaint is how the director chose to adapt the source material. Instead of going with a usual order of the novel series, he started the anime with the third volume. The third volume of the novel series containing the \u201cMemory in Children\u201d arc got adapted into three episodes - episode 1, episode 2 and episode 10. The actual first arc of the story \"Cat, Ghost and Revolution Sunday\u201d doesn\u2019t start until the third episode. As you can see even the synopsis of the story is an introduction to \"Cat, Ghost and Revolution Sunday\u201d arc rather than \u201cMemory in Children\u201d. I can somewhat understand why the director decided to adapt it the way he did but I can\u2019t say it was a good move. Plot of **Sakurada Reset** is very complex and adapting it this way only made it harder for the viewer to understand. As a comparison you could say that it is like watching Kizumonogatari movies before watching Bakemonogatari series. It can be done, but it is probably not a good idea. \\n\\n\r\nMy second complaint with it is the subs\u2026 The subtitles for **Sakurada reset** can be really awful sometimes. It sometimes feels like the translator didn't even try. The translations of the lines often have no \u201cflow\u201d. It is as if it was machine translated and then edited to make sense. This is where **Sakurada Reset** really suffers in my opinion. As a heavily dialogue driven story it deserves much better subtitles. They even sometimes \u201ctranslate\u201d the names incorrectly. There were times when Souma was written as Soma instead. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have it as Soma unless you have a macron on \u2018o\u2019. The subtitles also confused me a few times. Check out the following sentence from the subs - \u201cGod made a copy of the young man and created a fake\u201d. This is a grammatically correct translation but it is also very confusing. So did he make a copy AND create a fake? Obviously the fake man is the copy but it could have made clearer with a better phrasing such as \u201cGod created a fake copy of the man\u201d or something of the sort. Another case of a horrible translation is from episode 10 where the question \u201cDid you hear the voice?\u201d (the context is that someone will either hear the voice or won\u2019t) is asked, and it gets answered with a \u201cWhich one do you want to meet?\u201d which makes absolutely no sense even knowing the full context. The actual question is \"\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067\u5408\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\" which has the same reading as \u201c\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u201d which means \u201cWhich one do you want to meet?\u201d while the original \"\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067\u5408\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\" means \u201cWhich one do you want it to be\u201d - meaning do you prefer if I hear it or not. I could have forgiven this mistranslation if there wasn\u2019t a context which the translator could have used. I am back to my original point - which also answers Souma\u2019s question \u201cWho is the android?\u201d. The damn translator is an android. Another mistranslation I remember is the translation \"You won't take action unless you want an ability.\" from episode 4. The correct translation would be something along the lines of \"Abilities won't activate unless you want them to\", I believe. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to mention that the subs did somewhat improve after the first cour of the anime. As an example when the same scene from episode 10 was shown in episode 12, the translation was correct. \\n\\n\\n\r\n# TLDR;\\n\\n\r\n Watching Sakurada Reset is like putting a puzzle together. It starts out as a hard  task but gets easier as you put more pieces together. Sakurada Reset might not make any sense in the beginning but everything is part of something grand that you can only obtain by putting those small pieces together to see the big picture. If you are ready for that, give this unique anime a watch. Start binging it now and you will have caught up before the finale airs. \\n",

(or that is my take on what I saw, where some may say I am giving too much depth to how things are in reality)\r\nOnly to observe how feelings emerge from the \"heartless\" characters.\r\nIt's not your typical anime, it doesn't lack emotion, it's not for everyone, it makes you think about life, death, love (love triangle), morality.\r\nCharacters are, as some people say, \"robotic\" at first, wherethey seem to lack emotion, maybe have a riddled way of speaking. I personally think no one can empathize with any of them, but here is my take on it, that is the best part of the show. This creates characters that speak in a weird way for their age, that no normal teen would use, and gives freedom to the questioning of human problems in a detached way.\\n\\n\r\nThe transformation of their personality and the way their emotions begin to arise is what got me hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting, but the way it is told may get confusing because of so many special powers, timelines etc...\\n\\n\r\nMusic was ok, did not pay too much attention to it, maybe it did not spark my interest, but I can say it stayed in form with what was happening around, meaning it did not feel out of place, unlike truly awfully other examples I saw in different anime.

Not only is it more boring than watching paint dry, it is trying to become a new level of trash, and each episode just keeps one-upping the previous in doing so. Every single character in the show is extremely boring, lifeless and robotic, has absolutely no human emotions, and makes illogical decisions for no reason. The characters have had zero character development over the last 13 episodes I have seen, even less than Sword Art Online, which as far as I'm concerned, takes a mastermind to pull off. The plot is inconsistent, makes no sense,and many important things are not explained properly. The forced melancholy mood on top of everything just serves to make the show more painful to get through.\\n\\n\r\n1/10",

            "content": "\"I like hearing wind chimes when I least expected it. Like finding a rainbow.\" Sakurada Reset; episode 3\r\n\"Please, Tomoki. It's like a ritual...like exchanging rings becasue you pledge your everlasting love to God.\" Sakurada Reset; episode 16\r\n\"Thank you, I wouldn't want the ice cream to melt.\" Sakurada Reset; episode 18\r\n\"Grab her by the p*ssy\" Sakurada Reset; episode 25\r\nSakurada Reset is an anime that grabbed my attention months before it started airing. The story's main gimmick- the reset ability- is an interesting concept that has been explored well in literature and other anime but with this anime promising a young duo using clever tactics and witin conjunction with the reset ability, it looked to be a good addition to the string of bad thriller anime that have been pervading the last few years. It was very unfortunate, then that I carelessly ignored checking up on the staff on this anime. And I payed for it.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE ANIME\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset is a flat, shallow, farcical anime that whole-heartedly thinks its a serious show. It's a tragic example of a good idea done completely wrong. Sakurada Reset's problems go way beyond simple bad writing and bad direction- it's a mix of so many terribly done aspects that it's actually possible they have no connection to each other. In other words, everything is individually bad and not becasue one part of the anime affects the other. It's an additively, not multipely, bad anime. This makes it more annoying than normal bad anime since those at least have things tied together to the point one bad thing affects everything.\\n\\n\r\nFist off, the characters. All the characters are boringly written with very little to actually develop them. Their dialogue is bad (more on that in a latter paragraph) and all of them except the main characters merely exist as plot conveniences whenever the main character needs a handy ability around. The main character himself- Asai Kei- is an omniscient and omnipotent God who simply cannot lose because he's always right. Not my words, mind you, the other characters all treat him like he's the Messiah coming down from heaven in a wave of majesty. He's incomprehensible. His entire backstory is incomprehensible. The other characters are just bland as heck. Most of them are introduced in small arcs in the 2nd act (eps 3-12) of the anime and all of them suck. The arc has them play as minor villains who, in the end, become allies for the main character in the final arc of the show. Damn this anime make them incomprehensible. I'll try and explain the main arcs in order.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc had the character- Murase Youka- have a terrible excuse in that she wanted to save a cat and you can clearly see the anime pad out the runtime with pointless dialogue and events that make no sense. But its climax was where she literally tried to kill Kei. She has literally zero reason to kill him but the anime was written to have her be crazy and stupid enough to do so. Not one character talked any sense during this confrontation or even before. In the end, she just pisses off until she is needed again by the show. Next arc we have Oka Eri as our Scooby Doo villain of the week. She's a character who for some reason holds antagonistic feelings towards our hero and wants to \"beat\" him. That would be great if the anime actually showed us any motivation for her. It's offhandedly explained in some throwaway dialogue but this girl has no reason to be as bitchy as she is. The arc also has her do F*CKING NOTHING at all. Seriously, she just shows up, bitches about things, and pisses off to wait until the anime needs her again. Also in this arc there's something about a Witch and shit which I'm sure is important but was so boringly done I forgot most of it. Oh yes we are also introduced to some bloke who can transfer abilities from one to another through touch. He'll be a super important bland character later. Oh yeah, we also have WhatsApp guy. I mean Tomoki. He's a friend. I think. The anime doesn't exactly show him unless it needs him. Funny...I'm seeing a trend here...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the main problem with all these characters is that they're just so boring. The main characters (Kei and Misora) have the exact personality of an unpainted brick wall. I don't get how anyone can get behind their relationship because, unique as it is in anime, it's a very poorly handled relationship. There's a fair bit of emotional scenes in this anime and all of them fail due to the fact that these are badly written characters. Much of the development is rushed (ironically in such a slow show) and ham-fisted and the emotional scenes get in the way of much of the show instead of weaving itself closely. This is done much better in the final act of the show where I could see the anime sort of trying to give proper development but its let down by bad pacing and direction. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character I was even half impressed with was Souma Sumire- the only character to carry this show from \"unrelentingly horrendous\" to simply being \"really terrible\". She's a walking plot device. Not kidding, she even describes herself as such. She is, however, the only character with even half-reasonable motivations and explanations for what she does. She has an actual interesting character arc and sees more development than all other characters combined. She's also the only character we see being subtle in her methods and you can see faint threads throughout the story that she leaves behind- meaning she has a genuine presence within the show (for example, setting up the McGuffin so that Kei can meet up with Youko. I think that was one of the reasons. Though it still doesn't give any reason for Youko to be so bitchy about things). Helped A LOT that she was voiced by a top form Aoi Yuuki who puts everyone else to shame (not too difficult though since they're all as engaging and relatable as sandpaper). All other characters in this show do not matter. They're all plot conveniences used by the main character to look smart and show his omniscience. \\n\\n\r\nThen finally, we have our villain- introduced in the second half of the show and wants to erase all abilities from Sakurada town. He's a villain so bad he puts the villains from ERASED, Chaos;Head and Guilty Crown to shame. I literally know nothing about him. The anime does such a poor job of building him up as a character and thinks flashbacks and sinister smiles are enough to make him imposing in any way. The anime tries so hard to tell you he's a smart guy with an excellent plan that they fail to actually show him being smart and doing excellent things. All he really does is get driven around in a badly rendered CG car, writing notes and talking about how angsty his childhood was. The anime does a sloppy job giving him any motivation to why he wants to erase abilities from Sakurada. This creates a problem in the main conflict of the show. There's supposed to be this grand conflict of ideologies in this show about how Kei wants to keep abilities (also very poorly shown) and direclty opposes bad guy's desire to erase abilities. For all the anime trying to sound smart it doesn't give us anything tangible as to why we should support any of these characters. The themes that run through the arcs are poorly carried over and lost in the bad dialogue near the end of the show. This anime has very little to offer in challenging the viewer's views as it can't even present the opposing viewpoints of the characters very well. Also, the 2 side goons of the main villain have no personality at all. But that's not surprising. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about as incomprehensible as the characters. It's mostly all over the place with numerous plot holes that pop up whenever a character opens their mouth to explain something (which is frequent).The show also tries to do these really \"clever\" twist showing Kei's intelligence but these twist are shown in such an infuriating way its impossible to take seriously. The anime gives us so little information up until the twist that when it does come we're just left standing confused at what is going on. This mostly happens near the end of the show when they're wrapping things up but a good example would be in the penultimate episode with the bad guy in the car talking with Kei (btw episode 23 is one of the worse episodes of the show which says something). It's revealed that KEI ACTUALLY HAD A TALK WITH THIS GUY IN THE OTHER TIMELINE WHEN THERE WERE NO ABILITIES. What a cop-out. We got shown none of this nor was anything done to allude to the possibility that this happened, Kei just kind of says \"Yeah. So I got you to talk in that timeline. Now I know everything because I'm the main character.\". Not all the twist are as badly done as that but it definitely contributes to the overall incomprehensibility of the story. If you want more details of plot holes from Sakurada Reset pm me and I'll find some (its such a bad anime I have to research into why it is so bad). For the most part the story is only about as bad as the characters get though due to much of it being people sitting around talking about stuff. \\n\\n\r\nNow we go on to the crux of this show's problem. Every problem this show has traces back to one thing- the dialogue. The dialogue in this anime would make M Night Shayamalan proud. Its terrible. I can't begin to describe how badly written the dialogue is. It's like it was written by a robot who doesn't know how normal human interactions are like. This makes the writing feel mechanical. Too flowing. Too unnatural. The show is pervaded by this kind of dialogue. Every character, with no exception, speaks in parables, Aesops, thought experiments or metaphors. I thought it was only the 2 main characters but no its everyone. There's so many examples I could show you but I'll take one from near the end of the show. Kei goes back to where he was born and raised and meets his mother who has had her memories rewritten so Kei can stay in Sakurada. A simple dialogue between a mother and her son whom she has forgotten about should be an emotional gripper with subtlety. But no. They speak like robots. The dialogue is so unfitting of the real emotional music played around it its jarring. This is an extreme example of where the dialogue messes up but this ENTIRE SHOW has dialogue like it. The quotes in the beginning of this review are mere dabs of taste of what this show actually does. I watched it subbed like everyone but I know a fair bit of Japanese so I can safely say the subs are actually less silly than what the poor voice actors had to say at some parts. It ruins every interaction, makes everyone bland and shows how little the main characters develop (even in the personal monologue scenes.). It's dialogue that doesn't make them sound anything human. I know the point of the show is to show how detached many of the characters are but when everyone speaks like Shakespeare all the time its unnerving. It boggles my mind to think how anyone could approve of this sort of writing. The director and writer must have both agreed to have dialogue like this to be in the anime. You honestly have to watch the show to hear some of the dialogue that is being said. Its the main reason the story and characters are incomprehensible. They cannot express themselves naturally. The show has obviously done this to sound more mature but it only serves to disengage and confuse the viewer. I stress with no small experience that Sakurada Reset has the absolute worse dialogue I have ever seen in anime. Some of it is self-destructive to the story. Much of it is pointless. And all of it is  brain-melting. I repeat THE DIALOGUE SUCKS.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing in this review is something that is not as bad as the dialogue but much more annoying- the direction and art and animation. The director isn't particularly well known but has directed stuff like Non non boyori and Kokoro Connect. Sakurada Reset has a slow pacing with many stills like those anime but its so...boring. Nothing of interest happens in the shots, the lighting is undramatic for much of the show, the shot composition and angles are bland and uninspired and there is no subtle changes in things like character expressions or body language. It really is just people standing around and talking to  a flat, level, mid-shot camera position. Its one of the most boring directed anime I've watched. Art direction is also flat with the aforementioned lighting but also has crappy colour design, bland backgrounds, unexpressive character designs (except Souma Sumire and maybe even Chiruchiru), REALLY BAD CGI and a general blandness in the settings. There's such and overuse of white and light colours in the show that SJWs might protest it. So many scenes could have been directed better and therefore made better. There's a scene in episode 16 where  the show has very real potential to build up on a romantic relationship between Kei and Misora where Kei ask Misora in a message to meet him on the roof. The scene was directed blandly with unnecessary cuts of Misora WALKING to the roof. It would be far more effective to simply focus on Misora herself with some slight change in expression and body language to just display some of her thoughts and inner turmoil (its episode 16, she should be at least somewhat developed by now) and have the camera linger on her from a high angle show framing her in the bottom right or left. But no. I guess walking is more important to show. \\n\\n\r\nOther problems I have with this show...They almost ruined KanaHana's and Ishikawa Kaito's careers by forcing them to do bland deliveries of bad dialogue. The anime has terrible sense of time and location. In one instance a month had passed from the beginning of an episode but it really felt like a few days at most. The Bureau is a rubbish organisation on par with the Orbital Knights from Aldnoah Zero and Daath from Guilty Crown. The other characters I didn't mention like Ukawa and the teacher being completely stupid and changing motivations on a dime for reasons I fail to understand. The abilities being poorly explained or shown in general with few exceptions and the fact that the only actual abilities being shown are only shown to become tools for the main character to use (Except for the ghost girl thing. That was entire pointless and will take a team of scientist at least 5 years to understand why the writers even included it). The anime looks rubbish even though its the same studio that made Jojo. Things I liked? Ehhhhhh the music was pretty?\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset is an anime that had suckers falling for it with its supposed intelligence. What it really is is Kami sama no memochou except that it sucks. The characters are so badly written and bland its difficult to see any meaningful development. They're so unexpressive it makes me cry. If you want to see a show that is actually smart with clever dialogue and narrative twist as well as being well directed and beautiful to look at, watch Kino's Journey. If you want a show that does a mystery thriller better, Gosick is your answer. The Raildex series are infinitely superiour in terms of a place with abilities and using abilities to save people (as well as being a much better in-depth character piece). All in all, avoid watching this show and if you have watched it for fun and not for academics like me, I feel so bad for you since there's just so much better stuff out there.",

            "content": "Watching Sakurada Reset felt like watching various popular shows at the same time:\r\n~ Take a setting like that of \"Charlotte\" where people have special powers,\r\n~ but make the story revolve around few characters with time reversal like \"STEINS;GATE\",\r\n~ bring in an MC who has logic and intelligence like Ayumu from \"Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna\", \r\n~ Making the conversations long like \"HYOUKA\" or \"MONOGATARI series\" and\r\n~ finally most importantly add the philosophy like that of \"MAWARU PENGUINDRUM\" whose true essence never came out and there you get \"Sakurada reset\"\r\nSo basically, the story is simple, a town having people with special abilities and there is a mysteriousAdministration Bureau which controls how the things work, but our MC tries to help them but also tries to uncover the secrets behind the organization.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with this series is that, it tried to put 24+12 episodes of content in 24 episodes which made it seem little less lively but that doesn't mean the series is worthless like the rating shown, but to be honest the content of the story is on par with all the names of anime I have mentioned earlier. As the story covers events of elementary, middle and high school life in just this short span.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has one of the best written stories because when it states the rules of a person's abilities, it strictly sticks to it and also gives us insight of how it can be used various other things, which you might not expect when you aren't thinking out of the box, which shows like \"Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works\" failed miserably, as they don't give any proper reason for rules being bent for the sake of story.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing which I've found interesting in this series is the \"Philosophical thoughts\" which were really well written and analyzed and no doubt they are even applicable in our real world.\\n\\n\r\nComing to characters, its the main drawback of the series, I mean mostly only 3 characters are developed and that too you wouldn't know much of their backstory about why they were being emotionless. That's what makes people hate this show, i.e., you can't say which character you like the most or whose behavior you liked, but you can only just say that the ending is beautiful and a story worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC Asai Kei might not be cool, but he is definitely one of the smartest characters in anime history. Its just that he is not someone who you might take for a favorite person, but he has good ideas, also he is someone who tries to reach everyone needs, which is as if he is trying to be a God but if you just skip that part of his na\u00efve ideal rest assured is good.\\n\\n\r\nComing to soundtracks, there aren't any noteworthy soundtracks, but the op and ed songs are good to listen.\\n\\n\r\nArt is very common, which isn't much appealing to see but it's alright to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWell that being said, this series might not be something great, but it definitely underrated and has one of well-written story and philosophy, so watch it with patience as the ending is worth the watch. It doesn't have cool fights but it has some really interesting battle of wits. I know people dropped it because waiting for week for a single episode is a real pain, but now you can binge watch it and taste the true essence of a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Please Note This review assumes that you have finished watching Sakurada reset and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there will some spoilers within character analysis.   \r\nSakurada Reset is based off a popular light novel of the same name and introduces a rather interesting setting that puts a unique take on the powers genre. The overall premise of Sakurada Reset is twofold. On the surface Sakurada Reset is a power based anime that also feature heavy elements of human drama, mystery and school genre elements but it also features a unique play on the traditional powers anime. Because ofboth western influence and a need to make an anime stand out power based animes tend to feature either heavy combat or feature powers that are flashy to look at. Because of this it\u2019s a popular misconception among anime fans and general viewers that superpowers or in this case abilities are always flashy and powerful and has the potential to strike a guy a mile away. Sakurada Reset introduces its own take to this by going along an entirely different route. \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of setting Sakurada Reset takes place in a large town of the same name of which what is noteworthy is that the town houses a substantial amount of people who live in the town that have access to various types of abilities.  As noted before these abilities are not as flashy and destructive as what one would see in other forms of media. For example, the ability to send pre-recorded messages to one another via telepathy that can be delivered on a date and time of your choosing may seem normal to us and indeed may sound like it\u2019s similar to an email but this is a good example of what abilities in the anime are like. In that while they are not as flashy or powerful they are still able to provide to their users a means to enjoy their lives better and help others that may be less fortunate than them. This take on the traditional powers anime I felt was interesting as I felt that not all superpowers should be destructive or flashy and indeed some can be subtle and still have a powerful effect on people and society. The fusion of a traditional powers anime with human drama and mystery is also something that I quite liked about the premise and one that was rather unusual as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the premise is done let\u2019s move on \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Sakurada Reset follows the lives of Kei Asai and Misora Haruki two teenagers that live in the town of Sakurada that met each other on the prompting of Kei\u2019s old school friend Sumire Souma. The two of them because of living in the town of Sakurada the town where ability users live are both ability users and each have powerful abilities that help complement each other. The overall story common with modern animes features several different story arcs that are combined into the main plot while also having a number of sub plots as well. In the town of Sakurada both Kei and Haruki while still students on the surface use their powers to help the members of the bureau help maintain order within the town and solve ability related incidents. While solving problems with their powers is part of the overall plot that\u2019s not the only one as the growth and development of Haruki and Kei\u2019s relationship also forms it as well. As the series goes on and they encounter more characters and events Kei and his friends and allies soon discover that their involvement with the bureau will link them to much larger events that had in its roots in the towns mysterious past that can also affect the lives of everyone in the present.  Common with most modern anime Sakurada Reset features a number of plot lines that are bundled into the overall plot as story arcs each of I felt was unique. \\n\\n\r\nKei \\n\\n\r\nKei Asai played by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Owari no seraph and Occultic Nine fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A teenage boy that lives in the town of Sakurada Kei is a somewhat normal looking guy from initial appearances but beneath his somewhat mundane appearance Kei\u2019s personality is what defines him and allows him to be effective at countering the enemy. Personality wise Kei is a level headed, kind and caring person and as a result can understand the views of others quite easily which I felt was important for his job with the service club.  At the same time Kei, due to his level-headed nature is able to easily get to the heart of a problem by understanding the crucial parts of an event and come up with a means to solve it showing that he also has impressive deduction and analytic skills as well. However, while agreeable and pleasant to talk to when Kei is in his normal mode Kei has shown to have a more devious and cunning side to him when creating plans to deal with his opponents. In this state Kei while still bring his trademark cautiousness to the table is also willing to place himself and his friends at risk so as to allow his plan a higher chance to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kei\u2019s most prominent skills that allow him to stand against powers greater than him in the overall plot is undoubtedly his intelligence and his skill at strategy both of which allowed Kei and his friends to outsmart the series main enemy faction the bureau on multiple occasions. Although still a teenager by all accounts Kei has shown himself to very adept at strategy especially with regards to both anticipating the enemy\u2019s moves and outsmarting them by moving events in motion before the enemy does which I found to be pretty amazing considering his opponents in the story are all adults. When combined with Kei\u2019s unique ability as a character Kei is someone that can be seen to be a cunning and devious opponent for the bureau that while still impressive in his own right is more so when he\u2019s working with allies that agree with his plans and aims. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Kei\u2019s personality changes a great deal as a result of both meeting the series main female leads and his interaction with a number of different characters that reside in the town. In the beginning of the series Kei while still having his trademark calmness was rather quiet in the beginning and rather indifferent to the plight of others that meant that he at this time only had a small circle of friends. However, as the series goes on and especially after Kei meets Haruki Kei\u2019s personality starts to gradually change becoming more understanding of others and their situations and more importantly learning to place more trust in his friends and allies as well. As a character, I thought that Kei was a pretty well-designed character that showed that despite his young age that good planning and strategy combined with good analytic and deduction skills can easily frustrate opponents that have larger numbers of assets at their command. Watching Kei direct his friends in demolishing the enemies plans that he gleaned using his skills was a joy to see. I thought that Kaito Ishikawa really did an excellent job portraying the character of Kei. \\n\\n\r\nSumire Souma  \\n\\n\r\nSumire Souma voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuuki is one of the main characters of the show and can be considered the second main female lead after Haruki. A old school friend of both Kei and Haruki when they were still in middle school Souma was the one that ultimately started the friendship between the two and with that create the foundation that will create the strong bond that both of them share as the series progresses. In the beginning of the series Souma behaved very much like a childhood friend of Kei\u2019s and looked rather normal which I believe was part of her character design as one would never assume that such a girl would become so important to the overall plot. \\n\\n\r\nPersonality wise Sumire is a positive and cheerful girl that at the same time is also rather bold and brave at times. Her relationship with Kei in the beginning of the series did seem to be rather close which she uses to her advantage by teasing him often and being mischievous around him.  However even at this point Sumire\u2019s mysterious nature is still prevalent and forms a part of her personality that only adds to her mystique. Like Kei Sumire as an inhabitant of Sakurada knows of the existence of abilities within the town. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike Kei and Haruki Sumire herself is a character that\u2019s tied in rather closely to the overall plotline and such her character actually changes quite a bit as the series goes on due to plot related events. In the beginning of the series Sumire while retaining her positive, cheerful and mischievous and teasing nature also retains a level of mystery about her that indicated that she was anything but a normal character.  As the overall plot progresses and events happen that bring grief to Kei and Haruki Sumire\u2019s nature gradually changes. While still retaining her initial personality traits Sumire becomes smarter and more adept at thinking ahead which is helped greatly by her ability. At the same time Sumire also becomes somewhat manipulative though in this she always puts the interests of Kei first and foremost. While Sumire for the most part is allied with Kei and co her true goals and objectives in the plot are as mysterious as she is which makes seeing what decisions she makes in the plot even more interesting.  As a character, I felt that Sumire was a pretty well-designed character that made great use of her mysterious nature, fluid personality and her abilities to both keep Kei and the bureau guessing her intents while at the same time helping those that are dear to her while not being obvious with her true aims. I felt that this character was not someone that can easily be played but I felt that her seiyuu Aoi Yuuki really did an excellent job portraying her despite the challenge of this role. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMisora Haruki \\n\\n\r\nMisora Haruki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Mahouka Koko no Rettosei and Psycho Pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main female lead of the series. A teenage girl that lives in the town of Sakurada Misora is initially a fellow student of both Kei and Sumire though they were actually in different classes. The three of them met as a result of the machinations of Sumire as part of her plan. In the beginning of the series Misora was someone that was somewhat of an outcast within the school as a result of her quiet nature and because she seemed to prefer solitude than anything else. In the beginning of the series it can be seen that Misora had a rather limited personality in her which made trying to converse with her difficult for both Kei and Sumire. At this point in time it can be seen that Misora is a quiet, reserved but at the same time perceptive person traits of which allow her to live life well enough until she met Kei. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses and as her relationship with Kei improves Misora\u2019s personality and attitude begins to gradually change. While still retaining her core personality traits Misora gradually starts to open up to Kei first then to their increasing number of allies. The gradual evolution of Misora\u2019s personality is actually part of the overall plot of the series and I felt that this aspect was done particularly well. As the series progresses Misora gradually becomes more confidant in herself and gradually starts to break out of the shell that she herself created to protect her. This is best seen in her talks with Nono. And indeed, by the latter half of the series Misora\u2019s personality had changed so much that she was almost a different person that she was before.  Although Misora and Kei did not have the best of first encounters their relationship gradually improves over the series and more so after they were paired together for their work with the service club.\\n\\n\r\n In terms of relationships the relationship between Kei and Misora can also be considered to be one of the main points of the overall plot. In the beginning of the series after they met each other their relationship can be seen to be similar to that of a teacher and a student as at this point in time Haruki was still learning what a personality is and how it will benefit her. This gradually evolves as the series goes on as the two become friends and partners. Though they met in the most unusual of circumstances I felt that the relationship between Kei and Misora was done pretty well and linking the personality changes with the developing bond between the two of them was a smart move. Apart from her bond with Kei what sets Misora apart from others is her ability itself which I found to be rather unique and one that I felt suited Misora a great deal due to her nature. As a character, I felt that Misora was a really interesting character that was well designed and seeing her gradually start to develop her own personality while bonding with Kei and his allies was something that held my attention on this show. I felt that Kana Hanazawa really did a great job portraying the character of Misora. \\n\\n\r\nSeika Nonoo\\n\\n\r\nSeika Nonoo voiced by veteran seiyuu Sachika Misawa of Accel world and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kei and Misora\u2019s main allies. A fellow student of Misora and Kei Seika is a quiet, well-mannered and kind and caring girl that seems to have a love for animals. In terms of personality Seika is very similar to Misora in that both are quiet and have trouble expressing their opinions of things. However unlike Misora Seika actually has her own unique personality and things that she likes and dislikes. While the series itself had a large number of abilities that were unique in their own right each of these abilities was paired with the personality of that person in question. In the case of Seika her affinity with cats was related to her powers and I felt this was a pretty good combo as it allowed her to use her beloved pets to help and aid her when needed.  Her ability in question was something that I felt was well suited to her. Though Seika and Kei met several times and can be considered to be acquaintances her relationship with Misora is perhaps the one that was the most important to the plot. While both Seika and Misora are quiet by nature it was interesting to see both learn from each other and bond over this shared trait of theirs. Watching Misora make her first friend with Seika I felt was a nice thing and did well to develop Misora\u2019s personality. \\n\\n\r\nEri  \\n\\n\r\nEri Oka voiced by veteran seiyuu Yuuka Aisaka of Ange Vierge and Active Raid fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kei\u2019s opponents/ally. A old acquaintance of Kei\u2019s that he seems to have known when he was in middle school Eri is someone that Kei has a rather complicated relationship with though in no fault to his own. Personality wise Eri is a smart, fast thinking and cunning girl who\u2019s not above using deception to achieve her goals. However, it is in her relationship with Kei that Eri\u2019s more unique personality traits come out. Eri\u2019s personality when she deals with Kei can be best described as that of a Tsundere.  This personality trait of hers I felt was actually pretty cute since she always ends up helping Kei in some way or form.  In fact, I find Eri\u2019s constant attempts to act as Kei\u2019s nemesis and be evil to be more amusing than ever. Of particular note to Eri\u2019s character is her name which when said in full actually means welcome back which I thought was appropriate for her character. \\n\\n\r\nMasamune \\n\\n\r\nMasamune Urachi voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Bungou Stray dogs and Buddy Complex fame is one of the main support characters of the series and serves as the main villain of the series. A high-level member of the Bureau Masamune true to his role and rank is a calm, composed and intelligent person that\u2019s also devious as well. Masamune\u2019s most prominent trait is twofold firstly it\u2019s his careful nature in which he will evaluate a given situation thoroughly before committing to any action and secondly his habit of recording every last bit of detail in his trusted notebook.  These two traits combined with is other personality traits make Masamune a tough opponent for Kei and Haruki and one that tests their intelligence to the limit. \\n\\n\r\nHowever what sets Masamune both as a great villain and makes him such a threat to the story and its characters is his motivation and what caused him to have such an extreme view. As a member of the bureau Masamune knows that the town has many people that has access to many different kinds of abilities but should these abilities really exist in the first place. Should man not strive to achieve what they want by their own efforts by themselves. These are questions that truly define the type of character that Masamune is as they help define his reasoning and the ideology that caused it and help in understanding why he is that dangerous. As a character, I felt that Masamune himself was a pretty well-designed character as in addition to having all of the assets that someone of his rank is entitled to call upon he also has something that a lot of villains in other animes lack which is conviction and a good origin story that created such a conviction in the first place. As someone that works with ability users as part of their duties Masamune\u2019s views which ultimately resulted in the creation of his ultimate plan was really surprising and even more so after looking at his backstory. As a villain, I felt that Masamune really did a great job in his intended role as he was as a result of his intelligence, personality traits and abilities was able to frustrate and surprise Kei and his allies on a regular basis and seeing them clash over their opposite views in a discussion rather than in a brawl was a welcome sight. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for the characters that appear in this series I felt was pretty well done and designed with my favorites being Haruki, Nono and Eri and Souma.  The uniform designs for the characters I felt were also pretty well done. The animation for the ability effects was also well done with the dream world created by Honoka being especially interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe anime as one that has a whole season makes use of two opening and ending themes. The first opening is Reset which is sung by Yui Makino and conveys a welcoming feeling to the town helped by the visuals that show each of the main and support characters. The ending theme for the first half of the season is Tonari Au sung by the Oral Cigarettes. The second opening theme that plays from ep13 and the start of the second half of the season is Dakara Boku Wo Tebanasu sung by Weaver. This opening helped convey a sense of revelation and truth to me.  The scene music for the series I felt was really good with a pretty large variation of instruments and music used to convey the different types of emotions and situations that each scene conveyed. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the series I felt was strong with particular praise going to Kana Hanazawa who voiced Misora and Aoi Yuki who voiced Sumire Souma. Both I felt were able to convey to the audience the many changes and emotions that their characters experienced on the show as their characters were developed and improved upon as the show went on. Kana I felt had a much harder job since the initial stage of her character was very quiet and very different to the character that we see in the end but im glad to see that she could portray the character of Misora successfully. The show also had a number of support characters that I felt also did a great job despite their roles not being important with the best examples being Maaya Uchida who voiced the character of Honoka, Rikako Aida who voiced the character of Sera and Kana Uetake who voiced the character of Sakuin. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Sakurada Reset\u2019s strong points that made it stand out to me was its strong story, interesting premise, complex characters, excellent voice acting and its unique take on abilities. The insight into human emotion and the relationships between characters was I felt another of its strongpoints. Story wise I liked the contrast between the two halves of the series as they were quite different but yet linked rather well with the series overall plot. In the first half, the story focused on the club activities of the two main leads Misora and Kei and I liked the fact that in this first half in addition to seeing how each case played out we also get to see how they develop their friendship and bond. Each of the cases that was featured here I felt was pretty interesting and evoked a number of emotions in me when I saw them. The fact that each of the methods that were used to solve these cases was focused on negotiation and observation rather than rash action which is used in other animes was also refreshing and matched well with the atmosphere of this series. The second half of the series I felt was very different to the first as it was more focused on specific events and saw a lot of revelations and surprises both for the story and for individual characters as the main enemy plot was revealed.  The teamwork that the main characters exhibit with others was also something that I felt was done nicely and seeing them combine their abilities for Kei\u2019s plans was fun to see.  The characters that were in the series I felt were also pretty well designed and pretty complex with each having interesting backstories and motivations especially the main villain Masamune and the character of Sumire Souma. The unique take on the abilities that serves as one of the shows main premises I felt was interesting and it was nice to see abilities that are neither flashy or destructive but yet still are different enough to define them as abilities. Seeing the main cast use this to change the world and stop the main villain was really entertaining. While I do agree that the story can be hard to follow by some due to the amount of twists and revelations it\u2019s not as hard to follow as some others animes I seen. In the end while the views of both sides were both interesting I felt that I agreed more with what Kei and his allies were fighting for which is another good point for this series in that the reasons themselves were also good. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of score I would give it a 9/10 due to its unique premise, excellent story, well-designed characters and a unique take on abilities plus its focus on human emotion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Anyways, i will be giving my take on it.\r\nThis anime is for kinda experienced viewers, & i don't mean mature, but experienced. If u have watched tons of anime, & by this time its hard to find good anime which can keep you entertained, without you guessing whats gonna happen in next/last episode by watching the 1st/more episodes , or even after that watching all of it cause it was just that good/fun/entertaining, then this anime might be worth your time.\r\nAs for light viewers, watch it when u have some time in your hand,i think this willbe worth it & it might just give u a different taste u will like, opening a door for future/existing different genre of anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory will keep you entertained. It might take a little time reading, pausing & going back to read it again at 1st, but after u get the basics done of this anime's world (might take like 3 episodes), its fun to watch.\\n\r\nAlso this is 1 of those very few anime which actually has tons of content in each episodes, not like many anime where there's few min worth of content & rest is fluff , not that there's anything wrong with it, making quality content takes lots of time & effort. There's lots of content in this because most are in dialogues.\\n\\n\r\np.s- it might be better to binge watch 3-5+ eps at once, or it might be a little hard to understand unless u have good memory.",

            "content": "Man, I was so hurt by the 6.whatever rating Sakurada Reset had before (It's starting to move up a little though :D) \r\nI had not enjoyed an anime has much as I had with Sakurada Reset. I found every episode to be much more enjoyable than the last, even the first few episodes that others have claimed to be slow. The way the story brought everything together was so interesting. It did not leave anything out, and carefully explained every detail til the end of the final episode. Nothing ever felt boring to me, even the discussion between Nono and Haruki (pointless yet pleasant, asthey've said in the episode). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters was the best element of the show to me. They were very realistic, each with their own ideals and emotions. Kei, the main male character, was such an awesome character. He is so unpredictable, and will do just about anything to prove a point or achieve his goals (like in episode 4, that was just brutal). Haruki and Soma, the two main female characters, were both great too, but I don't think my explanation is good enough to do them justice. Also, Haruki is best girl, sorry Soma!\\n\\n\r\nThe music were all amazing, but the ending by Oral Cigarettes tops everything (I started checking them out because of this, and they are my favorite band now :D). \\n\\n\r\nHopefully the score for Sakurada Reset will get much higher, and I hope those who dropped this will give it a go again.  This is the first time I've written a review, and I just kinda wrote whatever I wanted, but those are my thoughts on the show. \\n\\n\r\nStory -10 (loved it)\\n\r\nArt-7 (wasn't its strongest point)\\n\r\nSound- 9 (Oral Cigarettes man)\\n\r\nCharacters- 10 (so cool!)\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10 (of course)\\n\r\nOverall- 10 (One of my favorite shows!)\\n",

            "content": "It's hard to accurately describe what's so captivating about this show. Much like Jojo, David Production treats Sakurada Reset like a loving fan project. There is a great degree of authenticity and charm to what they do, and it shows throughout every aspect of the story.\r\nEchoing back to shows like Shinsekai Yori, and the Monogatari series, Sakurada Reset's dense plot takes its time, giving attention to minor details that become crucial to the overarching story. Interactions between characters feel meaningful; the character progression natural. Both protagonists, Kei and Misora, come across as cold, distant, almost robotic in nature, only to grow more human from thesituations that occur around them and because of them. This might come off as generic sounding, but I don't see growth like this often. Character growth is often told, and not shown. Watching growth occurring organically is extremely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSakurada Reset has a great sense of continuity. It is my belief that all aspects of a show should serve a purpose, and the thought experiments proposed and discussed expand the viewer's understanding of both philosophy and the characters shown on screen. The way it's done is truly a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't been this excited about a series in a long time, and credit David Production for getting me attached to a series I otherwise would have glossed over. This adaptation was one with a lot of heart and has made me both a fan of David, and a fan of Sakurada Reset. I urge anyone willing to give the show a chance. You might have the same kinds of revelations I did.",

            "content": "This anime is a book of poetry. You will not find any brawls here, and there are no special effects for powers. They're usually very powerful though. The atmosphere is peaceful. Overall, this is more for a mature audience in general. You won't see fan service and it's best not to expect any. \r\nThe biggest reason I'm writing this review is just to tell people to go to Reddit after each episode so that they can read the comments to understand important details in each of the episodes. \r\nI hear that it is all slow until episode 6, but it's definitely all worth it ifyou're looking forward to the story and if you like the poetry behind the thinking experiments.\\n\\n\r\nI personally did not mind the pacing at all, and was just a very curious individual that really couldn't wait to see the story unfold. It also made me feel somewhat smart for keeping up with the episodes, but at the same time dumb, since I can't understand everything they're talking about on my own. But again, that's what Reddit's for.\\n\\n\r\nSo I write this review as an individual who feels this is in the best interest of normal people who just want a good thinking anime. Think of it like those book gatherings: After reading a book, you meet up with friends that read the book and converse among yourselves about all the things the book had to give, and end up appreciating the book more.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nI've never seen an anime made this way. It feels like every episode was necessary in completing the story it was trying to tell. I would like to think the main catch of the anime is the thinking experiments, as they tell you how they work, then they get involved in the story in some way at some point. I'm not sure what else I can tell without ending up summarizing the story tbh so I leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nI heard the anime was a budget anime, but for a budget anime, the artwork is pretty well-done. Imo it's like a polished version of Diomedea's recent anime Fuuka in terms of character design and animation. The animation is very smooth, probably because there's no super crazy fight scenes to animate. The camera angles are just right as well. I do feel this anime would get a lot more praise if it was made by SHAFT or Kyo Ani. SHAFT would be using a lot of crazy transitions while Kyo Ani could make it the way they made Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the music is very simple. Everything about the anime is watered down, actually. The only things that aren't watered down are those OPs and EDs. Those have so much emotion put into them. As long as the music is fitting, I don't see a problem. But they aren't astounding either. They do their part and it does help with the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThere's a reason Kei is the way he is. Haruki was just born the way she was. And there's a reason Souma is the way she is as well. But of course, they're not normal people either. People complain about how they're not relatable, but that's exactly what the story needs to be the story that it is. Kei doesn't want to solve things with violence, but how is a person supposed to be able to do that? Kei is a character that shows you how to be someone so intelligent, they can solve problems without violence. We have OP characters all the time, and I've seen people love the MC of Aldnoah Zero, so there's no real complaint to be made here. At the very least, Kei has more reason to be who he is than that kid. Souma is easy to take in, that's why people love her. Haruki though, not as many will like her, simply because she's like a robot. But her being born that way is definitely a human reason. There can be people like that in the world. Not impossible at all when there's over 6 billion people in the world. All the side characters get their bit of shine too. The antagonist is also pretty well done, imo. Although it's not to the death, you can think of this as a watered down version of Light and L's mind battles. But watered down means less hostile and more civil, which is a closer means to a better world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the part where this is completely my own enjoyment. Whether you enjoy it or not is really up to you as a person. If, even after the reddit suggestion, you do not like the anime after 3 or so episodes, it's simply not for you. The enjoyment of the anime will usually be very low or very high. I cannot say if there is an inbetween, but that is what I've seen of people. Perhaps because I feel most people won't like it, the enjoyment should objectively be around 4.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great Characters\\n\r\n-Great Story\\n\r\n-Poetic\\n\r\n-Thinking Experiments\\n\r\n-Solutions to conflicts without violence\\n\r\n-Life Lessons\\n\r\n-Great understanding of how people work (Very vocal about it)\\n\r\n-Like reading a book\\n\r\n-If you get through all of it and enjoy it, you're definitely an intelligent person! And I bet you're quite positive in general as well! :)\\n\r\n-Very few, if any at all, plot holes. \\n\r\n-Almost everything, if not everything, gets explained.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Too much talking (Of course, that's what this show is about. Keep in mind I'm basing this on audience opinion and not my own. This is ironic and that's the point. btw this is exactly how they are in the show.)\\n\r\n-Not enough visuals to help with explanations and conversations.\\n\r\n-It's like reading a book. People who watch anime don't usually read books as a hobby. (Though I have to say this is my perfect book)\\n\r\n-Characters can be uninteresting to most people.\\n\r\n-Even if the story is one of the best out there, it still has a very slow start-up\\n\\n\r\nAs I've somewhat mentioned before, this anime would garner much more people if it were made by Kyo Ani or SHAFT. The writing, planning, and execution of the anime were excellent in my opinion, but under objective views, the execution could've been much better. People cannot get past around 6 episodes because there's not much visual spark. I also heard the translation wasn't all too well done, but even then, it'd still be confusing for most people. Again, that is why I recommend going to Reddit after each episode to understand them better.\\n\\n\r\nAs well, because this is such a confusing premise for a first watch, it's obvious that once you finish the show, you can rewatch it to then be able to completely understand everything. Indeed it is one of those shows you'd have to have the time for. I cannot recommend this to people with busy lives, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my unbiased review of the anime. In my heart though, it is a 10/10. Please give it a watch if you'd like to see a peaceful anime that's very real in its own way, have the time on your hands, like feeling smart (you'll definitely be more enlightened by the end of it, I assure you), like to think, like poetry, and like a good story. \\n\\n\r\nIf everybody in the world liked the anime more than not, I feel we'd definitely be living in a better world. In that sense, it's a very romantic anime. And just maybe, that is why I love the anime so much.",

            "content": "Sakurada Reset feels like one of the most underappreciated anime I've seen. This anime delivers a deep, nuanced plot that takes time to fully grasp and comprehend, but which makes it much easier to appreciate the nuances it includes. It appears incredibly elitist to claim that this anime is only really for those \"with brainpower\", as many others have said before me, but Sakurada Reset truly is a more thought-provoking anime than most.\r\nThe story is, for the most part, well presented, almost like a mystery as various elements are gradually presented, each with their own importance. Many details that may seem trivial or irrelevant oftenare revealed to have a deeper significance: the show does an amazing job at subtle foreshadowing, sometimes far in advance of when it is eventually used.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the art could need some improvement. There is little animation within scenes, resulting in a decent amount of time passing without any significant change, and characters may somewhat awkwardly hold their poses for unreasonable lengths of time. Even so, the drawing is clean, and nicely captures the environment of Sakurada.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to sound, Sakurada Reset does a great job on its soundtrack. It manages to perfectly capture the ambience of each moment, which amplified the enjoyment I was able to get out of it. The OPs and EDs also include some pretty good music, which are composed in a way that doubles down on the themes seen in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nA criticism I've seen a decent number of times is that the characters are like \"robots\", without emotions. This claim has its merits, but it doesn't tell the whole story. There are people, in real life, who do tend to approach things calmly and rationally; these characters can simply be seen to be the same, and can keep their cool, unlike the characters of many other anime, even under pressure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, for me Sakurada Reset was a quite enjoyable anime, as the depth of the story and its excellent presentation more than made up for the flaws in art and character expression. I hope you, as a watcher, will be able to look past some of the surface flaws to discover the rich world within.",

Most people drop it because it is too slow but that is how most detective anime is like. It takes time to solve a case you know. \r\nSo the characters are Asai Kei a person who has the most important ability throughout the entire show and is a freaking genius in solving problems. Secondly Haruki Misori who is a kuudere,but has yet another ability that is important in the show. Lastly Sumire Souma who is a mysterious character that plays a good part in the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is jaw breaking once they've revealed an answer you're like Holy $@%^! You're going to be mind blown throughout this series. The story also contains tragedy so you'll probably be screaming when something suspense comes up, also there is a bit of unrequited love. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also freaking amazing it also has the same band that sang the Noragami opening. I also like the ost where the piano has a slow vibe to it, but gives a sad tragedy love triangle. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Kinda mediocre premise, right? Right. Though, it's far off from being something like a mediocre shounen but that doesn't cancel a mediocreness of the show. \r\nI've watched 12 episodes. There were a lot of info. What I've got from it? Some pretentious pseudo philosophical phrases. Lots of meaningless dialogues which made me think about one thing: please, someone teach them how to communicate. One robot talking to another. \r\nSure, there were some interesting twists and ideas. The show has some tremendouspotential but it's not capable to pull it off. It just trips every time it tries. \\n\r\nHonestly, I dislike shows which take a responsibility to realize some hard concepts with a poor directing. Sakurada Reset consists of such concepts. Does it manage to convey them in a decent way? I have my doubts.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just okay. It creates a feeling of a \"cheap\" one though. But I reckon it may be because there's nothing to animate here. Dull robots talking with another dull robots. From time to time they walk and talk. Or sit and talk. It's a bit an exaggeration but that's how I felt it sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nI did like the op and the ed. They were pleasant surprises to my ear. \\n\r\nSpeaking about actors' voices... Once again, robots. And that's not their guilt. They voiced characters which they had to. Robots. Nonetheless, I liked \"resetto\" word. It's cute. If I were to hear it more frequently, maybe I wouldn't drop this show...(just kidding). \\n\\n\r\nThe major mistake about characters is that there's no emotional character enough who would put the show in a right direction. What I mean is... try to imagine the anime in which were only Kyons. There's no Haruhi Suzumiya (quite ironic, main girl of Sakurada Reset is named Haruhi as well) to solve this problem. \\n\\n\r\nTo some degree I enjoyed watching this show. But that's not enough to make me watch another 12 episodes. That would be a routine. \\n\r\nI'd not recommend watching it. Though, I don't exclude the fact you might find something I didn't manage to find.",

            "content": "Sakurada Reset is unfortunately another one of those series that got literally zero attention from anywhere in the anime community. On top of that, out of the people who have started the show, over 25% have dropped it. However, in my opinion, and to my surprise, this turned out to be one of the best written stories of this year.\r\n---\r\n***REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*** This is more about outlining why I enjoyed this show despite its unpopularity and high drop rate.\r\n---\r\nOne of the things I liked most about the series was the way the story progressed. In the beginning, the characters are rather closed-off and almostseemed dull. Much of the communication between characters is done through riddles, thought experiments, or metaphorical stories. Over 1/4 of viewers quit watching the show just because the characters were \"boring and emotionless.\" However, as Ive said before, the characters were intentionally made this way, and in that respect they are very well written. The characters at first seem to be static, but in the second half, they turn out to be dynamic characters with internal change\\n\\n\r\nHaruki is a very timid and unambitious girl with zero self confidence. She lives strictly by her own set of rules, but she also has a high dependency upon others. However, in the second half, she slowly realizes her own desires and preferences; and eventually, she is able to act on her own accord. Haruki also begins to feel resentment and jealousy towards Soma, sensing her as a threat of being replaced as Kei's partner.\\n\\n\r\nKei is a very level-headed character who is able to develop a plan for any situation. Soma, having the ability of clairvoyance, is naturally several steps ahead of Kei's plans and uses him; however, she also depends on Kei in her shortcomings. Kei and Soma are very similar characters in that they both act out of selfishness, but their selfish desires also coincide with the interests of the people who are dear to them. Kei does everything in his power to stop Urachi from erasing abilities from Sakurada for selfish reasons; however, he also wants to rescue Soma from her internal conflicts. Soma goes as far as killing herself and using Kei for her plans to selfishly escape her fate of being captured by the Bureau and becoming the second Witch; however, at the same time she chooses her actions with the desire to fulfill Kei's happiness. Soma is deeply conflicted because she wants to be the one that Kei loves; but she knows he will choose Haruki, not her. In the very beginning of the show, Soma brings Kei and Haruki together for the sake of both her plans and Kei's happiness, knowing that it will ultimately damage their relationship. Soma acts for Kei's happiness even though it pains her.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this series that is really well-done is the use of abilities. This isnt just some shounen anime that shows off flashy supernatural powers; and it isnt a repeat of Charlotte's trainwreck. The series is good at defining both what the ability can do, and what limitations the ability has. The show also focuses on how different abilities can be used together in complex ways to achieve the characters' goals.\\n\\n\r\nRight up front, we are told Haruki's Reset ability has 3 limits: she can only Save once every 24 hrs; and that save only lasts for 72 hours; and like everyone else, she loses memories after a reset. However, with Kei's Perfect Memory ability, together they are able to circumvent Haruki's memory loss flaw and effectively change the past. Kei instructs Haruki to Save immediately before a pivotal point in time; then he uses the next 72 hours to discover the events that happen; then instructs Haruki to Reset before the Save expires, so he can change the past. Because Haruki can only Save once every 24 hours, Kei only has one chance to change what happens in the first day after a Reset; however he effectively has 3 chances to change the events that happened in the final 24 hours of the 72 hour window.\\n\\n\r\nUrachi's ability first seems like it can only remove people's memories; however, he actually has the ability to turn back the time for one specific object. He uses his ability to frequently turn back the time for his own mind, thus intentionally losing memories. This can be used to circumvent Sakuin's lie detection and Soma's clairvoyance, which depends on conversation. Kagaya's ability first seems like it can only be used to lock/seal doors; however his ability permanently seals objects in space and time, and can be used to petrify people, or freeze the exact current condition of an object. Object that are sealed with Kagaya's hand do not change even after a Reset. Therefore, Urachi uses Kagaya's ability to seal notebooks that contain his memories; that way he can later remember the things he intentionally forgot.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a couple occasions where several abilities are used together to accomplish a goal. There were 5-6 (i forget) people and abilities involved in reviving Soma. Another number of abilities were used together to bluff the Bureau and kidnap Urachi. And these are just a few examples. In fact, there aren't many instances where only one ability alone is used to do something significant. The well-defined structure of abilities and the ways abilities are used are what makes the supernatual aspect of the story interesting.",

Many have claimed it as being boring, and a slow starter, but far from that I would argue that even the initial stoicness of the mc's is interesting if you are willing to put any thought into their potential motivations.\r\nThose comparing it to Charlotte just came into the show with fundamentally incongruent expectations; its not a surprise that they didn't try and search for the depth that is hidden.\r\nOverall the pacing fits the themes addressed within the show, and while it reaches for a massive swath of themes that it may ormay not fully flesh out, even the surface level execution displays a mastery of detail on the part of David production. Any look deeper only shows the brilliance behind the engineering of the wondrous and contemplative plot of Sagrada Reset.",

The plot jumps all over the place, making it hard to follow as well. The characters are flat and unrealistic and respond to things that would be shocking with almost no feeling at all. The art style is not bad, but a majority of the animation includes little to no movement or action. Overall, this anime is very slow and I would recommend itto people with a patience for lengthy and sluggish storytelling.",

            "content": "To begin with, this show is, well, it is not for the average watcher who expects pew pew boom boom kind of action. I, myself, loved the show, but it is because I understood everything that was said and done in it. For other people, it was a hard time understanding it, thus such a low score on MAL. You need some brain to keep up with the show.\r\nThe story is very well-knit. I have to admit, it's been a while since I've watched a show that is this well-written. For me, it was a very good time because at times, I even foreseen whatsome things meant, which gave me an easy time watching. The show very well follows the principle of progression and you have to admit that by the mid-end there is some intense action that keeps you interested and curious to see the ending soon, because you can feel the tension and atmosphere of it coming to an end. Story development, culmination etc. is well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, if I'm being honest, I'm watching D.Gray-man and Sakurada Reset at the same time. Since I finished Sakurada Reset, I watch D.Gray-man. To compare both, Sakurada Reset looks way better and well-drawn, executed, than the opposite is, and D.Gray-man is an action anime, so you can pretty much worry about art the least.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay, this is the part where I want to cry, because the anime so well got me interested and intrigued that I couldn't even really take a notice onto the music. It was there, but it went straight to my emotions instead of my brain, so I'm literally just listening to the music after watching the anime. That means it is definitely not lacking. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now character development is something that I liked. Yes, change on supporting characters wasn't the main objective, but I really liked the development in Haruki, Kei and even Soma. Even some supporting characters can be seen changing. Despite even the character development, you could see visual development in general, which is also great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, I'm giving this a 10 just because I enjoyed it to its fullest. The characters were relatable, I really loved their behaviour. I couldn't help but notice the differences between them, and despite Kei and Haruki, I especially liked Soma. Her speech manner is rather lazy, or relaxed, as if she knew everything, but at the same time everytime she talked, it's as she is absolutely sad, despite being bright. And at times, she talks the same way again, as if being lazy, but that speech feels as of someone's who has seen a thousand years of experience, of life, of everything. When she speaks to Kei, it seems as if they're both some kind of higher beings, but Soma is someone who knows more, knows better, knows right and in a way, leads Kei's way, lectures him, when they casually discuss some things over. That is where I see the issue, that even the strong ones need help. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the show, make sure you don't have any misunderstandings, and don't listen to those who tell it's a bad anime. Do not mistake a bad anime to a something that you don't like, it is rude and incompetent.",

Its about a story about a city with super powers with powers been very balance and instead of concentrating on power like fire and so, they focus on powers where you have to use tactics to use. A story about a government supervising these powers and how it might be obsolete, a story of righteousness, cruelty and selfishness....and time travel.\r\nThe story its very solid. The characters, the foreshadow,the plot and the MC are very solid. TheMC is very decisive and takes action. This story has a lot of shred of mystery where everything will be explained in the end. Music, openings and ending are very great too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere will be some people that will be turn off the series in the beginning for two main reasons. One this story, although not very heavy dialogue oriented, it will concentrate on this (which in my opinion they did incredibly great on), and many people like a lot of movement and action happening. Second a lot of the characters do not react like your usual anime characters, they are bit stoic. Although they do express their feelings compare to many other series, they might appear dull. I like the way the characters express themselves in this story for three reasons. First, when they finally react to their feelings exaggeratedly (compare to their usual mood) it elevates the scenes even more. Second the way the story is, and the plot, it is understandable, it will feel off if they will act like usual anime characters. Third, the way they express themselves is unique and refreshing, specially if you have seen a lot of anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in good plot, solid characters, decisive main character, time travel story, strategy vs strategy showdown, and great solid development and interaction between characters, this is your series.",

This anime is unique and a true Masterpiece, I will recommend anyone to watch as the main Character- especially Asai Kei is really outstanding in knowledge. Great development and growth of character as they realize throughout the story who they are and the weaknesses, which is amazing. The art and sound are great as they appeal to each character perfectly 9/10, but with thestory will just make it feel beautiful. Overall this is a true Masterpiece and will deserves anyone's time!",

            "content": "First of all, this anime is absolutely underrated, the reason? Because people can not get past the 3 episode rule and because they can't pay enough attention to watching this anime; if you are wondering whether or not you should watch this anime then you should first ask yourself the following questions: 1) Do you like puzzles? 2) Do you like philosophical questions? 3) Do you like to eat your candies later? 4) Do you like to think a lot? 5) Can you think with other people's perspectives?\r\nIf your answer is yes to all of the above then I am sure you will find thisanime very very interesting.\\n\r\nBut for those who wish for a proper review, I will do my best to try and not give away any spoiler while also providing a proper review that this anime deserve.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's hard to put into words as to what the story is all about, but the summary definitely does not do justice to what the story is going to be. To be frank, yes it is about having abilities and two people having abilities that compliment each other, but it is much deeper than that. Our MC will often utter some fairly deep philosophical questions or ideas that will either serve as the main plot towards the specific story that the show is currently on and those can also sometimes be the clue to solve a certain mystery within the show.\\n\r\nBe aware that the entire anime is separated with stories or I suppose \"arcs\" which the plot will present a problem and our main characters are going to solve it, each of these \"arcs\" varies in length, but they are within the range of 2-5 per arc.\\n\r\nAn important note to be taken here is that there will be no fan service at all within this anime, you will not see boobs or panties or guys ran into a girl who just came out of a shower of that sort.\\n\r\nAnother side note here is that be sure to pay attention to the first 3 episodes of the show as they are the most important 3 episodes of this anime, it sets the story up, it gives you all the information you need before hopping on this train ride of ideals, philosophies, emotions, and mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nNot an expert when it comes to art, but it is what you would expect from a 2017 anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAlso not an expert in this area, I just find the background music, the opening, and ending compliments the show and brought out what it is all about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the part that drives most people from the show and if you are wondering why I still give it a 10/10 well, that is because they are wrong.\\n\r\nI am fairly certain that many comments stated their opinion about how the characters in this shows are all fairly robot like and exert no emotion, well they are dead wrong. \\n\r\nHow so, you may ask, well all the secrets lie within the first 3 episodes where it will be explained to you, that is if you actually not skipped anything and sat down and watched it and understand what is going on.\\n\r\nYou may ask, \"but does that mean all the characters will stay robot like?\" the answer is no.\\n\r\nAnd yes the characters will show growth, but it's not growth that is apparent, it's very subtle, and it requires a huge amount of effort to pick up those small changes, which the majority of them lies within the dialogues between characters which many complained to be boring and lack of emotional responses. But again, they are dead wrong, there are emotions within the responses between each character, it all lies within those choices of words, and the characters are designed to carefully choose their words as to slowly show their growth. The characters are all very intelligent and that is why they may all seem very robot like but no, they are not robots, they are still humans and have lots of emotion that they just express very subtle and mostly with words.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nToo much puzzle and ideals and philosophy for my brains to be honest, but it was fun, and it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSo summing it up, give it a try if you like what you have read, and try not to get bored out, this is a very adult-like anime, and very intelligent, so be prepared and know what you are going into, sometimes you have to watch an episode a couple times before you can fully understand what is going on, and sometimes you will feel the anxiety of wanting to know what happens next, and can not stop thinking about it, those are all part of this anime and what makes it so good, it challenges you to think and to make connections, so if you like those things, please do not be sway by the other comments and be sure to give it a try, I am sure it will grab your heart just like it grabbed mine.",

            "content": "I didn't think I would have been as impressed with Sakurada Reset as I have to be honest. The main complaint which can become apparent to anyone who watches the first couple episodes is that many of the characters that appear in the anime have very bland personalities. I would argue however, that for many of those characters (especially Misora and Kei), that apathy they seem to have almost makes sense considering some of the abilities they possess.\r\nAll of my other thoughts on this anime are positive ones. The story takes its time to develop but once it does you get to see some incrediblylayered storytelling. The way how the various abilities of the characters were used to convey this was very interesting to me. The art and animation are nothing amazing but are at a standard you can deem as acceptable. The soundtrack doesn't really stand out but I thought it was very good. A lot of the characters are interesting and have a certain way in which they view the world. Seeing how these differing ideals clash when characters came together made Sakurada Reset a pleasant watching experience.\\n\r\nI think this is one of those shows that may remain a hidden gem but if you happen to stumble across it, definitely consider giving it a watch.",

            "content": "Review contains slight spoilers about Masamune Urachi\r\nSakurada Reset was a painful but worthwhile experience. This may sound weird at first, but as this review goes on, I hope to make it clear to why I wrote that starting sentence. There are factors that I thought the show did really well, while there were others that ruined the show for me and caused the low average score and the large drop count.\r\nThe first half of the show was pretty much character introductions and build up. We learn about the town of Sakurada and the gifted people that live in it, following the lives of two highschool students. Misora Haruki is a quiet girl who has the ability to save a moment in time for 3 days and reset everything back to that certain point, causing everyone to forget what had happened after she used her ability, including herself. Kei Asai is a quick thinking problem solver who has the ability to remember everything he has experienced, even stuff that happened during a reset. With the compatbility of their abilities, they go through each arc solving a new case and problem, introducing a new character and learning about their ability and personality. This is where the problems start. The personalities of each character feel incredibly empty. Most of them rarely show any sign of emotions, and the way they speak feels boring and monotone. The dialogue also manages to throw in philosophical questions like the Swampman and the Ship of Theseus. It feels unrealistic that a bunch of high school students are talking about these kinda topics, and it really takes you out of the anime. The fact that the characters are pretty much emotionless androids ruin any kind of drama that the first half tried to create, even though the drama itself was quite interesting and the way they used their abilities to solve them were quite clever. There are also quite a few scenes that feel pretty pointless to the overall story, and some characters that are introduced but having no real importance to offer. All these factors make the first half an incredibly tough ordeal to get through.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is where the story really kicks in. To be more specific, the part where it really starts to pick up is the Eden arc. Old characters start to show a little more emotion, although not that much, while the painful dialogue slowly becomes more tolerable, even though they continue to use philosophical questions and monotone voices. I don't know if this is because the show's script got better or if I just got used to the way Sakurada's characters talk, but I could actually enjoy the anime more than I previously could. The drama feels more genuine as characters struggle to come to terms with the way others use their abilities, truly making it worth investing my time into this show. More characters are introduced and are still slightly unrealistic, but they also feel significantly better compared to the introductions in the first half, especially with the appearance of Masamune Urachi. Urachi is the director of the Administration Bureau's Management Department and becomes the main antagonist of the show. He has one simple goal he wants to achieve, to remove abilities from Sakurada. The show really lets you understand exactly why he wants to do this, and you slightly sympathise with him. Of course, our MC Kei wants to prevent this, and the clashing of their opposing ideals is what the show had been building up to. This is where the show really shines as both characters attempt to outsmart their opponents so they may reign triumphant. The ending is truly amazing as they use the abilities of their teams to solve the issues that had been made apparent in Sakurada.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I can't say for sure if I'd recommend Sakurada Reset to anyone. I'm glad I finished this show, but if I had to choose between rewatching it or forgetting it, I'd probably never be able to come to a decision. If you think you can endure the dialogue and characters and see what the story has to offer, I would definitely tell you to give it a shot and see if you like it or not. It's sad knowing if these things had been different, the anime would have been more well received and might possibly have become one of the best to come out of this year for me.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, send feedback if you have any!",

            "content": "It's safe to say that Sakurada Reset is a \"smart\" show and it is very much aware of that. \r\nAt first, the anime felt like a \"weekly mystery\" that would solved with the characters abilities. The evolution of the plot into something much more enthralling has been fun to watch and be a part of. We have really grown with these characters as they battle and try to figure out who they are themselves as well as to why it is exactly they are trying to help each other and the world that they live in.\r\nKei as the MC has definitely been one of myfavorites from this season thus far. He truly comes off as a white knight that is able to overcome just about any circumstance and his development and struggle has been great. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series has progressed the dialogue and conversations between characters prove to be the most captivating parts of the anime. The dialogue is quick and snappy, they are asking serious questions to others as well as themselves. As cliche as it may seem, this anime makes you think and requires that you pay attention to all that is going on all the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe major philosophical and social questions and themes that run the show truly dominate the intent and overall motivations for the plot and the characters. We are faced with asking ourselves what does it mean to be good or bad, what is good or bad about desire, is any of what we are doing only for ourselves or for the greater good. \\n\\n\r\nMy issues with the show stem from the complexity that it is pushing. The show so far has felt extremely long. Sometimes the complex dialogue goes in circles and it can sometimes be confusing as to what it is they are really trying to say. The middle of the show became a little muddled and messy as we saw a transition in the plot to something deeper, but as the show is gearing for the photo finish is as exciting as ever. This anime really challenges the viewers to keep up and I would say if you are up for the task to consider giving it your time. \\n\\n",
