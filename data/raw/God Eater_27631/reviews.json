            "content": "God Eater is one of those odd shows that starts out as kind of a slow burn for a few episodes at risk of losing you, but then goes from 0-100 real fast to grab you right back in.  Let's take a look at the score breakdown quick to see where we end up.\r\nStory (5/10) - The story honestly wasn't that special.  It isn't anything we haven't seen before, just your standard monster apocalypse type fair.  It didn't fail particularly at anything, but didn't do anything exceptional either; it just served as a familiar spring board for the viewer to get intothe action.  I did really appreciate all the flashback scenes and explanations how how this all came about and the description of the monsters (Aragami?).  It is something this show actually did really well that many other apocalypse shows either ignore or stumble on inelegantly.  It almost makes me want to bump up the story score... almost.  There is one minor quibble I have in the 2nd last episode about Alisa, but the action pulls you along quickly enough that I could ignore it and continue to enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - Hoooooooolllyyyyy shit... is quite frankly the only way I can truly express how ridiculously beautiful the art and animation is for God Eater.  Outside of a few hiccups that are fixed in the blu-rays, the visuals are just absolutely stunning, as is to be expected from Studio Ufotable.  The lighting, the particle/water effects, the characters, the monsters, just absolutely top notch work.  This is the kind of stuff you expect to see out of a movie budget.  Everything was fluid and distinct, even in busy light-show scenes, and the animation really managed to bring things to life.  It made horrifying scenes all the more horrifying and pleasant scenes absolutely delightful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - Another stand-out category for this show.  The OP is great and gets you super pumped, the ED is fantastic closure, and the insert songs in this show were just on a whole other level.  \"Human After All\" might be one of my favourite all time insert songs, and I look forward to the OST release with great enthusiasm.  The Foley in this show was also pretty top notch as well, with just fantastic sound effects permeating every scene without overbearing the voice work, which itself was also exceptional.  Really, really top notch sound work.  An absolute joy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) - Most of the characters, like the story, are kind of your standard archetypes.  You have the strong-silent Soma, the impulsive and heroic Lenka, the psychologically traumatized girl that tries to hide her emotions, etc. Part of the problem this show had is that a lot of the character development came in the latter half of the show, with one notable exception.  So you spent a good 1/2 of the show just thinking everyone is a stoic champion cut-out.  By the time all the character complexity came up, you were nearly at the climax already.  If it wasn't for this fact, I could have easily given it a higher score, as the characters themselves are quite interesting.  That being said, there are a couple stand out character moments in the show.  I won't spoil them here as they are important to the story, but they are moments where the character development is leagues above what you'd expect from it, moments that earnestly brought tears to my eyes, so that raises the score a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) - This is a hard one because early on (the first 3-4 episodes) the show wasn't very engaging.  It was just kind of laying the world-building ground work and introducing a large cast.  Once it hit episodes 4/5 though, it really took off at a frantic pace that didn't stop right up until the end.  Thankfully the gamble paid off and the latter 2/3 of the show became very, very enjoyable for me.  Despite all the archetypal characters and standard storyline, the direction was solid enough that it was still very fun to watch, and obviously the top tier animation/music helped prop it up a little bit as well.  Nonetheless, it was a quite fun bombastic action series with the occasional fantastic character scene.  I also have to give credit to the show for going darker and grittier and punishing characters for their mistakes.  Yeah, there was still plot armour, but the characters still suffered when they fucked up, and they suffered badly (I wish I could bold/italicize \"badly\" here, some of it it was frankly horrifying).  It really gave a lot more weight to their actions and made such a standard apocalyptic story more easy to suspend disbelief for and pull you in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater is a really interesting show.  It face a lot of hurdles throughout its run from the production delays attempting a whole new and beautiful animation style.  This probably lost a lot of viewers and quite frankly hurt the show rather badly due to the fact that some of its best work was presented in the remaining 4 episodes a full season after the original run began.  It also has some problems with its story/characters.  It is an adaptation of a game with a self-insert protagonist you play with zero background story, so expecting miracles from the story and characters isn't going to serve you well.  Honestly though, they did a fairly good job coming up with a proper background story for Lenka, one with meaning behind it.  It is worth a watch, if for nothing else other than the breathtaking animation and spine-tingling music.  The characters eventually do become interesting by the end, and it really lifts the show out of how mediocre it could have been and breathes life into the story.  If you want a super deep story and unique, multifaceted characters, God Eater wont be your thing, but if you just want a dark and gritty action show romp with best-in-industry aesthetics and the occasional heartfelt moment, then God Eater will be right up your alley.  If you do give it a shot, I really suggest sticking around until at least episode 5 before deciding on whether or not to keep going.",

            "content": "God Eater is like spoiled milk. It doesn't get any better with age. Now that this show is over, we can all breathe a sigh of relief when we clean that proverbial spot out of the refrigerator (our anime lists) that the fermenting cow squeezins are in the trash, and gone far far away from us. \r\nAt this point in time, I think most people have blissfully forgotten about God Eater, so I'm going to dig this rotting corpse up out of its shallow grave and run it over with a dumptruck again. \r\nYou tell me what's worse: a ripoff of an classic, or aripoff of an extremely successful ripoff of an old classic?\\n\r\nI'll tell you what's worst still: a terrible ripoff of a ripoff of an old classic that shamelessly TRIES to be something new, but sticks to the conventions of its hack fraud origins, to its own failure.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what we call God Eater. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this show is so bad that they halted it halfway through its run due to internal issues and poor reception- the rest aired more than 6 months later to a quiet death. I doubt anyone watched it then, either. Maybe besides me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7 \\n\\n\r\nI think most people (myself included) started this show because of interest in the company that produced it: ufotable. They're pretty well synonymous with \"maximal animation budget\", but Fate this is not. \\n\r\nI do have to hand it to them for being different though. The art style looks like oil on canvas, then on top of very stylized and crisp backgrounds. Kind of like David Production's Jojo, but less comic book-like. A lot of people were expecting a Fate UBW level/ultrarealism looking, and were disappointed, but I was impressed with their choice to do something different.\\n\\n\r\nHowever... this is the only strength of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 1\\n\\n\r\nThese cast members should be straight ashamed of themselves. Talk about phoning it in... this is a Central Park Media level BAD performance. Ultra generic angsty teen yelling and the absolute most bored sounding adults permeate this trash. In fact, it would have been better as a silent series, because then I wouldn't feel like my ear drums were being put into a wood chipper. Either that, or just play the Benny Hill Theme throughout the entire show, to accentuate how stupid it is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: -10\\n\\n\r\nAnyone with two brain cells to rub together can tell you that God Eater is copying Attack On Titan. If I tell you \"humanity lives inside a city with very tall walls, and are constantly under attack by monsters. They're defended by a group of people who aren't equipped to fight this massive threat. They suffer loss after loss, a lot of people die, and it seems hopeless, until a hero with new powers emerges and is able to fight back.\" \\n\\n\r\nWhat do you immediately think of? \\n\\n\r\nMoving on. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the show is actually complete- here's what happens:\\n\\n\r\nNothing. It's nothing a but a mindless action vomit featuring overpowered, but conveniently weak at inopportune moments characters falling into the same traps every single episode. The \"story\" just serves as an excuse to put tits and teen angst on display with comically superpowered characters.This is undiluted, brainless schlock and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nStandard issue whiny, angst ridden, shonen protag and oversexualized Female companion who suffers mental breakdowns for half the show and turns into a sniveling pile of useless crap, and should have just died, but alas, twas not to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is a ragtag group of apathetic losers. One super cool dude who smokes in every scene, because he has to show you how little he cares by smoking all the time, as everyone knows smoker characters are apathetic edgemasters. One is a \"dark mysterious edgy past\" character, and the other is total yawner of a woman, not even interesting enough for me to make a description of how boring she is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 3\\n\\n\r\nSince I gave the story a -10, the actual score is 0.6. Scoring it as low as possible with a 1 gives me a rating of 3. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was actively offensive on many levels. The one scene I can clearly recall from the show, as I've scrubbed the rest of them from my memory, went like this: \\n\\n\r\nProtag and useless blubbering female go running around in circles trying to evade the monsters after they lose their weapons, since the chick decided to break down in the middle of a fight and refuse to keep living (should have left her to get eaten, tbh.). They are shown in a montage literally running up and down hills and around buildings, with this ultra dramatic music in the background. It was the most cringeworthy thing I have seen in a long time, and the only reason why anything about this show was memorable, just for how bad this was. \\n\\n\r\nI would encourage everyone who knows what I'm talking about to go back and mute the episode at that point, then play the Benny Hill theme on top of it and tell me it doesn't match up perfectly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those who'd argue about my claim of Attack on Titan coming first:\\n\r\nIt's debatable which actually came first, God Eater Burst, the video game on which this anime was based, or Attack on Titan, as both came out at around the same time. AOT premiered in September of 2009, and God Eater Burst appeared in February of 2010. Naturally, games have development periods of generally at least a year, but novels and series have to have time to be written as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut, we're going to call this anime a rip, because AOT came out 3 years ago, and this is 2016, Bob Saget! \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, come rage at me, or leave nice comments. I don't care.\\n",

            "content": "Ever wanted to go to an anime fantasy world and see what it\u2019s like? Maybe that thought should be put on-hold for a show like God Eater. In this series, it\u2019s a world that most people probably wouldn\u2019t want to visit. Why? Because it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where mysterious monsters known as the Aragami exists and they aren\u2019t exactly there to make friends with humans. \r\nBased on a video game, God Eater strikes to me as a peculiar series that really needed to hook the audience. The type of hook should be something that would keep the audience at the edge oftheir seat. But what does it really accomplish? A rather messy start that doesn\u2019t exactly leave strong impressions. In essence, God Eater (based on the game, God Eater Burst) is more about the action and less about constructive storytelling on most parts. \\n\\n\r\nConsisting of 13 episodes, the series seemingly has promise in the beginning. Despite not being very original in its premise, it still has a way to be unique. In the beginning, we have Utsugi Lenka, a man who is part of the Fenrir, a group dedicated to fighting the Aragami. Among his group, there are also others with reasons to fight beyond just survival. Furthermore, the show makes it clear that in order to fight against Aragami, they would need special weapons. As such, God Arcs are created that are made from the cells of the Aragami. They are weapons, each unique in design and powers, to fight against them. Basically, this sets the story in motion with the war between humans and Aragami. \\n\\n\r\nNow, God Eater\u2019s characters are somewhat diverse. We got guys like Lindow who has leadership skills, Alisha with her repulsive yet secluded nature, the brains of the team like Sakuya, or powerhouse fighter Souma Schickal. Whatever the case, the main characters are all banded together with a common purpose \u2013 to destroy the Aragami. What some people may not realize is why they are fighting until the story unravels more about more about their past. And to be quite honest, it\u2019s not really that special to look at. Or rather, it\u2019s tragic with cases like Lenka and Alisha. So much so, the show often highlights their emotions on the battlefield when confronted with Aragami. Does this type of storytelling really work? In some ways yes, but other ways feels less welcoming. It also gives a very Attack on Titanish feel if you make a parallel comparison. But God Eater isn\u2019t Attack on Titan. It\u2019s more about surviving because the Aragami has already destroyed much of the world. \\n\\n\r\nI have not played the original game before but the story to me feels flat. Yes, it does have some nice buildup but the pacing itself feels strange. The Aragami are also too one dimensional as antagonists with lack of characterization. The main characters and their relationships are hardly worth noteworthy either. Lenka is the type of guy that seems to do what he wants even if it puts himself or others at risk. The first few episodes establishes this when he nearly gets himself killed. Throughout the show, Lenka forges some relationships with others but most of them seems to go nowhere. His relationship with Alisha seems rocky while on a professional level, Sakuya and Lindow seems to see him more like a rookie. His relationship with others does improve a bit later though. In the meantime, the series also makes it clear that there\u2019s no room for lighthearted episodes. It\u2019s filled with utter despair and as such, expect more of emotional drama more than anything else. Romance isn\u2019t something that will ever bloom either considering circumstances in their world. Instead, it feels like the main cast are more like an awkward family that slowly and slowly feels a connection with one another. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the generic storytelling, God Eater does a decent job to make sure crucial plot holes are filled. These include the essence of the Aragami, the experimental plans from behind the scenes, or character pasts that shapes who they are in the present. Furthermore, the show has some pretty neat action combined with a stellar soundtrack. It makes the show feel credible when we see how they fight the Aragami in this apocalyptic world, a place that seems to be almost extinct of life. The world fiction in God Eater may also not feel very intriguing but it stays true to the premise, being that it\u2019s desolate and easily gives the feel of a moody story. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical art style of God Eater is very ufotable-like with their style. Most of the character designs and Aragami are crafted with CGI animation. In addition, the action is fused with a lot of violence to illustrate the dark horrors of their world. However, I do have to say that it\u2019s easy to get used to. Furthermore, the God Arcs has a distinctive look that makes them look diverse. In essence, artwork for God Eater has an intense feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is even more intense once you get attached to the style of this God Eater adaptation. Theme song performances has a variety of style that blends between moody, charismatic, and intensified by the action. Furthermore, I think the character voice mannerism deserves some praise especially with how they adapt with such a tragic world. In retrospect, characters shows the desire of their fighting spirit through their voice mannerism in the face of danger. Or at times, there\u2019s also fear that is expressed by the talent of the voices.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater is really a hit or miss show. It starts off with the tragic feeling of a dark story, transits into the fight for survival, and then littered with emotions. The show capitalizes on creating a tragic feel by background storytelling and some characterization. But for all it\u2019s worth, the show itself feels more like a game rather than anime. The action, while stellar, is mere popcorn entertainment. Furthermore, the series constructs its story with weird pacing. So in retrospect, take the show as a grain of salt for what it is. Because in the end, God Eater isn\u2019t that special.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*SOME SPOILERS FOR GOD EATER*\r\nWhew. I'm glad I wasn't there during the massive delays...\r\nAh, God Eater. An anime adaptation of a video game. I haven't played the game, but from what I've gathered, it didn't recover much criticism in terms of being an adaptation as much as being a story. Ufotable's attempt at a 3D mixed with 2D action anime, and an interesting beast (intentional joke) if I do say so myself. What originally started back in the Summer of 2015 kept getting delays that lasted until episode 9 in the Fall season, before announcing a delay so big, it only finished airing this season(Spring 2016). Well, was it worth the delay, or did it get devoured by the fangs of failure? Let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAn unspecifically long time ago, three scientists discovered a type of cell that caused small phenomena. Soon, an outbreak would occur involving new beasts seemingly intent on wiping out mankind, nature, and effectively, all known life, before eliminating itself and Earth, causing everything to reset. A few years later, after some backstory, Lenka arrives at Fenrir as a God Eater. A person filled with genes that allow usage of living weapons designed to counter this new species knows as the Aragami. These God Eaters are trained to venture out into the outer territories of the wall (and outside maybe) in order to counter these invading threats that bring mankind to near extinction. If this sounds similar to Attack on Titan, then good. You've caught on.  Also, I like how they try to interweave the present to the past that gets relevant to the situations at hand, even if there are some notable problems regarding the sanity of Fenrir despite them normally being portrayed as solace only the gifted are allowed to make it into. Also, I like how they portray how harsh the reality of only certain types of individuals being able for combat aka a decent mean of living and survival as intermission between fights can be. Unfortunately, towards the end, they try to amp up the weapons in ridiculous fashion and handwave why they should, only to fail at making a compelling finale, and when the true antagonists get revealed, they lack a decent motivation for their messed up plans. The story is nothing special, but with the final episode, the scenarios that should've killed the main protagonist but somehow didn't, how certain things involving the weapons were allowed to happen starting with episode 7, and how little finality the ending had by only resolving one minor issue and completely sequel baiting with nothing to get truly hyped about, the story doesn't hold up all that well, like at all. Plus, there were at least two moments where the main lead should've died or at least have been rendered useless for a long period of time, but somehow were toughed out simply due to him being a main lead.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLeanka is a decent protagonist with a level headed, kind yet somewhat reckless, and kill them all/protect everyone mentality. Unfortunately, the show DOES put him in situations where he either should have died, or shouldn't have had much repercussion. His backstory wasn't all that impressive aside from the last 4 minutes of it, and he never really develops. Nobody does. With such a short runtime, we can only flesh some of them out, like with Alisa and her traumatizing backstory and Soma with his sad and honestly unfortunate life, even if both of them start off unkind. The other God Eaters are handled alright, even without being fleshed out or developed much. The researchers were nicely done, up until we realize that one of them, namely Johannes, is the true antagonist of the series with no good reason. Even still, our God Eaters were overall pleasant, like with Alisa's past catching up to her in brutally realistic fashion, or Rindou being a charismatic and badass leader with a good eye for suspicion and a positive effect on Leanka's backstory at one point. Basically, they're all underdeveloped but all around, relatively decent.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle Ufotable did was exemplary given the unique artstyle, even with some minor oddities here and there. The artstyle for the characters, backgrounds, God Arc weapons, and attacks are incredible, especially given the fact that they are different that Uoftable normally does with say, the Fate/ series. The weapons look pretty slick though. Most of the fights were well done too, even if the final fight and one of the moments in episode 3 got incomprehensible at points.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Aragami end up holding it back from a high 9 or low 10. These monsters were entirely CG and they weren't integrated all that well. Some of the designs are downright terrible. Who thought that a mutated Jango Fett's Slave 1 was a good idea? It's a shame that they weren't as good as everything else in the show's art department, since that aside, this series looks exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10*\\n\\n\r\n*SUBJECT TO CHANGE IF A DUB COMES OUT*\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is rather cool and fitting for such a harsh world like God Eater. It's definitely a rockin' and catchy track too. The ED, I'd rather plain and weak. The track called Human After All by GHOST ORACLE DRIVE is a nice emotional piece, even if it is the only track in God Eater that's truly worth remembering. A lot of songs were done with auto tune vocalist, and don't really stand out or sound that good to be honest. Auto tune isn't one type of music I enjoy, with a few exceptions, like say, Paresyte OP. The rest of the OST was merely decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis may not have been a truly great or spectacular series, but it was an enjoyable one nonetheless. The action was mostly solid, and the visuals of the characters and weapons were a big factor in that. The last 4 moments of episode 10 aka the end of Leanka's backstory mixed with a good montage of inspiration for his confirmation of his decision, were also satisfying. Overall, I found it to be a solidly fun time, and the first two episodes in particular made me have some good hope for the series, even if it didn't entirely fulfill them.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10    RAW SCORE: 64/100\\n\\n\r\nOverall, God Eater was a decent action show with a nice artstyle, some ok leads, and some nice moments of somberness and fleshing out. However, the CG usage for the Aragami, and the final episode, as well as the other problems mentioned above, cut it far too short of being  all that good. If you want some decent action with a sleek art style and don't require a whole lot else, then this is a great show for you. However, for those who want that extra mile, this may not be all that satisfying. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "This review will contain minor spoilers since I can't fully discuss some characters without mentioning certain things about them. \r\nAs somebody who played the God Eater game, I was very excited when it got an anime adaption. I had always felt that the story would translate very well to an anime and that the Aragami fights would be really fun to watch animated. So, was this the masterpiece that I hoped for or was it the disaster that I feared? Well, it was somewhere in the middle. There was more good than bad actually, but because of my disappointment with the show compared to myexpectations, I'll start with the bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with God Eater is Lenka. Let's make it clear from the start that I feel Lenka single-handedly knocked a couple of points off of the show's rating. The original game did not have a true protagonist. The protagonist was simply a player-created avatar that served one purpose: give the player someone to play as alongside the rest of the characters. Ufotable's decision to create a true protagonist would not have been quite as bad had they not made Lenka so boring. He's bland. He's an Eren clone. He has no personality. His seiyuu is very uninteresting to listen to. He gets inexplicably stronger as the show goes on as well rises through the ranks for seemingly no reason. He was just a bad decision all around. Ufotable would have been much better served just rolling with a collective group of characters (Lindow, Soma, Kota, Alisa, and Sakuya) all being co-protagonists if Lenka was the best they could do for creating their own protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of those other characters, none of them were properly developed in the anime. Lenka steals way too much screen time (and largely boring screen time at that- though I did like his flashback episode quite a bit) from them. \\n\r\nSoma is one of the most complex characters in the game. He's unpleasant up front and doesn't like working with others, but he has a real soft side to him. The reason he doesn't working with others is that they so often die and he's tired of it. On top of that, the guy is part Aragami. The anime touches on his past only a little bit, and doesn't give him nearly the screen time he gets in the game. A lot of this is due to a certain character not being introduced in the anime much to the dismay of fans of the game as she is a very important character. She was essentially responsible for about 70% of Soma's character development, which explains why he feels like such an unfinished product in the anime. It was hinted at during the last couple of minutes though that this character may be introduced in season 2 if there ever is one, so maybe that will happen hopefully. \\n\r\nAlisa is also very complex but her development is rushed way too fast. She has pretty bad PTSD, and they do a good job covering that intially, but how the PTSD affects episodes 9 and onward was not handled correctly at all. She deserved to be fleshed out more but it just didn't happen. It felt like they focused too much on the PTSD itself instead of the consequences of it. Sure, they hammered home the point that she's basically crazy, but nothing too bad really happens because of it. It pretty much got swept under the rug in the last few episodes when it should not have.\\n\r\nSakuya and Kota are nothing special, and they weren't handled too improperly. I feel they did the best job with Kota out of all the characters. He got a lot of screen time and they did a good job with his character overall. Sakuya could have been more developed (they barely touched on her past with Lindow), but she is a pretty bland character to begin with so no big complaints. \\n\r\nLindow was actually handled very well, so I won't write a lot about him. He got the most screen time next to Lenka so it was hard to mess him up. \\n\\n\r\nThe story for the God Eater game is also very good, with 2 main \"halves\" to it. The anime only covers about 25% of the game in total- or half of the first half if that redundancy doesn't bother you. I'm not going to bitch about them not adapting the entire story because I understand that wasn't possible in 13 episodes. Still, I would have liked for them to handle what they did adapt better. It seemed like the major plot points were either rushed or dragged out- there was no middle ground really. I was very happy with the way that episode 13 ended though as there were multiple hints at the rest of the game's story. Who knows whether it will eventually be adapted, but it was satisfying to see them acknowledge the later events and lay the groundwork for a possible second season. \\n\\n\r\nFor all my bitching about Lenka and how he took so much important screen time away from the rest of the show, it overall was not bad. The story was still solid overall even though they could have done a  better job. The flashbacks featuring Johannes and Paylor were a welcome addition that the game did not feature. They were overused, but they served the purpose of providing background for the creation of the Aragami. They didn't do a very good job of explaining exactly what God Eaters are and what their powers are, but they made up for it by giving an excellent backstory for the Aragami apocalypse. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also extremely fluid and makes the fights more entertaining. Overall, the fights were disappointing simply because they weren't quite as action-packed as expected. Maybe it's just my personal bias as someone who played the game but the Aragami just went down way too easily most of the time. But even though the fights were underwhelming, they were nicely animated at least. The art is also not bad, although I feel it is unnecessary. Ufotable did the prologue OVA for the game as well as all cinematic cutscenes in the game, and they looked just fine. There was no reason to use such a unique and somewhat lazy art style when they had animated the title before with a much cleaner-looking art style. The character designs suffered the most from this. It looks good overall (especially the environments which look great) but it had its problems. Also, I didn't think the CGI Aragami looked too great either but they weren't terrible. People who are not fans of CGI will likely be put off by the Aragami though. \\n\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack overall. It was very nice to hear songs from the game like \"Of God and Man\" during flashbacks and \"No Way Back\" during the final episode. It's a shame that \"Over the Clouds\" couldn't be used as that is the iconic song of the game, but the rest of the soundtrack was good enough to make up for it. The voice-acting cast is also stellar with the exception of Lenka. Lindow especially stood above the rest with Soma a close second despite his lack of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I was disappointed overall with the anime adaption, it was still an enjoyable watch. Though a lot of the game is still left not adapted and the characters were underdeveloped compared to in the game, it was still a solid 7. It would have been an 8 without Lenka, but he simply stole too much screen time from the rest of the characters as well as the overall plot. I'll say it again; the game had no \"true\" protagonist outside of a player-created avatar. Ufotable messed up trying to create a protagonist for the anime series. Other than that it was solid and I'm honestly just happy that it did indeed get an anime adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 5. The roster is actually pretty good but too many of the characters were left underdeveloped and thus hurt the score. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. I still enjoyed it despite the fact it did not live up to my expectations. Fun to watch for anyone who is an action or post-apocalyptic fan.\\n\r\nOverall: 7.\\n\\n\r\n If a second season ever occurs, I feel it will be much better. I doubt it will happen though after they had so much trouble with the first season.",

            "content": "Just finished God Eater today and damn it's good.\r\nFirst of all there is a LOT of hate floating around for this anime, I chose to ignore it and I watched it anyway which was a great choice.\r\nYou probably know already that God Eater is based off a game, although I never played it, hearing that put me off of watching it.\r\nThe reason for that is because I expected it to have a boring unoriginal story line however I was proven wrong.\r\nGod Eater has a very interesting story about fighting against god, which is odd as god is seen as someone who protects so the reversalof this made me more eager to find out how things would end up.\\n\r\nHumans are causing the world too much damage and must be eliminated by what they assume is god.\\n\r\nThe battle seems unending but there is a lot of logic behind the ways they try to solve things which also makes me want to watch more.\\n\r\nYes there is a lot of anime about mankind in desperate situations but this one is different and i recommend watching it to see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is really pretty and everything is nicely done, the monsters they fight against look very nice too as it's very smooth and easy to look at and enjoy.\\n\r\nAt first it was slightly slow paced but not so slow that it made me decide to stop watching, it starts to get more interesting around the 4th or 5th episodes and the story starts to build up.\\n\r\nThe character development is very good and you'll get attached to them as the anime goes on, there are SO MANY FEELS when listening to their background stories and when they fight like a bad-ass.\\n\\n\r\nI've finished the anime and I'm veryyyyy happy yet confused, as it ended on a cliffhanger (a good cliffhanger!)\\n\r\nBut hopefully there is going to be a second season with the way things are looking.",

            "content": "God Eater Review\r\nStory (6/10) Fair\r\nThe story for God Eater is simple so I wasn't expecting to much and so what I was given was around what I was expecting. In an anime era where this story plot of humans at the brink of extinction and having to fight some sort of enemy creature to survive can be considered over saturated to say the least, God Eater can be seen as one that didn't necessarily hold a candle when it came to other story elements hidden within it the plot they we were given. Granted introduced a character not even in the video it was adaptingfrom, made him the protagonist and even gave him a back story along with a few others, this is what's keeping it above a 5 to me everything else like the creation of the gods trying to kill them and their purpose to me felt little bit too generic and felt it was the weakest parts of God Eater. I feel it was trying to be deeper than it was suppose and it failed to when it came to that execution, this is obviously my opinion and maybe I'm just to stupid to understand any other deeper meaning to the plot by the time it concluded so if that's the case shame on me.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good \\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nThe Art style when first shown off I wasn't necessarily a fan of especially when you see the art style of how the prologue looks and the character art style of the character when play the video game looks in comparison to this? They went with this shadow cell shading effect on almost everything in the anime when made it look worse in comparison to what I previous know of. The colors that are used on everything also have this water paint style to it that makes a lot of colors too kind of dirty and dead. And what could say \"oh well this type of anime is quite blood and dark so the dirty/dead look would fit it perfectly\" sure you could say that but I personally prefer what it looked like in the prologue anime. As far as the animation it was the saving point when it came to this section especially the last few episodes it really brought the house down (in a good way). The CG on the god enemies and other small items could have been down without but it didn't entirely ruin it for me. So this section could have gotten a 9 or maybe even a 10 if there was less CG and the art style stuck to what the prologue had which resembles the art style at most of Ufotable's previous anime look like.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM, JP Voice acting, opening and ending were all very good nothing mind blowing or memorable (expect the opening). \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in God Eater were good for the most part. For 13 episodes it tries to make you care about the characters that it presents (obviously more than other like any other anime) and the ones that they do focus on for characterization and character development purposes all are good. The backstory for the MC and Alisa are good and are focused on the most. The only thing that has me a bit confused what the character death for *spoiler*. I wasn't expecting that only because I thought that specific character was important to the actually game and they would leave him/her alive. I actually was waiting for *spoiler* to die honestly because he/she isn't present in the video game so a death to him/her would have made more sense but I guess this anime is set in a alternate timeline or maybe *spoiler* does die in the video game I didn't finish God Eater 1 so I wouldn't know. (I'll see if he/she dies when I play the resurrection version later this year...)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for episode 1 and 2 were sitting at about a 9, I was hyped for the anime. Then as it went on and they started talking about instead of fighting my enjoyment for the story that I didn't really care too much about dropped to around a 8, 7 and 6 which was around episode 3-9. There were a few scenes during episodes 3-9 that were great but far FAR in between to the point where I was behind a few episodes and had to binge some because I didn't feel it was worth keeping up with weekly at a certain point. And the the anime when on a season hiatus. This left everyone with quite the blue balls, but when it came back for those last few episodes made my enjoyment every episode when up. From a 6 to a 7 and from a 7 to an 8. So it was definitely a roller coaster when it came to this one, those last couple episodes definitely saved it to some extent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.60/10) Good+\\n\\n\r\nDid God Eater live up to the hype? Fuck no, but was it a bad anime? Nahh it was good but I think my hype was far too high because I love the game that much so it's technically my own fault especially since by the time this anime was announced Ufotable was wrapping up Fate Stay Night UBW was I really enjoyed so my reasons are justified to some extent but I really should have expected as much as I want out of this adaptation it is based off a monster clone video to and majority of video game adaptations aren't done too well. But I think this one was not as bad as people say it is. The hype definitely killed it though especially after being right after UBW which is why I feel people who have absolutely little to no knowledge at all of the video game was even more disappointed and less forgiving than the ones that do (that's if they didn't like it that is because I do know a small hand full of people that have no knowledge of the game and they liked it but it's a SMALL group). Nothing more can be said about God Eater the adaptation I feel was a good one and can be recommended to people that have knowledge of the game but for anyone else (especially if you've watched anime in this genre like Attack on Titan or Owari No Seraph) I wouldn't highly recommended it.",

It didn't prove me wrong, as this anime is filled with flawed logic in almost every episode.  It's difficult to even get into the all the massive logic gaps, without spoiling things.  So, careful as there will be a few spoilers. \r\nA character goes from being a complete rookie flopping all over the place, to not justan ace combatant literally a few days later with no training, but goes on to lead an entire international offensive within the next week or two.  What army would give a rookie control over an entire military offensive that the fate of the human race rests upon? \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of commander would totally jeopardize this mission just to send an entire squad to go save one person?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of ridiculous situation allows someone to be able to survive being gutted, impaled, fall from hundreds of feet in the air from a cliff and then again only hours later from the 10th story of a building and live?  \\n\\n\r\nWhy wouldn't you just let Pita kill the Vajra and then jump in to fight at the end?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat was the point of brainwashing someone only for it to wear off when someone yells at them once?\\n\\n\r\nWhy the hell do killer animals keep letting the heroes live while they kill every other human instantly?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell happened to the giant dragon thing? Don't show a gigantic dragon and then NEVER SHOW IT AGAIN.  That was irritating. \\n\\n\r\nHow does a guy get a brand new weapon and INSTANTLY knows how to use it, what it does, and becomes a more beastly fighter than anyone else in the anime?  The weapon had like 5 forms, and he knew how to masterfully use every single form.  Are you kidding?   \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the characters.  You had the stoic MC whose entire dialogue for the series probably had less words than this review.  You had the useless sidekick buddy, Kota, who suddenly becomes a ninja shooter within 2 fights after he was tripping over his own two feet.  Then you have Alisha, the most useless, irritating character I've seen since Renge from Air Master.  And the really irritating part about it is that at the beginning she looked like she was going to be a beast.  But she turned into a weak, whiny, character who caused WAY more harm than she did good.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only two redeemable characters from this anime were Lindou and the Black Vajra, Pita.  Yes, the killer animal, that never said a word, was probably the best part of the anime.  I will give them that, it was really cool.  I wish it was a villain in another, better, anime.   But, that was it.  The logic was spotty, the characters were annoying, and it had some serious pre-occupation with trying to get people to not pray to God.  I mean, seriously, was this a hidden recruitment video for the Church of Satan or something?  We get it.  They're mad at God for the state of the world.  Okay. The horse is dead.  Stop kicking already.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was the equivalent of a blonde bimbo.  Very good looking, but very stupid once it starts trying to convey ideas.  \\n\\n\r\nYou can skip this one.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nThis is only not a straight 1 fest because of the Black Vajra.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nAnime based on video games don't usually work out. Recent examples would be Blade & Soul and Gunslinger Stratos. God Eater is based on a PSP game, yet it had a lot of hype surrounding it. Mostly because it was being animated by Ufotable. \r\nWhen the pilot finally aired, most people were disappointed. I wasn't, because I didn't have any expectations in the first place.\r\nStory: It's hard not to compare this anime to Shingeki no Kyojin. In 2070, humans live in a city surrounded by walls to protect them from monsters called Aragami. The people that kill Aragami are called God Eaters.God Eaters wield living weapons called God Arcs. Which are made from the same Oracle cells that the Aragami evolved from.\\n\r\nIf the Aragami are supposed to be scary, they do a terrible job of it. They look like Disney Monsters with beards. Titans are way scarier. \\n\r\nThe main character is Utsugi Lenka, who is a new-type. Only a select few are able to wield the new-type god arcs. This is basically their way of calling him 'the chosen one'. As usual he's a reckless idiot that is hell bent on destroying all Aragami. Why does that sound familiar?\\n\r\nIn episode 3, they introduce another new-type. I will get to her clothes later. To show how cool she is, they have her fight Aragami on a plane. I love how she jumps off the plane, with no fear of falling, kills the Aragami and just magically ends up on the plane again. Because Fuck Gravity.\\n\r\nIn episode 5, their expedition didn't go quite as planned. They went to destroy a type of Aragami called Vajra. But the strongest Vajra out there killed all the other Vajra and then went for the humans. Why is this Vajra so strong? Because he's black.\\n\r\nUnlike in SnK, we know the origin of the Aragami. They were created by humans. The leader of the project is now the director of Far East Branch. So that asshole creates these monsters. He then sits comfortably in a safe place, while innocent humans die outside the walls. This would be okay if he allowed said human to enter the safe city. But NO, only humans that can wield god arcs or their families are allowed. Isn't that convenient you sad excuse for a human being. \\n\r\nAt some points they introduce minor characters and kill them off almost instantly and expect us to feel bad. I did cry, but only because I was wasting my life watching this trash. If you want a better plot, go watch hentai.\\n\\n\r\nArt: First the character designs- The faces of the characters themselves aren't badly designed. But their clothes are something else. The main character wears a short jacket that looks suspiciously similar to what the survey corps wear. The wimpy classmate wears clothes that prove how lame he is. The women, specifically Alisa, wear clothes that are impractical. They cover only half their body. There is no way those clothes would help in a fight. The only reason for this is F A N S E R V I C E. Not even good fanservice.\\n\r\nNext the animation- This was the part everyone looked forward to. Ufotable just finished FSN: Unlimited Blade Works. The best part of that was the animation. If God eater was animated like that, maybe I would actually enjoy it a bit. But It isn't, instead they decided to use 3D animation. It's not as bad as the 3D we usually see. It's definitely done better, but I personally didn't like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the Opening and the Ending are forgettable. The Voice acting though is the only decent thing about this anime. Hirata Hiraoki is excellent as Lindow. Maaya Sakomoto and Nakai kazuya do a good job too. The OST isn't bad either, especially in episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I don't see much character development. None of the characters are well written. The main character is just like Eren, except I actually gave a shit about Eren. Lindow is pretty cool. Not as cool as Levi but still cool. The female characters are all terribly written. I don't think the writers have ever actually met a female human being.\\n\\n\r\nWell I'm dropping this.\\n\r\ninb4 \"It gets better!\"\\n\r\nIt know it doesn't.\\n\r\nThis anime is literally a meme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Barely 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\r\nThe weapons bleed when they're cut in half.\\n\r\nIt's only 13 episodes long and not 25.\\n\r\nRacism\\n\r\nSome decent voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCons: Everything else\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Only watch this if you hate yourself.\\n\r\nDon't waste your time/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nGod Eater is the kind of show that is slow for a few episodes but then goes 0-100 really fast.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nGod Eater is a show that follows the actions of a young man living and fighting in a post-apocalyptic war where mysterious monsters known as Aragami are devouring everything on the face of the Earth, pushing humanity towards extinction with each day that passes. Even though the story is not very original it does have unique features and the action is just so intense that you need to take a 5 min. break from time to time.\r\nI really did appreciate the flashback scenes and explanationsof the Aragami and how everything ended up the way it did. I liked the fact that these Aragami are not mindless, they have the potential to achieve intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters are generic but it is not as bad as it may seem, some of them are intriguing.\\n\r\nThe protagonist is the heroic and impulsive Lenka. I liked Lenka\u2019s personality, he is not all that generic, and I am surprised of how good his backstory is. I also liked the relation between Rindou and Lenka, he is a role model and a good friend to Lenka. Overall, Lenka is a good protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is godly, it is ridiculously beautiful. The visuals of God Eater are absolutely stunning,  as it is to be expected from Studio Ufotable. At first the animation felt weird but as soon as my eyes got adjusted I saw the beauty of it. \\n\r\nEverything was smooth, even when the screen was overloaded with light, blood, flowing water, rain, thunder strikes, etc. the animation was fluid and it really managed to bring things to life.\\n\r\nTop quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe opening theme is great, it gets you hyped up and ready for what is to come. The ending theme is good as well. \\n\r\nWhat I was surprised by is the blood-pumping background music as well as the fantastic sound effects infusing every scene without ever overlapping with the voice work. \\n\r\nTop quality sound.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe great animation/sound combined with intense action, fantastic fight scenes, pretty cool MC and decent plot  got me hyped up and made the show a really fun time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.6/10\\n\r\nGreat animation, sound and action with decent plot and characters. Just get through the first 3 episodes and watch the series in one go. I recommend this show to everyone, it is one of the best series of 2015.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who played the original God Eater PSP game I approve of this anime.\r\nStory 6/10: Story is pretty mediocre, if you've played the game you roughly know what is going on. Sadly, the anime doesn't follow the PSP story. The good thing is this anime gives you a deeper insight of the God Eater apocalyptic universe and how non-God Eater people live, it also provides flashbacks that show the origin of Aragami and how the world came to shit. (And also why those buildings have giant holes in them. Hint: It wasn't a laser beam). Other than that, there's not much else I canpraise about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Ufotable. Thats all I can say\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Again, Ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: This is a treat for those who played the original PSP game. Because in the original game you make your own main character so I can't say I was looking forward to the idea of Lenka. But the anime gives us insight of some but not all the characters origins.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Maybe I set my standards a bit too high after watching Unlimited Blade Works. Was really hoping for some epic God Eater vs God Eater action. But the monster killing is cool too. Sadly most of the main featured monsters are Vajras and Orgetails. And the combat is more realistic compared to the game.(Haha) The show does fill in the blanks on some unanswered questions found in the game mechanics. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: Mediocre story, Great characters stories. Here's to hoping for a season 2.",

            "content": "First review so I apologize if it isn't well done. but damn the initial hate over this series.\r\ntl;dr? Do you have 3 hours to spare? watch it.\r\nStory: What is the story? Humanity is on the verge of death with unbeatable monsters eating everyone. Last hope are God Eaters, beings who have taken into themselves what makes these monsters so special allowing them to fight them. The MC becomes a God Eater and we follow him as he does what he came here to do, kill those monsters. If this sounds kind of like Attack on Titan then you can pretty much say that you arein the right. What i would say is that both stories have great worlds, and characters (of which some die), but what sets this one apart is, in AoT i hated Eren as a main character. But in God Eater, Lenka is a pretty decent lead. He is naive but not stupid, i would almost relate him to Shirou from Fate/Stay Night as a MC. Both are capable, intelligent, but when others are in danger, hindsight goes out the window. This story from the first God Eater game on the PSP originally and mainly only covers 1/3 of the game, the story I would say is good. It isn't as fleshed out as it can be but the concept of what is going on and why is very interesting to me. It's a cool thought and they do enough to make you interested in how this will all turn out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: A series that seems to be rendered in more than the basic few types of colours that conventional anime usually gets rendered in adding to the style. I LOVE the art style in this series because of how much detail and shadow is in every scene, mind blowing. There are times when the animation is at a meh point but the art more than makes up for it and there is no animation section so i won't deduct marks for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was good, nothing amazing but they do the job. On a few scenes the music chosen and the music cue was fantastic, but the lack of, in my opinion, a great OST sets it from going above and beyond. Doesn't stop me from getting that opening though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This may be biased slightly because, from playing the game, i have more fleshed out characters in my head but I will try not to confuse them. Overall the characters were not handled AS well as they could have been and in some instances I look at what some choose to do and go \"...doesn't make much sense but okay.\" However in saying that there are some great key characters and over a 13 episode series they do the job. You will probably only remember 3-5 characters from the cast though and only remember well 2-3 of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bias most likely cause i played the game but this series I LOVED and ENJOYED. I have re-watched it 5 times and those later episodes that are in a class of their own i've rematched countless times. I loved them and enjoyed them fully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's got action, shounen, and some good cheesy lines but that doesn't stop this series from being one that I will absolutely buy the blu-ray of and keep on my hard drive for impulse watching at random points in time. It isn't a masterpiece but it is definitely a guilty pleasure. You don't need to be a masterpiece to be a series i will watch over and over again at later times and this one is definitely just that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a 13 episode series that, overall was enjoyable when watched all together. Initial turn off because they only did 9 episodes in over 1 seasons with a massive gap between those and the last 4 episodes. Leaves a bad taste in peoples mouthes but if you are NOW coming to watch it, absolutely go for it.\\n",

Mainly the MC Utsugi Lenka...\r\nWhen he first showed up, it kinda ticked me off that he was some kind of a hot headed someone that has the grudge to kill all of the Aragami, but it was notable that his personality changed overtime (and he speaks)...\r\nSecond was the unexpected shenanigans...\r\nThe inventivemind of the director kinda shattered my dreams as I watched further and saw the dark side of the Far East Branch (the \"if you are not suited then you cannot enter\" issue), it was not included inside the game or even though it was, it was kept out of the main plot line.\\n\\n\r\nThird was the events...\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes that were all black and white. I know that they want to explain how the Aragami came to be but they did not have to explain it in the middle of a battle... I mean if they made it into a one whole episode it might have been much better or they could have made it like the game... when the MC saw a memory drive on the floor that was dropped by someone (Dr. Sakaki) that contained the story of Soma and the foreshadow of the Aegis plan. but what can I do... huh...\\n\\n\r\nFourth the bullets...\\n\\n\r\nUm... I was not a fan of the guns of the GE but the bullets were kinda special. There is this mechanics of the main game that could customize the bullets that you use when battling the Aragami, though it was a huge part on battling them, it only got a foreshadow and a short glimpse of it's potential at the end ep. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the storyline...\\n\\n\r\nFrom the part when the \"I did not know\" side of the FEB to the part when you know... Lindow... the hype was kinda broken when I realized that my expected character would not be showing up, it was the person that Soma missed from seeing and the one on the last scene...\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise they might have done a better or worse job in telling it but, overall, it was a blast even with the ups and downs, I hope it will share the same sentimental value as it's game counterpart...",

            "content": "If God Eater was a person, its face would be pretty but it would be an airhead. It would have a muscular body but not a bit of strength. Its breasts would be big but they couldn't produce any milk. But hey, it looks amazing.\r\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is probably because God Eater managed to somewhat sway me. I'll say this in advance: I don't think God Eater is bad. Not as a whole. I know that a clear majority doesn't share my opinion on this show, and I can totally see why: the story, characters, story and characters. And the story.They are outright terrible, and that's a fact. Then, how is it possible that I actually liked it?\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the first 9 episodes weekly in the summer, I didn't like God Eater at all. It was confusing. The story sucked, the flashbacks didn't make sense and the music annoyed me. After the final 4 episodes aired in the spring, I rewatched the series. This time I got a better grip of the story, the flashbacks made sense, and what's more, the final episodes were pretty good. God Eater wasn't as bad as I thought even though its story and characters are pathetic by all odds.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>STORY - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater in a nutshell: Attack on Titan 3.0. It's about people with superpowers (God Eaters) who fight big ass monsters (Aragami) using big ass weapons (God Arcs) that are made from Aragami cells and are basically the only way to kill them. A walled city, a determined protagonist, an organization that is tasked with killing the baddies. There is nothing original in the story of God Eater. I'm not saying it copied AoT (because it didn't) but there are many, many other series with similar premises. The plot of some of the episodes is cliche in too many ways as well, and some developments in the story are absolutely ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe flashbacks are boring, yes, but I felt intrigued when I knew the whole story of Johannes, Aisha and Paylor in the final episode. Their actions made sense now, and the plot twist in the final episode was a very surprising one.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>ART - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisually, this anime is great. It has stunning visuals and cinematics. Some people get orgasms just by hearing the animation studio's name. The art style is original - the characters look like moving oil paintings with lots of details. I'm not sure how they do it but it looks awesome. AND DID YOU SEE THE LANDSCAPES? They're so rugged yet so charming in every situation. I could watch the backdrops all day long whether it's dusk, sunsets, skyscapes or rainy and gloomy. I liked the gore. There was nothing wrong with the direction, either. Almost everything in God Eater is crisp and clear to look at.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the CGI aragami look pretty ridiculous, especially that scorpion-like creature. The fighting also looks comedic and slow at some points (especially in ep 2) because it's a mix of animated people waving their sticks at the CGI monsters that are doing, uh, whatever they do. The animated and CGI movements don't match, and it doesn't look pretty. Don't get me wrong: the CGI isn't done badly, but it's still CGI. By the way, if you're going to (re)watch God Eater in the close future, try to spot a rather distinguishable animation mistake in episode 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>SOUND - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very good, realistic and modern. The music is beautiful and always fits the mood. There's this band that performs many songs in the OST of God Eater, and even though it took me a while, I realized that hey, this doesn't sound too bad after all. I found another crazy good OST that I could listen to while reading manga or something. The opening song was also very good - it wasn't your typical OP, it was some kind of metalcore, and I couldn't stop listening to it some time ago. The ED was OK. The voice acting was pretty nice as well, it's the characters' lines that were crappy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>CHARACTER - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't one character I liked. They all ****ing suck, god dammit. What were you thinking, Ufotable? Don't you know how to give the characters a personality?\\n\\n\r\nSome of the main characters are way too easy to compare with the characters of AoT. AoT came out in 2013 and the anime adaptation of God Eater two years later, so animewise, God Eater is a copy of AoT. In a certain way, you know.\\n\r\n- Lenka (Eren) is the protagonist of the show, and has vowed to exterminate all the Titagami\\n\r\n- Kota (Armin) is the \"incompetent best friend\"\\n\r\n- Alisa (Mikasa) is the beautiful, skilled and obstinate girl wonder\\n\r\n- Soma (Levi) is the crusty and somewhat unsocial bad boy who is secretly warm-hearted\\n\\n\r\nThere are also characters that fulfill other \"basic\" archetypes: a boobalicious commander, a badass unit leader whose cigarette never burns out and a cute, caring redhead who tries to be of help. Do I even need to say more? Well no, I don't, but I want to.\\n\\n\r\nSocial interactions between the characters. English isn't even my main language, but I still find the dialogue to often be cliche and embarrassing, and it makes me want to roll my eyes. But at least the behavior of the characters is kind of realistic with all their expressionless faces. I guess that's more like a bad thing, though?\\n\\n\r\nMajor Amamiya's boobs are too big and too out. Alisa's underboobs. How does that jacket (it's jacket, right?) even cover her boobs when she's jumping around? And Sakuya's wearing only an apron. Do the boobs fit the mood of this anime? No. Do the boobs fit the the mood of God Eater the game? Possibly. What I mean by this, is that it's a little stupid to make an anime adaptation of an action game. You can't play anime, you can only watch it. That's why many parts of the game don't suit the anime adaptation. I just wish Ufotable made an adaptation of some other series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>ENJOYMENT - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the fighting scenes, backgrounds and the mood whenever the music was playing and the characters weren't talking anything embarrassing. Episodes 2, 7, 8 and 9 were the worst episodes, with some infuriating dialogue or terribly carried out plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (tl;dr)\\n\r\nGod Eater is entertaining when it shows instead of tells. I can totally see why a lot of people don\u2019t like it \u2013 I didn\u2019t like it either, at first. The story barely exists, and the characters and their social interactions make me want to cringe too often. However, the strongest points of God Eater are animation and backgrounds that, along with the sound effects and epic music, made the series satisfying for me. A well-written story and enchanting characters aren\u2019t always a necessity for enjoying a show. God Eater succeeded in being enjoyable in its own way, and it left me wanting more. But still, it IS pretty stupid, like, the show assumes its viewers are complete idiots or something? That kind of disrespectful stupid.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>OVERALL - 6/10 (fine)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I wanted to know what/who that girl-like figure at the end of the final episode was so I spoiled myself a little, and then I spoiled myself a little more. I think a second season could be very interesting. However, I don\u2019t think God Eater was THAT popular in Japan, and I\u2019m a pessimist so it might be unlikely that they\u2019ll make a second season. But then again, we\u2019re talking about Ufotable here, and they don\u2019t obviously care about money so it\u2019s impossible to say just yet.\\n\\n\r\nWhooooh, so, this was my first review! (this seems to be a common thing to say?)... Feedback is much appreciated. Have a fantastic day! And if you just skipped to the end of my review, screw you.",

Be prepared to feel the feels everyone no joke. \r\nNow as everyone knows this is a anime based off a game. I played the game very sparingly. I never truly got into it. I thought it was going to be a fairly generic action anime. Until those last three episodes dropped holy crap. Everything just became greater once I watched those. For those who are reading this to get an idea of the anime. Yourlucky you can watch it without breaks. I think I can actually think more fondly now that I see it in its completed state. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters because I'm not great at art and sound stuff. I focus on things I believe i can judge. The characters for the most part are extremely static. We only truly learn the backgrounds of the Lenka and Alisa. The rest are mentioned as we get glimpses about them. Of course we find this world is extremely hard and traumatic.\\n\\n\r\nI believe God Eater is getting itself a season two which I am actually stoked to see. This anime truly surprised me with the last three episodes. I am so ready to see the second season of it.   \\n\\n\r\nIf your a fan of the games your a fan of this. And maybe after watching this anime you'd like to take a chance at the games. \\n",

            "content": "I just happen to read the reviews while updating my anime list and was a bit sad to read some negative reviews, well first of all this anime is not for everyone (isn't every anime like that?). God Eater is not so bad but not so great either, I did enjoy watching it though. This is my first anime review by the way so please bear with me. \r\nGod Eater was an anime adaptation of the PSP game of the same title, while it is called an adaptation the anime does not follow the game story completely which will probably disappoint a few of thepsp game fans, the anime had more events and character backstory that were not in the game which, in my opinion, actually made the anime more worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place after a disaster fell on the whole planet causing the birth of monsters known as aragami killing humans forcing them to hide behind walls, to fight these monsters God Eaters were created, they are special humans that can wield weapons called God Arcs, the only weapon that can deal damage to the aragami. It is a pretty common setting I know but understand that just because the setting is common, doesn't mean that its bad. The characters are pretty well made, even after the changes made in the story you can still feel that its the same chars from the game, character development was a bit lacking though. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is awesome, the fight scenes were really cool and really well made, well its made by ufotable after all, my only problem was that there were a few unnecessary slow-mos. The sound was also good, sound effects were good, the OP and ED song are quite nice, overall sound is not that great but just right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching this anime. If you are a fan of the game then you would surely enjoy this too, its a really well done adaptation. Would also recommend it to people who likes the genre, just keep an open mind and try not to be affected by reviews too much as you watch, just sit back and enjoy.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[This review contains 0% mentions of whats shown in the anime for spoiler sake]\r\n[This review coming from a person who very informed of the God Eater games]\r\nGod Eater is not a video game adaptation, rather a re-telling by ufotable of first quarter of God Eater Resurrection (Aegis Island arc). Doing the opposite of other writers took the franchise to their hands.\r\nLet me clear some stuff first. Other works (mangas and light novels) covering the first game features Yuu Kannagi (or Ryo Kagami, both of them are very kind/nice off the bat) as the main protagonist and very strictly follows the game's events. While the animefeatures a different protagonist; Renka Utsugi, with altered the story presentation/characters introduction/important plot from the game.\\n\\n\r\n==Story==\\n\r\nThe story is very nice... even tho is kinda sad most of the time. Very well constructed, which is a very big surprise from an action-hunting game.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know story more, try get the game. Its available on Vita, PS4 and Steam. For Steam, you get God Eater Resurrection for free when buy God Eater 2 Rage Burst. Dont worry, the PC port is very good and the games are multi-language.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n==Art==\\n\r\nI had to admit, I was really surprised when I saw the first anime trailer. Its really bold and contrast the characters very well. Sometimes, it looks weird at certain angles (as example in episode 2 and 7). The art style closely follows the game's art style, which I really like.\\n\r\nThe CG for the Aragami is quite nice too. Drawing the Aragami moving at high speed is hard.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n==Sound==\\n\r\nAlmost all the musics are from the games and created by Go Shiina (an employee of Bandai Namco Japan). Every tracks fits the situations very well and very hard to get fed up.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n==Character==\\n\r\nEvery characters are very loveable and some can be related. From chill and serious when needed, to kinda edgy and caring deep in heart. A colorful cast of characters.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment==\\n\r\nI enjoyed all 13 episodes, plot set up episodes and actions. The combat shows what God Eaters can really do and how versatile Aragami are.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 9\\n\\n\r\nYou might find it weird that I scored the anime 8 in my anime list page, thats because the anime didnt explain some stuff clearly (like why Oracle Cells being injected into body) and rather make it convoluted for people who are new with the God Eater franchise but the anime shows stuff that wasnt shown in the games. Thumbs up from me.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who deeply in love with the franchise (over 800 hours on the games combined), I find this anime really good and close to my heart.",

            "content": "There is a saying: \"don't judge a book based on its cover.\"  This is a show that I expect was dropped by many because of constant delays and a dull as fuck pilot that was followed up by an even worse second episode.  To be honest, I was one of those people.  I thought the first episode was really dull with confused direction and the second episode had all the trappings of an incredibly generic shounen.  There were also many red flags: video adaptations tend to suck, this anime's purpose at the time seemed to be to function as an uninspiredadvertisement, and lines like \"press this button to fire, press both to rapid fire\" just screams PREVIEW FOR GOD EATER FOR PC!!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after like three episodes aired after 10 weeks or so (probably leaving poor fans screaming at the multiple delays), I decided to give it another shot.  The delays started with episode 4 onward apparently... and it REALLY showed.  Not only did the show get better with each episode, I actually was left curious for a second season in the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters: 6/10 \\n\r\nThis show, similarly to Attack on Titan, does a pretty good job at world building.  There are memento-styled flashbacks that gives context to the world and many episodes are dedicated to show how much humanity struggles in this dark post-apocalyptic world.  These elements are really interesting and helped fleshed out the grim setting.  The numerous locations Ufotable draws also really gives the world an interesting look, feel and scale to it.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother well done aspect of the show, and by far the best thing in the show, is the feeling of helplessness and some gut-punching reveals that unravel.  While the writing is mostly mediocre, a lot of thought that was given to the show was how to present a world full of misery and on the brink of destruction.  There were a couple moments where there would be something achieved, only to be followed by a twist that gives a feeling of helplessness.  The main character, Lenka, encounters many situations like this and has a surprisingly solid arc.  In this cruel underworld, the show attempts to contrast the darkness with themes of hope and \"passing the torch\".  It is in these moments that the show it truly at its best.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about the characters.  These elements, especially in the first half, represent the show at its worst.  The side characters, with the exception of one, are paper thin with very little depth and stale personalities.  I will go through each character briefly:\\n\\n\r\nLenka: By far the best character in the show.  Ironically, I thought he was going to be my least favorite character: looking like a generic Eren clone with rage as his only character coupled with zero logic.  Unlike Eren however,  he grows and learns from his mistakes and experiences REAL consequences. He is the only one in the cast with any depth or character arc worth mentioning, and his backstory is easily the best episode of the entire series.  \\n\\n\r\nAlisa: In contrast to Lenka, she seemed cool initially.... and ended up being easily the worst character in the entire cast.  There is a difference between a SYMPATHETIC portrayal of emotional frailty and making a character seem completely PATHETIC.  From her overly stupid character design, to her tediously repeated backstory, and to her total reliance on others to solve her problems....  I was literally yelling at the scream hoping someone would bitch-slap her.  Oh and her arc was really rushed towards the end.  It was almost as if the writers realized at a certain point that her character wasn't worth spending more time on.\\n\\n\r\nLindow: Bad-ass, likable, and is a character with some actual personality.  He is the only one who has any real chemistry with the protagonist, and the scenes between these two provide some of the most human moments in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters have some characterization here and there, but are mostly unexplored and uninteresting.  Despite some of the positives I mentioned above, you really don't get attached to the GOOD characters until quite late in the show.  This, again, is probably why so many people dropped the show before it finally had characters to root for.  \\n\\n\r\nAudio/visual: 9/10\\n\r\nThe visuals and music are honestly top tier.  Fantastic work all around.  The music is epic and most of the insert songs were surprisingly very fitting. Excellent backgrounds coupled with great animation.  The art style is unique and interesting, and despite the visuals being oddly inconsistent with some CG blending that didn't mesh very well in the early episodes, it is a great looking show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10  \\n\r\nTo me this is an example of a show that came out before it was ready.  Every single aspect of this show got better following the delays, which is especially true of the last four episodes that seemed to finally have a grasp on what works in its favor.  While I don't think of this to be particularly great, I think it is interesting and quite an under-the-radar that deserves a little more attention and less hate than it is getting.  The first three episodes are rough... but once you get past it, the show becomes surprisingly enjoyable with a few gems to show off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (good)",

            "content": "Lenka Utsugi is a new God Eater, and one of humanity's last hopes against the invading Aragami. God Eater follows Lenka as he trains and eventually joins a company of fellow God Eaters. Ufotable has created a thrilling, engaging, and occasionally quite dire story where brave acts are often overshadowed by the grim reality of the task at hand- Aragami are endless creatures, reincarnating from Oracle cells, whereas the surviving human population and their scant resources are fast depleting.\r\nThough it lacks the depth of character of some of Ufotable's other works, this is still a very strong show, especially from a presentation perspective. In termsof story, it reminds me most of Schwarzes Marken; they share a similar sense of desperation of situation and some characters seem to harbor ulterior objectives. If you've enjoyed Ufotable's previous action-based works, this is good enough work to dive into. It may be a new setting but they sure did a good job making it come to life.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nUfotable has an incredibly high bar for animation quality, and that continues in this show. Attention to detail is present everywhere- whether it is the detailing in the clouds or the fast-forward time transition animations, we're talking animated-movie quality stuff here. The detailing is great elsewhere as well; you'll find great shading and realistic reflections off metallic surfaces. The last frame of the OP also blends in perfectly with the beginning of the ED! The setting itself is an interesting yet sad place; the majority of the world has been turned into a barren wasteland, littered with the skeletal remains of humanity's former civilizations. The surviving humans now live tightly-packed in walled off settlements. It's definitely a different environment than the urban feel of the Fate universe. I'd say there's a steam punk kind of feel to both the weaponry and technology in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also drawn in a unique style, though not quite as noticeable as Valkyria Chronicles; outlines on the characters are very thin and/or nonexistent, which often makes hair look more like spikes rather than strands. Character expressions aren't the strong suit in this show, though I don't blame them too much given their situation; I do find it a bit odd that they have so many opportunities to stop mid battle and strike a cool pose for the camera. The characters also have rather outlandish outfits given their roles and situation (a long dress for battle... seriously).\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of battles, this show is essentially an endless, desperate fight with a few brief lulls. Expect a generous amount of blood, gore, and death along the way. Though the Aragami are painfully drawn through CGI, there's a good focus on choreography; I found myself on the edge of my seat through many battles. If there's one thing that the show wants to remind you of, it's that whenever you think have the upper edge you had better think again. There's an even amount of ranged and melee fighting, though obviously they focus more on the melee aspects. The plane fight in the third episode, though rather implausible physically, was one of the more memorable encounters. Though there is a bit of skin exposure on the part of Alisa, this isn't really an ecchi-centric show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a heavy rock piece that gives it a fittingly gritty and rough feel; it's not really my choice of music genre but makes sense here. The ED is a rather interesting piece, starting with a slow and ominous tonality before transitioning over to a hopeful and positive main melody. For once, I can honestly speak out positively about a BGM. This show has a superb BGM that greatly complements the strong visuals. It is often accompanied by a very fitting set of insert songs by Ghost Oracle Drive.\\n\\n\r\nLarge portions of the show have lone pad instruments or a piano with long reverb, adding a constant, heavy pressure to the atmosphere. This is further reinforced by opportune use of the vocal insert songs, specifically \"Broke my Stake\", which in my opinion really captures the atmosphere and tonality of the show. The BGM is also definitive during the battle scenes, often using strong drums or one of the excellent battle insert songs. When things go wrong, the show really drives the point with the eerily hopeless tune in the insert song \"Human After All\". Really, if you've been waiting for a show with a superb OST, there's a very strong contender here.\\n\\n\r\nThough I'm not a particular fan of our protagonist's general lack of emotion, the show has a strong cast overall. Our main heroine is voiced by veteran Maaya Sakamoto, who gives her character a fittingly aloof feel. We have other Ufotable veterans as well including Sayaka Oohara and Rikiya Koyama. They are also joined by veterans Kanae Ito and Ai Kakuma in supporting roles. Honestly, personal preference aside I'd have to say Sayaka wins highest praise here for her commanding yet motherly presence.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThough I started the show with a healthy dosage of skepticism surrounding this story, it honestly is a well orchestrated piece that instantly draws you in and doesn't let up until you're spit out the other side - and be warned that it may even pull you back in for an encore.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, I consider the first two episodes fair game for an initial introduction here. Unfortunately, things move so quickly in this show that this would be spoiling a great deal. Instead, an analysis of some primary story elements will have to suffice.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater is told primarily through the lens of Lenka, who is introduced to the workings of the Far East settlement and must learn to cope with his new found strength and abilities. However, the story also occasionally tells of the past of Johannes, the current chair of the Far East settlement. This past, often told in grayscale color, sheds light on the origins of God Eaters and the Aragami. These two stories are well intertwined so that neither feels out of place nor distracting.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't figure out any reasonable breakdowns of the show in terms of arcs, it's just one long struggle with chain-inducing cliff hangers and well-placed plot twists. There are plenty of battles that range anywhere from a few minutes to the entirety of an episode. Occasionally, this fire hose of constant action is turned down a bit to offer the viewer a short reprieve; expect this lull to be filled with meaningful character development and further atmosphere building. As there are multiple intense battles, there isn't the typical, linear buildup to a climax but rather lots of peaks and ridges along the way. The final climax is pretty epic, and though it's a bit over the top, it pretty much has to be in order to compete with the already grand previous battles. It's a relatively predictable climax/resolution, and the show leaves a gaping door open for future expansions.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, I picked up a favorite episode. Episode 10 is Lenka's origin story, and it's both well placed and well executed. For some reason, it reminds me of Emiya Kiritsugu's origin arc from Fate Zero- perhaps it's the similarity of emotion that is captured by the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is by no means a perfect work, there are plenty of setting and character details that are conveniently left out, as well as a huge deal of plot holes that one can easily write an academic essay on. Many of these are issues that actually apply to the FSN world as well (how a heroic spirit can ride an F-15 / how God Eaters can stand on a jet going 150+ mph, how main protagonists have ridiculous injury recovery rates i.e. Emiya/Lenka, etc.). However, there's enough action to focus on that these inconsistencies/impracticalities can be safely taken for granted without compromising on enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHonestly, this is probably the weakest category for this show. Ufotable has traditionally left a lot of mystery surrounding their characters, and that continues here. Through the season we learn a lot about Lenka, Johannes, and (to a lesser extent) Alisa. However, the other characters don't really get much of a background exposition; they seem to be there to serve a supporting role and to look cool in opportune moments. The actual character interactions are pretty good as you get to see the group dynamics evolve through the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for individual characters, I don't particularly like Lenka's personality; the fact that his trump card is his \"hero\" mentality is a bit overused in general in the world of anime. Alisa is definitely a work in progress, as her personal stability doesn't match her prowess in battle. The characters are dynamic, but not to the extent that we've seen in works such as FSN. Ironically, I'd say the Aragami are the most dynamic of characters in this show as they constantly evolve.\\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters, let's just say that there's a lot of death in this show. Innocent bystanders are often helplessly turned to heaps of red in a similar fashion to ordinary soldiers in a Gundam show.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThese days, I often find myself struggling to find uniqueness or elements of a show interesting enough to supplement my generic review pattern. I'm glad to have found such an interesting and engaging show. Though it may feel a bit immature at times, i.e. catering to younger audiences, the sheer power of the setting combined with the excellent story and majestic production qualities truly make this show an entertaining and worthwhile experience. It's not a perfect work by a long shot, but the franchise definitely shows promise. The first season ends with a lot of open questions so let's hope there's enough momentum for a sequel.",

            "content": "God Eater is one of those odd shows that starts out as kind of a slow burn for a few episodes at risk of losing you, but then goes from 0-100 real fast to grab you right back in.  Let's take a look at the score breakdown quick to see where we end up.\r\nStory (5/10) - The story honestly wasn't that special.  It isn't anything we haven't seen before, just your standard monster apocalypse type fair.  It didn't fail particularly at anything, but didn't do anything exceptional either; it just served as a familiar spring board for the viewer to get intothe action.  I did really appreciate all the flashback scenes and explanations how how this all came about and the description of the monsters (Aragami?).  It is something this show actually did really well that many other apocalypse shows either ignore or stumble on inelegantly.  It almost makes me want to bump up the story score... almost.  There is one minor quibble I have in the 2nd last episode about Alisa, but the action pulls you along quickly enough that I could ignore it and continue to enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - Hoooooooolllyyyyy shit... is quite frankly the only way I can truly express how ridiculously beautiful the art and animation is for God Eater.  Outside of a few hiccups that are fixed in the blu-rays, the visuals are just absolutely stunning, as is to be expected from Studio Ufotable.  The lighting, the particle/water effects, the characters, the monsters, just absolutely top notch work.  This is the kind of stuff you expect to see out of a movie budget.  Everything was fluid and distinct, even in busy light-show scenes, and the animation really managed to bring things to life.  It made horrifying scenes all the more horrifying and pleasant scenes absolutely delightful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - Another stand-out category for this show.  The OP is great and gets you super pumped, the ED is fantastic closure, and the insert songs in this show were just on a whole other level.  \"Human After All\" might be one of my favourite all time insert songs, and I look forward to the OST release with great enthusiasm.  The Foley in this show was also pretty top notch as well, with just fantastic sound effects permeating every scene without overbearing the voice work, which itself was also exceptional.  Really, really top notch sound work.  An absolute joy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) - Most of the characters, like the story, are kind of your standard archetypes.  You have the strong-silent Soma, the impulsive and heroic Lenka, the psychologically traumatized girl that tries to hide her emotions, etc. Part of the problem this show had is that a lot of the character development came in the latter half of the show, with one notable exception.  So you spent a good 1/2 of the show just thinking everyone is a stoic champion cut-out.  By the time all the character complexity came up, you were nearly at the climax already.  If it wasn't for this fact, I could have easily given it a higher score, as the characters themselves are quite interesting.  That being said, there are a couple stand out character moments in the show.  I won't spoil them here as they are important to the story, but they are moments where the character development is leagues above what you'd expect from it, moments that earnestly brought tears to my eyes, so that raises the score a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) - This is a hard one because early on (the first 3-4 episodes) the show wasn't very engaging.  It was just kind of laying the world-building ground work and introducing a large cast.  Once it hit episodes 4/5 though, it really took off at a frantic pace that didn't stop right up until the end.  Thankfully the gamble paid off and the latter 2/3 of the show became very, very enjoyable for me.  Despite all the archetypal characters and standard storyline, the direction was solid enough that it was still very fun to watch, and obviously the top tier animation/music helped prop it up a little bit as well.  Nonetheless, it was a quite fun bombastic action series with the occasional fantastic character scene.  I also have to give credit to the show for going darker and grittier and punishing characters for their mistakes.  Yeah, there was still plot armour, but the characters still suffered when they fucked up, and they suffered badly (I wish I could bold/italicize \"badly\" here, some of it it was frankly horrifying).  It really gave a lot more weight to their actions and made such a standard apocalyptic story more easy to suspend disbelief for and pull you in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater is a really interesting show.  It face a lot of hurdles throughout its run from the production delays attempting a whole new and beautiful animation style.  This probably lost a lot of viewers and quite frankly hurt the show rather badly due to the fact that some of its best work was presented in the remaining 4 episodes a full season after the original run began.  It also has some problems with its story/characters.  It is an adaptation of a game with a self-insert protagonist you play with zero background story, so expecting miracles from the story and characters isn't going to serve you well.  Honestly though, they did a fairly good job coming up with a proper background story for Lenka, one with meaning behind it.  It is worth a watch, if for nothing else other than the breathtaking animation and spine-tingling music.  The characters eventually do become interesting by the end, and it really lifts the show out of how mediocre it could have been and breathes life into the story.  If you want a super deep story and unique, multifaceted characters, God Eater wont be your thing, but if you just want a dark and gritty action show romp with best-in-industry aesthetics and the occasional heartfelt moment, then God Eater will be right up your alley.  If you do give it a shot, I really suggest sticking around until at least episode 5 before deciding on whether or not to keep going.",

            "content": "God Eater is like spoiled milk. It doesn't get any better with age. Now that this show is over, we can all breathe a sigh of relief when we clean that proverbial spot out of the refrigerator (our anime lists) that the fermenting cow squeezins are in the trash, and gone far far away from us. \r\nAt this point in time, I think most people have blissfully forgotten about God Eater, so I'm going to dig this rotting corpse up out of its shallow grave and run it over with a dumptruck again. \r\nYou tell me what's worse: a ripoff of an classic, or aripoff of an extremely successful ripoff of an old classic?\\n\r\nI'll tell you what's worst still: a terrible ripoff of a ripoff of an old classic that shamelessly TRIES to be something new, but sticks to the conventions of its hack fraud origins, to its own failure.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what we call God Eater. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this show is so bad that they halted it halfway through its run due to internal issues and poor reception- the rest aired more than 6 months later to a quiet death. I doubt anyone watched it then, either. Maybe besides me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7 \\n\\n\r\nI think most people (myself included) started this show because of interest in the company that produced it: ufotable. They're pretty well synonymous with \"maximal animation budget\", but Fate this is not. \\n\r\nI do have to hand it to them for being different though. The art style looks like oil on canvas, then on top of very stylized and crisp backgrounds. Kind of like David Production's Jojo, but less comic book-like. A lot of people were expecting a Fate UBW level/ultrarealism looking, and were disappointed, but I was impressed with their choice to do something different.\\n\\n\r\nHowever... this is the only strength of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 1\\n\\n\r\nThese cast members should be straight ashamed of themselves. Talk about phoning it in... this is a Central Park Media level BAD performance. Ultra generic angsty teen yelling and the absolute most bored sounding adults permeate this trash. In fact, it would have been better as a silent series, because then I wouldn't feel like my ear drums were being put into a wood chipper. Either that, or just play the Benny Hill Theme throughout the entire show, to accentuate how stupid it is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: -10\\n\\n\r\nAnyone with two brain cells to rub together can tell you that God Eater is copying Attack On Titan. If I tell you \"humanity lives inside a city with very tall walls, and are constantly under attack by monsters. They're defended by a group of people who aren't equipped to fight this massive threat. They suffer loss after loss, a lot of people die, and it seems hopeless, until a hero with new powers emerges and is able to fight back.\" \\n\\n\r\nWhat do you immediately think of? \\n\\n\r\nMoving on. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the show is actually complete- here's what happens:\\n\\n\r\nNothing. It's nothing a but a mindless action vomit featuring overpowered, but conveniently weak at inopportune moments characters falling into the same traps every single episode. The \"story\" just serves as an excuse to put tits and teen angst on display with comically superpowered characters.This is undiluted, brainless schlock and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nStandard issue whiny, angst ridden, shonen protag and oversexualized Female companion who suffers mental breakdowns for half the show and turns into a sniveling pile of useless crap, and should have just died, but alas, twas not to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is a ragtag group of apathetic losers. One super cool dude who smokes in every scene, because he has to show you how little he cares by smoking all the time, as everyone knows smoker characters are apathetic edgemasters. One is a \"dark mysterious edgy past\" character, and the other is total yawner of a woman, not even interesting enough for me to make a description of how boring she is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 3\\n\\n\r\nSince I gave the story a -10, the actual score is 0.6. Scoring it as low as possible with a 1 gives me a rating of 3. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was actively offensive on many levels. The one scene I can clearly recall from the show, as I've scrubbed the rest of them from my memory, went like this: \\n\\n\r\nProtag and useless blubbering female go running around in circles trying to evade the monsters after they lose their weapons, since the chick decided to break down in the middle of a fight and refuse to keep living (should have left her to get eaten, tbh.). They are shown in a montage literally running up and down hills and around buildings, with this ultra dramatic music in the background. It was the most cringeworthy thing I have seen in a long time, and the only reason why anything about this show was memorable, just for how bad this was. \\n\\n\r\nI would encourage everyone who knows what I'm talking about to go back and mute the episode at that point, then play the Benny Hill theme on top of it and tell me it doesn't match up perfectly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those who'd argue about my claim of Attack on Titan coming first:\\n\r\nIt's debatable which actually came first, God Eater Burst, the video game on which this anime was based, or Attack on Titan, as both came out at around the same time. AOT premiered in September of 2009, and God Eater Burst appeared in February of 2010. Naturally, games have development periods of generally at least a year, but novels and series have to have time to be written as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut, we're going to call this anime a rip, because AOT came out 3 years ago, and this is 2016, Bob Saget! \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, come rage at me, or leave nice comments. I don't care.\\n",

            "content": "Ever wanted to go to an anime fantasy world and see what it\u2019s like? Maybe that thought should be put on-hold for a show like God Eater. In this series, it\u2019s a world that most people probably wouldn\u2019t want to visit. Why? Because it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where mysterious monsters known as the Aragami exists and they aren\u2019t exactly there to make friends with humans. \r\nBased on a video game, God Eater strikes to me as a peculiar series that really needed to hook the audience. The type of hook should be something that would keep the audience at the edge oftheir seat. But what does it really accomplish? A rather messy start that doesn\u2019t exactly leave strong impressions. In essence, God Eater (based on the game, God Eater Burst) is more about the action and less about constructive storytelling on most parts. \\n\\n\r\nConsisting of 13 episodes, the series seemingly has promise in the beginning. Despite not being very original in its premise, it still has a way to be unique. In the beginning, we have Utsugi Lenka, a man who is part of the Fenrir, a group dedicated to fighting the Aragami. Among his group, there are also others with reasons to fight beyond just survival. Furthermore, the show makes it clear that in order to fight against Aragami, they would need special weapons. As such, God Arcs are created that are made from the cells of the Aragami. They are weapons, each unique in design and powers, to fight against them. Basically, this sets the story in motion with the war between humans and Aragami. \\n\\n\r\nNow, God Eater\u2019s characters are somewhat diverse. We got guys like Lindow who has leadership skills, Alisha with her repulsive yet secluded nature, the brains of the team like Sakuya, or powerhouse fighter Souma Schickal. Whatever the case, the main characters are all banded together with a common purpose \u2013 to destroy the Aragami. What some people may not realize is why they are fighting until the story unravels more about more about their past. And to be quite honest, it\u2019s not really that special to look at. Or rather, it\u2019s tragic with cases like Lenka and Alisha. So much so, the show often highlights their emotions on the battlefield when confronted with Aragami. Does this type of storytelling really work? In some ways yes, but other ways feels less welcoming. It also gives a very Attack on Titanish feel if you make a parallel comparison. But God Eater isn\u2019t Attack on Titan. It\u2019s more about surviving because the Aragami has already destroyed much of the world. \\n\\n\r\nI have not played the original game before but the story to me feels flat. Yes, it does have some nice buildup but the pacing itself feels strange. The Aragami are also too one dimensional as antagonists with lack of characterization. The main characters and their relationships are hardly worth noteworthy either. Lenka is the type of guy that seems to do what he wants even if it puts himself or others at risk. The first few episodes establishes this when he nearly gets himself killed. Throughout the show, Lenka forges some relationships with others but most of them seems to go nowhere. His relationship with Alisha seems rocky while on a professional level, Sakuya and Lindow seems to see him more like a rookie. His relationship with others does improve a bit later though. In the meantime, the series also makes it clear that there\u2019s no room for lighthearted episodes. It\u2019s filled with utter despair and as such, expect more of emotional drama more than anything else. Romance isn\u2019t something that will ever bloom either considering circumstances in their world. Instead, it feels like the main cast are more like an awkward family that slowly and slowly feels a connection with one another. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the generic storytelling, God Eater does a decent job to make sure crucial plot holes are filled. These include the essence of the Aragami, the experimental plans from behind the scenes, or character pasts that shapes who they are in the present. Furthermore, the show has some pretty neat action combined with a stellar soundtrack. It makes the show feel credible when we see how they fight the Aragami in this apocalyptic world, a place that seems to be almost extinct of life. The world fiction in God Eater may also not feel very intriguing but it stays true to the premise, being that it\u2019s desolate and easily gives the feel of a moody story. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical art style of God Eater is very ufotable-like with their style. Most of the character designs and Aragami are crafted with CGI animation. In addition, the action is fused with a lot of violence to illustrate the dark horrors of their world. However, I do have to say that it\u2019s easy to get used to. Furthermore, the God Arcs has a distinctive look that makes them look diverse. In essence, artwork for God Eater has an intense feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is even more intense once you get attached to the style of this God Eater adaptation. Theme song performances has a variety of style that blends between moody, charismatic, and intensified by the action. Furthermore, I think the character voice mannerism deserves some praise especially with how they adapt with such a tragic world. In retrospect, characters shows the desire of their fighting spirit through their voice mannerism in the face of danger. Or at times, there\u2019s also fear that is expressed by the talent of the voices.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater is really a hit or miss show. It starts off with the tragic feeling of a dark story, transits into the fight for survival, and then littered with emotions. The show capitalizes on creating a tragic feel by background storytelling and some characterization. But for all it\u2019s worth, the show itself feels more like a game rather than anime. The action, while stellar, is mere popcorn entertainment. Furthermore, the series constructs its story with weird pacing. So in retrospect, take the show as a grain of salt for what it is. Because in the end, God Eater isn\u2019t that special.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*SOME SPOILERS FOR GOD EATER*\r\nWhew. I'm glad I wasn't there during the massive delays...\r\nAh, God Eater. An anime adaptation of a video game. I haven't played the game, but from what I've gathered, it didn't recover much criticism in terms of being an adaptation as much as being a story. Ufotable's attempt at a 3D mixed with 2D action anime, and an interesting beast (intentional joke) if I do say so myself. What originally started back in the Summer of 2015 kept getting delays that lasted until episode 9 in the Fall season, before announcing a delay so big, it only finished airing this season(Spring 2016). Well, was it worth the delay, or did it get devoured by the fangs of failure? Let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAn unspecifically long time ago, three scientists discovered a type of cell that caused small phenomena. Soon, an outbreak would occur involving new beasts seemingly intent on wiping out mankind, nature, and effectively, all known life, before eliminating itself and Earth, causing everything to reset. A few years later, after some backstory, Lenka arrives at Fenrir as a God Eater. A person filled with genes that allow usage of living weapons designed to counter this new species knows as the Aragami. These God Eaters are trained to venture out into the outer territories of the wall (and outside maybe) in order to counter these invading threats that bring mankind to near extinction. If this sounds similar to Attack on Titan, then good. You've caught on.  Also, I like how they try to interweave the present to the past that gets relevant to the situations at hand, even if there are some notable problems regarding the sanity of Fenrir despite them normally being portrayed as solace only the gifted are allowed to make it into. Also, I like how they portray how harsh the reality of only certain types of individuals being able for combat aka a decent mean of living and survival as intermission between fights can be. Unfortunately, towards the end, they try to amp up the weapons in ridiculous fashion and handwave why they should, only to fail at making a compelling finale, and when the true antagonists get revealed, they lack a decent motivation for their messed up plans. The story is nothing special, but with the final episode, the scenarios that should've killed the main protagonist but somehow didn't, how certain things involving the weapons were allowed to happen starting with episode 7, and how little finality the ending had by only resolving one minor issue and completely sequel baiting with nothing to get truly hyped about, the story doesn't hold up all that well, like at all. Plus, there were at least two moments where the main lead should've died or at least have been rendered useless for a long period of time, but somehow were toughed out simply due to him being a main lead.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLeanka is a decent protagonist with a level headed, kind yet somewhat reckless, and kill them all/protect everyone mentality. Unfortunately, the show DOES put him in situations where he either should have died, or shouldn't have had much repercussion. His backstory wasn't all that impressive aside from the last 4 minutes of it, and he never really develops. Nobody does. With such a short runtime, we can only flesh some of them out, like with Alisa and her traumatizing backstory and Soma with his sad and honestly unfortunate life, even if both of them start off unkind. The other God Eaters are handled alright, even without being fleshed out or developed much. The researchers were nicely done, up until we realize that one of them, namely Johannes, is the true antagonist of the series with no good reason. Even still, our God Eaters were overall pleasant, like with Alisa's past catching up to her in brutally realistic fashion, or Rindou being a charismatic and badass leader with a good eye for suspicion and a positive effect on Leanka's backstory at one point. Basically, they're all underdeveloped but all around, relatively decent.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle Ufotable did was exemplary given the unique artstyle, even with some minor oddities here and there. The artstyle for the characters, backgrounds, God Arc weapons, and attacks are incredible, especially given the fact that they are different that Uoftable normally does with say, the Fate/ series. The weapons look pretty slick though. Most of the fights were well done too, even if the final fight and one of the moments in episode 3 got incomprehensible at points.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Aragami end up holding it back from a high 9 or low 10. These monsters were entirely CG and they weren't integrated all that well. Some of the designs are downright terrible. Who thought that a mutated Jango Fett's Slave 1 was a good idea? It's a shame that they weren't as good as everything else in the show's art department, since that aside, this series looks exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10*\\n\\n\r\n*SUBJECT TO CHANGE IF A DUB COMES OUT*\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is rather cool and fitting for such a harsh world like God Eater. It's definitely a rockin' and catchy track too. The ED, I'd rather plain and weak. The track called Human After All by GHOST ORACLE DRIVE is a nice emotional piece, even if it is the only track in God Eater that's truly worth remembering. A lot of songs were done with auto tune vocalist, and don't really stand out or sound that good to be honest. Auto tune isn't one type of music I enjoy, with a few exceptions, like say, Paresyte OP. The rest of the OST was merely decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis may not have been a truly great or spectacular series, but it was an enjoyable one nonetheless. The action was mostly solid, and the visuals of the characters and weapons were a big factor in that. The last 4 moments of episode 10 aka the end of Leanka's backstory mixed with a good montage of inspiration for his confirmation of his decision, were also satisfying. Overall, I found it to be a solidly fun time, and the first two episodes in particular made me have some good hope for the series, even if it didn't entirely fulfill them.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10    RAW SCORE: 64/100\\n\\n\r\nOverall, God Eater was a decent action show with a nice artstyle, some ok leads, and some nice moments of somberness and fleshing out. However, the CG usage for the Aragami, and the final episode, as well as the other problems mentioned above, cut it far too short of being  all that good. If you want some decent action with a sleek art style and don't require a whole lot else, then this is a great show for you. However, for those who want that extra mile, this may not be all that satisfying. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "This review will contain minor spoilers since I can't fully discuss some characters without mentioning certain things about them. \r\nAs somebody who played the God Eater game, I was very excited when it got an anime adaption. I had always felt that the story would translate very well to an anime and that the Aragami fights would be really fun to watch animated. So, was this the masterpiece that I hoped for or was it the disaster that I feared? Well, it was somewhere in the middle. There was more good than bad actually, but because of my disappointment with the show compared to myexpectations, I'll start with the bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with God Eater is Lenka. Let's make it clear from the start that I feel Lenka single-handedly knocked a couple of points off of the show's rating. The original game did not have a true protagonist. The protagonist was simply a player-created avatar that served one purpose: give the player someone to play as alongside the rest of the characters. Ufotable's decision to create a true protagonist would not have been quite as bad had they not made Lenka so boring. He's bland. He's an Eren clone. He has no personality. His seiyuu is very uninteresting to listen to. He gets inexplicably stronger as the show goes on as well rises through the ranks for seemingly no reason. He was just a bad decision all around. Ufotable would have been much better served just rolling with a collective group of characters (Lindow, Soma, Kota, Alisa, and Sakuya) all being co-protagonists if Lenka was the best they could do for creating their own protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of those other characters, none of them were properly developed in the anime. Lenka steals way too much screen time (and largely boring screen time at that- though I did like his flashback episode quite a bit) from them. \\n\r\nSoma is one of the most complex characters in the game. He's unpleasant up front and doesn't like working with others, but he has a real soft side to him. The reason he doesn't working with others is that they so often die and he's tired of it. On top of that, the guy is part Aragami. The anime touches on his past only a little bit, and doesn't give him nearly the screen time he gets in the game. A lot of this is due to a certain character not being introduced in the anime much to the dismay of fans of the game as she is a very important character. She was essentially responsible for about 70% of Soma's character development, which explains why he feels like such an unfinished product in the anime. It was hinted at during the last couple of minutes though that this character may be introduced in season 2 if there ever is one, so maybe that will happen hopefully. \\n\r\nAlisa is also very complex but her development is rushed way too fast. She has pretty bad PTSD, and they do a good job covering that intially, but how the PTSD affects episodes 9 and onward was not handled correctly at all. She deserved to be fleshed out more but it just didn't happen. It felt like they focused too much on the PTSD itself instead of the consequences of it. Sure, they hammered home the point that she's basically crazy, but nothing too bad really happens because of it. It pretty much got swept under the rug in the last few episodes when it should not have.\\n\r\nSakuya and Kota are nothing special, and they weren't handled too improperly. I feel they did the best job with Kota out of all the characters. He got a lot of screen time and they did a good job with his character overall. Sakuya could have been more developed (they barely touched on her past with Lindow), but she is a pretty bland character to begin with so no big complaints. \\n\r\nLindow was actually handled very well, so I won't write a lot about him. He got the most screen time next to Lenka so it was hard to mess him up. \\n\\n\r\nThe story for the God Eater game is also very good, with 2 main \"halves\" to it. The anime only covers about 25% of the game in total- or half of the first half if that redundancy doesn't bother you. I'm not going to bitch about them not adapting the entire story because I understand that wasn't possible in 13 episodes. Still, I would have liked for them to handle what they did adapt better. It seemed like the major plot points were either rushed or dragged out- there was no middle ground really. I was very happy with the way that episode 13 ended though as there were multiple hints at the rest of the game's story. Who knows whether it will eventually be adapted, but it was satisfying to see them acknowledge the later events and lay the groundwork for a possible second season. \\n\\n\r\nFor all my bitching about Lenka and how he took so much important screen time away from the rest of the show, it overall was not bad. The story was still solid overall even though they could have done a  better job. The flashbacks featuring Johannes and Paylor were a welcome addition that the game did not feature. They were overused, but they served the purpose of providing background for the creation of the Aragami. They didn't do a very good job of explaining exactly what God Eaters are and what their powers are, but they made up for it by giving an excellent backstory for the Aragami apocalypse. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also extremely fluid and makes the fights more entertaining. Overall, the fights were disappointing simply because they weren't quite as action-packed as expected. Maybe it's just my personal bias as someone who played the game but the Aragami just went down way too easily most of the time. But even though the fights were underwhelming, they were nicely animated at least. The art is also not bad, although I feel it is unnecessary. Ufotable did the prologue OVA for the game as well as all cinematic cutscenes in the game, and they looked just fine. There was no reason to use such a unique and somewhat lazy art style when they had animated the title before with a much cleaner-looking art style. The character designs suffered the most from this. It looks good overall (especially the environments which look great) but it had its problems. Also, I didn't think the CGI Aragami looked too great either but they weren't terrible. People who are not fans of CGI will likely be put off by the Aragami though. \\n\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack overall. It was very nice to hear songs from the game like \"Of God and Man\" during flashbacks and \"No Way Back\" during the final episode. It's a shame that \"Over the Clouds\" couldn't be used as that is the iconic song of the game, but the rest of the soundtrack was good enough to make up for it. The voice-acting cast is also stellar with the exception of Lenka. Lindow especially stood above the rest with Soma a close second despite his lack of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I was disappointed overall with the anime adaption, it was still an enjoyable watch. Though a lot of the game is still left not adapted and the characters were underdeveloped compared to in the game, it was still a solid 7. It would have been an 8 without Lenka, but he simply stole too much screen time from the rest of the characters as well as the overall plot. I'll say it again; the game had no \"true\" protagonist outside of a player-created avatar. Ufotable messed up trying to create a protagonist for the anime series. Other than that it was solid and I'm honestly just happy that it did indeed get an anime adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 5. The roster is actually pretty good but too many of the characters were left underdeveloped and thus hurt the score. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. I still enjoyed it despite the fact it did not live up to my expectations. Fun to watch for anyone who is an action or post-apocalyptic fan.\\n\r\nOverall: 7.\\n\\n\r\n If a second season ever occurs, I feel it will be much better. I doubt it will happen though after they had so much trouble with the first season.",

            "content": "God Eater Review\r\nStory (6/10) Fair\r\nThe story for God Eater is simple so I wasn't expecting to much and so what I was given was around what I was expecting. In an anime era where this story plot of humans at the brink of extinction and having to fight some sort of enemy creature to survive can be considered over saturated to say the least, God Eater can be seen as one that didn't necessarily hold a candle when it came to other story elements hidden within it the plot they we were given. Granted introduced a character not even in the video it was adaptingfrom, made him the protagonist and even gave him a back story along with a few others, this is what's keeping it above a 5 to me everything else like the creation of the gods trying to kill them and their purpose to me felt little bit too generic and felt it was the weakest parts of God Eater. I feel it was trying to be deeper than it was suppose and it failed to when it came to that execution, this is obviously my opinion and maybe I'm just to stupid to understand any other deeper meaning to the plot by the time it concluded so if that's the case shame on me.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good \\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nThe Art style when first shown off I wasn't necessarily a fan of especially when you see the art style of how the prologue looks and the character art style of the character when play the video game looks in comparison to this? They went with this shadow cell shading effect on almost everything in the anime when made it look worse in comparison to what I previous know of. The colors that are used on everything also have this water paint style to it that makes a lot of colors too kind of dirty and dead. And what could say \"oh well this type of anime is quite blood and dark so the dirty/dead look would fit it perfectly\" sure you could say that but I personally prefer what it looked like in the prologue anime. As far as the animation it was the saving point when it came to this section especially the last few episodes it really brought the house down (in a good way). The CG on the god enemies and other small items could have been down without but it didn't entirely ruin it for me. So this section could have gotten a 9 or maybe even a 10 if there was less CG and the art style stuck to what the prologue had which resembles the art style at most of Ufotable's previous anime look like.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM, JP Voice acting, opening and ending were all very good nothing mind blowing or memorable (expect the opening). \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in God Eater were good for the most part. For 13 episodes it tries to make you care about the characters that it presents (obviously more than other like any other anime) and the ones that they do focus on for characterization and character development purposes all are good. The backstory for the MC and Alisa are good and are focused on the most. The only thing that has me a bit confused what the character death for *spoiler*. I wasn't expecting that only because I thought that specific character was important to the actually game and they would leave him/her alive. I actually was waiting for *spoiler* to die honestly because he/she isn't present in the video game so a death to him/her would have made more sense but I guess this anime is set in a alternate timeline or maybe *spoiler* does die in the video game I didn't finish God Eater 1 so I wouldn't know. (I'll see if he/she dies when I play the resurrection version later this year...)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for episode 1 and 2 were sitting at about a 9, I was hyped for the anime. Then as it went on and they started talking about instead of fighting my enjoyment for the story that I didn't really care too much about dropped to around a 8, 7 and 6 which was around episode 3-9. There were a few scenes during episodes 3-9 that were great but far FAR in between to the point where I was behind a few episodes and had to binge some because I didn't feel it was worth keeping up with weekly at a certain point. And the the anime when on a season hiatus. This left everyone with quite the blue balls, but when it came back for those last few episodes made my enjoyment every episode when up. From a 6 to a 7 and from a 7 to an 8. So it was definitely a roller coaster when it came to this one, those last couple episodes definitely saved it to some extent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.60/10) Good+\\n\\n\r\nDid God Eater live up to the hype? Fuck no, but was it a bad anime? Nahh it was good but I think my hype was far too high because I love the game that much so it's technically my own fault especially since by the time this anime was announced Ufotable was wrapping up Fate Stay Night UBW was I really enjoyed so my reasons are justified to some extent but I really should have expected as much as I want out of this adaptation it is based off a monster clone video to and majority of video game adaptations aren't done too well. But I think this one was not as bad as people say it is. The hype definitely killed it though especially after being right after UBW which is why I feel people who have absolutely little to no knowledge at all of the video game was even more disappointed and less forgiving than the ones that do (that's if they didn't like it that is because I do know a small hand full of people that have no knowledge of the game and they liked it but it's a SMALL group). Nothing more can be said about God Eater the adaptation I feel was a good one and can be recommended to people that have knowledge of the game but for anyone else (especially if you've watched anime in this genre like Attack on Titan or Owari No Seraph) I wouldn't highly recommended it.",

It didn't prove me wrong, as this anime is filled with flawed logic in almost every episode.  It's difficult to even get into the all the massive logic gaps, without spoiling things.  So, careful as there will be a few spoilers. \r\nA character goes from being a complete rookie flopping all over the place, to not justan ace combatant literally a few days later with no training, but goes on to lead an entire international offensive within the next week or two.  What army would give a rookie control over an entire military offensive that the fate of the human race rests upon? \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of commander would totally jeopardize this mission just to send an entire squad to go save one person?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of ridiculous situation allows someone to be able to survive being gutted, impaled, fall from hundreds of feet in the air from a cliff and then again only hours later from the 10th story of a building and live?  \\n\\n\r\nWhy wouldn't you just let Pita kill the Vajra and then jump in to fight at the end?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat was the point of brainwashing someone only for it to wear off when someone yells at them once?\\n\\n\r\nWhy the hell do killer animals keep letting the heroes live while they kill every other human instantly?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell happened to the giant dragon thing? Don't show a gigantic dragon and then NEVER SHOW IT AGAIN.  That was irritating. \\n\\n\r\nHow does a guy get a brand new weapon and INSTANTLY knows how to use it, what it does, and becomes a more beastly fighter than anyone else in the anime?  The weapon had like 5 forms, and he knew how to masterfully use every single form.  Are you kidding?   \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the characters.  You had the stoic MC whose entire dialogue for the series probably had less words than this review.  You had the useless sidekick buddy, Kota, who suddenly becomes a ninja shooter within 2 fights after he was tripping over his own two feet.  Then you have Alisha, the most useless, irritating character I've seen since Renge from Air Master.  And the really irritating part about it is that at the beginning she looked like she was going to be a beast.  But she turned into a weak, whiny, character who caused WAY more harm than she did good.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only two redeemable characters from this anime were Lindou and the Black Vajra, Pita.  Yes, the killer animal, that never said a word, was probably the best part of the anime.  I will give them that, it was really cool.  I wish it was a villain in another, better, anime.   But, that was it.  The logic was spotty, the characters were annoying, and it had some serious pre-occupation with trying to get people to not pray to God.  I mean, seriously, was this a hidden recruitment video for the Church of Satan or something?  We get it.  They're mad at God for the state of the world.  Okay. The horse is dead.  Stop kicking already.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was the equivalent of a blonde bimbo.  Very good looking, but very stupid once it starts trying to convey ideas.  \\n\\n\r\nYou can skip this one.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nThis is only not a straight 1 fest because of the Black Vajra.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nAnime based on video games don't usually work out. Recent examples would be Blade & Soul and Gunslinger Stratos. God Eater is based on a PSP game, yet it had a lot of hype surrounding it. Mostly because it was being animated by Ufotable. \r\nWhen the pilot finally aired, most people were disappointed. I wasn't, because I didn't have any expectations in the first place.\r\nStory: It's hard not to compare this anime to Shingeki no Kyojin. In 2070, humans live in a city surrounded by walls to protect them from monsters called Aragami. The people that kill Aragami are called God Eaters.God Eaters wield living weapons called God Arcs. Which are made from the same Oracle cells that the Aragami evolved from.\\n\r\nIf the Aragami are supposed to be scary, they do a terrible job of it. They look like Disney Monsters with beards. Titans are way scarier. \\n\r\nThe main character is Utsugi Lenka, who is a new-type. Only a select few are able to wield the new-type god arcs. This is basically their way of calling him 'the chosen one'. As usual he's a reckless idiot that is hell bent on destroying all Aragami. Why does that sound familiar?\\n\r\nIn episode 3, they introduce another new-type. I will get to her clothes later. To show how cool she is, they have her fight Aragami on a plane. I love how she jumps off the plane, with no fear of falling, kills the Aragami and just magically ends up on the plane again. Because Fuck Gravity.\\n\r\nIn episode 5, their expedition didn't go quite as planned. They went to destroy a type of Aragami called Vajra. But the strongest Vajra out there killed all the other Vajra and then went for the humans. Why is this Vajra so strong? Because he's black.\\n\r\nUnlike in SnK, we know the origin of the Aragami. They were created by humans. The leader of the project is now the director of Far East Branch. So that asshole creates these monsters. He then sits comfortably in a safe place, while innocent humans die outside the walls. This would be okay if he allowed said human to enter the safe city. But NO, only humans that can wield god arcs or their families are allowed. Isn't that convenient you sad excuse for a human being. \\n\r\nAt some points they introduce minor characters and kill them off almost instantly and expect us to feel bad. I did cry, but only because I was wasting my life watching this trash. If you want a better plot, go watch hentai.\\n\\n\r\nArt: First the character designs- The faces of the characters themselves aren't badly designed. But their clothes are something else. The main character wears a short jacket that looks suspiciously similar to what the survey corps wear. The wimpy classmate wears clothes that prove how lame he is. The women, specifically Alisa, wear clothes that are impractical. They cover only half their body. There is no way those clothes would help in a fight. The only reason for this is F A N S E R V I C E. Not even good fanservice.\\n\r\nNext the animation- This was the part everyone looked forward to. Ufotable just finished FSN: Unlimited Blade Works. The best part of that was the animation. If God eater was animated like that, maybe I would actually enjoy it a bit. But It isn't, instead they decided to use 3D animation. It's not as bad as the 3D we usually see. It's definitely done better, but I personally didn't like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the Opening and the Ending are forgettable. The Voice acting though is the only decent thing about this anime. Hirata Hiraoki is excellent as Lindow. Maaya Sakomoto and Nakai kazuya do a good job too. The OST isn't bad either, especially in episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I don't see much character development. None of the characters are well written. The main character is just like Eren, except I actually gave a shit about Eren. Lindow is pretty cool. Not as cool as Levi but still cool. The female characters are all terribly written. I don't think the writers have ever actually met a female human being.\\n\\n\r\nWell I'm dropping this.\\n\r\ninb4 \"It gets better!\"\\n\r\nIt know it doesn't.\\n\r\nThis anime is literally a meme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Barely 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\r\nThe weapons bleed when they're cut in half.\\n\r\nIt's only 13 episodes long and not 25.\\n\r\nRacism\\n\r\nSome decent voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCons: Everything else\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Only watch this if you hate yourself.\\n\r\nDon't waste your time/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nGod Eater is the kind of show that is slow for a few episodes but then goes 0-100 really fast.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nGod Eater is a show that follows the actions of a young man living and fighting in a post-apocalyptic war where mysterious monsters known as Aragami are devouring everything on the face of the Earth, pushing humanity towards extinction with each day that passes. Even though the story is not very original it does have unique features and the action is just so intense that you need to take a 5 min. break from time to time.\r\nI really did appreciate the flashback scenes and explanationsof the Aragami and how everything ended up the way it did. I liked the fact that these Aragami are not mindless, they have the potential to achieve intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters are generic but it is not as bad as it may seem, some of them are intriguing.\\n\r\nThe protagonist is the heroic and impulsive Lenka. I liked Lenka\u2019s personality, he is not all that generic, and I am surprised of how good his backstory is. I also liked the relation between Rindou and Lenka, he is a role model and a good friend to Lenka. Overall, Lenka is a good protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is godly, it is ridiculously beautiful. The visuals of God Eater are absolutely stunning,  as it is to be expected from Studio Ufotable. At first the animation felt weird but as soon as my eyes got adjusted I saw the beauty of it. \\n\r\nEverything was smooth, even when the screen was overloaded with light, blood, flowing water, rain, thunder strikes, etc. the animation was fluid and it really managed to bring things to life.\\n\r\nTop quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe opening theme is great, it gets you hyped up and ready for what is to come. The ending theme is good as well. \\n\r\nWhat I was surprised by is the blood-pumping background music as well as the fantastic sound effects infusing every scene without ever overlapping with the voice work. \\n\r\nTop quality sound.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe great animation/sound combined with intense action, fantastic fight scenes, pretty cool MC and decent plot  got me hyped up and made the show a really fun time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.6/10\\n\r\nGreat animation, sound and action with decent plot and characters. Just get through the first 3 episodes and watch the series in one go. I recommend this show to everyone, it is one of the best series of 2015.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who played the original God Eater PSP game I approve of this anime.\r\nStory 6/10: Story is pretty mediocre, if you've played the game you roughly know what is going on. Sadly, the anime doesn't follow the PSP story. The good thing is this anime gives you a deeper insight of the God Eater apocalyptic universe and how non-God Eater people live, it also provides flashbacks that show the origin of Aragami and how the world came to shit. (And also why those buildings have giant holes in them. Hint: It wasn't a laser beam). Other than that, there's not much else I canpraise about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Ufotable. Thats all I can say\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Again, Ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: This is a treat for those who played the original PSP game. Because in the original game you make your own main character so I can't say I was looking forward to the idea of Lenka. But the anime gives us insight of some but not all the characters origins.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Maybe I set my standards a bit too high after watching Unlimited Blade Works. Was really hoping for some epic God Eater vs God Eater action. But the monster killing is cool too. Sadly most of the main featured monsters are Vajras and Orgetails. And the combat is more realistic compared to the game.(Haha) The show does fill in the blanks on some unanswered questions found in the game mechanics. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: Mediocre story, Great characters stories. Here's to hoping for a season 2.",

            "content": "First review so I apologize if it isn't well done. but damn the initial hate over this series.\r\ntl;dr? Do you have 3 hours to spare? watch it.\r\nStory: What is the story? Humanity is on the verge of death with unbeatable monsters eating everyone. Last hope are God Eaters, beings who have taken into themselves what makes these monsters so special allowing them to fight them. The MC becomes a God Eater and we follow him as he does what he came here to do, kill those monsters. If this sounds kind of like Attack on Titan then you can pretty much say that you arein the right. What i would say is that both stories have great worlds, and characters (of which some die), but what sets this one apart is, in AoT i hated Eren as a main character. But in God Eater, Lenka is a pretty decent lead. He is naive but not stupid, i would almost relate him to Shirou from Fate/Stay Night as a MC. Both are capable, intelligent, but when others are in danger, hindsight goes out the window. This story from the first God Eater game on the PSP originally and mainly only covers 1/3 of the game, the story I would say is good. It isn't as fleshed out as it can be but the concept of what is going on and why is very interesting to me. It's a cool thought and they do enough to make you interested in how this will all turn out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: A series that seems to be rendered in more than the basic few types of colours that conventional anime usually gets rendered in adding to the style. I LOVE the art style in this series because of how much detail and shadow is in every scene, mind blowing. There are times when the animation is at a meh point but the art more than makes up for it and there is no animation section so i won't deduct marks for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was good, nothing amazing but they do the job. On a few scenes the music chosen and the music cue was fantastic, but the lack of, in my opinion, a great OST sets it from going above and beyond. Doesn't stop me from getting that opening though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This may be biased slightly because, from playing the game, i have more fleshed out characters in my head but I will try not to confuse them. Overall the characters were not handled AS well as they could have been and in some instances I look at what some choose to do and go \"...doesn't make much sense but okay.\" However in saying that there are some great key characters and over a 13 episode series they do the job. You will probably only remember 3-5 characters from the cast though and only remember well 2-3 of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bias most likely cause i played the game but this series I LOVED and ENJOYED. I have re-watched it 5 times and those later episodes that are in a class of their own i've rematched countless times. I loved them and enjoyed them fully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's got action, shounen, and some good cheesy lines but that doesn't stop this series from being one that I will absolutely buy the blu-ray of and keep on my hard drive for impulse watching at random points in time. It isn't a masterpiece but it is definitely a guilty pleasure. You don't need to be a masterpiece to be a series i will watch over and over again at later times and this one is definitely just that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a 13 episode series that, overall was enjoyable when watched all together. Initial turn off because they only did 9 episodes in over 1 seasons with a massive gap between those and the last 4 episodes. Leaves a bad taste in peoples mouthes but if you are NOW coming to watch it, absolutely go for it.\\n",

Mainly the MC Utsugi Lenka...\r\nWhen he first showed up, it kinda ticked me off that he was some kind of a hot headed someone that has the grudge to kill all of the Aragami, but it was notable that his personality changed overtime (and he speaks)...\r\nSecond was the unexpected shenanigans...\r\nThe inventivemind of the director kinda shattered my dreams as I watched further and saw the dark side of the Far East Branch (the \"if you are not suited then you cannot enter\" issue), it was not included inside the game or even though it was, it was kept out of the main plot line.\\n\\n\r\nThird was the events...\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes that were all black and white. I know that they want to explain how the Aragami came to be but they did not have to explain it in the middle of a battle... I mean if they made it into a one whole episode it might have been much better or they could have made it like the game... when the MC saw a memory drive on the floor that was dropped by someone (Dr. Sakaki) that contained the story of Soma and the foreshadow of the Aegis plan. but what can I do... huh...\\n\\n\r\nFourth the bullets...\\n\\n\r\nUm... I was not a fan of the guns of the GE but the bullets were kinda special. There is this mechanics of the main game that could customize the bullets that you use when battling the Aragami, though it was a huge part on battling them, it only got a foreshadow and a short glimpse of it's potential at the end ep. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the storyline...\\n\\n\r\nFrom the part when the \"I did not know\" side of the FEB to the part when you know...

            "content": "If God Eater was a person, its face would be pretty but it would be an airhead. It would have a muscular body but not a bit of strength. Its breasts would be big but they couldn't produce any milk. But hey, it looks amazing.\r\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is probably because God Eater managed to somewhat sway me. I'll say this in advance: I don't think God Eater is bad. Not as a whole. I know that a clear majority doesn't share my opinion on this show, and I can totally see why: the story, characters, story and characters. And the story.They are outright terrible, and that's a fact. Then, how is it possible that I actually liked it?\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the first 9 episodes weekly in the summer, I didn't like God Eater at all. It was confusing. The story sucked, the flashbacks didn't make sense and the music annoyed me. After the final 4 episodes aired in the spring, I rewatched the series. This time I got a better grip of the story, the flashbacks made sense, and what's more, the final episodes were pretty good. God Eater wasn't as bad as I thought even though its story and characters are pathetic by all odds.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>STORY - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater in a nutshell: Attack on Titan 3.0. It's about people with superpowers (God Eaters) who fight big ass monsters (Aragami) using big ass weapons (God Arcs) that are made from Aragami cells and are basically the only way to kill them. A walled city, a determined protagonist, an organization that is tasked with killing the baddies. There is nothing original in the story of God Eater. I'm not saying it copied AoT (because it didn't) but there are many, many other series with similar premises. The plot of some of the episodes is cliche in too many ways as well, and some developments in the story are absolutely ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe flashbacks are boring, yes, but I felt intrigued when I knew the whole story of Johannes, Aisha and Paylor in the final episode. Their actions made sense now, and the plot twist in the final episode was a very surprising one.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>ART - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisually, this anime is great. It has stunning visuals and cinematics. Some people get orgasms just by hearing the animation studio's name. The art style is original - the characters look like moving oil paintings with lots of details. I'm not sure how they do it but it looks awesome. AND DID YOU SEE THE LANDSCAPES? They're so rugged yet so charming in every situation. I could watch the backdrops all day long whether it's dusk, sunsets, skyscapes or rainy and gloomy. I liked the gore. There was nothing wrong with the direction, either. Almost everything in God Eater is crisp and clear to look at.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the CGI aragami look pretty ridiculous, especially that scorpion-like creature. The fighting also looks comedic and slow at some points (especially in ep 2) because it's a mix of animated people waving their sticks at the CGI monsters that are doing, uh, whatever they do. The animated and CGI movements don't match, and it doesn't look pretty. Don't get me wrong: the CGI isn't done badly, but it's still CGI. By the way, if you're going to (re)watch God Eater in the close future, try to spot a rather distinguishable animation mistake in episode 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>SOUND - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very good, realistic and modern. The music is beautiful and always fits the mood. There's this band that performs many songs in the OST of God Eater, and even though it took me a while, I realized that hey, this doesn't sound too bad after all. I found another crazy good OST that I could listen to while reading manga or something. The opening song was also very good - it wasn't your typical OP, it was some kind of metalcore, and I couldn't stop listening to it some time ago. The ED was OK. The voice acting was pretty nice as well, it's the characters' lines that were crappy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>CHARACTER - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't one character I liked. They all ****ing suck, god dammit. What were you thinking, Ufotable? Don't you know how to give the characters a personality?\\n\\n\r\nSome of the main characters are way too easy to compare with the characters of AoT. AoT came out in 2013 and the anime adaptation of God Eater two years later, so animewise, God Eater is a copy of AoT. In a certain way, you know.\\n\r\n- Lenka (Eren) is the protagonist of the show, and has vowed to exterminate all the Titagami\\n\r\n- Kota (Armin) is the \"incompetent best friend\"\\n\r\n- Alisa (Mikasa) is the beautiful, skilled and obstinate girl wonder\\n\r\n- Soma (Levi) is the crusty and somewhat unsocial bad boy who is secretly warm-hearted\\n\\n\r\nThere are also characters that fulfill other \"basic\" archetypes: a boobalicious commander, a badass unit leader whose cigarette never burns out and a cute, caring redhead who tries to be of help. Do I even need to say more? Well no, I don't, but I want to.\\n\\n\r\nSocial interactions between the characters. English isn't even my main language, but I still find the dialogue to often be cliche and embarrassing, and it makes me want to roll my eyes. But at least the behavior of the characters is kind of realistic with all their expressionless faces. I guess that's more like a bad thing, though?\\n\\n\r\nMajor Amamiya's boobs are too big and too out. Alisa's underboobs. How does that jacket (it's jacket, right?) even cover her boobs when she's jumping around? And Sakuya's wearing only an apron. Do the boobs fit the mood of this anime? No. Do the boobs fit the the mood of God Eater the game? Possibly. What I mean by this, is that it's a little stupid to make an anime adaptation of an action game. You can't play anime, you can only watch it. That's why many parts of the game don't suit the anime adaptation. I just wish Ufotable made an adaptation of some other series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>ENJOYMENT - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the fighting scenes, backgrounds and the mood whenever the music was playing and the characters weren't talking anything embarrassing. Episodes 2, 7, 8 and 9 were the worst episodes, with some infuriating dialogue or terribly carried out plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (tl;dr)\\n\r\nGod Eater is entertaining when it shows instead of tells. I can totally see why a lot of people don\u2019t like it \u2013 I didn\u2019t like it either, at first. The story barely exists, and the characters and their social interactions make me want to cringe too often. However, the strongest points of God Eater are animation and backgrounds that, along with the sound effects and epic music, made the series satisfying for me. A well-written story and enchanting characters aren\u2019t always a necessity for enjoying a show. God Eater succeeded in being enjoyable in its own way, and it left me wanting more. But still, it IS pretty stupid, like, the show assumes its viewers are complete idiots or something? That kind of disrespectful stupid.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>OVERALL - 6/10 (fine)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I wanted to know what/who that girl-like figure at the end of the final episode was so I spoiled myself a little, and then I spoiled myself a little more. I think a second season could be very interesting. However, I don\u2019t think God Eater was THAT popular in Japan, and I\u2019m a pessimist so it might be unlikely that they\u2019ll make a second season. But then again, we\u2019re talking about Ufotable here, and they don\u2019t obviously care about money so it\u2019s impossible to say just yet.\\n\\n\r\nWhooooh, so, this was my first review! (this seems to be a common thing to say?)... Feedback is much appreciated. Have a fantastic day! And if you just skipped to the end of my review, screw you.",

            "content": "Gods Eater sorta scared me when they went on an extended break in between the seasons. I was pleasantly surprised when it came back. Episode 10 gave me extreme feels. Be prepared to feel the feels everyone no joke. \r\nNow as everyone knows this is a anime based off a game. I played the game very sparingly. I never truly got into it. I thought it was going to be a fairly generic action anime. Until those last three episodes dropped holy crap. Everything just became greater once I watched those. For those who are reading this to get an idea of the anime. Yourlucky you can watch it without breaks. I think I can actually think more fondly now that I see it in its completed state. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters because I'm not great at art and sound stuff. I focus on things I believe i can judge. The characters for the most part are extremely static. We only truly learn the backgrounds of the Lenka and Alisa. The rest are mentioned as we get glimpses about them. Of course we find this world is extremely hard and traumatic.\\n\\n\r\nI believe God Eater is getting itself a season two which I am actually stoked to see. This anime truly surprised me with the last three episodes. I am so ready to see the second season of it.   \\n\\n\r\nIf your a fan of the games your a fan of this. And maybe after watching this anime you'd like to take a chance at the games. \\n",

            "content": "I just happen to read the reviews while updating my anime list and was a bit sad to read some negative reviews, well first of all this anime is not for everyone (isn't every anime like that?). God Eater is not so bad but not so great either, I did enjoy watching it though. This is my first anime review by the way so please bear with me. \r\nGod Eater was an anime adaptation of the PSP game of the same title, while it is called an adaptation the anime does not follow the game story completely which will probably disappoint a few of thepsp game fans, the anime had more events and character backstory that were not in the game which, in my opinion, actually made the anime more worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place after a disaster fell on the whole planet causing the birth of monsters known as aragami killing humans forcing them to hide behind walls, to fight these monsters God Eaters were created, they are special humans that can wield weapons called God Arcs, the only weapon that can deal damage to the aragami. It is a pretty common setting I know but understand that just because the setting is common, doesn't mean that its bad. The characters are pretty well made, even after the changes made in the story you can still feel that its the same chars from the game, character development was a bit lacking though. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is awesome, the fight scenes were really cool and really well made, well its made by ufotable after all, my only problem was that there were a few unnecessary slow-mos. The sound was also good, sound effects were good, the OP and ED song are quite nice, overall sound is not that great but just right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching this anime. If you are a fan of the game then you would surely enjoy this too, its a really well done adaptation. Would also recommend it to people who likes the genre, just keep an open mind and try not to be affected by reviews too much as you watch, just sit back and enjoy.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[This review contains 0% mentions of whats shown in the anime for spoiler sake]\r\n[This review coming from a person who very informed of the God Eater games]\r\nGod Eater is not a video game adaptation, rather a re-telling by ufotable of first quarter of God Eater Resurrection (Aegis Island arc). Doing the opposite of other writers took the franchise to their hands.\r\nLet me clear some stuff first. Other works (mangas and light novels) covering the first game features Yuu Kannagi (or Ryo Kagami, both of them are very kind/nice off the bat) as the main protagonist and very strictly follows the game's events. While the animefeatures a different protagonist; Renka Utsugi, with altered the story presentation/characters introduction/important plot from the game.\\n\\n\r\n==Story==\\n\r\nThe story is very nice... even tho is kinda sad most of the time. Very well constructed, which is a very big surprise from an action-hunting game.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know story more, try get the game. Its available on Vita, PS4 and Steam. For Steam, you get God Eater Resurrection for free when buy God Eater 2 Rage Burst. Dont worry, the PC port is very good and the games are multi-language.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n==Art==\\n\r\nI had to admit, I was really surprised when I saw the first anime trailer. Its really bold and contrast the characters very well. Sometimes, it looks weird at certain angles (as example in episode 2 and 7). The art style closely follows the game's art style, which I really like.\\n\r\nThe CG for the Aragami is quite nice too. Drawing the Aragami moving at high speed is hard.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n==Sound==\\n\r\nAlmost all the musics are from the games and created by Go Shiina (an employee of Bandai Namco Japan). Every tracks fits the situations very well and very hard to get fed up.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n==Character==\\n\r\nEvery characters are very loveable and some can be related. From chill and serious when needed, to kinda edgy and caring deep in heart. A colorful cast of characters.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment==\\n\r\nI enjoyed all 13 episodes, plot set up episodes and actions. The combat shows what God Eaters can really do and how versatile Aragami are.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 9\\n\\n\r\nYou might find it weird that I scored the anime 8 in my anime list page, thats because the anime didnt explain some stuff clearly (like why Oracle Cells being injected into body) and rather make it convoluted for people who are new with the God Eater franchise but the anime shows stuff that wasnt shown in the games. Thumbs up from me.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who deeply in love with the franchise (over 800 hours on the games combined), I find this anime really good and close to my heart.",

            "content": "There is a saying: \"don't judge a book based on its cover.\"  This is a show that I expect was dropped by many because of constant delays and a dull as fuck pilot that was followed up by an even worse second episode.  To be honest, I was one of those people.  I thought the first episode was really dull with confused direction and the second episode had all the trappings of an incredibly generic shounen.  There were also many red flags: video adaptations tend to suck, this anime's purpose at the time seemed to be to function as an uninspiredadvertisement, and lines like \"press this button to fire, press both to rapid fire\" just screams PREVIEW FOR GOD EATER FOR PC!!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after like three episodes aired after 10 weeks or so (probably leaving poor fans screaming at the multiple delays), I decided to give it another shot.  The delays started with episode 4 onward apparently... and it REALLY showed.  Not only did the show get better with each episode, I actually was left curious for a second season in the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters: 6/10 \\n\r\nThis show, similarly to Attack on Titan, does a pretty good job at world building.  There are memento-styled flashbacks that gives context to the world and many episodes are dedicated to show how much humanity struggles in this dark post-apocalyptic world.  These elements are really interesting and helped fleshed out the grim setting.  The numerous locations Ufotable draws also really gives the world an interesting look, feel and scale to it.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother well done aspect of the show, and by far the best thing in the show, is the feeling of helplessness and some gut-punching reveals that unravel.  While the writing is mostly mediocre, a lot of thought that was given to the show was how to present a world full of misery and on the brink of destruction.  There were a couple moments where there would be something achieved, only to be followed by a twist that gives a feeling of helplessness.  The main character, Lenka, encounters many situations like this and has a surprisingly solid arc.  In this cruel underworld, the show attempts to contrast the darkness with themes of hope and \"passing the torch\".  It is in these moments that the show it truly at its best.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about the characters.  These elements, especially in the first half, represent the show at its worst.  The side characters, with the exception of one, are paper thin with very little depth and stale personalities.  I will go through each character briefly:\\n\\n\r\nLenka: By far the best character in the show.  Ironically, I thought he was going to be my least favorite character: looking like a generic Eren clone with rage as his only character coupled with zero logic.  Unlike Eren however,  he grows and learns from his mistakes and experiences REAL consequences. He is the only one in the cast with any depth or character arc worth mentioning, and his backstory is easily the best episode of the entire series.  \\n\\n\r\nAlisa: In contrast to Lenka, she seemed cool initially.... and ended up being easily the worst character in the entire cast.  There is a difference between a SYMPATHETIC portrayal of emotional frailty and making a character seem completely PATHETIC.  From her overly stupid character design, to her tediously repeated backstory, and to her total reliance on others to solve her problems....  I was literally yelling at the scream hoping someone would bitch-slap her.  Oh and her arc was really rushed towards the end.  It was almost as if the writers realized at a certain point that her character wasn't worth spending more time on.\\n\\n\r\nLindow: Bad-ass, likable, and is a character with some actual personality.  He is the only one who has any real chemistry with the protagonist, and the scenes between these two provide some of the most human moments in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters have some characterization here and there, but are mostly unexplored and uninteresting.  Despite some of the positives I mentioned above, you really don't get attached to the GOOD characters until quite late in the show.  This, again, is probably why so many people dropped the show before it finally had characters to root for.  \\n\\n\r\nAudio/visual: 9/10\\n\r\nThe visuals and music are honestly top tier.  Fantastic work all around.  The music is epic and most of the insert songs were surprisingly very fitting. Excellent backgrounds coupled with great animation.  The art style is unique and interesting, and despite the visuals being oddly inconsistent with some CG blending that didn't mesh very well in the early episodes, it is a great looking show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10  \\n\r\nTo me this is an example of a show that came out before it was ready.  Every single aspect of this show got better following the delays, which is especially true of the last four episodes that seemed to finally have a grasp on what works in its favor.  While I don't think of this to be particularly great, I think it is interesting and quite an under-the-radar that deserves a little more attention and less hate than it is getting.  The first three episodes are rough... but once you get past it, the show becomes surprisingly enjoyable with a few gems to show off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (good)",

            "content": "Lenka Utsugi is a new God Eater, and one of humanity's last hopes against the invading Aragami. God Eater follows Lenka as he trains and eventually joins a company of fellow God Eaters. Ufotable has created a thrilling, engaging, and occasionally quite dire story where brave acts are often overshadowed by the grim reality of the task at hand- Aragami are endless creatures, reincarnating from Oracle cells, whereas the surviving human population and their scant resources are fast depleting.\r\nThough it lacks the depth of character of some of Ufotable's other works, this is still a very strong show, especially from a presentation perspective. In termsof story, it reminds me most of Schwarzes Marken; they share a similar sense of desperation of situation and some characters seem to harbor ulterior objectives. If you've enjoyed Ufotable's previous action-based works, this is good enough work to dive into. It may be a new setting but they sure did a good job making it come to life.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nUfotable has an incredibly high bar for animation quality, and that continues in this show. Attention to detail is present everywhere- whether it is the detailing in the clouds or the fast-forward time transition animations, we're talking animated-movie quality stuff here. The detailing is great elsewhere as well; you'll find great shading and realistic reflections off metallic surfaces. The last frame of the OP also blends in perfectly with the beginning of the ED! The setting itself is an interesting yet sad place; the majority of the world has been turned into a barren wasteland, littered with the skeletal remains of humanity's former civilizations. The surviving humans now live tightly-packed in walled off settlements. It's definitely a different environment than the urban feel of the Fate universe. I'd say there's a steam punk kind of feel to both the weaponry and technology in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also drawn in a unique style, though not quite as noticeable as Valkyria Chronicles; outlines on the characters are very thin and/or nonexistent, which often makes hair look more like spikes rather than strands. Character expressions aren't the strong suit in this show, though I don't blame them too much given their situation; I do find it a bit odd that they have so many opportunities to stop mid battle and strike a cool pose for the camera. The characters also have rather outlandish outfits given their roles and situation (a long dress for battle... seriously).\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of battles, this show is essentially an endless, desperate fight with a few brief lulls. Expect a generous amount of blood, gore, and death along the way. Though the Aragami are painfully drawn through CGI, there's a good focus on choreography; I found myself on the edge of my seat through many battles. If there's one thing that the show wants to remind you of, it's that whenever you think have the upper edge you had better think again. There's an even amount of ranged and melee fighting, though obviously they focus more on the melee aspects. The plane fight in the third episode, though rather implausible physically, was one of the more memorable encounters. Though there is a bit of skin exposure on the part of Alisa, this isn't really an ecchi-centric show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a heavy rock piece that gives it a fittingly gritty and rough feel; it's not really my choice of music genre but makes sense here. The ED is a rather interesting piece, starting with a slow and ominous tonality before transitioning over to a hopeful and positive main melody. For once, I can honestly speak out positively about a BGM. This show has a superb BGM that greatly complements the strong visuals. It is often accompanied by a very fitting set of insert songs by Ghost Oracle Drive.\\n\\n\r\nLarge portions of the show have lone pad instruments or a piano with long reverb, adding a constant, heavy pressure to the atmosphere. This is further reinforced by opportune use of the vocal insert songs, specifically \"Broke my Stake\", which in my opinion really captures the atmosphere and tonality of the show. The BGM is also definitive during the battle scenes, often using strong drums or one of the excellent battle insert songs. When things go wrong, the show really drives the point with the eerily hopeless tune in the insert song \"Human After All\". Really, if you've been waiting for a show with a superb OST, there's a very strong contender here.\\n\\n\r\nThough I'm not a particular fan of our protagonist's general lack of emotion, the show has a strong cast overall. Our main heroine is voiced by veteran Maaya Sakamoto, who gives her character a fittingly aloof feel. We have other Ufotable veterans as well including Sayaka Oohara and Rikiya Koyama. They are also joined by veterans Kanae Ito and Ai Kakuma in supporting roles. Honestly, personal preference aside I'd have to say Sayaka wins highest praise here for her commanding yet motherly presence.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThough I started the show with a healthy dosage of skepticism surrounding this story, it honestly is a well orchestrated piece that instantly draws you in and doesn't let up until you're spit out the other side - and be warned that it may even pull you back in for an encore.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, I consider the first two episodes fair game for an initial introduction here. Unfortunately, things move so quickly in this show that this would be spoiling a great deal. Instead, an analysis of some primary story elements will have to suffice.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater is told primarily through the lens of Lenka, who is introduced to the workings of the Far East settlement and must learn to cope with his new found strength and abilities. However, the story also occasionally tells of the past of Johannes, the current chair of the Far East settlement. This past, often told in grayscale color, sheds light on the origins of God Eaters and the Aragami. These two stories are well intertwined so that neither feels out of place nor distracting.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't figure out any reasonable breakdowns of the show in terms of arcs, it's just one long struggle with chain-inducing cliff hangers and well-placed plot twists. There are plenty of battles that range anywhere from a few minutes to the entirety of an episode. Occasionally, this fire hose of constant action is turned down a bit to offer the viewer a short reprieve; expect this lull to be filled with meaningful character development and further atmosphere building. As there are multiple intense battles, there isn't the typical, linear buildup to a climax but rather lots of peaks and ridges along the way. The final climax is pretty epic, and though it's a bit over the top, it pretty much has to be in order to compete with the already grand previous battles. It's a relatively predictable climax/resolution, and the show leaves a gaping door open for future expansions.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, I picked up a favorite episode. Episode 10 is Lenka's origin story, and it's both well placed and well executed. For some reason, it reminds me of Emiya Kiritsugu's origin arc from Fate Zero- perhaps it's the similarity of emotion that is captured by the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is by no means a perfect work, there are plenty of setting and character details that are conveniently left out, as well as a huge deal of plot holes that one can easily write an academic essay on. Many of these are issues that actually apply to the FSN world as well (how a heroic spirit can ride an F-15 / how God Eaters can stand on a jet going 150+ mph, how main protagonists have ridiculous injury recovery rates i.e. Emiya/Lenka, etc.). However, there's enough action to focus on that these inconsistencies/impracticalities can be safely taken for granted without compromising on enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHonestly, this is probably the weakest category for this show. Ufotable has traditionally left a lot of mystery surrounding their characters, and that continues here. Through the season we learn a lot about Lenka, Johannes, and (to a lesser extent) Alisa. However, the other characters don't really get much of a background exposition; they seem to be there to serve a supporting role and to look cool in opportune moments. The actual character interactions are pretty good as you get to see the group dynamics evolve through the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for individual characters, I don't particularly like Lenka's personality; the fact that his trump card is his \"hero\" mentality is a bit overused in general in the world of anime. Alisa is definitely a work in progress, as her personal stability doesn't match her prowess in battle. The characters are dynamic, but not to the extent that we've seen in works such as FSN. Ironically, I'd say the Aragami are the most dynamic of characters in this show as they constantly evolve.\\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters, let's just say that there's a lot of death in this show. Innocent bystanders are often helplessly turned to heaps of red in a similar fashion to ordinary soldiers in a Gundam show.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThese days, I often find myself struggling to find uniqueness or elements of a show interesting enough to supplement my generic review pattern. I'm glad to have found such an interesting and engaging show. Though it may feel a bit immature at times, i.e. catering to younger audiences, the sheer power of the setting combined with the excellent story and majestic production qualities truly make this show an entertaining and worthwhile experience. It's not a perfect work by a long shot, but the franchise definitely shows promise. The first season ends with a lot of open questions so let's hope there's enough momentum for a sequel.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCompasses are basically tiny magnets that are attracted to the magnetic poles of the Earth.\r\nThey\u2019re fascinating. They don\u2019t usually look like much \u2013 a round casing, some lettered markings, and a red-white dial rotating about the center \u2013 but their ability to guide, to lead. They are an invaluable tool for any adventurer. Any person, really.\r\nGod Eater has a compass. Believe it or not, it actually has symbolic purpose. But the anime still misdirects itself regardless.\r\nSTORY\r\nGod Eater stars Lenka Utsugi, a wandering boy who joins Fenrir, a militaristic branch bent on wiping out the evilAragami. These beasts have been killing mankind, and it is up to Lenka and crew to stop them once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nBut the road to victory is paved with blood. Literally. God Eater is not an anime for those with weak stomachs. Aragami devouring people alive, gallons of internals washing over characters, and an exploding caesarian section demonstrate handily the anime\u2019s penchant for violence.\\n\\n\r\nSaid violence may be grotesque, but it fits this apocalyptic setting in which Lenka and the others roam. It gives the world a harsh and dark atmosphere \u2013 exactly what it needs given all the doomsday talk.\\n\\n\r\nViolence is just one mainstay, though. God Eater also takes a back-and-forth approach to the presentation of its events. That is, instead of glossing over the backstory, the anime takes its time in divulging the past. It intersperses the present plotline with flashbacks that reveal more about how the aforementioned setting came to be. The discovery of the Oracle cells, the start of the calamity, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, the anime does a competent job at world-building. While only the Far East Branch part of the world is shown, the show does not skimp out on new terms and details. The advent of God Arcs. Oracle cell erosion as a side-effect to a fluctuating Bias Factor. Multiple species of Aragami. Nothing intricate, but it at least shows the anime cares about its world.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, however, that compass goes haywire.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst aspects of the anime is the dialogue. A lot of what is said devolves into some variation of \u201cyou are strong\u201d and \u201cyou can do it.\u201d The talking becomes more like a yelling match rather than a conversation held between two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe action itself is not much better. Many situations involve a character narrowly escaping death thanks to convenient timing on someone else\u2019s part, devolving the tenser ordeals into repetitive moments. Furthermore, some of those violent scenes tread into unbelievable territory: massive spikes through spines, slit throats still giving speech and life for more minutes than possible, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is rough, too. Despite the narrative making Lenka\u2019s quickened death a major point of contention, he does not perish even after essentially experiencing the full effects of his affliction. It also doesn\u2019t help that the tale itself does not actually resolve (and God Eater even reverses the death of one of its characters), but at least Johannes\u2019s master scheme is revealed in full.\\n\\n\r\nEven rougher is the whole indoctrination-of-Alisa-to-kill-Rindou plotline. While it was done because Rindou discovered the truth behind Aegis (a rocket to protect a few select humans from the Devouring Apocalypse, the supposed end of the world), it comes off as pointless since her actions did not affect Rindou or the situation to any high degree despite how much emphasis the anime put on this detail.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all of these events are going on, the anime tries to push two different themes: a theme on man versus god and a theme on having hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe former has some interesting footholds. Emphasizing one\u2019s self-determinism rather than relying on prayer. A theory that Aragami and humans may not be so different (in the long run). The very fact that these people are called GodEaters.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter is more typical. In a world where beasts roam and people starve, hope is not just needed but vital for survival. But as Tsubaki, Rindou\u2019s sister, would put it, it is hard to have hope after all that has happened (destruction of Earth, rampant loss of life) and will continue to happen (the ease with which Aragami respawn).\\n\\n\r\nNeither theme manages to see much in terms of exploration, though. Indeed, the anime is more concerned with heavy-action sequences. But the ideas are there in some capacity, alleviating some of the negatives accrued elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater takes a slightly different approach to its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe style is apparent from the get-go. The anime adopts heavy shadows, thicker colors, and contoured clothes to make its characters defined, to make them stand out among the various backdrops of the world. Another way to describe the style is that it rests somewhere between two-dimensional and three-dimensional. It takes a bit of getting used to, but, once one does accept the uncommon approach, it at least becomes not unwelcome.\\n\\n\r\nPeering at the designs more closely, they may be a bit too eccentric for this wasteland, but, at the minimum, they have a sense of care put towards them. Alisa\u2019s design is easily the best. Her cap, half-suspenders, and skimpy-checkered outfit make her quite attractive. Her big boots make her seem larger (thigh-wise) than she appears to be, too.\\n\\n\r\nSouma\u2019s design \u2013 with his white hair, raised hood, and brown tie \u2013 give him the outsider look that coincides with his outsider status. And Sakuya\u2019s short brown hair, long gloves, and even longer skirt give her an air of maturity that seems lacking among the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOther designs, like Rindou\u2019s and Lenka\u2019s, are too plain compared to the others. And while Tsubaki\u2019s design screams commander (long hair, tight uniform), her exposed bust seems a bit too out of place given the circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the Aragami choose instead to go full three-dimensional. In short, it is passable. They are rarely wonky in their movements, and they even blend well with the stylish nature of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation tends to remain high where it counts. Namely, the action. Aragami jump after their prey. Characters slice, fly, and run. And the various explosions and lights, and not to mention the smattering of blood, give weight to the many encounters held throughout the show. Downtime unfortunately receives a reduction \u2013 not as much movement from the cast\u2019s bodies or facial expressions \u2013 balancing out the given animation amount.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, while it can have some cool looking landscapes and the detail is there, they are sadly a mishmash of green, brown, and grey, leaving behind much in terms of creativity. The anime has to be this way, but it is still drab to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe art does have other positives. The show uses a high-speed effect to indicate the progression of time. And the past plotline uses a black-and-white grainy overlay to let the audience understand that the events currently on-screen are, indeed, from an earlier time.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the anime has one significant negative: God Arcs. These weapons that the God Eaters wield are simply silly. Way too big, cumbersome to fight with, and lacking in terms of interesting designs. Each issue triply so for Lenka\u2019s last God Arc.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOne of God Eater\u2019s weaker areas is the characters that it touts.\\n\\n\r\nYet it is best to begin with the best. At the top of the strong list sits Rindou. Not to imply that he is particularly well-written. He does get impressed by Lenka and the others from time to time, but he has no outstanding qualities besides smoking a cigarette and having a purposefully incorrect catchphrase. Plus, his development is next to zilch.\\n\\n\r\nNo, what Rindou provides is a two-fold connection.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate, Rindou connects himself to nearly every member of the cast. Rindou visited Lenka when he was a kid. For Sakuya, he has a more romantic relationship. Tsubaki is the older sister that humanizes him. He befriends Souma when nobody else would. And he works with, not against, Alisa despite her difficult behavior.\\n\\n\r\nWhile he does not actively seek to put himself in their lives, he is not one to shy away from providing them that push in the right direction. And that\u2019s his second connection: He represents the main theme that the characters follow (through him).\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the major theme appears to be finding one\u2019s path in life. That\u2019s definitely a nice interpretation. After all, many of the cast members experience this dilemma. Lenka struggles between fighting to kill or fighting to protect \u2013 two similar yet vastly different outlooks. Alisa cannot overcome a traumatic moment from her childhood, believing herself to be weak. Souma\u2019s upbringing indicates that he was never wanted by family or friends, so he does not even have any choices to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nThe better interpretation, however, slightly alters the original: It\u2019s about helping others find their own path.\\n\\n\r\nLenka does not reach the protection conclusion on his own. The family that saved him and the team that supported him allowed him to realize that it is not about killing Aragami but rather saving these same people that matters most. Alisa is similar. Lenka\u2019s words of encouragement give her the strength to move forward. And Souma does not break his shell without Lenka refusing to give up on him and Kouta\u2019s general friendliness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as was written, Rindou influences all of them. He instilled in Lenka the necessary qualities to being a leader. He gave Sakuya the opportunity to carry on his project in his stead. He humanized his sister Tsubaki in return. He gave Souma a place, a team, to call home. And when Alisa was on the brink of insanity, his words of wisdom snapped her out of her delusions.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, his compass, an object whose sole purpose is to provide direction, solidifies both his representation of and the show\u2019s focus on this theme.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, beyond Rindou and the message of helping others find their own path, the cast falters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Souma\u2019s development from a brooding boy to a less-than-brooding man exists, the transition has low execution. Mostly because the anime does not give him the necessary time to flourish as a character. Indeed, the heavy-handedness of soldiers passing by and making remarks could have been handled better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it was. At least, in the past portrayal. His origins \u2013 born a hybrid of human DNA and Oracle cells \u2013 ostracize him from others due to his \u201cmonster\u201d status. And him inadvertently killing his mother, and hence Johannes\u2019s lover, made his father absolutely despise him. In other words, Souma\u2019s characterization is nice, but the development of his character is not.\\n\\n\r\nLenka is one notch below Souma. Lenka was originally bent on getting out there and fighting, but, after indirectly getting a squad mate killed, he reels back the solo-hero antics. Granted, he trades them in for cooperative hero antics, like drowning a mammoth Aragami and fighting atop a flying plane. But he at least concedes that brash confidence will only get him \u2013 and others \u2013 killed.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, that\u2019s the extent of his character for a long while. His first fight with Dyaus Pita goes horribly wrong, but it does not change his character. Not until episode ten does Lenka finally get more thrown his way. Much needed backstory at that.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, however, the execution isn\u2019t there. While the entire episode is dedicated to his origins, childhood, and subsequent arrival at the Far East Branch (nice), the pacing is too fast, removing any sense of tension and importance that his family members\u2019 deaths would impart (not-so-nice).\\n\\n\r\nOther characters have a similar problem to Souma: They are not around enough. Kouta has an intriguing aside when it comes to the thoughts and feelings of family members who see their loved ones going off to war. But since he is only around briefly in the beginning, middle, and ends of the anime (i.e., he does not have a presence) his character does hold strength.\\n\\n\r\nSakuya and Tsubaki are the same. Their relationships to the other characters are hardly explored. Especially so with Rindou. A joke about beer and a couple of elevator rides (respectively) do not aid in strengthening the bonds they share with the lover and brother (respectively).\\n\\n\r\nYet by far the worst character in God Eater is Alisa.\\n\\n\r\nShe initially seems rather important to the anime. Her New-Type status matches that of Lenka, her prowess on the battlefield is commendable, and her staunch need to save everybody aboard her inbound plane demonstrates where her heart is found. Not too shabby of a start.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime does not put much more emphasis on her character for a couple of episodes (she does have that poor teamwork phase), she makes a resurgence with Dyaus Pita\u2019s arrival. In essence, the dark beast killed her parents right before her eyes, causing her feelings of being weak as well as the PTSD she combats daily with drugs.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing her failed confrontation, Alisa basically regresses into a state of mania. For two episodes, she is literally unable to do anything but cry for her mommy and daddy. Her complete about-face puts the traumatization of the event she experienced into perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThen she disappears for two more episodes, receiving next to no attention. She only resurfaces after her creepy doctor hypnotizes her.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, her character has one clear goal: kill Dyaus Pita. To overcome the fear that plagues her, she must destroy her most important enemy.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s easy to guess what doesn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nYes, after all of her crying. After all of the emphasis placed on her one piece of backstory. After all of the tolls she has had to endure. She is not the one to kill Dyaus Pita. Despite her entire character revolving around the beast, the honor of the kill goes partially to Rindou and mostly to Lenka.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it is insanely asinine. Avenging her parents and defeating this anomaly that has tormented her psychologically for years was her character. So it makes absolutely zero sense for her not to be the one to ultimately take Dyaus Pita out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cast have many positives with slightly more negatives, reducing the total level of execution that they otherwise should have had.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater liked to use many insert songs throughout its run. They usually started playing right before a high-impact scenario in order to give said scenario more oomph, more adrenaline. While not every song is worthwhile, a couple of them are. \u201cHave You Ever Seen\u2026\u201d has a rock-n-roll composition that fits the cooler tone of the show. And \u201cHuman After All\u201d (while technically considered an ending track) is practically spiritual, going along with the god motif.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is sometimes loud and almost always grandiose. \u201cRequiem -Rakka-\u201d incorporates a choir for a churchlike feel. \u201cTensei\u201d does not let up on the violins, creating a fast piece for those tenser moments. \u201cAdmiration\u201d slows it all down, relying more on a soft piano to bring about gentler times.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the OST may not be memorable since the tracks themselves are not that catchy. But they at least support God Eater through their various tones, scopes, and compositions.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is half-and-half. The first half is mysterious and beautiful thanks to the slowness of both the instruments and the vocalists. This all gives way to more of that grandiose tone found in the OST, ruining what was otherwise a heartfelt piece (even if the vocalist maintains execution throughout).\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track trades away the subtlety and slowness of the ED with a faster and louder composition. Heavy guitar, drums, and a coarser vocalist work together to create a piece that aligns with the anime\u2019s own (to a degree) hardcore premise. Even so, the OP is less an articulate offering and more just loud noise. Especially in comparison to the other musical choices that the anime provides.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while lots of screaming went on, no notable voice acting performances were had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a large reason why I was not a big fan of this one.\\n\\n\r\nThey are simply boring. Rindou isn\u2019t that cool, Lenka is too lame, Souma\u2019s bad-guy-but-really-a-good-guy shtick got old quick. Alisa seemed as though she would be a nice addition to the team, and she is certainly attractive, but her rude behavior and lacking personality made her less fun overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe action was also not that fun to follow. One reason was the gunplay. More often than not, I get bored by battles involving gunshots, missiles, and other projectiles, and it was no different here. Another reason were the enemies. I.e., the Aragami. They were uninteresting monsters; they were not cool or neat or scary. In fact, Dyaus Pita\u2019s grinning and human-like reactions were more goofy than intimidating.\\n\\n\r\nCertain moments \u2013 the anime implying Rindou is alive, Johannes\u2019s despair following his beloved\u2019s death, Lenka willing to sacrifice himself to save Alisa \u2013 were intriguing, but these few examples were about as much entertainment as I could find throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater manages to weave two different plotlines together while also creating a connected theme for much of the cast. Unfortunately, the weak narrative choices, the poorly handled characters, and other notable issues cloud the show. It is lost \u2013 and no compass could help give it the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, nice world-building, interesting back-and-forth plotline, and themes on God and hope, but lame dialogue, repetitive action, and some silly plot developments\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, stylish appearance, okay character designs, about-average actual animation, and okay artistic direction\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Rindou highlights the major theme of helping others find their own path, but Souma, Lenka, and especially Alisa are riddled with issues\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, okay insert songs, okay OST, below-average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, boring characters and boring enemies made everything a chore to watch\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "I am a pretty big fan of the God Eater video games, for those unaware God Eater is a Monster Hunter style video game where you fight creatures known as Aragami. So just like most popular Japanese games before it God Eater was eventually turned into an anime, and the result was a fairly decent show which left a bit to be desired.\r\nStory: 6/10- The year is 2071 an the world has been ravaged by the Aragami, creatures who basically see the world as an all you can eat buffet, devouring anything they can. To fight the Aragami the organisation Fenrir deploys God Eaters, humansenhanced by Oracle Cells (what the Aragami are made of) weilding God Arcs the only weapons capable of killing the beasts. Our lead Lenka Utsugi is one of the first wave of Newtype God Eaters, who's Arcs can take the form of both a blade and a gun. The plot of the anime follows the first story arc of the game the Aegis Island arc, or to be more exact the early goings of the arc with some anime original bits put in, now on one hand i don't mind this as if they tried to adapt the entire arc in 13 episodes it would be awful and they would miss out on major character moments, on the other hand though the actual game content adapted is only like the first hour and a half of the game. Now some of the anime only stuff included is actually pretty good especially the end of the 5th episode which was really damn good, plus throughout the anime there are flashbacks which show life before during and the aftermath of the Aragamis arrival which was never really explored in the game. However some of the new things they add are... not so good, particularly a plot point they introduce at the end of episode 8 which was really unneeded and leads to some of the more questionable moments towards the end of the series. So overall the story in the anime has strong points but if your looking for the full thing your better off with the game.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10- The visuals are one of God Eaters strongest points. The animation was done by studio Ufotable of Fate and Garden of Sinners fame and they really make the visuals cinematic and sharp with mostly smooth animation to boot. However i do have a couple of issues one of which is the Aragami themselves, which are done entirely in CGI, now while this sometimes works fine other times it really stands out and is not friendly to the viewers eyes. Also and this could be seen as more of a nitpick but throughout the series they have these cuts which are done with a static effect which i personally found a bit annoying, but again that could be seen as a nitpick.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10- The sound is also very strong in God Eater. The music in the show is mostly taken from the games with some newly composed music every now and then. The music taken from the game is still as good as it was in the game (which was really good) and the newer music, most of which were vocal tracks done by Ghost Oracle Drive are also very good, though the vocals to the songs don't actually make sense if you look into them, the music fits for the scenes that they are used in and it all sounds good. As for sound effects its all very good, in battle the God Arcs sound great feeling very powerful, the sounds throughout the world are all good and the voice acting both subbed and dubbed is really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10- The characters in the God Eater video game are well written, well developed and very likeable. The characters in the anime... not so much. Now they still written fairly well and are still fairly true to their game counterparts if slightly more one note and not much development, Lindow is the cool leader, Sakuya is the big sister character, Alisa is basically a tone downed version of Asuka from Evangelion with less depression by the end of it etc. The character who suffers the most from this is Soma who is a major character in the plot and has a great amount of development across the whole arc... in the game. In the anime a lot of his development is rushed in a single episode, this development taking place later in this arc in the game, which makes the development in the anime come of as very rushed and as a result not very effective. The character who ends up with the most development is Lenka (ironic given he is a fill in for a player created character in the video games) who initially starts off as a sort of knock off Eren Jaeger but becomes a lot more mature as the series goes on and he actually has a bit of depth to him, he's not great but he's not awful either. so overall the characters are portrayed accurately as to how they are portrayed in the game but lose a lot of their development as a result of the short amount of the story the series covers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10- Despite a lot of the short comings the show is still very enjoyable, the action is well animated and entertaining to watch with a really good soundtrack to back it up and the characters are fine, but towards the end of the series it does begin to fall apart due to some... questionable choices.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10- As a fan of the games, i can say that the anime is worth a watch, it a good fun series you can binge watch and enjoy that does have a few really good moments. And if you finish it and enjoy the series i highly recommend the games as they are a hell of a lot of fun, and will actually give you the full story if you are curious to see how things turn out after the animes end.",

            "content": "God Eater is based on a video game of the same name but after watching the anime, I don't think I'll try out the game. Not saying it was bad, everything was just too mediocre and safe (asides for the characters because they got their butts kicked).\r\nStyle:\r\nFrom the start you notice that the animation is different but it's hard to put your finger on it. It seems kinda cheap but as time moves on it gets more enjoyable, that's a factor that I actually enjoyed from God Eater. It goes a bit hard on glitch effects at first but calms down after the first fewepisoodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nLooking at the story though, that was kind of a crap show. I usually try to go in with an open mind, I'd take any premise the anime offers and run with it as long as it can maintain it's own logic but God Eater has so many problems everywhere, nothing humongous, just a lot of small ones that I couldn't ignore and ruined the show for me. Overall it's a solid anime but if you start to look at it closer then it falls apart. Like how the main character isn't told how to use his state of the art weapon for no reason or how he passes out from an electric shock but later on gets stabbed and falls down from a cliff and actually get's better from those things. \\n\\n\r\nNOTHING surprising really happens in the anime. It plays way too safe with a story that we have already seen done better in Attack on Titan and it doesn't even advance it's own plot with the 13 episodes it offers.\\n\\n\r\nYou can check out my full review on my YouTube channel at MudanTV and ALSO I made a video that states everything that is wrong with God Eater anime a la Cinemasins style (It's not to be taken too seriously though).",

            "content": "There is a different impact on every people watching anime, especially if the anime is an adaptation of something else like a manga, a novel, and for this one, a game. I played the game and expected too much on it (Well, the game was really GREAT and I loved it.) and when it aired as an anime, it turned into a \"Clean Mess\". Here is why:\r\nStory - [8] : I gave it a six because all the good things I knew would happen, didn't really happen the way I expected it to be. But, meh, it happens a lot on adaptations. But why 8you ask? Well....let's see. For example, in episode 12, the game setting was WAY better (Especially since they're talking about god and such, the church setting SHOULD be better) but since it's the anime were discussing here, I gave points to certain changes and improvements like episode 2 and other surprises that I did not expect. I also gave it some point on it being an open end  type where chances of a Season 2 is possible (but just a tiny chance).\\n\\n\r\nArt - [9] : This, I noticed, didn't give much, if any, negative impression on me. But slashed it by a point from perfection due to some frames being repeated (I tend to memorize things and get a feeling of tardiness if I see an anime repeating animation frames unless, of course, it is a 4th wall joke. It's just a tiny problem.)\\n\\n\r\nSound - [9] : Same as the Art. The soundtrack is great, especially the battle scene BGMs. Some game soundtracks also in there which gives a nostalgic feeling to players of the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - [5] : Still the sane character design from the game. I did thought of their attires to be out of place, but then I though \"Hey. The world is ending in this anime so fashion doesn't matter.\". To be honest, I just gave points because my favorite character, Sakaki Paylor, is still as cool as he was in the game.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - [7] : I like seeing flesh being eaten like in SnK. Just Kidding. The roller coaster of positive and negative in this anime make it seem not great but it's not bad either. Starting from a shambled start, to a rocket mid-tier, to an even speed ending. I also enjoyed Episode: Scattered Petals (My favorite episode all in all). It makes me give a shred of pity on the MC and like him a tiny bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a a total of 7. It wasn't that bad, in fact, it was a good change of pace. The game IS better, but the anime isn't much worse also. If you are watching deep (really deep) anime, this one can pull you back into shallow waters. In other words, keep hoping that there will always be better anime with NO DELAYS! (I'm just joking lol). The delay itself became something that made me hope it's gonna be better, and it........ kinda did.",

The story starts really slow, especially during combat scenes, that's where it really suffers from weird pacing, you have characters talking and standing around in the middle of the fighting while the enemies just patiently wait for our heroes to finish their dialogue like its turn-based game, that problem really affected the overall enjoyment of this anime.\r\nThe story also only started topick up on episode 10, when they finally revealed the main character's past and motivation, that's the point when it hooked me in but by that time the anime is already at it's end, it would have made a better impact if we were shown his backstory a bit earlier, say episode 3 or 4, not 10. it would also make it easier for the audience to feel for the main character knowing his tragic backstory and why he's fighting for like what Attack on Titan did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it had the potential but lost it because of bad pacing and slow action scenes but had amazing visuals and soundtrack.",

The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it has a weird static transition of animation, which is okay, but it's used alot. But other than that, the animation is absolutely delicious.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound, (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Op especially is pretty intense but the music and soundtracks that play are good, they get us suspenseful and wonder what will happen next\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the character design is pretty good, except for Amamiya, I swear him and Lenka look like father and son. The only problem I have with the characters is how chill they can be. I swear like each character has like 12 pairs of balls it's ridiculous, especially Lenka, he can just friggin get up after being impaled it kinda makes me mad.\\n\\n\r\nMY OFFICIAL OPINION:\\n\\n\r\nThe Good,\\n\\n\r\nThe action, art and sound are AMAZING. Plus there was a scene that made me cry.\\n\\n\r\nThe BAD,\\n\\n\r\nI wish they could've had a little bit more development on other characters (I'm looking at you Alisa)\\n\r\nplus the story is pretty much a ripoff of attack on titan but other than that there's not too much more too say. If I had to compare it to AoT it's pretty much a anime with much less mystery to it than Attack on Titan and has alot of gore like AoT if not more.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why should you watch it?\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Attack on Titan, this is a good watch, or if you want some pretty amazing eye candy.\\n\r\nFor only 13 episodes, it is a pretty decent watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's my review",

            "content": "Adapting video game into an anime (or well, to any visual medium like tv series or movie, really) has always been a tricky business. There's usually two, most often used, ways to do this. Either stick close to the narrative of the game or branch out to create its own narrative using the game as a foundation.\r\nGod Eater anime is more or less in a weird compromise between the two methods. The anime only covers about half of the game storyline (I've played the game before watching, pretty the only reason why I'm watching this) while adding in its own several ideas. The overall resultof that is....interesting. God Eater is underdeveloped and uneven in many parts, but it certainly has highs. I'd say that's already more than most anime could do.\\n\\n\r\nThe series set in a distant future where a mysterious monster called Aragami has overrun the entire world. Fenrir was established to combat these Aragami through the use of the God Eaters, chosen individual with the capability to use the God Arc, the only weapon to kill Aragami. Our main protagonist, Lenka, is the newly recruited God Eater for Fenrir's Far East branch, formerly known as Japan. Lenka's determined to kill Aragami, but soon find himself struggling with his own simplistic desire and his incapability to protect everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main element of God Eater is the parallel between human and Aragami. Aragami came to existence through Oracle Cell. A newly discovered biological cell that's capable of evolving through devouring other cells, both organic and non-organic.In response to the ever-evolving Aragami, mankind similarly evolve. God Arc was also created with Oracle Cell, essentially making it a human-made Aragami, which resulted in it's wielder, the God Eaters, to become more than human, but human no more. Fenrir only sheltered those who are capable to become God Eaters, and their families. Through the conflict between human and Aragami, it's clear that God Eater was trying to evoke the theme of \"Utilitarianism vs Humanism\" in which for the sake of humanities survival, sacrifice of the few must be made. But in doing so, there's also the question where how many sacrifice we made for the sake of collective good before we entirely lose what made us human to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nBut, Aragami also function for another metaphor, the general idea of \"evil\" and, to some extension, death. Aragami is a mindless monster that mysteriously appeared out of nowhere and attack indiscriminately at any time, but it's also monster that, as revealed later on, cannot truly be extinguished. For every monster that was killed, their remaining Oracle Cell can always regroup itself again to create a new.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters struggle with the ideas above in varying degree. Lenka  vague and simplistic desire/resolve to become God Eater render him incapable of protecting anyone and almost made him giving up on his own life in the process, all the while struggling with the fact he can never save everyone. With the guide of his unit leader, Lindow, a man who acknowledge the tragedy of the world, but nonetheless strive through it in his own way (like providing a safe haven for those who can't get into Fenrir), and the very people that he tried to protect, Lenka found a new resolve. To inspire and guide others, something he does later on with his comrade such as Alisa, a God Eater transfer from the Russian branch who's coping with trauma of losing her parents to an Aragami (and in her effort to suppress her fear, almost made her gave up on her humanity), and Soma, another God Eater who struggle with his identity as the first God Eater ever conceived and the fact that his birth is at the cost of his mother's life. Lenka's renewed determination more or less becomes God Eater thematic (the second one, at least) conclusion , you can't never truly extinguished \"evil\" or misery in the world, but you still have to fight for a better world and passed on that hope to someone else. God Eater's delivery of it's ideas can sometimes be less than graceful, but the series knows when to hammer it's message home and when the story needs a breathing room or delivering moment of horror, cruelty, or triumph.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the present-time narrative, God Eater was also peppered with flashbacks from before the apocalypse happened, chronicling the struggle of Johannes, the current Far East branch director, as he witness the subsequent birth and rise of the Oracle Cell. The flashback allows for some nice parallel to the present-time narrative, and serves as another articulation of God Eater's overarching theme.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater's core problem lies in the risky narrative decision that was made by the creative team. In the pursuit of fully articulating solid core ideas, several character's arc lacks the pay-off that they should have. Arcs for characters such as Soma and Alisa are missing several key emotional beat in order for their emotional development to truly resonates. Alisa's PTSD problem for example, which was build up over the course of few episodes, ends in a matter of minutes through a loud pep talk. Soma's character arc also suffer the same fate with even less build-up. Plus, it's attempt to also adhere to the original game's story in limited episode count resulted in unfinished overarching storyline. A likely deal breaker since second season is unlikely due to low viewership, sales and delays because of troubled production.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic-wise, God Eater more or less shine. The post-processed visual allows for not only a distinct grim apocalyptic look, but also made the CG-rendered Aragami to blend in quite well with the environment. The action is also flashy and well executed as expected of Ufotable production, although the dynamic camera movement sometimes can makes it a little unclear what action the character was doing. The music done by Go Shiina was also a standout with diverse range from harrowing choir to fist-pumping rock guitar during peak action moment.\\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, despite rough edges, I came out liking God Eater, more than I expected at the very least. It took a couple of episodes for me to be completely invested on the going ons in the story, but  I'd say its worth it. While the overarching storyline isn't complete, God Eater, for me at least,  is kind of one of those stories where it's actual narrative is incomplete, but thematically it does. Not for everyone, but I have a good time. Recommended.",

            "content": "For a 13-episode anime, this one was pretty solid. Watching this showed me that anime creators can put a lot in 23-minute or so episodes to fill a 13-episode story. A lot happened, in other words. This was based on a video game, which means there's quite a bit of combat, which I like in my anime, and maybe you do too if you're reading this review.\r\nUfotable. A god among anime studios. The designs are almost three-dimensional in their depth and... it has this certain, chisel-like, Greek sculpture-like lineament and surface that renders the characters and setting and Aragami a remarkably vivid quality. It's awesome.Ufotable also did some of the Fate anime, Fate/Zero if my memory serves me right, and among all anime studios I've seen anime for so far, ufotable undoubtedly stands out. Most studios kinda look alike, especially the more recent anime, but ufotable, especially in God Eater, it just... stands out. The art is a solid 10 out of 10, no doubt about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound's pretty good, some battle-like undertones and some vocals that smoothly blend in with the fighting and emotional scenes. Not super memorable like that of FMAB or Code Geass (superb soundtracks by the way), but still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Lenka Utsugi, is also one of the best-designed male anime characters I've seen, at least in regards to panache. His hair is spikey black and awesome and he is noble in that he fights to protect others far above his own safety. There are some other pretty swag characters in that they fight well and boldly. Certainly an anime to get your blood going.\\n\\n\r\nNot necessarily a \"Best Picture\" anime, but definitely very enjoyable and addicting. You can finish this in a day or two, so there's no harm in trying it out. Don't be dismayed by the 13 episodes, based on the ending it looks like they might make another season (I hope), but even if they don't, as I said, a lot does happen in these 13 episodes. Think of it like a 4-5 hour movie chock-full of high-octane action, gore, and humans fighting Aragami with these huge and awesome weapons that give them the name God Eater.\\n\\n\r\none word to describe this anime: charged",

            "content": "You all probably know the feeling when you need to wait for season two of an anime to see how it ends. Awful right? But do you know what's worse than that? It is when you watch an 13-episode-long anime but they take an 5-month-long pause after the 9th episode. While waiting for the 10th episode of this anime I totally forgot about it and finished it just yesterday. And now here is the review for GOD EATER!\r\nPlot and Story Line\r\nFirst thing's first, the anime God Eater is actually an adaptation on the same-named game God Eater. Produced by Bandai Visuals, God Eater is anaction, adventure, military and supernatural anime with a rating of 7,56. \\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, the worst thing about this anime were the frequent delays, especially the one after the 9th episode. Now that the anime is finished and the story nearly complete, let\u00b4s discuss it.\\n\r\nSo, the story of God Eater takes place in post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 2071. The world was nearly destroyed due to monster-like creatures called Aragami. A special organization with the name Fenrir was created to exterminated the Aragami with weapons called God Arcs that are made of Aragami cells. Since the introduction of a new God Arc type, that can change its form, new God Eaters (Aragami exterminators) are introduced and so is our protagonist Utsugi Lenka. The story follows him and his friends in various missions and battles but also a couple of background stories that follow the main characters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, it is actually a well-known scenario. Huge, monster-like creatures attack human kind and they need to fight back. Even tough there are so many anime with one and the same topic,  they all kinda develop their own story in between. Thing is, God Eater is an anime that's trying to tech us what humanity really is. It concentrates on some basic rules of society such as \"The strong ones survive\" and how we sometimes need to obey the stronger ones in order to survive. One thing that is quite often the topic is 'how to chose between two'. It is something we encounter many times in life and the anime surely shows us how to chose. Other, more additional \"stories\" that would make up the main story in other anime are pushed into the background. Funny is, most of those stores are actually background stories and flashbacks of the past. But they are actually quite good. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to our protagonist, Lenka, I would say that his life story is the main story line. Pushed by all the things that happened in the past Lenka fights and craves strength to protect others. That is exactly what drives the whole anime. True that it is also a thing that we\u00b4ve seen before (motivational talks, all round Naruto-like optimism) it still catches you kinda emotionally and it doesn't get boring.\\n\r\nIn addition to a good story, what made this anime watchable is the action. The action scenes were truly amazing and awesome. Not to talk about the fact that they you have a fight every here and there. I loved it.\\n\r\nOn the whole, no plot holes, the story is intriguing and catchy and the background stories are just as interesting as the present story line. Again, it is not just an anime about fighting monsters but it also concentrates on stuff like humanity and society. One more thing: with the last, 13th episode, the anime actually reached its peak, meaning, the story is not over. There is more to it but unfortunately, a second season hasn't been announced yet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are...good. Nothing special in particular but I like them. They are all special and to each comes a different story.  You have a couple of leaders, an emotionally unstable but very talented girl, the \"Ron Weasley\" kind of friend, a typical villain etc. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\\n\r\nNow this is an amazing example when it comes to animation of 2015. The animation of God Eater is outstanding. I loved it. Colorful, bright colors and smooth. Can't be better. 10/10.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to style...I loved it. I actually started watching because of the animation and style. The style is so unique and is definitely the first anime to try something like this-a kind of watercolor-3D effect. At least I remember it as the first one. It was also obvious that others liked it to because anime like Ajin and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar copied that style. Besides, I am usually not a fan of monster-looks in most anime, but God Eater nailed it. They are really one of a kind and different from everything else you've see.\\n\r\nConclusion: The animation and style are so good that even if every other aspect like story and characters were bad, it would be worth watching. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIf you don't like anime with the topic of an apocalyptic world destroyed by huge monsters watch God Eater because you'll probably change your opinion about them. If not, than just do because you must not miss such a great animation work. In short, the anime is interesting, the story is rich in good background stories and messages and you get a huge load of action in only 13 episodes. For God Eater : 8/10! \\n",

This happens a lot of times in the series, not only with deaths, with every bit of trauma or pain a character has.\\n\r\n---   End of spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the quality of the review, it's my first one.",

            "content": "Now LA knows what your gonna say, this is like ''Attack on Titan'', but with \"Aragami's\", instead of Titans, and LA knows, LA had the same vibes of it too, however where it diverges is the storyline format of it.\r\nDeath in this anime is rampant from red shirt civilians to main casts death and like ''Attack on Titan'' Episode 1, they pull on your heartstrings for this. \r\nCharacter-wise, they give the main cast as much development or obstacles as they can however it's only one episode each except for Lenka, Lindow Amamiya voiced by ''Hiroaki Hirata'' and Alisa Illinichina Amiella voiced by ''Maaya Sakamoto'', withLenka changing and evolving the most from the \"typical Eren Yeager\" to a strong-willed leader-like protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime adaptation is an adaptation from the same PSP game series however LA will talk about that and the main plot in a bit but first.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music for this anime although many people dismiss the change in style that ufotable has taken with this anime series, LA says that the animation is taken from the game series animation in less polygonal style and more watercolored in a ways which complemented the bleak world of God Eater and LA praise the animation for it as the battle scenes in God Eater are AMAZING, every fluid movement to the changing of the God Arcs done by ufotable is like the quality LA expected, there is CGI used in this anime mainly on the God Arc's and the Aragami's however LA can easily ignore it as ''they are meant to be like this'', the God Arc's are mechanical thus CGI compliments it, the Aragami are meant to be \"monsters from another world\" thus again the CGI works on their favour and along with the watercolored textures on them compliments the already bleak world. ufotable once again uses CGI to it's fullest effect (last time being Berserker from Fate/Zero) as to not make the CGI standout but disguise it within it's environment or make it more alien as intended and not to tamper with it's slick character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe music given gives ambience to atmospheric quality depending if it's a dramatic or battle or even sombre.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting through the board is top quality so LA won't talk much on this.\\n\\n\r\nGod Eater has been plagued with delays which is why the \"release\" of this anime was split by a 2 season gap and by all means if ufotable was having problems in development, it does go to show that a powerhouse animation studio like ufotable can be into trouble sometimes but LA can easily go on the offensive and say that at least at the VERY least they WANTED to finish this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was utterly great with not only a great climatic battle but also a plot twist that makes the story go full circle, the plot didn't end per say but it ended on a very satisfying note. Now remember what LA said about this being a video game adaptation and how LA would be talking about the plot of this anime?. Well LA will say this, LA will praise this adaptation for trying to adapt it as well as it did from it's animation to trying to make use of it's game storyline to the fullest and even with it's faults of a \"typical Attack on Titan\" to \"another Eren Yeager\" to heck even rigid story telling of it's main cast cept for a fair few but with this anime's massive world building and goals of Fenrir helps us be immersed in this bleak world and even the main cast deaths are taken not in mourning or plot armour but more in a ways of moving on the legacy of that character to someone else.\\n\\n\r\nYes, LA will defend this anime for what it does \"new\" to it's \"typical attack on Titan setting\" and character and massive world development. Is this a bad video game anime adaptation?...well for LA, it has it's flaws, but considering what LA said, LA still enjoyed it even when it was delayed and even the ending was well worth the wait that made it one hell of ride to watch. God Eater looks to be something of a change to video game anime adaptations...LA just hopes other video game adaptation will see this as the NORM not the exception.",

            "content": "This is my review of the first season of the show and while there where delays and production issues I wont let that effect my scoring of the show as that wont apply to people who will watch the show in one sitting. When I started watching god eater I was expecting something different to Ufotables usual fate stay night type work which is all about stories where people are betraying or crossing one another in beautiful animation filled fights. I knew what God eater was before watching the show and it has met and gone over my expectations which would have been a eightoriginally. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the first half is basic where it involves introducing some characters and world building. The story in general is basically moments of dialogue at home base between character with fights against monsters in between. The later half of the story is really good and and was able to make the pacing good for 13 episode series even with the flashbacks for the characters. My favorite episode apart from the final where the one that gave character development to Soma and the episode focused on Lenka the MC which was what I believe should have been the first episode of the series which is why I am giving it a  9 instead of 10. The story also has a combination of dark and epic moments that make you say WTF or Holy S&%t\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Ufotable they produce a series with a very good looking art style. The animation is mostly smooth and character and weapon designs are very detailed and shiny. The animation in the fight scenes are pretty good and dynamic. effects like fire, rain, blood are done nicely however electricity effects in the scenes they were used seem slightly overused and take away from everything else. The monsters in the series where mainly 3d CGI by the look of them but it wasn't bad CGI and didn't ruin what you where watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was what I loved the most about the series considering I am going to buy GhostOracleDrive album and listen to it in college. The music that was used always seemed to fit the moment it was used. I usually watch a fight scene remembering the music as a few bangs and a small bit of dubstep however in this series I would mostly remember the epic song playing in the background. The music is also not only effectively used during fights it is effectively used during character dialogue.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first squad characters are pretty well developed and sort of likable in the series as a whole but half of them at first can be very childish however to avoid spoilers I am not going to say who. The MC Lenka seems like the best character to get development in series. He is not a character in the god eater video games which the series is based off of as the games get you to create a main character to begin with. At first he seems like a blank slate as a character where he has nothing really interesting about him other then his need to kill aragami. Later on he does end up becoming my favorite character in the series after getting some decent development. My other favorite character in the series was Soma for similar reasons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\\n\r\ndespite delays I really enjoyed every episode of this series mainly due to the pacing which wasn't too slow or too fast while keeping things entertaining. I would recommend this show as one you do watch in one sitting.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 \\n\\n",

Lot of mystery, explanations and really enjoyable \"flashback\" presenation of past about scientist of what happened to the world. I found the story really enjoyable, but the usual low amount of episodes  caused effect of rushing through story and did not have satisfying end. I also liked dark atmosphere it had and quite gruesome deaths. Also lot of sacrificing was included. (not only character'wise). But yeah, low episode count had impact on development of characters and rushed progression.\r\nArt\r\nI absolutelyloved, characters felt odd sometimes, but honestly I couldn't figure out whenever it was CG or not. Nevertheless that cel shading style had really nice touch. Battles had lot of effects and quality ones. BD vs TV release was also great improvement. Point being, art felt really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nOST was great, music was great. But during conversations some OST didn't felt fitting at all. (well, based of game and game was even more awkward) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nNot much to comment, varied cast and stereotypes. MC was mostly great. Voice acting was superb and voice actors cast is great. Alisa lewd. Probably the most attention got from me Lenka and Sakuya. Lenka the MC has satisfying aspects and plot points. Sakuya, I simply like her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I did enjoy this anime a fair share. Sadly it's too short and short anime issue is the usual. Feels rushed and does not have satisfying end.",

Speaking of action,it was well animated in the beginning of the anime but later on it felt like it degraded \\n\\n\r\nMusic And Sound (4)\\n\r\nThe anime did have good sound effects but music, it was a huge disappointment on the side of music, they could have done a lot better on music side.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Design (7)\\n\r\nWhy I give this a 7 is because some characters were exposed really well, like  Alisa. The backgrounds of characters were also covered neatly,but wasn't sufficient enough but overall they did good on character design\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\r\nDefinitely recommend if you are in to action anime, this has a promising experience, character background and few other important historical events will be covered time to time in each and every episode, It's kind hard to predict what's gonna happen next while watching. Might call it a good anime after all",

            "content": "I decided to do this anime some justice. If we want to name all the things, which remind us of some older anime - the main hero, Earth population wiped out, humanity's strongest captain, special battle equipement etc. - we're gonna be here forever. Let's move on. Let's call this a genre.\r\nHonestly, I don't even think that SnK is first in this genre. It goes much further in the history of anime, like... 80s. All those huge aliens and mecha fighting, you know. There's basically nothing original about the Evangelion premise, right?\r\nBut what do all these stories have in common? We enjoy them! We enjoythose innocent children, who symbolize the future of humankind, fighting strange unknown evil, which is growing every day, causing everyone to fall into despair. That's why the number of those \"generic\" anime series keeps growing. And God Eater is doing a good job.\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as you get over the unoriginality, you will start to enjoy those little differences. There is nice story developement that even explains some of the past events. The main hero is not a complete good-for-nothing, he has some previous life experience (which reminds me a bit of Terra Formars and I do like that type of character). The amount of despair is... delightful. Well executed violence. Nothing is black and white, or more like: everything is dark. You are left wondering after every episode whether are there any chances of humanity surviving. Even the morally strong protagonists have major character flaws. Even the biggest hopes will be stained with bloody disillusion.\\n\\n\r\nPeople here praise the animation. For me, it was one of the weakest aspects. It is undoubtedly well done, but it just feels weird to me. Distracting. Very CGI-like. One of those animes where you watch first episode and think: wait, is this... video game adaptation? Looks like it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway. If you can't get enough of action sci-fi shounen genre, go ahead and watch this! If you're looking for deep, thoughtful stories with delicately designed personalities and unusual enviroment, go search somewhere else.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nGod Eater stayed in my \"plan to watch list\" for a really long time. It was mostly because it was a CGI anime and also i thought that it had an interesting but ordinary story after reading the synopsis of it.\r\nA week ago i finally started watching it. It started like an ordinary shounen anime but i think everything about the anime developed through the episodes.\r\nFirst of all the animation didnt irritate me at all. I even liked it. After watching a few episodes i often forgot the fact that i was watching a CGI anime. I still prefer non CGI anime buti think this was also really well done.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSecondly yes, the story was an ordinary story. God Eater takes place in the future. In its world there are creatures that are called \"aragami\". Aragami eat everything and kills humans too. Humans try to survive. There are people called God Eaters. They are specialized soldiers who kill aragami.\\n\r\nSimple story right? But how it was told was really interesting i think. There were also some plot twists especially in the last episodes. Action scenes were nice but the anime wasnt all about action scenes. The characters were interesting. Many of them developed well. I felt bonded with many of the characters and got really sad because of some deaths. The only character who couldnt really satisfy me was alisa. Even though i thought she would be the main heroine in the first episodes and even though i thought she would have great character development, after a few episodes she became a side character who barely does something and she could never be able to get an important role after that. Some important things happened about her but i couldnt feel really satisfied with her character in general.\\n\r\nStory: 7-8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI didnt really like the opening or ending musics but i didnt hate them either. \\n\r\nI LOVED the insert songs. \\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought about giving 8/10 overally but especially the last episodes were great in my opinion thats why i am giving 9/10.\\n\r\nI know this is adapted from a game thats why it probably wont have a second season but i would love to see it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Personally, I would give the series a 9 but it may seem biased since I was a fan of the original game. Therefore for everyone else, I would give it an 8\r\nBefore I start with my review, let me preface by saying that I did play the game before watching the anime so I do have some above-average knowledge of God Eater's lore and what was the game's biggest Wham moments. Though I have since put down the game for good and cannot for the life of me get back into playing it, I did enjoy the story and the cast. I find that GodEater's story is at the top of all Monster Hunter-clones (and is even better in that department when compared to any official Monster Hunter game)\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime was announced and said to be developed by Ufotable, I was ecstatic. Ufotable is hands-down my new favorite animation studio. I've been in love with their works since Kara no Kyoukai leading up to Fate/Zero and then finally with Unlimited Blade Works. It was a no-brainer that I give the God Eater anime a chance.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you were following the anime at the same time as the original broadcast, I will admit that it was a horrible experience. With that much delay in-between episodes, the glamour of the series diminishes after each passing week. It's easy to believe that the God Eater anime sucks.\\n\\n\r\nFor a time, I did think same. I absolutely placed the series in the back of my mind. My thoughts at the time were that it was an unfortunate debacle. Ufotable did not seem to reach the lofty expectations fans set after enjoying all of their continually great series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the delayed episodes were announced to be broadcast without any breaks, I decided to binge watch every episode again.\\n\\n\r\nI was shocked. When watching every episode back-to-back, the difference in terms of enjoyment was clearer than night and day.\\n\\n\r\nI know now that the blame for the poor initial reception lies solely on the delay and not on the series itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was never the problem. It was still as good as the day I first watched them and it's on par with all of their previous works\\n\\n\r\nOf particular note here is the fight choreography. On my first viewing, I did not pay particular attention to them but they were much more amazing the second time. The fight on top of the airplane, the fight near the dam, the underground fight (where Lenka was coordinating things) and the fight in the final episode clearly stand out in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, you should expect much of the same as with Unlimited Blade Works. To the uninformed, Ufotable expanded the original story, There were much more scenarios and development in the anime that were never in the original work. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of the original work and are the type to hate it when the anime expands upon the story by creating new scenes, you might as well stop reading now.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really enjoyed it. The added scenarios created a new experience for me. Even though I was already spoiled from enjoying the game's original spoilers, I appreciated Ufotable by creating new surprises for me to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character development, the original game focused on Alisa, Lindow and Soma. But here in the anime, those three are joined by Lenka and Johannes. The anime especially did a great job with Lenka and Johannes. Since Lenka was based on the blank Player Character of the game, there were a lot of ways they could have developed him. But I am quite pleased with the story they crafted. \\n\\n\r\nIf you could only watch one episode of God Eater, then you should really watch Episode 10. It's one of the most heartbreaking episodes of any anime and was the reason I decided to give this series a second chance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd besides Lenka's developments, I also felt for Johannes. When you watch the anime as whole, you can truly feel that you now understand what makes him tick. His character journey is equally heartbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the soundtrack. For the majority of the episodes, there is a very blood-pumping action-filled rock soundtrack on par with what the original game did. It's purpose is to tell you that a very cool fight is about to happen and it does it's job well. \\n\\n\r\nBut what surprised me is the soundtrack they used during the quiet moments. It definitely grabs your attention and helps make you feel more for the characters. Of particular note is the entire soundtrack for episode 10. Ruined Land by Go Shiina feat. naomi is my new go-to feelz song.\\n\\n\r\nSo please, if you are a fan of the original game, a fan of Ufotable or are simply a fan of the action genre, please give this series a chance. Watching the series now that it's completed will not be a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nMy only disappointment is that the anime stopped right before the Burst storyline. I truly feel that Ufotable may not get a second crack at the series and may not be able to create a second season finishing the original game's story. But I do feel that the anime stopped at a satisfying point. You can still watch this series and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\n(Besides MAL, I am also posting this review on Crunchyroll so please don't be alarmed)",

God Eater is, without any doubt, the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. It is breathtaking.\r\nThere is also a different kind of story, different world building, and a much faster pace. It also has a different way of creating villains. I think that if you liked AttackOn Titan, you would like God Eater, but it is much more than off-brand Attack On Titan. \\n\r\nI want there to be another season of God Eater, just as I am sick of waiting for Attack on Titan season 2.

The story was really well made and same goes for the sound, but i would've expected more from the art since the FIGHTING/ ACTION were amazing. But it wouldn't go in my top 5 fighting/action anime but it was well there. The character development was well...good (you know what i mean) And the game is addicting but for people who despise dubbed or just plain don't like it, You will have to deal with the fact that they don't have the Japanesedubbed (sorry to break it to yah). Personally i like God Eater 2 Rage Burst you can get it on steam http://store.steampowered.com/app/438490/ (Just copy and paste it) And so I don't want to spoil the story and action but you know those times when you watch something so good you can't resist but to spoil it? Yeah i'm trying to resist it right now. But overall i would recommend anybody who loves monsters, fighting/action, hint of romance and ecchi, GIANT SWORDS AND GUNS AND BOWS AND SNIPER RIFLES!, and a badass main character whom personality is cool to the touch (And at the end....SUPER SAIYIN) and a bad'ass' 'Heroine' (who you might hate at the start but will like at the end) who shows a bit of side boob  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) .

            "content": "This anime is kind of epic. It's not the sort of thing I'd rewatch, but I do really wish that a second season was in the works. From what I gather, God Eater was based off of a game series, and this season was only made to promote God Eater 2 (the game). So, unfortunately, I don't think we'll get any more of this anime, which is a real shame. \r\nThe animation style in God Eater kind of turned me off at first, but the more I got used to it, the more I was able to focus on the story. The main plot pointof saving civilization is not an original idea, but it is done well here. Not to mention, the battles were stunning. Both because of the characters and because of the animation (once I got used to it). \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they're amazing. I wish, again, that we had more seasons so that we could get more development from them, but they were extremely well written. I'd say Lindow, Soma, and Lenka were my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up, I'd recommend this anime to people that enjoy Attack on Titan and anime similar to that. Although, in my opinion, God Eater is slightly lighter that AoT, so if that appeals to you, there you go. I enjoyed this anime immensely, and I would definitely watch a second season should it appear at some point in the future. Here's hoping!",

            "content": "God Eater is a pretty good anime. First it got really nice art style. Something between drawing and cgi, works very well and makes it enjoyable to watch.\r\nStory is interesting. The world is under attack by creatures called Aragami. Humanity is on the edge of extinction. The only way to fight those monsters is by merging humans with Aragami to create God Eaters. What I liked about the anime is the fact that we get the whole story. Every episode brings some more details about what happened and how Aragami attacked humanity. That gives it more depth that just fights with no purpose. \r\nAs faras characters go we have our main guy - Lenka. He is well written character. Even thou he is special he is not full of himself, he works hard and he is a team player. Trough whole series he does not change his personality. \\n\r\nApart from Lenka we got some other side characters that are also cool and add to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I can recommend this anime to everyone that is looking for some good action anime with good story with interesting characters.",

I liked this anime, it had a good combination of action and backstory. If you like RWBY or Attack on Titan and are looking for something similar, I'd say you should watch this too. Honestly, the setting-mankind trapped behind walls, is exactly like Attack on Titan, which bothered me a lot. The action scenes seemed a bit ridiculous, but it did take the characters massive effort to kill a stadium sized monster/Aragami. The 3D art style botheredme at first, but I admit it was very different, and not in a bad way either. Character wise, the impractical wardrobe of the characters definitely screamed RWBY to me. The characters personality wise, were generally hit or miss. Some seemed generic, your badass commander, your scaredy-cat, and your try-hard. But as time went on, not all of them were as generic as they initially seemed. However, most characters did not have much depth. Overall, I enjoyed this anime and am hoping for another season. I may even decide to take a look at the game.",

To fight them, an organization\r\nwas made that creates weapons that only capable of killing an Aragami,which is called \"God Arc\". \r\nGod Arc can be a sword or a gun(cannon-like).\r\nPros :\r\n+ Awesome Animation\r\n+ Beautiful Sounds\r\n+ Epic monsters\r\n+ Good fighting scenes\r\n+ Amazing Backgrounds Scenes\r\nCons :\r\n- The animation is delay sometimes(as always in 3D-animation)\r\n- Good Story (6.8/10)\r\n-Dark scenes...(I can't see! where's my flashlight?)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I like this anime.

However I describe this show to people as if they took Attack on Titan and Black Bullet and they had a child with the best of both. I have introduced this show to several people and everyone enjoyed it.\r\nStory: Same as Attack on Titan/Black Bullet/mankind on its last leg. Fighting for survival. The plus side is everything is explained, how it happened, why it happened so on and so forth.\r\nArt/Sound: The art style is unique and quite different, however after a few episodes it begins to grow on you.The sound track is quite well done as well. Defiantly a must see. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: When I read the reviews, this comes up as a major flaw, since one of the MC shuts down halfway through the show. But all that did was add realism to the show to me, traumatic events will cause some people to completely stop functioning. I found it to be a redeeming factor instead of a flaw. If you disagree with me, message me and hell I will argue this out with you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I found this show to be a gem, in the shit that has been coming out recently for the genre. The back story is thoroughly explained, the characters actually are developed over 13 episodes. And they actually have some real human emotions in there. Also the artwork and sound track are extremely well done as well. This is a must see if you enjoy the end of the world type anime.",

This series was fantastic in my opinion. Even though this is a common post apocalyptic series it was the best one iv'e seen til now! The excitement was unreal!  Ufotable has never disappointed me when it comes to animation, they did a great job with the art. The story line was good too. I see many people being paranoid about this and I don't see why. Every animehas there own unique story and it seems people compare this to attack on titan. Like wtf-.- People should not have this kind of perspective and lock other animes out when writting a review. (my opinion). Sound was good, I had no problems with that and characters where pretty cool. They all had there personalities and through the series then evolved a bit and it turned out they fought harder for what they believed in. The last words I can say is! Totally worth watching! Msg if you want to know anything about this series :",

            "content": "I AM REVIEWING FROM A GAMER'S POINT OF VIEW SINCE I PLAYED THE GAMES FIRST\r\nStory (SPOILERS): I loved God Eater's original story, however the anime obviously took different turns. First up, it might not have been the producer's fault, but the anime was TOO SHORT!!! I cut up the God Eater plot into 3 major points. One, Alisa's issue and Lindow going missing. Two, the protagonist is now captain and Johannes is going to use Shio to start the Devouring Apocalypse. Three, we stop Johannes but find out Lindow's alive so we save him; roll credits. The anime covered only 1/3 of the plot ANDrushed through it leaving out monumental parts. Not to mention, I feel like the political side of God Eater's story wasn't really important until the approaching 2nd game and certain aspects were conditioned or brought up too early. (For example, to those who played the older, not remade games, it's like when you have those Rank 1,2,3 missions targeting small fry and all of a sudden a big a** un-introduced Aragami pops up. Wait your turn, I don't KNOW what you are!!). They changed certain small facts here and there, but for the most part, they weren't that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The setting designs were flawless, however the character design truly disappointed me and the Aragami rubbed me the wrong way. For those who were deep into the games plot, you'd know there was already a protagonist before Lenka Utsugi, named Yuu Kannagi. I personally liked the design of Yuu Kannagi more than Utsugi's and believed they should've kept it. Other characters, like Alisa and Soma, were given a more outrageous alterations in the design that made them look like shiny, plastic action figures. God Eater isn't the first anime this design team worked on and some like the art, but I didn't. On the bright side, the fight scenes were very pleasing to the eye\\n\\n\r\nSound: I could't imagine a better soundtrack. There were scenes where I had trouble paying attention because the soundtrack was so cool and beautiful. Oldcodex's Feed A is one of my favorite songs and the ending theme wasn't bad either. Not to mention they flattered fans by bringing back classic songs like \"No Way Back\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Unfortunately, due to how short the anime was, certain important characters like Soma and Kota weren't given they're full development because the anime did not reach that part of the plot where they were truly involved. Alisa's story is one of the more important aspects of the anime and I feel like they strayed from the original (in a bad way) by emphasizing more aspects and cutting out others which eventually changed her general character. In the game, Alisa was more of a tsundere character that sometimes spoke before thinking and was self-driven, making her a good God Eater. However, the anime took out the tsundere feel to her and turned her into a callous, pragmatic kuudere full of hate who was just naturally talented and hid her flaws. And deep down, she was nothing more than a weak, unreliable little girl. I feel like the game handled it better. And now, for the elephant in the room: Lenka Utsugi. For the most part, the game protagonist is silent and not much is said on Yuu Kannagi's past in the manga. And although I did not like Utsugi's design, I feel like the past he was given was interesting and one deserving of a main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THE GAME FOR A BETTER STORY AND EXPERIENCE, the anime kept me busy and the fight scenes were stunning and well portrayed",

Actually it was really worth it waiting for this to finish and I liked the show so, watch I recommend to watch this anime to the end.\r\nApparently some people didn't like this show because of pacing and probably the story. Well in my honest opinion I think this show worked kinda well but with some major problems such as the releasing of episodes they made us wait for months just for this show to finish which was the biggest problem for me,I know they had problems in producing so I kinda understand and just had to be patient with it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-So first the Story; ( the story actually gave a deep vibe in it)\\n\\n\r\nyou may say it's a cliched type, well it really is but even the most cliched shows can be at least good if executed well, in example the setting of an humanity's destruction caused by humans could be great with proper explanations which this show did but it took a lot of time and gave a vibe that this episode was just a filler or something but, no problem with that for me because I liked how they mad it like a flashback thingy.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show was kinda boring compared to it's first ep making it a bit inconsistent, but for some reason I felt happy when a new ep was released this year and it was a good one. As for the ending though(I'll try not to spoil) it started good midway but there was a part where you could just expect what happens next which made it feel lacking but nonetheless still nice.\\n\\n\r\n-For the Art( the greatest selling point for this series) it shows great depth and an amazing feeling when I watch it making it feel different from other animes.\\n\\n\r\n-for the music at first I didn't like it but as the show progress I started to get a good feel to the music fitting in with the series but there could have been better alternatives\\n\\n\r\nWould have been better if it was longer though but it probably didn't since they might have production problems. \\n\r\nStill wish for a continuation after that ending.\\n\\n\r\nWell remember this is all in my opinion. \\n\r\nHope this was helpful and I recommend this show to people who enjoys a bit of action and seeing humans cause there downfall and... well I just recommend it since it's an overall nice anime.\\n\r\nDefinitely worth it.",

Indeed, there is Hirata Hiroaki voicing a character of this anime that also made the voice of Sanji in One Piece.\r\n+ Beautiful animation+ Good character design.\r\n+ Pretty cool soundtrack that makes me remind of Shingeki no Kyojin one.\r\n+ Beautiful landscapes, well designed world in ruins.\r\n+ Really cool weapons called God Arcs that make fights interresting.\r\n- Characters without determination.\r\n- Poor character development, about the past of them for exemple.\r\n- The story that did not advance a lot, it turned around.\r\n- The opening and endings that are pretty bad.\r\n- Normal aragamis that are not dangerous, when you are ready to fight they attack, butwhen you have to talk or to wait someone that would save you, they just wait.\\n\\n\r\nDon't forget that it's just my opinion, but I think that it's just a worse version of Shingeki no Kyojin in every point, but Shingeki no Kyojin is fantastic, so it's not really fair to criticize an anime just because there is better. Yeah, to the end it was cool to watch, but it was not fantastic neither. The animation is really cool, the voice acting is pretty good with few big names of the voice acting, and the soundtrack was not bad. Except that, there is nothing special, the story and the character development is way too poor.",

            "content": "After seeing some of the total crap reviews of this anime, I felt inclined to do one of my own.\r\nI won't summarize sections, let's just say of all the categories none received below a 9 for me.  Chars, story, art, etc...all great.\r\nFor the fanboys rating this anime down because it has similarities to Attack on Titan, such as humanity dying off so are living in a walled in area to be safe....  Get over yourself, that's in a MILLION animes and movies, and guess what Attack on Titan wasn't the first.  You'd know that if you didn't have your head so farup AoT's butt that you can't even see the light of day anymore....\\n\\n\r\nMoving on....the characters are good.  Sure some chars piss you off at times, they are supposed to though.  No one wants a show where everyone always does EXACTLY what we think they should do and never screws @#$% up.  I really liked several of the chars, even the female leads some folks are griping about.  Also whoever said the acting was bad HAD to be having a stroke when they watched it or watched the English dubbed version...which who are we kidding, 99.9995% of all English dubbed animes have worse than crap acting, no shocker there, that's why you should just watch the subbed version....it's GREAT.\\n\\n\r\nI for one, actually prefer this anime over AoT (and I'm not saying that because I dislike AoT....because I don't, i actually REALLY enjoy it a lot - just being honest).  For one, I like the lack of zip line fighting and not having too see some of the dumbest looking twats running around nude as \"titans\" just makes this more appealing to me.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime while, agree there are some BROAD similarities is NOT Attack on Titan...you can watch both animes, and enjoy the hell out of both, never once feeling like \"oh I've seen this before\", etc...  They are truly both unique in their own right, within their own stories ... especially how the heroes totally differ in their abilities and power to be able to fight back.  The stories are truly are quite different once you realize that just because it's an end of the world / let's save humanity scenario doesn't make the other 90% of the story that's told have to be the same as other shows with that general premise, because it's not.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short....this is a GREAT anime.  VERY much worth a watch, so ignore some of the harsh ratings on here, those folks clearly just don't like this sort of thing (which is fine, to each their own), are too much of AoT fanboys to even enjoy anything else, or were experiencing that time of month when they wrote their review.  So...ignore their BS, hell ignore mine if you want, but at least watch the anime and make your own choice...it's worth the watch and I think you'll be glad you did.",

            "content": "Based by the game for PSP, God Eater. This is one of the few anime adaptions from the game that I find attachment to it. \r\n* Story (9) - The series start with a slow pace, focusing on how the main character, Lenka will face his own struggles on defeating the Aragami. Later on the anime is starting to pick up a reasonable pace where we are greeted by more fighting. \r\nWhat I like about this anime is that they actually try and give the main character a background story which is not available on the game. The ending will give you the feeling ofhaving a season 02 but I seriously doubt it. \\n\\n\r\n* Art (10) - The first time I saw this anime, it has the 3D feel to it, but it surprisingly fit in. This will seriously stay in your mind for awhile because of its unusual art style and the way it is animated. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters looked entirely different and you can easily remember their names as well. Background, there's nothing much we can do about it because the humans are technically on the brink of destruction thanks to the Aragami,\\n\\n\r\n* Sound (10) - VAs of this anime did a job well done. It feels like their voices suited the characters. The acting is also believable like they pour their emotions as if they were the characters themselves. They didn't overreact. They reacted like the way we should have acted. \\n\\n\r\n* Character (10) - There are some major and minor character developments, but none is left behind. Every character has faced some hardships with life and they have to deal with it of course. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters you may find it annoying or cringeworthy to watch but sometimes we have to understand that they faced some hardships and they do often overreact because they are tired or traumatized. \\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment (10) - Even though I give it a perfect score, it is not exactly the anime I would rewatcha fter a month or so, because the anime can give a big impact or little impact that you may forgot what the anime is all about. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason behind the perfect score, it is because until now, I still remember how the protagonists react to one another or to a battle and such. It has taken a place of my mind and that is like   6 - 7 months ago. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating is 10 - They did a good job on trying their best to make the anime realistically enough for us viewers. If you know the game, then you should also know that they changed some things from the anime to make it more logical for us. I think you will know what I mean if you did some research of the game itself. \\n",

            "content": "I think I will lead off with the fact I am ignorant of the source material but I hear it's based on a video game; and it kind of shows. The good: It looks superb! The animation is gorgeous, the colors are live and vibrant. The animation is smooth and makes the action sequences worth watching. The character designs are interesting and diverse, though a little impractical considering their line of work.The back story for this series is fascinating and makes me wish we could see a series about that and the early days. That's not enough to warrant a higher rating though. \r\nThe badhere is there is nothing else to speak of, nothing else stands out about this series. The enemies are less diverse and blase as the grim from RWBY, and just about as interesting & important. The characters are so cliched and one dimensional that one often imagines them as better, more developed characters from other series; or wishing they were.  It has some cool action scenes but that's all. Nothing else here is all that memorable. \\n\r\nI could have forgiven all that and gave this series a three but there's the ugly to deal with. After nine episodes I'm left wondering, \"Couldn't this have been summed up in a two hour motion picture?\" Given the actual amount of story and plot here couldn't this just have been a movie? Now the series has concluded with 13 episodes and this review still remains valid. Nothing in episodes 10 - 13 helped to change my mind or opinion of this series. Worse they only served to kill off Lindow, something everyone who watched the opening know was gonna happen anyway. That's why I didn't put it in a spoiler section.\\n\r\nIn conclusion watch it in between other things to watch.\\n",

Too many plot hole as well.\r\nThe action scene are very slow pace, monsters alway wait until you finish talking. If you are surrounded by monsters, you won't die, theres always someone helping, and they won't give you any fatal wound. Even if you are wounded and fell to the river, don't worry, there will be a first aid kit pop out of nowhere that keep you alive. \r\nCharacters are so dumb and naive, even those who fought for a long time. Theyare often running in open space so monsters can surround them; god eaters fight like savages, no cheography, no strategy, counter measure or whatsoever. Conversations are so fake and a lot of them are meaningless. Lot of meaningless scenes as well. They could cut few episodes and it still look good. Shortly, too many unlogical and unrealistic details. \\n\\n\r\nArt is good but design is a disaster. Weapon is kinda mixing between gun and sword that remind you of final fantasy, but the design is so terrible. I was expecting different kinds of weapon like spear, hammer... Monsters...well, at least please make the \"boss\" look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound fx is good, music is so so. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is pretty good since they reveal everything at the end and make you want to waste more time to watch next season.",

            "content": "'God Eater' - An exceptionally animated 13 episode series set in an apocalyptic, futuristic environment, based on the 2010 video game of a similar name. \r\nMy first statement on the show is that of a warning; this series does not have astounding character development, nor does it have a particularly memorable story or ending. The reason why I feel the need to make this review is because although the series lacks in those features, it compensates in some of the best animation and sound I have experienced in an anime. \r\nStory - 5/10\r\nThe situation presented in God Eater is fairly unoriginal, and executed quite poorly.The protagonist Lenka Utsugi has a personal grudge against 'Aragami', fast evolving monsters that are effectively pushing the human race to the brink of extinction. Without going into too much detail, Utsugi has a special ability and uses this against the Aragami. As many of you will have realized, the setting is comparable to that of Shingeki no Kyojin, but unfortunately God Eater fails to reach the same story quality. The pacing felt unbalanced; there were several moments where I felt that too much happened in a short period of time, whilst other instances dragged out to an unnecessary degree. The end of the series was average, with an appropriate climax, but many loose ends and a lack of closure that would hint towards another season. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where God Eater truly shows its strength. Facial emotions are conveyed perfectly, action sequences are animated beautifully and smoothly, and the backgrounds are nothing short being perfectly designed. If you can appreciate a unique yet astounding art-style, then God Eater's animation quality is the single reason good enough for me to recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nLike the art, the sound in God Eater reaches near perfection. The opening and closing themes flow perfectly and are engaging. The soundtrack used throughout the series effectively conveys and enhances emotions towards the viewer, whilst not feeling intrusive on the overall setting. Once again, I highly recommend this anime to those who appreciate great OST's. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters within God Eater are not bad, nor are they exceptional. As the series progresses, more background information on the main characters are shown through flashbacks and episodes set in the past, but very little significant character development actually occurs. There were a few notable characters in the series, such as Rindou Amamiya, and Souma Schicksal voiced by the amazing Kazuya Nakai (Mugen from 'Samurai Champloo'). However, the character of Alisa Illinichina Amiella was the greatest shortcoming in the series, turning what could have been a great character with potential for development into a whiny, crying brat. She alone reduced my personal enjoyment of the series significantly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nI approached this show with the mindset of 'this probably won't have a great story, but the animation will look good', and my expectations were thoroughly met. There were many literal jaw-dropping moments, and one scene in particular after the airplane sequence was possibly the best 5 seconds of anime I have experienced. To feel and relate the absolute hopelessness of the characters is something very few series can achieve, and this anime manages to do it. Enjoyment would have been another 10/10 if not for the constant pace shifts and the character of Alisa. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 38/50\\n\r\nAs stated throughout the review, I highly recommend this to people who enjoy great art-style and soundtracks. The story and characters are nothing special, but there are a few moments in which this anime conveys and afflicts the viewer with raw emotion perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, so apologies in advance if there was anything missing or incorrectly presented. \\n",

I'm the type of person who nearly enjoys every anime, which has a serious story and entertainment! \r\nAlso, this is a new \"kind\" of review by writing Pros and Cons :)\r\nSo have fun and if you want do discuss, please text me!\r\nPROS:\r\n+ Amazing artwork ( even if it takes getting used to)\r\n+ Awesome and just godlike Soundtracks! They fit in every situation being epic, emotonial, sad and cool! (made by the band \"Ghost Oracle Dive\" --> GOD)\r\n+ No really unnessecarycharacters! Some are badass, some have problems and chrisis to solve. Lenka (main) is very well done (ok, sometimes he overplays it a bit). But in general all main charaters and second characters are nice designed, have good properties and have a meaning!\\n\r\n+ Good and intense fighting scenes which aren't too long and boring\\n\r\n+ Quite enjoyable story ( yeah it's a standard apocalypse story, but it adds some really good features likes God Arcs, Aragami, egis, etc.)\\n\r\n--> Yeah these were the most important \"Pros\" you need to know about\\n\r\n       Just because of them, the anime is worth it!!!\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Aragamis sometimes are bad animated (looks not good in some scenes)\\n\r\n- Lenka (main) sometimes acts too dramatic, which doesn't fit well in some situations. (Generally some characters overdo it in some scenes)\\n\r\n- \"standard\" story, very simular to AOT\\n\\n\r\nSo, and now to conclude: Just watch this cool anime and have your own opinion! I can really recommand it, because the positive aspects predominate strongly and there are only 13 eps!\\n\\n\r\nx Have Chance and Luck! x \\n",

He has seen really brutal events in his entire lifetime and continues with his bad luck to the end but somehow his \"strong spirit\" manages to keep him optimistic toward everything and make him stronger and eventually effect people who are near him.

            "content": "Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors. Kinda writing it half-asleep after staying up to binge this for no reason. I'm not likely to come back and fix any mistakes.\r\n-----\r\nSo, screw this show. Right off the bat, it's cliched and just not good. I absolutely hate when an anime expects you to care for a character that had only a couple lines that weren't even that good and died in the first episode. I can't care for a character I don't know. Making them look kinda different from the background characters and giving them a name doesn't automatically make them someone the audience cares about.\r\nIknew right then I was gonna hate it. I do hate it. I would not recommend this show to anyone. However, I stuck with it because I'm a reclusive waste of space and it didn't suck to look at, so why not?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you want to watch it, like, even a little bit, there's no reason not to. Ultimately it's a waste of a couple hours, but while the it's complete shit everywhere visuals aren't concerned, it's a pretty enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is shit, but not complete shit. I don't have much to say about it. Maybe if you played the game, you'd have a bit more on it, but I haven't and I shouldn't be prerequisites to watch a show, so I'm going to assume I don't need prior knowledge of the game. In the end, I just don't care. Nothing made me care about the people in the fucking show. It's just shit and ultimately not a story anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of this anime is it's visuals. I won't go far as to say they're top notch, best I've ever seen, but they didn't suck. It looks great, in fact. The problem is the choreography during the fight scenes and the general direction, visually. It seemed to change a bit. I had read that the show was put on hold in the middle of airing due to internal conflicts, so perhaps that had something to do with it. I don't care enough to find out.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the visuals are fine and the only thing I can actually praise this show for, but the actual execution during the show was done in an off-putting way.\\n\\n\r\nThe weapons look pretty fucking stupid, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Fuck it. It was rare that the music was used correctly to impact me in any way. When it wasn't, the music just seemed like it was trying to illicit emotions out of me for free, and fuck any anime that thinks it can do that, I will burn its house down with lemons. When the music was used correctly, it just felt like they accidentally got something right with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself isn't bad. I personally wouldn't put them in any of my playlists, but I didn't hate it.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was generic stoic adults and loud, angsty teens. Not complete shit, but it's not getting any points.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is a character? I'm asking on the writer's behalf because they wrote one kinda decent character as a secondary character, and then made the main character, which started with less character than a potato, and made him a clone of that secondary character. Every other \"character\" just seems like a lump of plot information with a name, face, and relation to another lump we can tack onto them.\\n\\n\r\nThis piece of shit of an anime was surprisingly enjoyable. It's not worth going out of your way to watch this show for, but if you choose to sit through it, you won't hate every single second.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I guess this show's halfway decent, especially in the latter half. I wouldn't be surprised if it started getting better in the episodes following the hiatus, but I don't care enough to check.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this show. After the first episode, I had to force myself to start the second, but it honestly did get considerably easier to start the third, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, in the first episode, the main character's one of those reckless un-thinker characters that just do things in the name of someone the audience doesn't care about so that they can get beat up and stand up stronger because that's what needs to happen because plot. I CANNOT stand when characters do that. There is never any reason for it other than being a cheap and easy way to start the plot. That was the reason I had trouble passing episode one, but after that, the 'character' did a 360 and started being competent SOMEHOW. I hate when that happens, too.\\n\\n\r\nBlegh.",

            "content": "So God Eater is a post-apocalyptic anime about human fighters known as God Eaters that take on the monsters that kill humans known as the Aragami. It follows Lenka Utsugi, a human who commits himself into killing all of the Aragami. overall, is it worth watching? I will have to say it is.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is actually really good and is part of why this anime is worth watching. While is does seem to rip off from Attack on Titan and has the first two episodes losing its audience, the third episode brings in all the action needed to bring them back to their seatswatching the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNow this is the main reason to why this anime is worth watching! The art style is godlike in terms of amazement. The CGI is well done and not overused. The animation is spectacular, and overall, it seems different from the art of a lot of other anime, but in a great way, being close to realistic. Of course this is by none-other than Ufotable themselves who are also the makers of Fate/zero, and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (series), two amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 7/10:\\n\r\nwhile I am not into anime soundtracks, I will admit that it had a decently good soundtrack, despite most of the songs with noticeable auto-tune voices. The opening song, Feed A by Oldcodex, is great, not only in tune, but also in fitting context. The ending song, Kouhai Chi by Go Shina feat. naomi, is a bore fest, but it fits with the dark theme, so points for that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10:\\n\r\nYeah some points had to be cut off from this aspect because most of the characters seem to have personalities taken from Attack On Titan characters (e.g., Lenka Utsugi and Eren Jaeger, Alisa Illinichina Amiella and Mikasa Ackerman, Soma Schicksal and Levi Ackerman), but why the characters are the way they are, they are explained during the anime. Also, most of the characters are actually really likable, and Alisa, while wearing skimpy clothing, is not just there for fanservice as some might think of it to be, but is actually more as an important plot point for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10:\\n\r\nWith such great animation, badass fight scenes, showing the gore when it's needed, and an overall likable cast of characters, this anime is really enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10\\n\r\nWhile this is not the best anime of all time, it is still a great anime to watch, great especially for the art style and animation.  In conclusion, this is a great anime adaptation of a video game and will go down as one of the best anime of 2015.",

Seeing how these reviews are going, it seems you have to compare this to other anime to clarify how good of an anime this is. If compared to other anime in its genre, it wouldn't stand as high as some of the other mainstream anime. It uses many of the generic baselines, IE: apocalypse wasteland, lust to get revenge, Kill all protect all ect ect.. If you solely watch the anime in an of it self, I personally think you'll thoroughly enjoy this anime!",

            "content": "God Eater is one of the more.. disappointing shows I've watched. Legendary Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works/Heavens Feel and Kara no Kyoukai studio managed to certainly MAKE a story with the adaptation of the PlayStation Portable game of the same name, but after both watching the show and playing the game, I can't help but feel the show is the more inferior of the two, even with the gimped controls of the handheld.\r\nA story that hops between plot points like an Olympic gymnast with little to no care of the actual chronological order of things, with bland character arcs that felt like their storyboards gotmixed around in the planning room, cop-outs that slap you in the face if you were expecting something that was supposed to happen and shove \"Something Unexpected\" into your hands and forces you to smile and say \"thank you,\" but an interesting premise that I just hoped would have been handled better makes me give the story a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were unique if at some points a bit risque, and the monster designs were faithfully adapted from the game. The world looks and feels like a completely barren wasteland, with only small refuges of humanity left. Ufotable ceases to fail in its art direction, so I give that a 9.\\n\\n\r\nFeed A by OLDCODEX certainly captures the feel of what the show is SUPPOSED to be, a gritty fight for survival against insurmountable odds by those who are humanity's last protector, and Kouhai Chi by Go Shiina and naomi does a splendid job of instilling the hope that \"maybe, just maybe they'll pull through.\" While Human After All by GHOST ORACLE DRIVE and BiSH tells you that this grueling endeavor is over and you can rest, for now. Outside of the music, the sound design for the Aragami are pleasantly recreated and upgraded from the game, so the sound design gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters from the God Eater video game return in the anime, minus item vendor and other, minor NPCs, so the only real original character here is the main character, Utsugi Lenka. A cardboard cutout with little to no character backstory, who fills the role of the main character I guess, seeing as the game had a custom character that you created. But, most if not all the character customization choices give your character in-game life, he/she isn't just some person whose goal is to kill Aragami, and the lack of certain characters makes the world feel a little less alive. In the game there were different character interactions depending on if you finished an important mission or not, ie. a little girl mourning a character's death, a guy having a crush on an operator, and cooperation with God Eaters' outside of the main cast are kept to a minimum or removed entirely. All that along with no more growth from any of the returning cast leaves the story at a 5.\\n\\n\r\nI originally went into God Eater with the only knowledge of the ip being from when I saw around seven seconds of gameplay four years ago, so I wasn't expecting really much at all. I felt let down by the slow pacing yet the overarching story was what kept me from dropping it. Every episode has a flashback sequence which explains, over the course of the thirteen episodes, how the world came to be like it is. Which, is a good sentiment if everything wasn't in grayscale and exposition was handled by the characters better. And, when all was said and done and the credits rolled on the thirteenth episode I got my hands on the first game and became even more disappointed. So much potential could have been sought to fruition if the show was just a little bit more fast pace or just a couple of episodes longer. But, because this is the final product, I can't help but see a wasted chance for another great anime under Ufotable's belt, so my enjoyment was a 4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, God Eater was really middle of the road. Yes, it's an adaptation of a video game, but it didn't do as horribly as other adaptations. Yes God Eater itself is a relatively niche game so really only die-hard God Eater fans can enjoy God Eater to its fullest, but I feel when making a show like this niches shouldn't be specifically catered to. And yes the production and the action sequences were incredible, but the pacing and dialogue were flat, leaving only gore and fanservice to sate one while watching it. Finally, yes, CG can definitely be done horribly and ruin an experience, but despite the unnaturalness of seeing 3D CG, it feels like it belongs due to the unnaturalness of the Aragami. So, God Eater gets an overall 5 in my book.",
