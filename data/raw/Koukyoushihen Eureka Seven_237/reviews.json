I said why not and proceeded to get all of its 50 episodes. I started watching it only recently, after going through Ergo Proxy. Upon opening the first episode, I went o_0 then 0_0 instantly! Eureka Seven has a great OP and accompanying music! This promised to be a great anime. I could not resist going on after seeing the first episode. I can say I went through the episodes likea breeze, almost refusing to stop!\\n\\n\rSo, let me just say it here, loud and clear: Eureka Seven is DEFINITELY THE BEST ANIME I HAVE SEEN! It was a total addiction to me, and it still is!\\n\\n\rBear with me, this review will be quite lengthy! Eureka Seven (E7) really deserves it anyways!\\n\\n\r- [ Animation = Excellent = 10 ] -\\n\\n\rThe animation of E7 is really, and I mean it,  really impressive! The characters are extremely well drawn. Not your general, wide-eyed anime models but they are definitely well made. Their features are very well-detailed and their appearance is very good. Their clothes are futuristic and kinda cool in a way. E7 involves mechas, and as you could expect, they are quite stiff and roughly drawn. NO! They are the opposite! Their designs are well-polished and smoothly drawn. Here too, the features are very well-detailed. The motion of both characters and mechas are extremely smooth and not glitchy, specially considering that E7 involves something called \"reffing\" which resembles snowboarding. Even at the apex of fast-paceness, the motion is real smooth. The characters' movements are natural and not robotic and their poses are very human-like. Granted, the mechas look a bit like Evangelion's or perhaps even RahXephon's. But in E7, they are well coloured, and in my opinion, better designed. In a way, the way the characters were designed represent their personality. I'll leave it at that without elaboration. Go find out for yourself!\\n\\n\rNow, the backgrounds and sceneries of E7 are again impressive. Well detailed, well drawn, good play on lighting and atmosphere gives them a truly unique feel. You won't be seeing much scenery anyway, as most of the scenes will be above clouds. But when you do see real scenery, it's nice! They vary from the lively towns, to lush and wild nature and colourful flowers, to the dark and grungy industrial zones and to the dark, moody and emotional scenes. The transition between these scenes is so smooth that you rarely notice that you have suddenly changed decors! The light works was well done and will give more life and vividity to scenes. Notice the rock textures and how light is used to bring out the relief. The people at BONES have done something very good here.\\n\\n\rThe greatest part of the animation lies in the battle and action scenes, particularly those involving the characters \"reffing\". The action is so smooth! There are no robotic movements, even when the action is at its climax and everything is going fast. No blurs, no glitches and no flaws! Great!! And also, there are almost no frame re-use except for flashbacks (there are not many). Take for example, in Shaman King. Yoh is always seen summonning Amidamaru and this scene is in most episodes. Here, you won't find such repeating scenes often. Even if there are some repeats, they are different in their own ways.\\n\\n\r- [ Sound = StoryWriter wins! = 10 ] -\\n\\n\rI don't usually pay much attention to sounds and music in animes. Story, characters and animation usually get my attention. With E7 however, things are different! The OST for Eureka Seven is much varied from hard rock to electronic music! The OP music was great and I really enjoyed the music. However, the best song according to me, remains Storywriter by Supercar! I long to hear it again and again, and it has made it to my top favourites! It makes a really great accompaniment for action scenes, trust me. Yeaaaahhhhhh! The techno beats you hear during fights or the rock you hear during major events are g.r.e.a.t!!!!\\n\\n\rE7 makes heavy use of music since there are lots of action scenes. However, for every scene, whatever it is (emotional or fast paced), the music chosen is right! It really highlights the scenes and make them so much more interesting! Definitely a good choice of music in E7, and definitely worth a listen! Sound effects too are present and nicely integrated into the scenes. Notice the wind \"whoosshhh\" when the chracters are reffing, and the sound of flapping clothes. It gives added realism to the scenes. Sometimes, you can hear accompanying explosions after a major bang! It's nice to note these, just for added realism.\\n\\n\rThe voice actors did a pretty good job too! However, for some characters like Anemone or MoonDoggie, you can have some difficulty to understand them, due to their accents. Anyway, it's not a real problem if you got fansubbed episodes, or subbed DVDs.\\n\\n\r- [ Story = Complexity and Details = 9.9 ] -\\n\\n\rEureka Seven starts with our main male character, Renton aged 14 in his hometown of Bellforest, enjoying his life, albeit 14 years of boredom as he mentions. One day, a huge robot (an LFO) crashes in his grand-father, Alex's workshop. Out of it emerges a beautiful young girl, our main female character, Eureka. Dumbfounded by her beauty and mysteriousness, Renton is immediately love-struck. However, the millitary was pursuing Eureka. Eureka is a member of GekkoState - a sort millitia/anti-government, non-conformist reffers group, led by Holland. Eureka must return to GekkoState at all costs. However, Holland had another mission - to get the Amita Drive from Alex, a device developed by Renton's late father and world hero, Adrock Thurston. To help in Eureka's escape, Renton grabs his reffing board and tries to deliver the Amita Drive to Eureka who is now escaping in her LFO, the Nirvash. Inspired by his all-time hero Holland, Renton would like to join GekkoState to train as a mechanic. Holland, accepts (although not very gladly), and so Renton becomes GekkoState's youngest member, and his adventures and romance now start. \\n\\n\rSome main characters are Talho, main pilot of GekkoGo. Holland, the commander. Ken-Goh, the weapons expert. Stoner, photographer and editor of Ray=Out magazine which is very anti-government and was hence banned. Hap, second commander and Holland's friend. Misha, the on-board doctor. Jobs and Woz, the ship engineers. MoonDoggie, catapult operator and secondary pilot. Gidget, communications operator. Hilda and Matthiew, LFO pilots. And Renton and Eureka, Nirvash pilots and main characters. And also, the Nirvash LFO can also be considered a character at the end of E7.\\n\\n\rOk, my description is not very great but story is really one of the greatest strengths of E7. The plotline is really complex and deep. Agreed, you have one main plotline that runs through the entire series. However, what is interesting is the way that plotline is explored from various angles and according to various characters' point of view. This gives an added understanding of the plotline. You will also see many innovative things like Trappar Particles, LFO's, Reffing, Amita Drive, and Coralians! Indeed, it's a very elaborate plotline. Interestingly enough, you will sometimes find the plotline diverging to explore various side characters' stories eg. William B. Baxter's story. Don't worry, it's here for a purpose - that is of explaining the global situation from different people's perspective.\\n\\n\rThe story runs very deep, exploring such things as war and conflicts between friends, companionship, unfaltering loyalty, indomitable will to protect, duty, love, sense of justice, and the loss of close-persons. Sometimes, the emotions get real heavy and the sensitive views might be moved to tears, no joke! It can become very heavy and emotional sometimes, specially scenes involving the above-mentioned. It's a very well detailed plotline, with many interesting twists that add spice to an already very interesting story. It's a good blend of romance, action, mecha and adventure. Definitely my type!\\n\\n\rThrough the course of the story, you will have the opportunity to explore the characters' past and get to know them better. You won't find many loopholes or dark points here as everything is well explained. Expect emotional warfare, painful pasts, jealousy, self-sacrifice, the death of companions, inter-crewmate conflicts and resolutions of conflicts by various ways according to the characters, added to some good philosophies about love and the other things I mentioned! It's a nice lesson in a way.\\n\\n\rHowever, expect a major change of pace after Episode 26. You will be seeing more adult-related things, like blood and death more often. Just a warning. Mind you, many weird and frankly, strange things are awaiting you from Episode 31 and onwards! You would think you are in some kind of toon movie! :D\\n\\n\rThe plotline offers no boredom since the characters constantly change and adapt, specially on the emotional level. I like the way the twists in emotions are introduced. It's subtle, but really present. E7 is really a great piece of work and you will see lots of unexpected things. Pay close attentions to the play on words. The GekkoState assault on Capital Hill really got me stuck.\\n\\n\rOne thing to hate is the presence of Maeter, Linck and Maurice! Damn! These 3 kids know how to ruin the mood and atmosphere! In my opinion, they got no place in E7! Another is the complexity of some plots! You don't understand anything at first, but it's revealed after. Although there are some minor things which are left unexplained, or are not given enough elaboration, it cannot beat the greatness of E7. (Except only one which needed more elaboration). Anyways, if you use your brains a bit, it's not hard to figure out those un-explainations! :D\\n\\n\rOverall, E7 has a real smooth way for proceeding with the story, smooth and sweet! Just what I've been looking. No rush, no incessant/useless main character deaths, no plotholes, no fillers, just pure delight. Good job, E7! Frankly, it has the damn B.E.S.T ending I've ever seen so far, surpassing even my previous \"favourite ending\", Last Exile. Eureka Seven devoted almost one episode just for ending, a weird (and surreal) ending! Talk about a good finisher! :D\\n\\n\rAnd now, for a bit of selfishness (shared selfishness IMHO): I WANT EUREKA SEVEN MOVIE TO EXPLAIN EVERYBORY'S ENDINGS! :D\\n\\n\rP.s. Why 9.9 and not 10? Because some important events got left out of the explanations. You could guess what they were, but an explanantion would have been easier. That's why I substracted 0.1 marks!\\n\\n\r- [ Characters = I like the name \"MoonDoggie\" :p = 10 ] -\\n\\n\rOk, it's not *just* because I like the name \"MoonDoggie\" but it's still a very hilarious name! The characters really deserve that 10. I've really seen such a diverse and complex cast of characters. So I think it's better that I introduce some of the main characters first. I can't do that for all of them since there are so many (25-like main characters! Sugoi! :S)\\n\\n\rAnyways, let's start by our main character, Renton. He's what you will call a normal guy. No super-powers a-la-Bleach here. No, he's just normal, leading a normal life. However, he is still the son of Adrock Thurston, the guy who saved the world. Quite a name to carry around. Renton gets accepted on GekkoGo (GekkoState's ship). Now, this is not what he expected. Holland is kind of a slave-master! He kinda get beaten up, get used as a.. duh slave, and things like that. Life's not all pleasant for him, all because Holland is... jealous! LOL! No joke! Anyways, E7 beautifully illustrates his development through it's 50 eps, going from a not-worth-anything to the.. (Spoiler. Cannot tell you!). He's got much ahead of him. I really cannot say more without spoiling major things.\\n\\n\rEureka. Beautiful, quiet, mysterious. Love-at-first-sight for Renton, who would do anything to protect her. Her development is well-presented too. Mind you, strange things are awaiting you at the end of E7, be ready for it! This girl has many secrets and lots of potential. Although, she appears to lack emotions (which Renton teaches her), but she's an adept at LFO combat. Enough here, cuz spoilers are coming if I continue.\\n\\n\rOn with Holland. The master of reffing and Renton (and all kids') all-time god (hero/idol) and commander of GekkoState. Holland appears to be a fun character, and somewhat stern. However, Renton was badly mistaken. Holland is just the opposite of what he seems to be. He is like a father for GekkoState, protecting everybody and self-sacrificing for the sake of others. Midway through E7, he undergoes dramatic changes, all for the best.\\n\\n\rTalho! The captain of Gekko-Go. She is the leash for Holland, restricting his impulses and setting him in the right direction. She has a secret (ok, not so secret) crush on Holland.\\n\\n\rHap, the everything-doer. Not much to say, but he still has quite a role in E7. Similarly, Woz (strange hat man!), Jobs (Hitman's son?), Gonzy, Gidget, MoonDoggie (Doggie Nii-san! LOL!), Stoner and the others have their respective roles to play, but they are very diverse from each other, and each's development is well planned and well presented. Their emotional developments are very well introduced, smoothly and at the correct pace, giving the viewer time to digest the changes and appreciate them.\\n\\n\rThere are characters on the other side (bad side) if you want, like Dominic, Anemone, the Sages the millitary and Dewey. But I can't explain about them without spoiling. Expect something Gundam Seed Destiny-like with Dewew. The others are not so bad, but take soooo long to realise it.\\n\\n\rThe hierarchy is: Sages -> Dewew -> Millitary -> Dominic -> Anemone. Or something like that.\\n\\n\rAs you can see, there are literally lots and lots of characters in E7, and that goes without mentioning important side characters like Diane Thurston, William B. Baxter and the others. They have important roles to play and are here to reveal parts of the E7 plot to us, in a subtle way. It allows the viewer to get a global view of E7 and from different perspectives. There is literally lots and lots to tell about E7's cast, but I leave their discovery to you. I can't spoil the fun furthur.\\n\\n\r- [ Value and Enjoyment = YEAH!!! = 10! ] -\\n\\n\rIf you haven't guessed by now, Eureka Seven is just great and I really enjoyed my watching experience. I am now going to rewatch it, just to get a clearer view of it. In fact, Eureka Seven is one of the rare anime that I have ever rewatched. And frankly, it deserves it. I would rank the rewatch value as \"Very High\". At the end, you will want to rewatch it from the beginning, just to watch the characters and story's evolution again, from a new and enlightened perspective. And to gain a better understanding of E7's magnificent story of course!\\n\\n\rI really, really enjoyed Eureka Seven and it is now my top favourite. It deserves this space. Eureka Seven is a masterpiece, take it from a fellow fan.\\n\\n\rNow, E7 might have some plotholes and some things that weren't elaborated extensively, just as any other anime have. But the positive aspects of E7 fully compensate for these small (tiny) losses. You won't even feel them. Nothing is perfect, but I believe E7 approaches perfection up to its nose!\\n\\n\rAs summary: Rewatch Value? Very High. Enjoyed myself? I kinda went overboard! Was E7 good? Na, no good. It is simply a masterpiece!\\n\\n\r- [ Conclusions ] -\\n\\n\rGo watch Eureka Seven!! That's all there is to say. You won't regret it. I know some people will be dissatisfied with my review, but I am just expressing my opinions. And I consider Eureka Seven to be a true success! Go watch it and draw your own conclusions. I do not think you would regret it. And I am not joking, it really deserves these \"10\"'s from me!\\n\\n\rNow, I sincerely await a movie. Not because was bad (in fact, it was great. Strange but great!). But because I really want to see more of Renton and Eureka, of Holland and Talho, of MoonDoggie and of Dominic and Anemone. I would like more about their endings, and what has become of them. The mere glances I got at the end is not enough to satisfy my hunger! I hope the creators of E7 can hear me! :D\\n\\n\rThank you for reading my review. I know it was long. If something needs elaboration, contact me. I will amend the review where needed. Sayonara and go enjoy Eureka Seven!",

            "content": "\u201cEureka 7\u201d is definitely an entertaining series even if not a great one. The artistry oozing from the animation, designs, and music may help you overlook the story\u2019s schizophrenic inanity. \r\nThe show\u2019s supreme craftsmanship provides the spoonful sugar for its less-than-tasty story. It\u2019s easy to watch these fifty episodes when the characters and their world are as creative and eye-popping as \u201cEureka 7\u2019s.\u201d Bolstering the shows designs and animation is one of the best soundtracks to bless a show; most impressive is the music\u2019s ability to capture each of the story\u2019s emotions with a perfectly mellifluous track.\r\n\u201cEureka 7\u201d suffers mainly from an identity crisis thatends up degrading the overall story. It begins as a really fun, rebels-versus-establishment adventure set in a world where skaters and hipsters reign as the supreme good guys. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they creators would have stuck with this tone; it\u2019s original and fun and would have lent itself perfectly to a. However, the show soon veers toward a melancholy, internal drama, and, before the fifty episodes are over, \u201cEureka 7\u201d takes another sharp turn toward silly romance.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m too harsh, though. \u201cEureka 7\u201d is targeted at teens, and if you can successfully put yourself into the mind of a na\u00efve, romantic teen (see every teen), it\u2019s easier to forgive the show for its flourishes.\\n\\n\r\nLess forgivable, however, is the fragmentation of the story and characters caused by the shifting focus from adventure to drama to romance. Running in so many directions causes \u201cEureka 7\u201d to roll its ankle, and the show never achieves any emotional impact. This is particularly disappointing since many of the characters had great potential to connect with the audience. Unfortunately, with the changes, the characters lose their original luster, drastically degrade into one-dimensional stereotypes, or drop from the story entirely.\\n\\n\r\nAs critical as I may be, please note that I watched \u201cEureka 7\u201d nearly continually at every chance I got. It is, for the most part, an enjoyable series. To best enjoy this show, appreciate the audio-visual experience and always remember the target audience is young teenagers. \\n",

            "content": "At first I was skeptical as to just how good this series would be and the 50 episode runtime was a bit daunting however I began watching anyway as it seemed the most interesting out of the series I have waiting. I can say that I definitely wasn't disappointed. \r\nStory: \r\nI'm sure you've read the synopsis so I won't be mentioning that here. The story moves quicker than what you would expect from such a long series and this is a good thing as it minimizes any time where it would seem to be boring. This is even more impressive when you realize that thereis next to no filler and what filler there is was entertaining and worth watching. The context of the story and the way it evolves isn't over the top or unbelievable, it unfolds at a steady pace the entire time and doesn't ever feel rushed or drawn out either. I see that a couple others have said that at times it is hard to follow but that isn't the case at all if you're paying attention and overall its an enjoyable journey with a satisfactory ending even if it left you wanting just a couple more answers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art is definitely above average, the animation is smooth and the colour scheme works well. It is a great support for everything else and the variation in quality across the span of the series is minimal. There were times when a certain lack of shading was noticeable but they quickly passed. Its not the best around but it is very good and considering the length makes it all the more impressive. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is the only section i'll score a perfect 10, it really is outstanding. The music from the openings to the endings and everything in-between is enjoyable and not something you'll get sick of. Every track seems as if it could have been made to be used here and truly makes part of the show what it is. Sound effects and the like are perfectly acceptable, definitely above average. I haven't heard the dub so I can't comment on it but the Japanese voice acting fit well and no characters voice felt out of place. Overall a very pleasing experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are great, you won't see any cardboard cutouts here, each character is multi-dimensional and all add to the story. Eureka at first seems distant and not quite developed but thats exactly how she's meant to be, you find yourself waiting for scenes where she and Renton interact with eachother for this is where alot of entertainment comes from. Seeing her grow as a person from that is quite something. That leads me to Renton, an average kid by all means, at times its downright annoying how naive and childish he really is but he learns from it and by the end you can truly see how he has grown. With all of this you may be asking why I rated it only an 8, thats because of the three kids, maybe I just dislike kids altogether but they cry at the drop of a hat, mess things up due to their own selfishness and are just a plain annoyance, I found myself becoming slightly irate everytime they were on screen. However i'm sure thats how people sometimes feel around real kids as well so if they were given just a little less screen time I guess I could have brushed it off. Overall the character development is really great especially concerning Eureka and Renton, further more apart from the kids I didn't find myself disliking any character which is a testament to how well made they all really are. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI watched the series in three days and it never felt like it dragged on, I was always eager to see what came in the next episode and overall I really did enjoy this series. It just has the feeling of being enjoyable, taking you on a ride and you find it hard to leave. Once again I felt the kids detracted from this but whatever shortcomings they bring are immediately made up for by the rest. Enjoyment level for this series is high. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end its an interesting, enjoyable and great series. Don't let the length put you off, if you watch anime then this is something you should see.",

            "content": "Eureka seveN is about saving the world! ...Eventually!!\r\nSTORY - A strange girl and her mecha enter Renton\u2019s life one day. He quickly develops a crush on her and decides to leaves his home and stay with her by joining Gekkostate, a group of outlaws and his childhood heroes. Shenanigans follow. There are vague and unclear plot developments that happen in the background, but the actual story will not really start to manifest for another twenty or thirty episodes, and even then, it\u2019s difficult to figure out what exactly anyone\u2019s try to do, much less how they intend to do it. Eureka seveN has some ofthe most frustrating and ridiculous pacing I\u2019ve ever seen. Many of the first dozen or so episodes feel like filler \u2014 some characters are developed and some histories are uncovered, but you are pretty much following the Gekkostate around as they take odd jobs to pay for food. You know they are rebels, but you don\u2019t know why they\u2019re rebelling or what they hope to accomplish. People attack and they fight back. They investigate things, but there is no clear sense of purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, there are several high-tension and climatic moments, but again, thorough explanations are difficult to come by and many of the characters don\u2019t seem to really know what\u2019s going on either. They are just compelled to put themselves into situations without understanding why, and when each climax is over, life goes on\u2026 to even more filler-like episodes; it\u2019s as if they\u2019re trying to make you forget about any plot-relevant developments by inserting that pointless soccer episode. Instead of devoting time to the overall plot of the series, Eureka seveN spends a lot of time developing more general themes like religious discrimination, family relationships, responsibility, and identity. While that isn\u2019t terrible in itself, it would have been infinitely better if plot progression (and explanation) didn\u2019t have to be sacrificed for them (and if the characters involved were more sympathetic).\\n\\n\r\nEventually, and by eventually, I mean like, the last ten episodes, things finally start falling into place and there is a lot of late exposition. Some of the overarching ideas could have been deduced from earlier clues, but a majority of the details couldn\u2019t have been, further making the bulk of the series feel scattered and unimportant. There is also a lot of \u201csurprise\u201d revelations and character \u201cdevelopment\u201d near the end that feel incredibly cheap and unnecessary. The final plot of the series, when all is revealed, is actually pretty interesting. A lot of the concepts presented are thoughtful and unique, if a bit far-fetched in some regards. It\u2019s a story with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, because of the insistent, terrible pacing leading up to the late explanation, my patience was completely gone and I couldn\u2019t force myself to care about the story so late in the game. So I sat through the last few episodes just hoping for a good fight to wrap everything up. (But I got rainbows instead.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Renton and Eureka both start off as pretty typical archetypes \u2014 the protagonist boy who wants adventure, and the mysterious girl that you know is special for one plot device reason or another. Neither of them interested me. Instead, it was the crew of the Gekko that initially attracted me and kept me going through those opening filler episodes. Since there is so little going on plot-wise for the first half of the series, most of the focus was on character interaction and relationships. Holland, the captain, quickly establishes himself as an interesting and sympathetic character; he is the one with the rough past and a goal, even if you have no idea what that goal is initially. Talho is also sympathetic, partially because it\u2019s rare to see characters with established romantic relationships. The rest of the ship\u2019s crew offers little beyond the basic support roles; now and again, there were be attempts to spotlight them, but it was never anything really meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as the series progressed, all of the characters got more and more irritating. For someone who is supposedly fourteen, Renton\u2019s perspective and train of thought is incredibly juvenile most of the time and the idiocy of some of his thought processes frustrated me to no end. He chooses to leave his \u201cboring\u201d life behind in pursuit of a girl he just met and knows nothing about and is upset when things don\u2019t go his way. Am I supposed to sympathize with that? He is absurdly naive (can\u2019t even realize when the entire crew is trolling him) and sometimes seems forcibly ignorant, especially when it comes to fighting and his role aboard the Gekko. Eureka is similarly clueless, though she has the excuse of not being \u201cnormal,\u201d for whatever reason. But the most aggravating thing about the pair of them is their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nTo some extent, there is the illusion that their relationship actually develops and matures throughout the series, but the truth is that their relationship is completely idealistic from beginning to end. Renton\u2019s attraction starts off as just infatuation, and yet he immediately decides that he wants to follow her and \u201cbe with her.\u201d Eureka is more ignorant, but as soon as she starts to realize it, there are no longer any doubts. Their misunderstandings are grounded in stupidity and they don\u2019t seem to feel much conviction in their fights, implying that they are too purely \u201cin love\u201d to have serious disagreements. The bumps in their road are superficial at best, including Eureka\u2019s adopted children, who have little point or personality beyond (over-)emphasizing the familial themes present throughout the series. As the primary protagonists, Renton and Eureka\u2019s failure to really make me care about them alongside the haphazard pacing of the story makes me wonder how I managed to finish the fifty episodes series at all, since unsympathetic characters is my #1 reason for dropping series.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Holland also falls down the immaturity path where many of his actions and views are decidedly juvenile and illogical. A believably character flaw, certainly, but as the story refuses to allow him to explain his conflicts and frustrations in detail, it\u2019s difficult to sympathize with the way he acts, and he just gets annoying after a while. Talho was the last character I had any respect for; her jealousies and frustrations were the easiest to deduce and thus the easiest to sympathize with, especially since she actually confronted them now and again. Sadly, the maturity of her character seems to take her out of the spotlight during much of the latter half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nDewey, the primary antagonist, takes his damn sweet time coming into direct relevance since he spends the entire first half of the series lurking in the shadows and vaguely putting together his grand plan. Even when those plans are put into motion though, his motivation remains unclear until the finale, so there\u2019s no chance for understanding or sympathizing with what he\u2019s trying to do. In the interim, Dominic never really presents himself as an enemy and never does anything particularly interesting or relevant; most of the focus is instead on his abusive relationship with Anemone, who, aside from being obviously tsundere for him the whole time, isn\u2019t properly explained until the last five episodes or so (and even then, not very well at all). Additional characters include Charles and Raye, who are unnervingly creepy in their parental affection, and Norb, who is an expository plot device more than an actual character (though he does have an ironic personality).\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE & ANIMATION \u2013 Eureka seveN has some really great battle scenes, but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from BONES. Everything is smoothly animated and fun to watch, so even though I has very little emotional investment in the characters and subsequently, the actual outcomes of the battles \u2014 I still liked watching them. The mecha designs are a bit reminiscent of those from Evangelion, but there\u2019s a lot more variety between the various suits, including the way they\u2019re piloted (especially when you consider the typeZERO VS the typeTheEND). The giant boards and surfing parallel seemed kind of ridiculous at first, but it really grew on me after a while (besides, Code Geass had rollerblading mechas, though Eureka seveN debuted first). At the very least, the concept makes flying sequences much, much more interesting, and the added danger of a pilot losing their board mid-fight is fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs in the series are simple and attractive, and I really liked that a few of the characters made a point to change their appearances at certain points in the story, usually in correspondence with a significant change in their mindset and goals. More series should do this, if only to accentuate the fact that their characters actually mature over time.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - There\u2019s obviously a ton of hiphop influence in this series, so it was no surprise to see it reflected in the music as well. It\u2019s always nice to mix up the game a little by injecting some atypical genres into the soundtrack, and Eureka seveN does a good job here. Additionally, there is a ton of really, really epic music that is occasionally paired with a scene that\u2019s quite a bit less than epic, which makes things feel out of place. \u2014 those tracks would probably sound better independent of the series so they don\u2019t seem so pretentious. About halfway through the show, I finally noticed Naoki Sato\u2019s name in the opening credits and had an \u201cahha! that\u2019s why the music is awesome\u201d moment. The last time I heard Sato\u2019s work was in the X TV series, where the music was its single greatest asset. It\u2019s not quite as true here, but it\u2019s close.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t pay attention to most of the opening and ending themes in Eureka seveN. I enjoyed the rap in the second opening, \u201cShounen Heart,\u201d by Home Made Kazoku, but most of the others were pretty forgettable, especially since I\u2019m indifferent towards most of the involved artists. All the themes were also much shorter than usual \u2014 they hovered around thirty seconds in length, rather than the usual minute.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING \u2013 I saw this series dubbed, which probably further contributed to my lack of sympathy towards Renton. I didn\u2019t realize that Johnny Yong Bosch was Renton for a long time since the voice was incredibly different from his other roles. Renton sounds (and acts) incredibly young, and his voice was both over-the-top earnest, naive, and whiny. On one hand, it\u2019s actually an incredible fit for the character; on the other hand, it was annoying as hell, especially when coupled with lots of fail dialogue. Stephanie Sheh as Eureka was also rather fitting, but much less irritating. Honestly, the dub cast did a great job: each voice was distinct and unique, and every voice fit their character very well. Crispin Freeman as Holland was pretty badass in particular.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there was a quite a bit of awkward dialogue and word usage. A lot of lines were unnecessarily corny or just outright awkward (like, \u201cMm, smell that? That\u2019s the smell of your Papa!\u201d \u201c\u2026It smells good.\u201d) though that can obviously be attributed to awkwardness in the original script. I found the use of \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cPapa\u201d in place of \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d kind of strange though, and it sounded unnatural coming from a lot of the characters, especially Renton. Lastly, there are a handful of slips in the pronunciation of \u201cEureka\u201d throughout the series. Most are by minor characters and not particularly notable, but it\u2019s an indication of sloppiness all the same.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Given all the positive recommendations I\u2019d gotten for this series, I\u2019m pretty damn disappointed with how things turned out, especially since the finale revealed that the story could have been ten times more interesting if presented in a more efficient manner. The pacing, along with the quick evaporation of my sympathies towards the cast, really destroyed the little enjoyment I was getting from technical aspects of the show. I really wanted to drop the series around the halfway point, but I figured I\u2019d already invested so much time into it, I might as well finish it (what a stupid train of logic rarely does it reward you in the end). A recap movie of this series might work a lot better since it would, theoretically, cut out a lot of the excess filler crap and force the actual plot out into the open much faster. The recently released Eureka seveN movie, Pocketful of Rainbows, isn\u2019t a recap movie though, so I\u2019m not going to watch it. I\u2019ve had enough of rainbows.\\n",

            "content": "Thankfully, Infinity (the first reviewer) posted a wonderfully analytic review of this anime already, so I can forebear myself to post another. Instead, I just want to reinforce his review with a few short comments on my part.\r\nFirst of all, this anime is, without *any* reservation whatsoever, the best anime I have ever seen. The storyline is engrossing, the character development surpasses anything I have ever seen before (although, admittedly, I don't watch many pure dramas), the animation flows true and clear even through the most active fight scenes, and the sound is perfect. \r\nThe anime begins with this immature kid we see expressing his'modest' dreams to be a great reffer (air surfer) like a great hero of his. Then as we follow this kid through the story, we see his development into a far more mature and responsible person. Similarly, we are introduced early on to a pretty little female character, looking for the world as the stereotypical innocent maiden. But again, as we go on, we learn that (surprise) she actually has a past, and a good story to tell about herself! Character depth is increased incredibly throughout the show!\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, as I stated before, its smooth and clear. I really like how this anime refuses to do the whole 'rinse and repeat' cycle with its scenes. We rarely see repetition, unless actually needed by the story.\\n\\n\r\nI'll finish this off now with a comment about the ending: It is one of the best endings I have ever seen in my life. I can say this openly; this is the *only* other anime aside from the Chrno Crusade that has ever made me cry. Trust me, I don't do that easily. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful show. It has singlehandedly made a spot for itself on my list. After watching this, I moved every single other anime aside from Chrno Crusade down a point because it had set a new standard for quality.",

When I say unpredictable, I hardly mean it in a good way. I enjoyed it in the beginning to some point (when I wasn't sleeping through it) but I was also annoyed by the basically completely unlikable cast (Renton, anyone?) Renton never EVER became anything good in my mind. He was obnoxious even when he grew a pair. Eureka was just too weak in my opinion. Whenever I liked or found a character interesting, they were either killed off or they woulddo something I didn't like. *sigh* I lament having watched this show in its entirety, as by the end, I hated every character and found no satisfaction in the romances or resolution. I also found the story quite whack. Anyway, I admittedly did enjoy the music. Open and End themes were good throughout and the background music was nice too. The art was good at times but often made the characters appear quite ugly. I kept watching this to the end, hoping it would get better but I feel like it got worse. I apologize if I've insulted anyone. I just did not like this anime at all, but I will not say it was a waste of time...",

            "content": "Story: 8 - Sweeping and poignant, but fraught with several filler episodes and inconsistent pacing.\r\nCharacters: 10 - Dynamic and well-developed cast all-around. Flawed, but likable heroes as well as sympathetic and compelling antagonists. \r\nArt: 8 - Fluid and emotive, but with a tendency to go off-model.\r\nSound: 9 - Fantastic use of music, memorable soundtrack, solid voice casting. \r\nEnjoyment: 10 - A fun and emotional ride with surprising complexity and thematic resonance. \r\nFull review:\r\nWhere do I even start with this? There\u2019s just so much going on in this thing that it\u2019s hard to organize my thoughts. Most stories tend to stick to one or two centralthemes, and explore those. E7 takes the shotgun approach, and decides it wants to talk about everything. It has multiple thematic elements, from coming of age, to anti-war messages, to quasi-environmentalism. Several prominent romance arcs. Tons of character development all around. Recurring flower motifs, allusions to American counter-culture movements, and countless nods to other sci-fi and mecha franchises(my favorite of which is the backpack in the episode titled \u201cRunaway\u201c being the same colors as Evangelion Unit 01. I see what you did there, Bones). I\u2019m kind of amazed how much they managed to pack into this show without it becoming nonsensical. And I think ultimately, it does make sense. The story is thematically and logically consistent, and with the exception of a few filler episodes, is reasonably well-executed. The entire first act doubles as foreshadowing for the third, and the third act despite being totally absurd, feels surprisingly free of plot holes and deus ex machina. Any lingering questions can be chalked up to purposefully ambiguous sci-fi nonsense, rather than inadvertently bad writing. I think what fundamentally makes E7 work as well as it does is that it feels less like a linear narrative, and more like a series of individual moments threaded to a common conclusion. Fate isn\u2019t always determined by one catastrophic event or miracle, and life isn\u2019t always a straight path. In that sense, E7 feels as true-to-life as an anime about sky-surfing counterculture resistance mecha pilots reasonably could be. It feels like if these were real people, and real events, things would play out exactly as the show does. In a lot of ways, even more so than RahXephon, E7 seems to be Bones' answer to Evangelion. It borrows a lot of Eva's themes, and character archetypes, but spins them in a much more optimistic way. While Evangelion uses post-modern existentialist ideas of subjective personal reality as a means to self-actualization, E7 takes the opposite approach. We're all stuck in this reality together, and even though interpersonal relationships can be painful, it's also what makes life worth living. And rather than simply internalizing your flaws, using your loved ones supplement those flaws instead. Which is an equally valid, and far more positive point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Bones is a name that carries a lot of weight in the anime world, and it\u2019s impossible not to have a few preconceived expectations going into one of their projects. Fortunately, E7 holds up pretty well. Shortcuts are taken largely where they won\u2019t matter, and special attention is given to the frenetic action scenes and somber dramatic moments. The character designs are distinct and expressive. Many a quiet forlorn glance speaks volumes more than any line of dialogue ever could. Use of color in E7 is all very deliberate and very beautiful. From Eureka\u2019s own soft feminine blues, to the gloomy grayed-out hues of a ruined cityscape. The world of E7 adopts a full range of sentiment and tone, feeling very organic and dynamic in the process. The cinematography is no slouch, either. Gorgeous sweeping landscapes and dramatic close-ups are used liberally and to great effect. With the exception of a few sporadic slips of model consistency, most egregious in the second act, E7 is everything to be expected of a Bones production. And that includes the anime\u2019s absolutely fantastic soundtrack. The electronic techno/hip-hop and cheesy Jpop, usually reserved for shows trying way too hard to be hip and cool, integrates perfectly with the sci-fi counterculture aesthetic. So much so that E7 makes it point to use them in-story on several important occasions. Episode titles are even taken from various song titles. The use of music as a narrative device in E7, while not quite Cowboy Bebop and Princess Tutu levels, is rather impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe series greatest strength, however, and Bones' decided strong-suit, is the characterization. There are at least six complete character arcs in this story, and several smaller arcs for key secondary characters. The characters are dynamic, with their own distinct personalities that color their actions, and inner demons that they struggle to overcome. The way they act, speak, and the decisions they make are all consistent with the people the story makes them out to be. The romantic entanglements are arguably the weakest part of the show, seeming rather forced and melodramatic in a few places, but are still handled more nuanced and naturally than most other attempts. Making the relationships overall emotionally engaging and gratifying. Renton\u2019s frequent missteps with Eureka are especially humanizing. I think everyone can relate to that awkward moment of talking to the girl/guy you like and inadvertently saying something stupid or insensitive. Renton and Eureka have easily the most complete and dynamic character arcs in the series, as well as the most fleshed out relationship. Renton\u2019s journey from immature classical anti-hero, somewhat annoyingly narrated by the other characters, is both satisfying and heartwarming. While Eureka\u2019s humanization is both subtle and endearing. Making the absolute most of her Rei Ayanami archetype, which may be the best I\u2019ve ever seen it executed in a story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eureka Seven is a fun, and remarkably ambitious entry into its genre. It has a lot to say, and articulates in a way that is equal parts simple and meaningful. Aside from some minor pacing issues(I feel the show could have been 39 episodes), a bit of overwrought drama, and a few logical inconsistencies(Eureka\u2018s entire existence doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense in the long run), I don\u2019t really have any major problems with this show. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a flawless masterstroke, but it is definitive proof that \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cthoughtful\u201d are not mutually exclusive. And I think that it\u2019s a testament to what shounen action/adventure anime can strive to be.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is one of those animes that I wanted to watch ever since it came out in 2005. However, I was a kid back then and I was still mainly watching children's anime like Digimon, Pokemon, Beyblade etc. I did, however, watch some of the episodes from some older anime like Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, Outlaw Star and The Big O but for the most part, I was stuck watching kids due to my age. Fast forward to 2012 where not only I was watching anime more regularly but it was the same time were I started to watchmore teen/mature rated anime with my own will on the internet. When I eventually decided to watch Eureka Seven on TV I sadly could not find a channel that shows anime in the UK not to mention the DVDs were going out of print thanks to Beez Entertainment the UK version of Bandi Entrainment closing its store. Now fast-forward to Spring 2016 where one fateful day at the weekend I decided to pick up the out of print Anime Legends DVD collection set from my local CEX store and during that same weekend I marathon it and I aboustly loved it. Now fast forward to the year 2018 where after that unholy train-wreck that was called Darling in the Franxx I decided to re-watch Eureka Seven because not only I wanted to recover myself from the wrath that was Darling in the Franxx but I wanted to see how it holds up since my last watch of it.\\n\r\nSo do I think that Eureka Seven still good?\\n\\n\r\nWell let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story for Eureka Seven follows a young boy named Renton\u00a0Thurston who is currently living a boring life with his\u00a0grandfather in a boring town. While living the boring life Renton dreams of\u00a0joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. However, his life would change forever when\u00a0he meets and falls for Eureka, a mysterious LFO pilot who serves in Gekkostate, an anti-military group under the guise of a counter-cultural commune.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Eureka Seven is brilliant for the most part. While the show is at heart a coming of age story it slowly introduces other story elements such as war, love, and religion, and the show does a fantastic job at slowly blending in other story elements to the core story itself without feeling forced and pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nThe love story of Eureka Seven is by far one of the best love stories I have ever seen in anime. Eureka and Renton relationship in the series was fantastic and well executed. Not only they take the time to understand each other but they chararter chemistry between these two was great especially in the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a brilliant at exploring the themes of growing up, love, understanding one another, reality, human modification, depression and the show does them all great.\\n\r\nI also really loved how Eureka Seven used its tone. The first quarter of Eureka Seven is light-hearted fun but after that, the show started to become pretty dark where we see characters suffering from depression to characters dying left and right. It may not be as dark as Neon Genesis Evangelion but it\u2019s still pretty dark enough. Not to mention the show becomes way more complex as the series goes where they not only the world of Eureka Seven gets beautifully expanded but most of the show's themes that were established now have a darker edge to them.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\r\nMy favourite part of Eureka Seven was when Renton leaves the Gekkostate where he goes on a journey to discover about himself. This is where the coming of age story element comes into play because not only we see the already beautiful world of Eureka Seven being fleshed out even more but we see Renton grow up as a person during those episodes. Not mention the moment when Renton meets Charles and Ray is where the show reached masterpiece status for me as it constancy got better from that point on.\\n\r\n(End Of Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on talking how great Eureka Seven is but I think it\u2019s time to address two of the show minor issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe first issue that I had with Eureka Seven was the pacing in the first quarter of the show. Eureka Seven has pretty good pacing for the most part in general as the second half, in general, is beautifully paced, however, I felt the first quarter of Eureka Seven was pretty draggy where the show seemed to move at a very slow pace. Many events in the first quarter seem to drag on way longer than they should plus it doesn\u2019t help the fact that the character around that point of the story isn\u2019t exactly the likeable bunch where we see Eureka kids being annoying, Renton whining to Holland and Renton screaming contests which usually end up Holland punching Renton in a form of child abuse. Honestly, this wasn\u2019t really an issue for me as I don\u2019t mind shows that have slow pacing but I can acknowledge that it a problem especially for some anime fans who hate slower paced shows.\\n\r\nThe second and final issue that I had with Eureka Seven was that random scorer episode aka episode 39.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, that episode felt like a waste of time because not only it was really awkward to watch but it was just poorly timed where at that point of the story Renton and Eureka have gone through 9 tenths of the character development. If that soccer episode happened in the early episodes than I wouldn\u2019t mind it but since it came in so late in the series it just became distracting.\\n\r\nOverall despite those shortcomings, I thought the story of Eureka Seven was nicely crafted\u00a0\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf you don't count the three annoying kids the characters in Eureka Sever are pretty great. Yes, the characters do start off a bit rough but they really start to grow on you as the series progresses to a point where they become totally different people by the end.\\n\\n\r\nRenton is a brilliant character. Sure he may be a pain in the beginning for some due to his whiny personality but as the series progresses he transforms into a more compelling chararter that I really loved who gets amazing chararter development. Overall great character.\\n\\n\r\nEureka is a great character that I really liked. She starts off as this borderline emotionless girl who has difficulties dealing with her emotions as well as interacting with others but as the series progresses she develops as a character where she starts to understand emotions. Her character development also leads to Eureka falling in love with Renton wherein the second half of the series they have fantastic character chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie I didn\u2019t really liked Holland in the beginning thanks to his psychical child abuse to Renton as being a ass however after a certain event of the series which I won\u2019t spoil he become a much better to a point where not only he becomes a good father figure to Renton but he becomes more of a competent leader.\\n\\n\r\nTalho is a pretty cool character and I really loved his relationship with Holland. She\u2019s the main source of Holland character development in the series however she does have her own character development where she has to fully understand her role in the Gekkostate.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I didn't care for Domanic and Anomone as first thanks to them being copycats of Eureka and Renton however after a short while I really started to adore especially Anemone who became my favourite female character in the show thanks to her wonderful character development and back-story.\\n\\n\r\nThe final character that I want to talk to mention is Charles. I really adored this character to a point where I consider him to be the best characters in the show at times. Not only he has a great manly personality but he\u2019s also the main key of Renton character growth to the show even more than Holland ever did.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were pretty damm good for what they were and they were all enjoyable minus the main villain who is sadly pretty generic.\\n\r\nOther than the three kids as well the main villain the characters in Eureka Seven are great and memorable.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Eureka Seven is a masterpiece.\\n\r\nThe background scenery is very well done as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of the series.\\n\r\nThe charterers designs are also great and charming in they own ways especially for Eureka and Anemone who are some of the best looking female characters I have seen in anime thanks to how charming and unique they are.\\n\r\nThe actual animation for Eureka Seven is wonderful and very well animated.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Eureka Seven are amazing.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nMasterpiece is honestly the best way to describe the music in Eureka Seven. There was an amazing blend of tense, upbeat, emotional and sad tracks that fits well the setting and mood of each respective scenes and conflict.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the opening themes in Eureka Seven are great in their own ways but if I had to pick which one is my favourite it would be opening 4 Sakura which is by far one of the best openings to ever exist in an anime. Not only that the opening was beautiful to listen from start to finish but the way it perfectly captures the tone and events of the final quarter of the series.\\n\r\nThe ending themes are pretty good overall but they are sadly not as memorable as the opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good overall for what it is but the dub is actually way better. Sure Johnny Yong Bosh as Renton can be a bit rough in the in the earlier episodes but once you get to the second quarter and beyond he improves a lot to a point where Johnny Yong Bosh nailed his performance as Renton. The main why I recommended the dub over the sub is because of the other voice actors in the show minus the kids nailed the performance from the respective characters. My favourite performance in the dub includes\u00a0Kari Wahlgren as Anemone, Johnny Yong Bosh as Renton, Kate Higgins as Tahio, and Patrick Seitz as Charles.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nEureka Seven is a great anime that I loved with a passion. Even if the show had some shortcoming I still hold Eureka Seven in very high value. The story for the most was masterfully well executed, the characters minus the 3 kids and the main villain are amazing and well written, the visuals are fantastic and the soundtrack was brilliant. If you\u2019re looking a great coming of age story that has great chararters, fantastic mecha action, and well-done story elements then I recommend Eureka Seven\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime that I will love as long as I live.\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10\\n\\n",

I've never been a big fan of mecha, but this one wasn't just mecha, Eureka Seven had something for everyone. At first I thought Eureka was a little strange, a robot maybe, and Renton's whining got on my nerves, but I was really drawn in, because every episode made me wonder more and more what Eureka was, and what the Gekkostate's goal was. I had originally watched the first five or so episodes in Japanese, but I could actually handle the dub, which Ifound surprising, normally I am totally turned off by the dub. \\n\\n\r\nThe mecha part was very interesting. Eureka's ability to speak with the Nirvash intrigued me, and I liked how the Nirvash developed just as much as Renton or Eureka as the story progressed, as if it was growing and maturing along with them. \\n\\n\r\nOnce Anemone and Dominic joined the story, I was beyond interested. I found the parts with the military very interesting. All of the characters were interesting and had very different personalities. The character development was amazing, you can actually notice Renton becoming more mature (somewhat) and Eureka slowly becoming more confident, and gaining feelings for Renton. The best part about their relationship was that Renton confessed his love, and Eureka didn't really understand or return it at first. It wasn't love she showed him, it was curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story, though it was a little hard to grasp and follow, what with having one plot-filled episode one day and then filler the next. \\n\r\nBut then again, that kept it interesting.",

            "content": "If you fancy settings where great robots surf the skies in epic battles, rebels fight the government without knowing why, the underground magazine they publish is a popularity hit and military engineers help them because they're engineers first, soldiers second, then Eureka Seven might be your cup of tea. If not, consider skipping it.\r\nThis anime has a couple of interesting ideas and moments, and it has some battle animations and a good soundtrack. It is, however, mostly riddled with problems, the first of which is its length. Running at 50 episodes you'd expect it would have a lot to tell. Well, it doesn't. For thefirst 10 episodes, after introducing the rebel force, Gekkostate, their ship and Renton, the kid who joins them, it goes about aimlessly, showing everyday situations of life aboard the ship. I suppose the point was to introduce the crew and establish character but the fact is that by the end of this part we still don't even know the names of most of them. Actually, the same could be said upon finishing episode 50; that's how fleshed out crew members other than Renton, Eureka, Holland and Talho are. Furthermore, the episodes from this arc definitely fail to realise what the first two promise. The introduction of the series presents us with LFOs, giant humanoid robots that both the rebels and the army use to fight and surf the sky (ok, technically the military use KLFs instead of LFOs), and Eureka, the strange girl piloting a rebel LFO, who doesn't seem very aware of social norms but somehow establishes a connection with Renton. Well, for the following 10 episodes all of that is thrown out of the window: battles are scarce and dull, and Eureka barely interacts with Renton (or shows up at all). During the middle chunk of the series stuff starts to happen but the presentation of things is mostly regarding inner conflicts and personal growth and the sorts, without an actual overarching plot gluing things together. Lastly, around the final 15 episodes, Eureka Seven does get a plot but, honestly, who still cares by then?\\n\\n\r\nBut the length isn't the beginning and the end of Eureka's problems; many are there to be found. Like many mecha series, Eureka Seven draws a lot from Evangelion, and pretty much fails at it. This is not to say EVA is perfect or should be the benchmark for mecha series, but the fact is that Eureka Seven invites the comparison rather clearly. So, we have kids (but not only) driving some huge robots that are used for battle. Like in EVA these robots are not really man made: here they produced by the land and found in caves, almost like diamonds in mines. Interesting as this idea may be, it is never really explored much, which makes it little more than one of the weirdest super technology sources I've seen in science fiction. Some of these robots, the ones that are legendary and all that, seem to have some degree of sentience. That is, sometimes they go into a berserk mode of sorts and act on their own to protect the drivers. Unfortunately this is never really explained or explored; you're just left to accept that these machines move without input when they feel like it and no one worries about it. If this seems terribly similar to EVAs, that's because it is. But, if that's the source of the idea, I get the impression that the author didn't really realise what was happening in Evangelion. Furthermore, the LFOs need to have a thing called the Compac drive plugged in to work, but the berserk mode can stand on its own. Once again an EVA parallel, but the problem with this one comes from Eureka Seven doing too much rather than too little. At the beginning we're given the impression that Compac drives are very important objects, possibly even containing the key to the mysteries that the characters are later to face. Well, not really; they are just tools for the rest of the series. As for LFOs going berserk without the Compac drive, there's an egregious example when it happens as a result of the drive actually being pulled out from the Nirvash, Renton and Eureka's LFO. Basically, as the power source is cut the robot decides to get a mind of his own and walk away, and no one ever cares about why that happened or gives it five minutes of thought. As a last parallel, the Seventh Swell power that the Nirvash holds is deeply reminiscing of the Second Impact from EVA. At the beginning it is supposed to be a very big deal but after that, as usual, it is left on a shelf gathering dust.\\n\\n\r\nThe previous exposition might give the impression of some underlying inconsistencies but, to tell the truth, they are much more widespread, and they show up almost as soon as the show begins. On the first episode Renton is told to deliver the Amita drive, which is a sort of expansion pack for the Compac drive, to Eureka because the Nirvash is not performing properly without it. This Amita drive was a one off thing made by Renton's father specifically for the Nirvash and seems to hold some deep significance. In this first instance it unlocks Nirvash's hidden powers and lets Eureka win the battle; after that it's all but forgotten and it's meaning and purpose never explain (at least they don't forget to draw it). Speaking of Renton's father, Adroc, he is another source of trouble. According to what we're told, he is some sort of hero that saved the world. Now, obviously, governments always make use of such martyrs for their own purposes and so they \"adapted\" his story to fit they view they wanted to convene. Problem: we're never told what was that the government made up about it. We do see, however, that Dewey, the generic big bad guy, uses this to great effect in controlling the masses and overthrowing the ruling Council of Sages. In fact the whole relationship between Dewey and the sages is odd at best. He is a former military leader that had been imprisoned for reasons never quite explained. The sages feared what he might do if he was free but decide to reinstate him in a top position of the army. From this point on, even if he was supposed to confront Gekkostate, all we see him doing basically amounts to plotting to overthrow the sages. This culminates with him giving a public speech that can be more or less summarised as: \"People of the world, you don't know but we are being attacked by these things called coralians! But fear not, I, Dewey, will protect you. And for that I will overthrow the sages, who have been lying to us.\" And that's it, coup d'\u00e9tat done. Two sages die, one accepts Dewey as a leader. Obviously this one is quickly dusted under the carpet and forgotten. He also takes the chance during the speech to let people know on which planet they are living. Apparently the whole of humanity had relocated planets more than once in the last ten thousand years but forgot about it in the meantime. Dewey is as unconvincing a speaker as you get one, but then again the facts on which he is reporting aren't that convincing either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, if inconsistencies plague the bad guys, they're also on the Gekkostate's main menu. Firstly, for a one ship rebel force they sure are eager to seek pointless battles. This just isn't a problem because they are the good guys and so they obviously always win. They win battles where they are ridiculously outnumbered and even if their LFOs are destroyed they are lucky and don't really die, and happen to have a spare, older robot for replacement. Sure, sometimes they suffer some damage, but when a single ship can blast through the imperial capital's defences, holding it's own against everyone and everything, to \"buy time\" for some crew members to go on a rescue mission that lasts from noon to dusk you know something is wrong. Given the sheer insanity of such mission it would appear that its necessity was beyond the obvious. Well, the rescued character, Norb, a high priest of the conveniently oppressed Vodarac religion, did become a major plot driver from that point on, but until then he had never even been mentioned and the reason given for the need of the rescue was something akin to \"we must do it\".\\n\\n\r\nFrom the rescue onwards the series does seem to get a plot, but it is as inconsistent as everything else. Discussions with Norb lead to the conclusion that the world is about to self-destruct because the number of sentient beings living on it has passed a certain limit. Why this limit exists is, naturally, never given much thought. However, it is explained that to avoid this Renton and Eureka will have to cross the Great Wall and enter the Zone and that to, in order to do this, they will have to meet Sakuya-sama. Lots of names, little explanations: the purpose of all of this is never given and everything is done in a \"you must do it\" basis. Though, to be fair to Norb, the rest of the cast was already aware of the importance of the Zone. They had seen an opening to it when they first contacted with a coralian and it was revealed that their grudge with the authorities had to do with the coralians. And revealed really is the right word, as most of the crew had no idea of what a coralian even was. As for the significance of the Zone, just because it was described as important it doesn't mean it was properly explained. The same goes for the dream sequence the coralian encounter triggered and that seemed to hint that Renton and Eureka's minds were somehow connected but that was, to retain the pattern, merrily ignored. Lastly, as the plot is finally about to take off after 40 episodes Norb insists that they take a day off to play football, in which is probably one of the lamest fillers ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Eureka Seven's world is not very well designed and the plot doesn't add up. Is there any remission by looking at it as a character driven story? Not really, as most characters are both not very likeable and not very good characters anyway, of which Renton is a prime example. The whole series revolved around his development and learning and growth, a coming of age story. The issue is that he never really gets anywhere: he starts as an idiotic kid who acts without thinking, goes through many internal conflict and character development stages, where his supposed improvement is stressed by the storytelling, and after each of them manages to go back to square one and make an ill-considered move that hurts someone else. I don't know, but I believe that shouting \"Any normal human would know that!\" to a character that is not quite normal is not an episode 40 mark of a grown and mature character. Nor is hurting yourself in order to be \"closer\" to someone who is hurt. In this particular sequence his wounds got infected and he got seriously ill, almost dying; I just found myself hoping that he did (even if knowing he wouldn't). As for the rest of the cast, they are not much better. Eureka starts girl who is a little off but a distinguished fighter. After that her character development basically consists in making her a meek girl who is there almost solely to support Renton. It's true that her back story drives part of the events but she herself has little to offer. Even in fights, despite the fact that the Nirvash is supposedly a dual pilot unit (the workings are never explained), we never really see much of a team action. She simply gradually cedes her place as driver to Renton and starts supporting him the way he supported her before. Concerning other less prominent character development aspects, she also falls for the old clich\u00e9 of trying to put on make-up to look prettier for Renton and ending horrible. That episode has such a predictable and beaten structure that it just triggers feelings of \"Can we please skip this?\". From the remaining characters, Talho seems to be the only half reasonable and likeable one. Holland behaves like a spoiled brat most of the time and is a major source of conflict, often taking out his frustrations on Renton, (though that's just a facade because he is oh so troubled deep inside) and the others are just stock characters with just one or two defining traits, or none at all. The only exception worthy of mention, but not for the best reasons, are the little kids to whom Eureka acts as guardian. They are probably one of the most annoying trios to ever have gone on screen, and putting up with them for 50 episodes is a real challenge. Straight of the bat they take a disliking of Renton and decided they are going to make his life hell. Kids as they are, they are very good at this, bullying him to no end. I guess the idea was to allow for them to grow fond of him during the course of the series but, even if they do so in words, their actions remain consistently annoying and dislikeable until the end, not to say actually dangerous to them and others. They also prompt what is probably the best example of Renton's inability to grow: in one of the first episodes he flies with them on Nirvash during a risky mission and gets a serious reprimand for endangering them; come the end of the series and he goes full circle, taking them with him and Eureka on an even more dangerous flight. It would be laughable if it weren't so pitiful.\\n\\n\r\nAdding it all up, Eureka Seven is a series with a few good ideas and lots of promise but that ultimately fails to live up to the expectations and instead just becomes painful to watch as it drags on and on. After all this only one question remains to ask: seven? Why seven? The series is called Eureka Seven but the number seven doesn't play a special role anywhere on the story. Was it introduced in the title without thought because it sounded cool? Quite likely it was, as that seems to have been the pattern for most of the elements anyway.",

            "content": "I would like to start off by saying Eureka Seven is hands down my all time favorite anime series. From beginning to end it managed to keep me glued to the computer screen without so much as a blink of the eye. Sure, I lost my eyesight after watching the series from beginning to end due to the lack of blinking, but all I can say is; worth it, totally worth it! This anime has everything you would want, and then some! Ranging from humor, to a love story, to action/adventure, and one of my favorite's; things that deepen the plot, leaving you with somany thoughts and opinions after the series ends. With it's oh so lovable characters, awesome storyline, action, adventure, and love/feelings between the main characters and more, it is hard not to get emotionally attached.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most notable things about this series, in my opinion at least, is the music. I have never seen an anime series use a more amazing selection of music for the openers, endings, and throughout the series in general. They truly put it together in an indescribable fashion. The music in this series really sets the mood for each scene, whether it be emotional, or action based. They have a selection for EVERYTHING, and none of them disappoint!\\n\\n\\n\r\nI often wonder how the series has affected others, as it has had a great impact on myself. I for one had to re-watch the series at least two more times after my first taste, and was still left unsatisfied. Not due to the series itself lacking anything, but the sole attachment that was created between myself and the characters of the series. Each one of them leaves you wanting more, and the emotions felt during the series (laughter, sadness, happiness, etc) do not fade after the series concludes. For this reason, it has become the most memorable and cherished anime of mine. No other anime has affected me so deeply, emotions wise, and for that, I am grateful. It sorta gives a new outlook on life, just watching Eureka and Renton, go through the good times, and the bad. This series also gave birth to one of my favorite sayings, that I like to look to in all aspects of life. &quot;Don't beg for things, do it yourself, or else you won't get anything&quot;. There is a lot of truth to the statement, and plays a big role in the series itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those who haven't seen the series, I highly recommend you take the time to watch it, it will not disappoint. When I first finished the series back in 2007, it left me with an odd void in my life, like I was missing something. That something turned out to be more Eureka Seven. I scoured the net, dying to find out whether or not they were in production for a new series, a movie, anything, and only found dead ends and rumors. Then, in April, the movie was announced, and that void I felt for so long was finally put to rest. Just knowing something more is around the corner keeps the desire to re-watch the series again and again at bay (tho I have seen it more times then I dare admit). So in the end, I wonder, how will Eureka Seven affect you? Don't pass this series up, you will regret it! I'd recommend the English version personally, as I feel the voice actors really nailed it, but the Japanese version does shed light on a few things you might not have understood in the English. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Besides poking fun at Christianity, one genre that seems to be a writing gold mine for anime is the coming-of-age tale. Taking a character who is in their teens, a period where they start to shape themselves to soon ingress into adulthood, and make them face reality in its different shades up until they become completely rounded figures is a setup that offers a vast range of opportunities for writers. The deal is that, the main character being a kid or a pre-teen, you can make them as immature as you can get away without making the audience hate the little twerp and slowly improvethem into a better person. Also, being animation such a versatile media, you can deliver as much of that development in one full season without having to deal with the difficulties of live-action.\\n\\n\r\nSo, which one is the best coming-of-age story in anime? Of course, that is not a question with definitive answer, if any question in regards to art is, but I\u2019d like to offer my pick for the best one I watched so far: Eureka Seven.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven (E7 for short) caps at 50 episodes, which is by no means a shy length for any series. Any anime packing that number of episodes can be an absolute chore to sit through if it doesn\u2019t offer the content to hold the viewer and enough quality-development to justify its size. Luckily there\u2019s no shortage of either for this series. During its running time, E7 builds its fantastic world and addresses multiple character arcs and themes, from religious conflict to environmentalism, leaving very little to be fully explained, and even in these cases it\u2019s not anything that represents a driving force of the plot. Before we talk about that, though, let\u2019s discuss the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRenton, the main protagonist, is unusually relatable for a character of this kind of story. He is immature, sure, but also displays grounded morals and is, at least initially, driven by an adventurous spirit. Being the son of the late hero responsible for saving the world, Adroc Thuerston, he would have some pretty big shoes to fill, however, Renton doesn\u2019t really want to deal with that kind of responsibility. Like many other teenagers, he wants simply to enjoy his younger years dedicating himself to his hobby and expanding his horizons, which primarily motivates him to join Gekkostate. That would lead him to face a reality much harsher than what he was originally prepared for and forces him to strengthen his ideals in order to push himself through the struggles he faces. So, yeah, Renton is amazing, quote me on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe titular Eureka is Renton\u2019s love interest for the story and the center of many conflicts both in the overall plot, as well as the tension between Renton and Holland. While not exactly emotionless, she has difficulty properly dealing with the emotions she slowly develops, and Renton plays a big role in leading her to understand how to better interact with others. She is naturally kind-mannered and loyal, but when it comes to dealing with failure or regret, more complex feelings ion general, she has significantly harder time processing those emotions.\\n\\n\r\nHolland is the leader of Gekkostate, a cool figure outside, but a very contrasting person for those who get to know him closely. Jealous, easily angered, unusually immature and quick to lash out against weaker characters who dare to upset him, most of the time Renton and frequently with violence, he is possibly the one that goes through the most sizeable development in the series, and a very positive one. That development though, takes some time to manifest, so while he acts like an absolute asshole, don\u2019t be surprised if you find yourself enjoying his suffering. I sure did.\\n\\n\r\nTalho is the main pilot of Gekkostate and Holland\u2019s lover. Being the only person who Holland accepts to have challenging him, she is the main agent to his development, but before that happens she is also forced to grow and properly understand her role in the group.\\n\\n\r\nCharles Beams, along with his wife, Ray, is one of the antagonists, appearing mid-run in the anime. Even though he is technically placed on the \u201cbad guys\u201d side, he is still a very honored, responsible and loyal figure, which is why he plays a big role in Renton\u2019s development. He is also Eureka Seven\u2019s embodiment of MANLINESS. Seriously, I bet the guy had chest hair when he was 8.\\n\\n\r\nDewey is Holland\u2019s older brother and the main antagonist for the series. Initially very mysterious, his motivations seem to fluctuate as the anime goes on, up until they are properly revealed and sadly place him among the \u201cDestroy the World\u201d kind of villain, the least compelling kind. That was the only meaningful issue I was able to find in the series: villains of this category hardly ever work, and in cases they do work they often go for the type that is so crazy it doesn\u2019t matter or so powerful that destroying the world isn\u2019t a big deal for them. Dewey is mostly portrayed as a collected and calculating individual, so this motivation is all the more out-of-place. Lastly, there are Dominic and Anemone. Their role in the story is to serve as a parallel to Renton and Eureka\u2019s relationship, but at the side of the antagonists, for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nOk, tackling the coming-of-age aspect first, Renton\u2019s development is triggered mostly by the use of an interesting contrast: without giving too much away, halfway through the series he gets separated from the Gekkostate, who at this point were not the most responsible folks to serve as an example. While in their company, it was difficult to side against him, as there was a clear lack of proper orientation from the crew. The point where they get separated is the moment his character-arc truly starts to shine, it\u2019s the moment when he\u2019s able to do his biggest mistakes and witness the impact they have. As an effect of that, Renton begins to develop higher respect for other\u2019s resolve, as well as the importance of keeping himself loyal to the responsibilities he takes. When he finally reunites with the Gekkostate, he is better prepared to face the challenges they would find up ahead. His development doesn\u2019t stop there, however, as there\u2019s much work to be done in his relationship with Eureka and the strengthening of his values, but that is something you should witness on your own.\\n\\n\r\nIn Eureka\u2019s case, the development kicks in early on, since it\u2019s not so much focused on maturing but in learning to deal with issues she was never forced to deal with in her blank-slate condition. Due to Renton\u2019s influence, not only over her but also the Nirvash, she begins to be exposed to feelings she was not used to, not all of them positive. During the boy\u2019s absence, she starts to understand that the reason why she misses him might be romantic feelings and the sudden need for his companionship also plays a huge part on forcing Holland to mature himself. All of this makes for deeply dynamic characterization, as in Eureka Seven characters don\u2019t simply decide to change or shift on a whim depending on plot convenience (No, I\u2019ll not make a \u201ccough, cough\u201d joke!), they influence each other, stumble, hurt themselves and make amendments, the way well-written interaction is supposed to do. The side-characters in the other hand have fairly straight personalities and stay pretty much the same along the series. Is that a problem? No. Keep that in mind, folks: a large cast doesn\u2019t mean everyone should receive in-depth development, some characters are nice the way they are, just adding some flavor to the series\\n\\n\r\nNow, when learning that a series tackles subjects like religious conflict or environmentalism, many people would be immediately put off, in fear that it might end up featuring very preachy writing. Eureka Seven, however, gracefully avoids this trap. The subjects in question are all swiftly introduced as the plot progresses, and now and then play their role in the story by being naturally integrated in the arc, without any moralism being spelled out by anyone in ham-fisted manner. The environmental aspect, for once, is not directly brought up, but subtly conveyed throughout the series, as it\u2019s an integral part of the overarching plot, and the series manages to do such a thing even as these themes become ever more present in the story. By the end, it\u2019s not hard to grasp how such elements are a natural component of the world presented in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nBy the Gods, that looks beautiful!\\n\\n\r\nOk, professionalism dictates I have to be more specific. Made in 2005 by Studio Bones, Eureka Seven is, to this day, one of the best looking anime ever made. Bones is a studio used to make anime where characters are realistically proportioned, but still retain anime-like features and that allows them to have distinct expressions. You will hardly find a relevant character that expresses in the same manner as the others, tying perfectly with their personalities and demeanors. With the exception of some episodes of minor importance, like the soccer episode, the figures show steady consistency in their character models, retaining natural proportion even when seen from a distance. This is often the animation issue that is most noticeable in other works, but E7 manages to avoid it and deliver stellar animation with beautifully fluid movement without losing its consistency and detail. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are striking and memorable. They follow the seinen logic of packing details that by themselves are nothing special, but when placed together form a design that is at the same time harmonic and distinct. Now, all of that aside, the real kicker that makes the series such a visual marvel is its use of colors. From the character designs, both human and mechs, to the machinery, the effects and explosions, E7 always brings the most vibrant and impactful colors. The shining green of the trapar waves, the perfectly toned shades of orange used for the sunset, the lightly flavored natural environments and even pink-colored explosions, everything immediately pops out on the screen, and coupled with the sharp use of lighting, it drives perfectly the mood of the scene, be it action or just moments of important dialogue. When you consider that alongside the number of episodes and characters, it only makes the work Bones displayed all the more impressive. There is nothing I can complain in regards to the visuals that doesn\u2019t boil down to nitpick, as the overall package is consistently pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven\u2019s soundtrack has its fair share of exciting, blood-pumping tracks to help make the action all the more energetic and even some to evoke a grandiose feeling, but what stands out the most are its emotional pieces. They come in at the exact moment to make you know that you\u2019re about to watch a meaningful moment of character interaction or to highlight development that is about to happen. If you don\u2019t find these tracks memorable, better look for a medic, you might have faulty memory or be lacking a heart. On the voice acting department (Japanese, off course), the most notable detail is Renton\u2019s seyiuu, Sanpei Yuuko. Renton is another teenage-boy played by a female. Let that information sink in for a minute: does the acting, at any moment, denounce that the character is not played by a man? This is without a doubt the most convincing case of a female seyiuu playing a male role I\u2019ve ever seen and can easily dethrone Paku Romi or Takeuchi Junko in this category. Not to say that the rest of the cast doesn\u2019t range from solid to excellent. Fujiwara Keiji plays Holland, so if you are familiar with his work you know there\u2019s no worry and Nazuka Kaori\u2019s portrayal of Eureka reflects with no problem the image of a girl learning to process newly-found emotions, while maintaining a sweet vibe to her acting.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nNow, there\u2019s an aspect I\u2019d like to comment on this section specifically. Eureka Seven has some of those moments you could call \u201cshounen moments\u201d, where the logic is made to obey more the emotions the characters are facing at the time and the ones the anime wants to pull out of the viewer, then the internal rules established in the story. This might be just my bias speaking, as I have a soft spot for the shounen genre myself, but I believe these instances enhance the series instead of detracting from it. Sure, they may seem corny to some, but not just of logic you build a cathartic and fulfilling story, emotion is also important and as long as it doesn\u2019t stretch believability beyond what the audience was accustomed to give, or contradicts other rules of the setting, I say \u201cgo for it\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIf WattheWut doesn\u2019t mind me borrowing his rating system for a while, Eureka Seven is a Must Watch. Sure, this review might not have convinced you, as I spent little time dissecting how the story unfolds, but trust me, it\u2019s better that you experience that for yourself. Safe to say, I believe this series uses with effect its runtime, as there was a lot to be handled and the manner in which it did was very solid, paced out with no issue. You can call Eureka Seven a perfectly rounded series: it has a tightly fleshed out world with a story that fully utilizes its setting and dynamic, likeable and developed characters, fitting without a problem the universe they live in.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m running out of things to say, so go watch the anime.\\n",

            "content": "This could possibly be one of the best written anime series of all time. Dai Sato is defently one of the best screenwriters in all of Japan. Tomoki Kyoda is also a very talented director. With those two and  people like Chiaki J. Konaka, and Sayo Yamamoto involved it's no wonder this anime is a success. \r\nI started watching this anime on Adult Swim, from the day it first aired. It took a few episodes before I was hooked, but once they grabbed me, they never let go. So please give this series a shot. After it aired on Adult Swim I started buyingall the DVD's. I missed a few episodes in the middle and the ending the first time it aired, but watched that, plus the rest of it on DVD. Although this is one of my favorite anime series of all time, I'll try very hard to be fair and  as un-biased as I can be\\n\\n\r\nIt clearly takes many things from Neon Genesis Evengelion,FLCL, Fullmetal Alchemist, Gundam, and RahXephon. And I noted it acually takes some things from Shadow Star Narutaru as well (like some of the darker aspects of the series, and the Coralians  and anti- Coralians are clearly inspired by the dragons [creatures] in Shadow Star Narutaru, not to mention some other smaller things as well). None of this is surprising as many of the people heavily involved in Eureka Seven where involved in these series as well.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story: \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go deep into the synopsis of the plot. I thought it was a very well written story, and the plot was just amazing. Lot's of mystery and drama!! It's very interesting to watch the military conflicts unfold. We watch what happens (and the changes to) the government that runs the planet, and how war effects everyone. The series is also very deep, dark, and can get physiological at times (not unlike Eva). It does have it's fun and silly moments, and even an episode or two devoted to humor and jokes. This is very well thoguth out, as the drama and &quot;darker&quot; parts are well balanced by this. Comedy is used at the right moments not to depress the veiwer to much. Plenty of action and interesting plot developments to make sure you are never bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is written very amazingly, and complex. It gets dark, but never too depressing. All of this is important because this is partly a plot driven anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters were very strong. While it's easy to see how Renton was inspired by Shinji (NGE) and Naota (FLCL) he is still very much his own character. Same gos for Eureka (who some say is inspired by Rei from NGE). Talho and Holland are completely original. Most of the characters are well likeable. I found the &quot;bad guys&quot; of course to be much more interesting, likeable, and just overall cool however.  The Sage Council (my picture) are an amazing trio who run the country!  Dominic Sorel is very cool, likeable, and interesting!! Colonel Dewey Novak is also a great character and develops a lot throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is interesting, and helps show the viewer a little bit of the world this takes place on. They all are good characters, which is important because this anime can be very character driven at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice. It gets it's job done, plus some! It really amazes you at some times, but being a 50 episode series it does change up a little over the time. No real problems with it, but not incredbly high quality animation or anything like that. The backgrounds are great looking, and the character and mecha designs are very cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic- \\n\r\nThe music was just amazing!! The best songs, from the best bands were chosen for this anime!! But not just great opening and closings either, the insert songs where very powerful! Esecially the insert song &quot;Storywriter&quot; by the band Supercar.\\n\\n\r\ndub-\\n\r\nI only watched the English dub, and I can defently say this is one of Bang Zoom! 's best dubs ever!! Sure Renton (Johnny Young Bosch) could be anoying to some people, but I think he sounded really good. I didn't even know that was him, he used such a high pitch voice. Crispin Freeman will forever be Holland for me, because his voice fit so perfectly!! Peter Doyle was also spot on with Dominic. In fact every single character seemed well cast. Of course Stephanie  Sheh gives the overall best performance as Eureka. She's just great at anything she does. Eureka is brought to life with her voice.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Vertic:\\n\\n\r\nA more plot driven/character driven mecha then most people are used to, but acually makes this anime more apealing. It works for people who don't necessarily like mecha anime too much. Therefore it's not mecha-driven, but they do serve a point, and there is some mystery to them. The characters are well likeable. The plot is very well thought out, and just amazing. It gets philosophical, physiological and deep at times, but plenty of action to keep you entertained. \\n\\n\r\nIt has a good story to tell, and proves once again Dai Sato is the man with the golden pen. When it comes to screenwriting, he always manages to outdo himself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nA common saying that people often hear is, \"All is fair in love and war.\" Interpreted literally, what this phrase says is that there are no rules when it comes to the battlefield. That people will do whatever it takes to win, to obtain the ultimate prize: victory. In both circumstances, it's something that is quite difficult to achieve, but when it is, it's one of the sweetest, most exhilarating feelings in the world. To an extent, the tale of Eureka Seven is the manifestation of such an idea.\r\nSTORY\r\nEureka Seven begins with Renton Thurston being visited by twopeople, Eureka and Holland. Along with the Nirvash, a mechanical unit piloted by Eureka, Renton joins Gekkostate, beginning an incredible journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to a series like this, it's interesting to see a show with so much dedication behind it. Resting at 50 episodes, it takes a considerable amount of time to get through, relative to most seasonal shows. The pacing isn't so much slow as it is awkward. It starts off rather quickly, slows down immensely, picks back up, slows down, then charges towards the end. Now, this isn't technically a negative; in fact, I found this pacing to help. By being more lethargic towards the beginning, it allowed for the demonstration, characterization, and augmentation of the crew. This applies not only for Renton and Eureka, but for the side characters as well. In this way, when the story does pick up for a time, it has to spend less on the characters in question and more so on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nGoing off this, the story-telling is done in a sneaky way. Most shows have you learn the world as the main character does. And this is true for Eureka Seven as well. But what separates this anime from many others is that the world and knowledge is already established. To put it as best as I can, it feels like you are learning the world not alongside Renton but as Renton. Like a kid figuring out \"wonders\" for the first time, the gradual way in which information is given and learned as the story progresses worked quite well. Areas are left shrouded in mystery, both in the sub-plot and the over-arcing one, allowing the audience to not only care about the characters in play but also the environment surrounding them.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven is an anime about \"the power of love!\" Love, and the need to protect those dear to you, enshrouds people with very strong emotions. And for the most part, these emotions are what drive the narrative. Between Renton and Eureka, and a few other key characters, its love that gets them through the day, love that allows them to do the impossible. But there is a bigger idea at play besides just \"love cures all.\" It's the acceptance and understanding of someone inherently different from you. Whether by race, culture, or ethnicity, learning to respect the ideals and values of someone completely different from yourself is not only mature, but the right thing to do. And Eureka Seven explores this idea beautifully, with a variety of different cases, both jubilant and tragic.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the praise I give the show, it does two things sadly wrong: the details for the plot and the ending. Starting with the former, the show's way of expressing its world was done nicely. However, as it goes on, many ideas and plot points are either left unexplained or explained terribly. As the story ramps up, so does the amount of information thrown the audience's way. This, in turn, gives it more opportunities to either do it wrong, try something new, or both. As it neared its conclusion, it was usually both.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending, it's bitter-sweet. The bitterness comes not from how it all went down, but rather for how it stayed up regardless. In other words, the show leaves itself surprisingly open-ended. Not tying up loose ends in a couple of important areas, it makes the conclusion itself feel rather underwhelming, despite the incredible ride the final ten episodes or so provided. It feels rushed and somewhat sloppy, as if the final episode feels out of place in comparison to what came before it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven feels like an homage to days gone by.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself feels mostly gray. Not only with the constant clouds and decor of the airship, but also in the atmosphere given off. The show does a nice job of making it feel as if the world itself has experienced some rather melancholy happenings. But it isn't afraid to bust out the colors, especially with Eureka, the rest of Gekkostate, and during the fights themselves. And of course, the \"Seven Swell Effect\" is always glorious to see.\\n\\n\r\nAt this time, it's important to give a big shout-out to Studio Bones for drawing the mechanical units in 2D. This may seem lame to say, but with studios opting to go with 3D because its either cheaper or easier, it was almost refreshing to see the robots flying around as paper and not as polygons.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation is usually pretty good. The show incorporates great facial detail and expressions when it wants to, alongside good character movements. The battles utilize both faraway shots of dodging and explosions, and closer, more detailed gun-firing, trapar-riding, and sword-wielding.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Eureka Seven is placed in a rather peculiar predicament. I'll focus on the big four: Renton, Eureka, Holland, and Talho.\\n\\n\r\nTalho is the lead pilot of the Gekko. Girlfriend of Holland, her commanding attitude and cold demeanor make her somewhat of a \"wild child.\" But deep down, she cares a lot for the crew she steers on a daily basis. And when it comes to Holland, his safety, both physically and mentally, comes first. She is also affected by jealousy of a past she wishes would be forgotten. For her, her greatest struggle is coping with her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nHolland is the leader of Gekkostate. Handsome and quick to anger, he believes in the friends he has come to make over the years. His intentions seem unclear, but his determination to accomplish his goals are anything but. For some reason, he has a deep-seeded hatred for Renton. His issue is not coping, but handling the emotions he has.\\n\\n\r\nAs a young boy, Renton dreamed of lifting with the cool members of Gekkostate. As the main character, Renton is kind, trustworthy, and wanting to do what's right. From the very beginning until the every end, he has one simple goal: protect Eureka. It seems lofty and perhaps even nonsensical, but his drive to protect the girl he loves brings him farther than he could have ever thought possible. Renton's issue was always understanding what feelings he currently had.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character from the show is Eureka. Mired in mystery from the get-go, the turquoise-haired, purple-eyed, quiet-speaking girl is definitely a little strange. Besides her outward appearance, she appears to be a normal teenager. But as her origins are explained and questions are answered, it becomes apparent that her inner-self is just as different as her outer-self. Emotionally, her biggest hurdle was simply learning about what she was feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCoping, handling, understanding, and learning; for these four characters, the way in which they handle their emotions is vastly different when compared to one another. And this is important, considering the main themes revolve around love. The first half of the show nicely explores Talho, Holland, Renton, and Eureka's journey towards dealing with each of their separate obstacles. Putting it another way, the first half is each of them growing up. Whether through a new perspective on life or a new outlook provided to them by a fellow crew member, the four of them experience significant change during the first leg of their adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that the second leg focuses entirely on the plot and ignores the characters. After they overcome their personal challenges, there is little to no development afterwards. It may be argued that the relationships between them are affected, which is certainly the case, but their individual selves are not. Coupled with the convoluted story-telling mentioned earlier, this causes the shift in focus to be more of a step down than a step up.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note is Dewey, the antagonist, and Anemone. Dewey is the villain, but not a conventional one. His tactics and ideas are political rather than confrontational, making him interesting to watch as he goes about his plans. Anemone is similarly interesting because she is the complete opposite to Eureka; she knows the feelings she has but refuses to acknowledge them. Both characters become supremely important in the second half of the show, but their inclusion within the show allows the audience to view the ideas at play from a different angle, providing us not only with more insight but also a new way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP takes a bit of getting used to. The drums and guitar provide a nice beat, and the vocalist in the second half comes through with good emotion. It sounds somewhat \"old school,\" which fits nicely with the old school feel of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is the best of the four. The trumpet, drums, vocalist, and lyrics work wonderfully. They mix together to provide an incredible beat that is easy and fun to follow. Plus, who doesn't love to sing along with \"Let it bloom!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe third OP comes in second, with its rough singing and nice tempo. The \"I wanna fly away!\" in conjunction with the visuals is actually pretty powerful the more it's viewed, given everything that goes on during this OP's arc. It's also quite nice to bob your head to.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth OP's best quality is easily the first ten seconds with \"Amazing Grace.\" At this point, the show is nearing its end, so emotions are high. Meaning, it works to ease us into the coming episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED, like the OP, takes a little bit of time to get used to. The singing sounds rather choppy, but it actually has a rather mellow feeling despite the range put into it. And the final violin arrangement is beautiful yet sad.\\n\\n\r\nED two sounds somewhat all over the place, unlike its OP counterpart. However, the \"Fly away!\" helps to bring it back into focus. The beat is slightly too quick and jumpy to follow easily, making it not too great to listen to on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe third ED is the best of the EDs, with its good tempo, nice vocalist, and lyrics. The visuals are also quite interesting in what they portray. And the \"tip taps\" is fun to sing along with.\\n\\n\r\nThe final ED isn't so much a song as it is a story itself. It's more important to read the lyrics for this one as opposed to listening to it, but the many people singing it together makes it feel that much more alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is actually very good. The piano pieces, the heart-pounding frantic-ness between Nirvash and The End, and the grand orchestral music make it a feast for the ears time and again.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, I found Yuuko Sanpei as Renton and Keiji Fujiwara as Holland to give above average performances as their respective characters. At times, you could really hear the emotions they were attempting to portray.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to anime, romance is something I place higher than anything else. So, seeing it not only as prevalent within the show but being used as a literal plot device made me exceptionally happy. All of the blushing, the smiling, the name-calling; it had it all and I would have loved to have seen even more of it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are humorous moments during the show, but they are mostly around during the first quarter or so. Afterwards, it sticks mainly to dramatic elements. They never feel forced, just sometimes questionable because we never really have all the answers. The show, however, almost got to me a select few times in the crying department. Not all the way, but it was getting there. So much was riding on their actions, and the feelings they had for one another at certain points bubbled over, and I almost cried alongside Eureka.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the best moments come from the Nirvash kicking some KLF butt. Watching the two of them, Renton and Eureka, work in harmony to take out the bad guys time and again never got old. If anything, I wanted to see just how far their love was going to take them.\\n\\n\r\nI never fully got invested, however, into the show or the characters until the final stretch. At that point, I really had to know what was coming next. Sadly, the ending just didn't cut it for me after promising so much yet providing so little.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I think Eureka Seven had the potential to become a masterpiece. All of the elements were there, but the mistakes kept piling up the further it went along. Despite these missteps, I still had a wonderful time. And even after getting through it all, \"All is fair in love and war\" still stands truer than ever.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, strong first half becomes convoluted the further it goes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, 2D, fluid, and pretty when it needs to be\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, nice mains and supports that could have been great\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OPs, EDs, amazing soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, romance, baby!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "This anime, is beautiful. Not just in animation or sound, but also in how the story and characters are laid out. However, each gem comes with it's own dents and scratches, and this is no different. Just a heads up that although I easily would give this anime a ten because of how amazing it made me feel at the end, I'm going to try my hardest to not be incredibly biased and point out flaws just like any other review. \r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory:\r\nFirst, lets start off with both a positive and a negative point. I found that for a lot of the time, many, many thingswere left unexplained, even though they were referenced fairly often, especially in the earlier episodes. Now, I realize that this was to emphasize how little our protagonist, Renton Thurston, knew about the world, but it still left gaping plot holes by the end of the series. Still, it isn't really something I can completely fault the show for, because by leaving many things unexplained, it showcases how naive and clueless Renton is at the start. Still, it felt like driving through a thick cloud of fog. We weren't given any sort of main goal to reach, so we were subject to following the Gekko State meander about doing something to provide for a greater cause. This more or less doesn't matter, however, because we really aren't supposed to focus at all on the story for the first half, as the characters were the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story does pick up when nearing the midway point, and it sure does pick up. We finally realize why Gekko State are rebelling against the military, and the themes that start to arise are spectacular. We see that it is easier to conquer obstacles with the help of a trusted partner rather than being a lone wolf (screw you Kirito) and the power that comes with wanted to protect and be with the one you love. There is also some fairly obvious religious symbolism, and in this regard, it is fairly easy to draw parallels with Neon Genesis Evangelion. Still, it was handled rather well. I do feel as though the story was more or less a vessel to carry the amazing characters contained in it, but as a stand alone story, it's simplicity holds up nicely.\\n\\n\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the animation, other than it's Bones at it's finest. The art is stylistic, fluid, and fits the overall feel of the show perfectly. The animation was also just as fluid, especially when dealing with the epic LFO fight scenes. The bright colours really fit the tone of the show: very uplifting and passionate. Lastly, the character designs. A while back, I watched another great show called Planetes. I was pleased to see the person doing the character designs for that particular show doing the character designs for Eureka Seven. All of them were completely original, and fit their roles in the show perfectly. Holland and Talho had very surfer-like attire to go with their rebelling against the State, Eureka's entrancing purple eyes embrace her mysterious yet beautiful side, and even the military uniforms were stylish. For a show made in 2005, it's animation still managed to keep me glued to the screen even at this day and age.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nOnce again, very high production going into this soundtrack. When the show needed to be serious, the music helped to produce suspense and tension. When there was some kind of powerful as all hell romance scene, the music was the driving force to give you butterflies in your stomach and feel like everything is perfect and beautiful. Also the openings were not just pleasing to the ears and eyes, but they actually replicated the stages of Renton's emotions at the time. In the first opening, the music and animation is very cheery, which is implies of Renton's laidback, carefree attitude at the time. Later on during the 3rd opening, he is shown falling through the sky, going to catch Eureka. This shows his boundless love for Eureka, and how he has grown and matured because of that love. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the dub was solid, with breathtaking performances by Johnny Yong Bosch and Stephanie Sheh as Renton and Eureka respectively. However, you can't just say it's a coincidence when you see Ichigo Kurosaki and Orihime Inoue in the lead roles of a budding romance. I won't spend time talking about the other cast, as they are just as good. I did have a bit of a problem with the script at times, however. Sometimes the dialogue seemed a little bland between Renton and Eureka. It just doesn't seem to fit with the actions that are taking place at any given time. Fortunately, these moments are few and far between.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAnd of course, I have saved the best to last. The characters are what make Eureka Seven one of my favourite anime of all time, and I'm sure many people agree with me there. Let's start off with Renton Thurston. Honestly, he isn't the most original person in the bunch. He is a whiny, annoying protagonist forced to fight in a mech because why the heck not. However, it's the journey he goes through and the development he gets that makes him such a phenomenal character. By the end, he becomes someone people can actually depend on to make the right choices, and cares more about the people he loves rather than himself. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Eureka. I hate to keep making Evangelion References, but I will. At first, Eureka seems to be the Rei  Ayanami clone: very quiet, keeps to herself, you know the drill. But once again, its the journey she goes through that turns her into someone with actual emotions. She begins to feel the strength of love and the weight of guilt, which turns her into a very \"human\" character by the end (which is funny for obvious reasons).\\n\\n\r\nIts weird for me to say this, but I don't think there is one character I really disliked all that much. All the side characters in Gekko State had enough development and personality to make an extremely well rounded cast. Like seriously, every single character on the Gekko got at least a little bit of development by the end. However, I didn't really like how one particular old man was fleshed out at the last episode of the entire series. It was just a completely unnecessary plot twist that did nothing significant in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the characters in the military were also just as strong. It made me pleased to see that Dominic and Jurgens were more than just military dogs, and turned out to have a mind of their own. For a while, I thought Anemone was an annoying little brat who treated Dominic, the one who loved her and actually treated her with respect, like complete shit. However, after learning of her past, her motivations, and how she changed thanks to Dominic, she came to, like Eureka, be a very human character. Speaking of Dominic and Anemone, even though their relationship was just a side plot, it even held a candle to Renton's and Eureka's. It went from rock bottom to soaring heavens, and it was a delight to see the end result.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the best part. Renton and Eureka, as a couple. I couldn't help having a wide grin on my face whenever those two were on the screen. The dedication and passion the two have for each other is astonishing. It really makes me long to have that relationship with someone someday. There are so many roadbumps along the way, but it doesn't matter to them. They can do whatever the hell they want because of their trust and unrequited love for each other. They are what make this anime so spectacular, and so groundbreaking.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThis anime was a complete rollercoaster. The start was a slow, gradual, and for the most part, boring. one. However, the payoff was more than I could ever want. Even though the show was slow to start, they did it for a reason. Even the flaws I point out in this show are done to emphasize some kind of key theme or symbol. It just made you feel immersed into the whole setting, like you were actually there, watching the whole thing unfold through Renton's eyes. The production quality was borderline perfection, and I just hope that I can find someone with whom I can share the same love that Renton and Eureka did. However, even though in my heart I want to give this show a perfect rating, I can't. This is a review, and my opinion shouldn't be biased to completely overlook the flaws this show had.\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I've been looking forward to typing up this review ever since around the 25th episode. For me, Eureka Seven has been bouncing between, and around an 8-9 for the rating. But it really didn't take long AT ALL to make me change that score. It was in my \"Plan to Watch\" list for far too long as well. And deserved to be looked into a lot sooner. So, first, what I mean by this is, if you haven't seen Eureka Seven yet, DO NOT WAIT ANY LONGER. Especially if you absolutely love incredible love stories. \r\nI'll start with story, I gave it a 10because:\\n\r\nWell, it's kind of hard to tell you why I gave it a 10 without spoiling the story, but I'll try it out. During the entirety of Eureka Seven, the story is a HUGE emotional-roller coaster; one that I didn't want to end. They really give life to every character that is on screen often, give you the needed background information to make them feel real. I got connected to these characters and what they were fighting for. Making me sad every time I finished an episode, knowing its one episode closer to the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere are ups and downs, people learning what they're doing wrong, everyone working together to overcome such amazing obstacles. Truly one epic tale, that makes you envious that you can't do what they do. But sometimes are glad you don't need to go through such heart-wrenching moments in life. Eureka Seven actually left me teary-eyed at some points, especially at the end of an intense episode, Eureka and Renten say \"To be continued\" together, but sound incredibly sad after something bad that happened. It's like getting dumped, then having everyone laugh at you. It feels terrible. But it's good because they actually make you feel for the story, and what the characters are going through. I'd give it a 100/10 if I could, but that isn't possible. \\n\\n\r\nNow for Art, I gave it a 9 because:\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here, most Anime that Bones works on (that I've seen) looks amazing, but there were very small parts that I don't think were up to par, but it might have been because I was watching DVD quality on a 40\" HDTV without being upscaled to fake-HD. But no complaints, a well deserved 9.\\n\\n\r\nFor Sound, I gave it a 10 because:\\n\r\nNot much to say here either, they nailed all the effects, all the voices (I watched it dubbed) were perfect on all the characters. They all seem to fit so perfectly. Kari Wahlgren played Anemone, and she is one of my favorite voice actors, so I was happy to hear her in this doing another amazing job. So no complaints here, top notch sound for a top notch Anime, i'd say. \\n\\n\r\nI gave Character a 10 because:\\n\r\nWell, I kind of explained why in my reasons on Story, and sort of, in sound.\\n\r\nThe characters are well thought out and expressed. Leaving no holes to make them feel fake, or robotic. Emotions are no where near lacking, character style is unique enough and how they all are made to interact just surpasses incredible. Basically, if you made a blind person \"listen\" to Eureka Seven, he/she would think it was something real happening around them, and that these people really exist. Hard to be done, but Eureka Seven excels here. \\n\r\nAnd also to mention, I'm glad to finally see a 10/10 worthy Anime that doesn't include overly-big sized chests and girls that are too spunky for life as the main character.\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I've said why I gave it a 10 for Enjoyment, but I'll do a quick recap:\\n\r\nAmazing characters, heart-wrenching story that pulls you in and DOESN'T let you go, top notch action scenes, and incredible plot that didn't confuse me and was easily understandable but deep enough to keep you hooked and it feeling fresh. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though I gave Art a 9, that IN NO WAY brings down the overall score. Since the story was so amazing, with the support of an amazing character cast and amazing Voice Actors; all this amazing could only add up to an outstanding Anime. So if you haven't seen it yet, I'd suggest you watch it as soon as possible. I downloaded it first, but after finally finishing it, I'm going to buy both Box sets, and buying the \"Pocket Full of Rainbows\" movie when it comes out. Just to own and help possible future Eureka Sevens to be released, or Anime like it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, my final words are, I'm glad I watched it, and I never plan on regretting all the emotions I felt while watching Eureka Seven. And I'm sure you'll fully understand what I mean after you watch it for yourself.",

            "content": "*Notice: This review contains some spoilers. And a lot of this contains sarcasm, depending on the portion of the review you're reading. If you\ufffdre not prepared for either, stop reading. Also, if you haven't seen the series (or most of it) you probably won't understand a lot of what I'm talking about to be completely honest. Which is why I have that summed up below, but even that has a couple of references to scenes late into the series.\r\nThe first 25-30 episodes were an absolute bore for me (think slightly more enjoyable than the 9th level of Hell), but in the latter episodes there weresome decent fight scenes which made it more enjoyable. There were also two \ufffdromance stories\ufffd in the end which I also found to be enjoyable (being a fan of romance). There were some parts where certain characters\ufffd personalities got overhauled in some respects to quickly and I felt it seemed unnatural and odd (like Renton suddenly going from \ufffdDamn! Damn! Damn!\ufffd to \ufffdI\ufffdm gonna kick some ass and chew some gum. But I\ufffdm all outta gum.\ufffd There were also some episodes that were fairly entertaining but basically worthless (soccer game, anyone?). I also felt that some of the characters in those episodes *coughRentoncough* acted worthless. \ufffdDude, I\ufffdm sweet at soccer because I leave the ball completely open to an attacker and they can\ufffdt get it due to their lacking coordination! Oh snap! Moondoggie just did! Shi-zo!\ufffd Those kinds of moments irritated me since passing a ball is pretty basic concept, and Renton couldn\ufffdt seem to grasp the concept within a matter of seconds but understood how to jump off of a teammate and perform a coordinated kick on the goal with Eureka somehow. Makes perfect sense, I know, but I digress. Most of the later episodes helped to advance the plot and provide a little bit of character development, although some of the development seemed \ufffdoff\ufffd (with respect to each character) and felt unrealistic. However, because some of the characters didn\ufffdt seem to mature realistically, it allowed for some hardcore moments. Except for Maurice holding a bolt-action rifle which was assumed to be loaded (despite making zero sense since it was stored in the back of an LFO and only takes a few seconds to load one round into it. Much less that none of the characters in the Nirvash at that time probably even knew how use it). Maurice is a wuss, by the way.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nHere\ufffds the story in a nutshell: There\ufffds a kid named Renton who wants to be Tony Hawk except in the air. And using a mech. Then a girl crashes into part of his property and he falls in love with her. He joins a group called Gekko State and whines for lot of episodes. Then he meets a guy that likes frilly tops and a woman who cooks well. He wants to think of them as his parents and pays no attention to their being complete strangers, but has utmost trust for them from the gitgo. Then they both die. He goes back to Gekko State. He whines some more and claims that he\ufffdll protect the girl that destroyed his property. There are some cool battles. Holland acts like a jerk and then becomes mildly hardcore later on. More sweet battles. Eureka, Renton, and some kids end up going through \ufffdthe Zone\ufffd and end up a ways underground. Eureka undergoes some physical changes. A guy named Dewey comes to power, tries to wipe out all Coralians, tries to destroy the Nirvash. Then Dewey dies. Renton saves Eureka using a new version of the Nirvash (like the Nirvash 2.0). Then an old man is revealed to be a Coralian and leaves. Dominic gets it on with Anemone. The show ends.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the shortened plot synopsis: A kid named Renton meets a girl named Eureka. She pilots a big mech (the first one ever). Renton falls in love with the girl. Then he joins and anti-government organization to fight &quot;the man.&quot; He and Eureka pilot the mech (the Nirvash) together and fall in love. Stuff happens, Renton whines a lot, matures extremely quickly at some points, and almost gets killed a few times. Then the lead man of the government dies and Eureka ends up in a &quot;state [of being]&quot; where she needs to be saved, which only Renton can do. Renton saves her. The show ends.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Animation\ufffd\\n\r\nThe animation in Eureka 7 was decent. Nothing awful by any means, but also nothing particularly astounding. The characters all had their own definite \ufffdstyles,\ufffd and had a distinctive look to them. But at the same time, their clothes were typically drawn with great detail and some of their other features (like Holland\ufffds \ufffdbeard\ufffd) were lacking, too. The environments also left some to be desired. Most of the backgrounds typically were fairly bland and didn\ufffdt have much attention to detail, but this wasn\ufffdt nearly as noticeable since the show rarely focused on the environments themselves. Where the animation did excel was with the LFOs (the mechs). They were reminiscent of Neon Genesis Evangelion (compare the Nirvash and the Type 01), although still had some of their own nifty features (hoverboards, anyone?). The animation was also very fluid and done well for the battles, and the effects for explosions among other things almost always looked good. The reason animation gets an eight from me is because although there was some to be desired, the animation involving LFOs was done well (as were battles in general).\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Sound\ufffd\\n\r\nI thought the sound was done very well. The first two openings weren\ufffdt terribly appealing, but the third one was very enjoyable and the fourth one still had some of its own merits. One of the ending themes was decent but none of them really stood out or grabbed me. The voice acting was done well for each character, and no particular one really stood out, but that can be seen as good or bad depending on your perspective. The battles or \ufffdintense\ufffd moments generally had great music accompanying. One of my personal favorites was the music that sounded like the tango played near the end of the movie \ufffdTrue Lies.\ufffd Then again, I\ufffdm a fan of the tango so that may be more personal preference. All in all, I thought the insert songs felt fitting for their scenes and I liked the music (Storywriter by Supercar I thought worked really well).\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Character--\\n\r\nEach of the characters had their own personality and attributes, although I didn\ufffdt feel most of them developed too much in ways that made great sense. For instance, like I stated earlier in the review, Renton goes from \ufffdwhine whine whine\ufffd to \ufffdGet to the chopper! If you want to live, come with me,\ufffd in a Schwarzenegger tone. While I definitely liked it more when some of the characters were like that (as oppose to not), it didn\ufffdt feel \ufffdfitting\ufffd for them based off of their previous actions and emotions. It was supposed to be a sign of them developing but I never got the impression that it truly \ufffdclicked\ufffd for most of them. Eureka\ufffds personality progressed in a way that seemed natural, but at the same time according to the story she learned basically everything from people, so how she experienced or developed different emotions was never fleshed out. Then again, she\ufffds probably just supposed to already retain the ability for different emotions like hatred, love, etc, and it\ufffds a given. So I didn\ufffdt dwell much on that issue when I was watching the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nIt\ufffds a fun show overall. Was it worth sitting through almost 30 episodes of boredom to see some exciting and uplifting parts later on? Maybe, but that\ufffds questionable. It\ufffds a decent show, and it has some ups and downs. If you really like mechs and action you may want to watch it, but I\ufffdd stick with something like Full Metal Panic for mechs myself. A lot of people enjoy Eureka 7, and while it\ufffds not absolute top-notch or anything like that, a good portion of it is enjoyable and interesting enough for you to finish an episode and want to see what happens in the next. \\n\\n\r\nHere are the basics for whether you might like the show or not. If you:\\n\r\n-like mechs\\n\r\n-like romance stories\\n\r\n-like hoverboards\\n\r\n-like watching stuff get blown up\\n\r\n-like decently cool battles\\n\r\n-enjoy watching characters go from being total pansies to suddenly owning everything in sight\\n\r\n-enjoy having a &quot;tragic&quot; hero who does well but has some flaw\\n\r\n...then you might like this show. Those are the basics.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRatings (This is how to understand what I have it you think it doesn't match up with the numbers):\\n\r\n10- Astoudning, fantastic. This is the alpha-male. It wins on more levels that I can count.\\n\r\n9- Excellent and better than most of what you typically come across. Not the pinnacle of greatness, but still close.\\n\r\n8- Well done, although flaws are definitely present. It does a lot of things fairly well but you can see the errors in it. Could use some work or it's still fairly enjoyable, but not a lasting impression.\\n\r\n7- Decent. Doesn't execute anything to any amazing extent or anything really poorly. Very middle of the road.\\n\r\n6- Limited appeal. This may appeal to some but it's very on the edge between average and being poor.\\n\r\n5 and Below- 100% craptacular goodness. The lower the score here is, the more you realize how much you hate the material in question.",

            "content": "\"Even our favorite things in life have flaws. Even so, we continue to love them regardless.\"\r\nAs I thought of this generic, cheesy, probably already existing line, the first anime that came to mind was Eureka Seven. Not only because it's the main theme throughout the show regarding its characters and their relationships, but also because it perfectly describes my general thoughts on the show itself.\r\nLet me start off by pointing out where Eureka Seven truly shines. In my opinion that would be the general lively atmosphere and vibrant color palette. Man, this show is the definition of fun! The character designs are award-winningly awesome, theanimation (while still having dips and hiccups here and there) is gorgeous, the background art mesmerizing.\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Not only are most of the OP/ED themes memorable, but the OST itself is FILLED with absolutely amazing, memorable tracks, most notably including catchy techno beats that fit surprisingly well with action scenes on one hand, and captivatingly ambient experimental rock tracks which make you feel like you're lifting on trapar waves without a care in the world on the other. \\n\r\nEverything about Eureka Seven screams creativity, and you can tell that the whole project is filled with love and passion from its creators.\\n\r\nAll of these components give it that special, nostalgic feeling that kicks in as soon as you start the show and never goes away.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that this nostalgia in particular is what makes people love this show so much and sometimes even neglect the show's problems, which, if you manage to wake up from that ecstatic, youthful, pure fun feeling this show puts you in, you'll realize aren't that small.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to point out the show's length. It's 50 episodes long, which is not the most common length. Maybe one that you see once a year or once every 2 years. This relatively chunky length springs up 2 major problems.\\n\r\nThe first one is the fact that the show is filled with unnecessary filler. I'd dare say almost half of the show is weird, out of place slice-of-life stuff that drastically slows the story down. Now don't get me wrong, I'd take the development of the characters (most of which are, mind you, surprisingly deep and realistic already) over awkward, badly explained politics/military/sci-fi shenanigans we will get into later. However, most of the filler doesn't even develop the characters much, but instead puts them in weird, one-episode gag situations which end up serving little to no benefits to the story later on (for example the mission where Renton goes out in the field as an in-disguise spy, or the infamous soccer episode).\\n\r\nThe second problem which is sprung up by the length is the show's \"identity crisis\". What I mean by this is the fact that the show changes its core genre way too much. It starts off as a shounen-esque adventure story, but shortly after switches to an organization-based rebel story. Then, it starts really focusing on the characters' psyches and problems, which works fine until the show starts focusing on Renton's and Eureka's relationship, at which point the other parts of the story get more and more neglected and unexplained in order to focus on those two as much as possible. The show's final... let's say approximately third focuses on the sci-fi part of the story which still somehow manages to be outshined by the beloved Eureka-and-Renton part. That, combined with the aforementioned filler chunks make the pacing of the story feel like one big mess.\\n\\n\r\nI saved the most glaring problem for last, that being the sci-fi/politics/worldbuilding part of the show. Let's face it, it's not the smartest thing ever. Most concepts that are introduced (and there's many) are either explained very briefly/poorly and not in the most understandable way, or just... not explained at all. It's not uncommon while watching this show to start thinking things like \"Wait, am I supposed to understand what they're talking about? Did I miss something? Am I dumb for not understanding it?\" only to realize that you indeed were not supposed to understand it, at which point a character just pulls out a bunch of info out of nowhere. However, you then realize that if they knew that all along, they could have done something about some situations that have already happened beforehand, which then makes you pull out your hair in frustration because of how dumb these decent characters end up looking because of weird directing decisions. And yes, I do blame the aforementioned two problems for this one to a certain extent. If only the pacing was better and some of the filler left out, they would have been able to explain and flesh out these concepts properly and make them feel less dumb/shoehorned in.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nEureka Seven is not a perfect show. Far from one, in fact. However, its real charm lays in its characters, world, atmosphere and just sheer fun factor.\\n\r\nIt's like that one game from your childhood that isn't anything amazing objectively, but it still feels special to you no matter when or how much you play it because it brings you back to those simpler, better times when you were just a daydreaming playful kid without a care in the world. \\n\r\nIt explores themes such as family, love, jealousy, happiness, loneliness, etc. in such a way that really makes you invested in these characters to the point where they end up feeling almost like best friends to you.\\n\r\nWhen I look at the members of Gekkostate, I don't just see a bunch of fictional characters. I see a group of friends, a family, people who'll always be by my side no matter where I am.\\n\r\nRenton, Eureka, Holland, Talho, Stoner, Hap, Mattheiu, Hilda, Maeter, Linck, Maurice, Moondoggie, Gidget, Mischa, Jobs, Woz, Ken-goh, Gonzy, and last but not least, Nirvash. They'll always hold a special place in my heart and I'll never forget the fun times I had on Gekko alongside all of them.\\n\r\nThat feeling is something that's really hard to find nowadays, even in the best of shows. That's why I think Eureka Seven deserves all of the love it gets, and why it should remain to be a timeless classic for all of eternity.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "So much unrealized potential. I began watching Eureka Seven on the basis of the many positive reviews here and elsewhere, but was gravely disappointed in what I experienced. There is indeed the foundation for a great work here, and there is within it some exceptional parts, but they are too few and far between to support a fifty-episode run. \r\nMy principle issue is certainly with the lead characters, nearly all of whom are more frequently frustrating to watch than endearing and spend far too much time whining and lazing about like some useless wretches. There are numerous secondary characters who are far more intriguing andwho barely get any screen time, or are elevated to a \"mauve shirt\" before vanishing or being killed off. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a good balance between mystery and explanation of the tech, which I like. Not too much is revealed but enough to give it some plausible functionality. Similarly with the historical background; much is left for you to fill in but this is more a benefit than a detriment. The score(s) have been universally praised, and with good reason, but the art is strangely inconsistent. Some of the design is clearly shared with Bounen no Xamdou (also produced by studio Bones), but it pales in comparison on all counts to it otherwise. \\n\\n",

            "content": "- - - [ Eureka Seven :: Eps: 50 :: Rating: 9.9/10 ] - - -\r- [ Intro ] -\rWhile enduring one of my anime-deprivation periods, I saw Eureka Seven with a high rating. I said why not and proceeded to get all of its 50 episodes. I started watching it only recently, after going through Ergo Proxy. Upon opening the first episode, I went o_0 then 0_0 instantly! Eureka Seven has a great OP and accompanying music! This promised to be a great anime. I could not resist going on after seeing the first episode. I can say I went through the episodes likea breeze, almost refusing to stop!\\n\\n\rSo, let me just say it here, loud and clear: Eureka Seven is DEFINITELY THE BEST ANIME I HAVE SEEN! It was a total addiction to me, and it still is!\\n\\n\rBear with me, this review will be quite lengthy! Eureka Seven (E7) really deserves it anyways!\\n\\n\r- [ Animation = Excellent = 10 ] -\\n\\n\rThe animation of E7 is really, and I mean it,  really impressive! The characters are extremely well drawn. Not your general, wide-eyed anime models but they are definitely well made. Their features are very well-detailed and their appearance is very good. Their clothes are futuristic and kinda cool in a way. E7 involves mechas, and as you could expect, they are quite stiff and roughly drawn. NO! They are the opposite! Their designs are well-polished and smoothly drawn. Here too, the features are very well-detailed. The motion of both characters and mechas are extremely smooth and not glitchy, specially considering that E7 involves something called \"reffing\" which resembles snowboarding. Even at the apex of fast-paceness, the motion is real smooth. The characters' movements are natural and not robotic and their poses are very human-like. Granted, the mechas look a bit like Evangelion's or perhaps even RahXephon's. But in E7, they are well coloured, and in my opinion, better designed. In a way, the way the characters were designed represent their personality. I'll leave it at that without elaboration. Go find out for yourself!\\n\\n\rNow, the backgrounds and sceneries of E7 are again impressive. Well detailed, well drawn, good play on lighting and atmosphere gives them a truly unique feel. You won't be seeing much scenery anyway, as most of the scenes will be above clouds. But when you do see real scenery, it's nice! They vary from the lively towns, to lush and wild nature and colourful flowers, to the dark and grungy industrial zones and to the dark, moody and emotional scenes. The transition between these scenes is so smooth that you rarely notice that you have suddenly changed decors! The light works was well done and will give more life and vividity to scenes. Notice the rock textures and how light is used to bring out the relief. The people at BONES have done something very good here.\\n\\n\rThe greatest part of the animation lies in the battle and action scenes, particularly those involving the characters \"reffing\". The action is so smooth! There are no robotic movements, even when the action is at its climax and everything is going fast. No blurs, no glitches and no flaws! Great!! And also, there are almost no frame re-use except for flashbacks (there are not many). Take for example, in Shaman King. Yoh is always seen summonning Amidamaru and this scene is in most episodes. Here, you won't find such repeating scenes often. Even if there are some repeats, they are different in their own ways.\\n\\n\r- [ Sound = StoryWriter wins! = 10 ] -\\n\\n\rI don't usually pay much attention to sounds and music in animes. Story, characters and animation usually get my attention. With E7 however, things are different! The OST for Eureka Seven is much varied from hard rock to electronic music! The OP music was great and I really enjoyed the music. However, the best song according to me, remains Storywriter by Supercar! I long to hear it again and again, and it has made it to my top favourites! It makes a really great accompaniment for action scenes, trust me. Yeaaaahhhhhh! The techno beats you hear during fights or the rock you hear during major events are g.r.e.a.t!!!!\\n\\n\rE7 makes heavy use of music since there are lots of action scenes. However, for every scene, whatever it is (emotional or fast paced), the music chosen is right! It really highlights the scenes and make them so much more interesting! Definitely a good choice of music in E7, and definitely worth a listen! Sound effects too are present and nicely integrated into the scenes. Notice the wind \"whoosshhh\" when the chracters are reffing, and the sound of flapping clothes. It gives added realism to the scenes. Sometimes, you can hear accompanying explosions after a major bang! It's nice to note these, just for added realism.\\n\\n\rThe voice actors did a pretty good job too! However, for some characters like Anemone or MoonDoggie, you can have some difficulty to understand them, due to their accents. Anyway, it's not a real problem if you got fansubbed episodes, or subbed DVDs.\\n\\n\r- [ Story = Complexity and Details = 9.9 ] -\\n\\n\rEureka Seven starts with our main male character, Renton aged 14 in his hometown of Bellforest, enjoying his life, albeit 14 years of boredom as he mentions. One day, a huge robot (an LFO) crashes in his grand-father, Alex's workshop. Out of it emerges a beautiful young girl, our main female character, Eureka. Dumbfounded by her beauty and mysteriousness, Renton is immediately love-struck. However, the millitary was pursuing Eureka. Eureka is a member of GekkoState - a sort millitia/anti-government, non-conformist reffers group, led by Holland. Eureka must return to GekkoState at all costs. However, Holland had another mission - to get the Amita Drive from Alex, a device developed by Renton's late father and world hero, Adrock Thurston. To help in Eureka's escape, Renton grabs his reffing board and tries to deliver the Amita Drive to Eureka who is now escaping in her LFO, the Nirvash. Inspired by his all-time hero Holland, Renton would like to join GekkoState to train as a mechanic. Holland, accepts (although not very gladly), and so Renton becomes GekkoState's youngest member, and his adventures and romance now start. \\n\\n\rSome main characters are Talho, main pilot of GekkoGo. Holland, the commander. Ken-Goh, the weapons expert. Stoner, photographer and editor of Ray=Out magazine which is very anti-government and was hence banned. Hap, second commander and Holland's friend. Misha, the on-board doctor. Jobs and Woz, the ship engineers. MoonDoggie, catapult operator and secondary pilot. Gidget, communications operator. Hilda and Matthiew, LFO pilots. And Renton and Eureka, Nirvash pilots and main characters. And also, the Nirvash LFO can also be considered a character at the end of E7.\\n\\n\rOk, my description is not very great but story is really one of the greatest strengths of E7. The plotline is really complex and deep. Agreed, you have one main plotline that runs through the entire series. However, what is interesting is the way that plotline is explored from various angles and according to various characters' point of view. This gives an added understanding of the plotline. You will also see many innovative things like Trappar Particles, LFO's, Reffing, Amita Drive, and Coralians! Indeed, it's a very elaborate plotline. Interestingly enough, you will sometimes find the plotline diverging to explore various side characters' stories eg. William B. Baxter's story. Don't worry, it's here for a purpose - that is of explaining the global situation from different people's perspective.\\n\\n\rThe story runs very deep, exploring such things as war and conflicts between friends, companionship, unfaltering loyalty, indomitable will to protect, duty, love, sense of justice, and the loss of close-persons. Sometimes, the emotions get real heavy and the sensitive views might be moved to tears, no joke! It can become very heavy and emotional sometimes, specially scenes involving the above-mentioned. It's a very well detailed plotline, with many interesting twists that add spice to an already very interesting story. It's a good blend of romance, action, mecha and adventure. Definitely my type!\\n\\n\rThrough the course of the story, you will have the opportunity to explore the characters' past and get to know them better. You won't find many loopholes or dark points here as everything is well explained. Expect emotional warfare, painful pasts, jealousy, self-sacrifice, the death of companions, inter-crewmate conflicts and resolutions of conflicts by various ways according to the characters, added to some good philosophies about love and the other things I mentioned! It's a nice lesson in a way.\\n\\n\rHowever, expect a major change of pace after Episode 26. You will be seeing more adult-related things, like blood and death more often. Just a warning. Mind you, many weird and frankly, strange things are awaiting you from Episode 31 and onwards! You would think you are in some kind of toon movie! :D\\n\\n\rThe plotline offers no boredom since the characters constantly change and adapt, specially on the emotional level. I like the way the twists in emotions are introduced. It's subtle, but really present. E7 is really a great piece of work and you will see lots of unexpected things. Pay close attentions to the play on words. The GekkoState assault on Capital Hill really got me stuck.\\n\\n\rOne thing to hate is the presence of Maeter, Linck and Maurice! Damn! These 3 kids know how to ruin the mood and atmosphere! In my opinion, they got no place in E7! Another is the complexity of some plots! You don't understand anything at first, but it's revealed after. Although there are some minor things which are left unexplained, or are not given enough elaboration, it cannot beat the greatness of E7. (Except only one which needed more elaboration). Anyways, if you use your brains a bit, it's not hard to figure out those un-explainations! :D\\n\\n\rOverall, E7 has a real smooth way for proceeding with the story, smooth and sweet! Just what I've been looking. No rush, no incessant/useless main character deaths, no plotholes, no fillers, just pure delight. Good job, E7! Frankly, it has the damn B.E.S.T ending I've ever seen so far, surpassing even my previous \"favourite ending\", Last Exile. Eureka Seven devoted almost one episode just for ending, a weird (and surreal) ending! Talk about a good finisher! :D\\n\\n\rAnd now, for a bit of selfishness (shared selfishness IMHO): I WANT EUREKA SEVEN MOVIE TO EXPLAIN EVERYBORY'S ENDINGS! :D\\n\\n\rP.s. Why 9.9 and not 10? Because some important events got left out of the explanations. You could guess what they were, but an explanantion would have been easier. That's why I substracted 0.1 marks!\\n\\n\r- [ Characters = I like the name \"MoonDoggie\" :p = 10 ] -\\n\\n\rOk, it's not *just* because I like the name \"MoonDoggie\" but it's still a very hilarious name! The characters really deserve that 10. I've really seen such a diverse and complex cast of characters. So I think it's better that I introduce some of the main characters first. I can't do that for all of them since there are so many (25-like main characters! Sugoi! :S)\\n\\n\rAnyways, let's start by our main character, Renton. He's what you will call a normal guy. No super-powers a-la-Bleach here. No, he's just normal, leading a normal life. However, he is still the son of Adrock Thurston, the guy who saved the world. Quite a name to carry around. Renton gets accepted on GekkoGo (GekkoState's ship). Now, this is not what he expected. Holland is kind of a slave-master! He kinda get beaten up, get used as a.. duh slave, and things like that. Life's not all pleasant for him, all because Holland is... jealous! LOL! No joke! Anyways, E7 beautifully illustrates his development through it's 50 eps, going from a not-worth-anything to the.. (Spoiler. Cannot tell you!). He's got much ahead of him. I really cannot say more without spoiling major things.\\n\\n\rEureka. Beautiful, quiet, mysterious. Love-at-first-sight for Renton, who would do anything to protect her. Her development is well-presented too. Mind you, strange things are awaiting you at the end of E7, be ready for it! This girl has many secrets and lots of potential. Although, she appears to lack emotions (which Renton teaches her), but she's an adept at LFO combat. Enough here, cuz spoilers are coming if I continue.\\n\\n\rOn with Holland. The master of reffing and Renton (and all kids') all-time god (hero/idol) and commander of GekkoState. Holland appears to be a fun character, and somewhat stern. However, Renton was badly mistaken. Holland is just the opposite of what he seems to be. He is like a father for GekkoState, protecting everybody and self-sacrificing for the sake of others. Midway through E7, he undergoes dramatic changes, all for the best.\\n\\n\rTalho! The captain of Gekko-Go. She is the leash for Holland, restricting his impulses and setting him in the right direction. She has a secret (ok, not so secret) crush on Holland.\\n\\n\rHap, the everything-doer. Not much to say, but he still has quite a role in E7. Similarly, Woz (strange hat man!), Jobs (Hitman's son?), Gonzy, Gidget, MoonDoggie (Doggie Nii-san! LOL!), Stoner and the others have their respective roles to play, but they are very diverse from each other, and each's development is well planned and well presented. Their emotional developments are very well introduced, smoothly and at the correct pace, giving the viewer time to digest the changes and appreciate them.\\n\\n\rThere are characters on the other side (bad side) if you want, like Dominic, Anemone, the Sages the millitary and Dewey. But I can't explain about them without spoiling. Expect something Gundam Seed Destiny-like with Dewew. The others are not so bad, but take soooo long to realise it.\\n\\n\rThe hierarchy is: Sages -> Dewew -> Millitary -> Dominic -> Anemone. Or something like that.\\n\\n\rAs you can see, there are literally lots and lots of characters in E7, and that goes without mentioning important side characters like Diane Thurston, William B. Baxter and the others. They have important roles to play and are here to reveal parts of the E7 plot to us, in a subtle way. It allows the viewer to get a global view of E7 and from different perspectives. There is literally lots and lots to tell about E7's cast, but I leave their discovery to you. I can't spoil the fun furthur.\\n\\n\r- [ Value and Enjoyment = YEAH!!! = 10! ] -\\n\\n\rIf you haven't guessed by now, Eureka Seven is just great and I really enjoyed my watching experience. I am now going to rewatch it, just to get a clearer view of it. In fact, Eureka Seven is one of the rare anime that I have ever rewatched. And frankly, it deserves it. I would rank the rewatch value as \"Very High\". At the end, you will want to rewatch it from the beginning, just to watch the characters and story's evolution again, from a new and enlightened perspective. And to gain a better understanding of E7's magnificent story of course!\\n\\n\rI really, really enjoyed Eureka Seven and it is now my top favourite. It deserves this space. Eureka Seven is a masterpiece, take it from a fellow fan.\\n\\n\rNow, E7 might have some plotholes and some things that weren't elaborated extensively, just as any other anime have. But the positive aspects of E7 fully compensate for these small (tiny) losses. You won't even feel them. Nothing is perfect, but I believe E7 approaches perfection up to its nose!\\n\\n\rAs summary: Rewatch Value? Very High. Enjoyed myself? I kinda went overboard! Was E7 good? Na, no good. It is simply a masterpiece!\\n\\n\r- [ Conclusions ] -\\n\\n\rGo watch Eureka Seven!! That's all there is to say. You won't regret it. I know some people will be dissatisfied with my review, but I am just expressing my opinions. And I consider Eureka Seven to be a true success! Go watch it and draw your own conclusions. I do not think you would regret it. And I am not joking, it really deserves these \"10\"'s from me!\\n\\n\rNow, I sincerely await a movie. Not because was bad (in fact, it was great. Strange but great!). But because I really want to see more of Renton and Eureka, of Holland and Talho, of MoonDoggie and of Dominic and Anemone. I would like more about their endings, and what has become of them. The mere glances I got at the end is not enough to satisfy my hunger! I hope the creators of E7 can hear me! :D\\n\\n\rThank you for reading my review. I know it was long. If something needs elaboration, contact me. I will amend the review where needed. Sayonara and go enjoy Eureka Seven!",

            "content": "\u201cEureka 7\u201d is definitely an entertaining series even if not a great one. The artistry oozing from the animation, designs, and music may help you overlook the story\u2019s schizophrenic inanity. \r\nThe show\u2019s supreme craftsmanship provides the spoonful sugar for its less-than-tasty story. It\u2019s easy to watch these fifty episodes when the characters and their world are as creative and eye-popping as \u201cEureka 7\u2019s.\u201d Bolstering the shows designs and animation is one of the best soundtracks to bless a show; most impressive is the music\u2019s ability to capture each of the story\u2019s emotions with a perfectly mellifluous track.\r\n\u201cEureka 7\u201d suffers mainly from an identity crisis thatends up degrading the overall story. It begins as a really fun, rebels-versus-establishment adventure set in a world where skaters and hipsters reign as the supreme good guys. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they creators would have stuck with this tone; it\u2019s original and fun and would have lent itself perfectly to a. However, the show soon veers toward a melancholy, internal drama, and, before the fifty episodes are over, \u201cEureka 7\u201d takes another sharp turn toward silly romance.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m too harsh, though. \u201cEureka 7\u201d is targeted at teens, and if you can successfully put yourself into the mind of a na\u00efve, romantic teen (see every teen), it\u2019s easier to forgive the show for its flourishes.\\n\\n\r\nLess forgivable, however, is the fragmentation of the story and characters caused by the shifting focus from adventure to drama to romance. Running in so many directions causes \u201cEureka 7\u201d to roll its ankle, and the show never achieves any emotional impact. This is particularly disappointing since many of the characters had great potential to connect with the audience. Unfortunately, with the changes, the characters lose their original luster, drastically degrade into one-dimensional stereotypes, or drop from the story entirely.\\n\\n\r\nAs critical as I may be, please note that I watched \u201cEureka 7\u201d nearly continually at every chance I got. It is, for the most part, an enjoyable series. To best enjoy this show, appreciate the audio-visual experience and always remember the target audience is young teenagers. \\n",

            "content": "At first I was skeptical as to just how good this series would be and the 50 episode runtime was a bit daunting however I began watching anyway as it seemed the most interesting out of the series I have waiting. I can say that I definitely wasn't disappointed. \r\nStory: \r\nI'm sure you've read the synopsis so I won't be mentioning that here. The story moves quicker than what you would expect from such a long series and this is a good thing as it minimizes any time where it would seem to be boring. This is even more impressive when you realize that thereis next to no filler and what filler there is was entertaining and worth watching. The context of the story and the way it evolves isn't over the top or unbelievable, it unfolds at a steady pace the entire time and doesn't ever feel rushed or drawn out either. I see that a couple others have said that at times it is hard to follow but that isn't the case at all if you're paying attention and overall its an enjoyable journey with a satisfactory ending even if it left you wanting just a couple more answers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art is definitely above average, the animation is smooth and the colour scheme works well. It is a great support for everything else and the variation in quality across the span of the series is minimal. There were times when a certain lack of shading was noticeable but they quickly passed. Its not the best around but it is very good and considering the length makes it all the more impressive. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is the only section i'll score a perfect 10, it really is outstanding. The music from the openings to the endings and everything in-between is enjoyable and not something you'll get sick of. Every track seems as if it could have been made to be used here and truly makes part of the show what it is. Sound effects and the like are perfectly acceptable, definitely above average. I haven't heard the dub so I can't comment on it but the Japanese voice acting fit well and no characters voice felt out of place. Overall a very pleasing experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are great, you won't see any cardboard cutouts here, each character is multi-dimensional and all add to the story. Eureka at first seems distant and not quite developed but thats exactly how she's meant to be, you find yourself waiting for scenes where she and Renton interact with eachother for this is where alot of entertainment comes from. Seeing her grow as a person from that is quite something. That leads me to Renton, an average kid by all means, at times its downright annoying how naive and childish he really is but he learns from it and by the end you can truly see how he has grown. With all of this you may be asking why I rated it only an 8, thats because of the three kids, maybe I just dislike kids altogether but they cry at the drop of a hat, mess things up due to their own selfishness and are just a plain annoyance, I found myself becoming slightly irate everytime they were on screen. However i'm sure thats how people sometimes feel around real kids as well so if they were given just a little less screen time I guess I could have brushed it off. Overall the character development is really great especially concerning Eureka and Renton, further more apart from the kids I didn't find myself disliking any character which is a testament to how well made they all really are. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI watched the series in three days and it never felt like it dragged on, I was always eager to see what came in the next episode and overall I really did enjoy this series. It just has the feeling of being enjoyable, taking you on a ride and you find it hard to leave. Once again I felt the kids detracted from this but whatever shortcomings they bring are immediately made up for by the rest. Enjoyment level for this series is high. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end its an interesting, enjoyable and great series. Don't let the length put you off, if you watch anime then this is something you should see.",

            "content": "Eureka seveN is about saving the world! ...Eventually!!\r\nSTORY - A strange girl and her mecha enter Renton\u2019s life one day. He quickly develops a crush on her and decides to leaves his home and stay with her by joining Gekkostate, a group of outlaws and his childhood heroes. Shenanigans follow. There are vague and unclear plot developments that happen in the background, but the actual story will not really start to manifest for another twenty or thirty episodes, and even then, it\u2019s difficult to figure out what exactly anyone\u2019s try to do, much less how they intend to do it. Eureka seveN has some ofthe most frustrating and ridiculous pacing I\u2019ve ever seen. Many of the first dozen or so episodes feel like filler \u2014 some characters are developed and some histories are uncovered, but you are pretty much following the Gekkostate around as they take odd jobs to pay for food. You know they are rebels, but you don\u2019t know why they\u2019re rebelling or what they hope to accomplish. People attack and they fight back. They investigate things, but there is no clear sense of purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, there are several high-tension and climatic moments, but again, thorough explanations are difficult to come by and many of the characters don\u2019t seem to really know what\u2019s going on either. They are just compelled to put themselves into situations without understanding why, and when each climax is over, life goes on\u2026 to even more filler-like episodes; it\u2019s as if they\u2019re trying to make you forget about any plot-relevant developments by inserting that pointless soccer episode. Instead of devoting time to the overall plot of the series, Eureka seveN spends a lot of time developing more general themes like religious discrimination, family relationships, responsibility, and identity. While that isn\u2019t terrible in itself, it would have been infinitely better if plot progression (and explanation) didn\u2019t have to be sacrificed for them (and if the characters involved were more sympathetic).\\n\\n\r\nEventually, and by eventually, I mean like, the last ten episodes, things finally start falling into place and there is a lot of late exposition. Some of the overarching ideas could have been deduced from earlier clues, but a majority of the details couldn\u2019t have been, further making the bulk of the series feel scattered and unimportant. There is also a lot of \u201csurprise\u201d revelations and character \u201cdevelopment\u201d near the end that feel incredibly cheap and unnecessary. The final plot of the series, when all is revealed, is actually pretty interesting. A lot of the concepts presented are thoughtful and unique, if a bit far-fetched in some regards. It\u2019s a story with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, because of the insistent, terrible pacing leading up to the late explanation, my patience was completely gone and I couldn\u2019t force myself to care about the story so late in the game. So I sat through the last few episodes just hoping for a good fight to wrap everything up. (But I got rainbows instead.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Renton and Eureka both start off as pretty typical archetypes \u2014 the protagonist boy who wants adventure, and the mysterious girl that you know is special for one plot device reason or another. Neither of them interested me. Instead, it was the crew of the Gekko that initially attracted me and kept me going through those opening filler episodes. Since there is so little going on plot-wise for the first half of the series, most of the focus was on character interaction and relationships. Holland, the captain, quickly establishes himself as an interesting and sympathetic character; he is the one with the rough past and a goal, even if you have no idea what that goal is initially. Talho is also sympathetic, partially because it\u2019s rare to see characters with established romantic relationships. The rest of the ship\u2019s crew offers little beyond the basic support roles; now and again, there were be attempts to spotlight them, but it was never anything really meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as the series progressed, all of the characters got more and more irritating. For someone who is supposedly fourteen, Renton\u2019s perspective and train of thought is incredibly juvenile most of the time and the idiocy of some of his thought processes frustrated me to no end. He chooses to leave his \u201cboring\u201d life behind in pursuit of a girl he just met and knows nothing about and is upset when things don\u2019t go his way. Am I supposed to sympathize with that? He is absurdly naive (can\u2019t even realize when the entire crew is trolling him) and sometimes seems forcibly ignorant, especially when it comes to fighting and his role aboard the Gekko. Eureka is similarly clueless, though she has the excuse of not being \u201cnormal,\u201d for whatever reason. But the most aggravating thing about the pair of them is their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nTo some extent, there is the illusion that their relationship actually develops and matures throughout the series, but the truth is that their relationship is completely idealistic from beginning to end. Renton\u2019s attraction starts off as just infatuation, and yet he immediately decides that he wants to follow her and \u201cbe with her.\u201d Eureka is more ignorant, but as soon as she starts to realize it, there are no longer any doubts. Their misunderstandings are grounded in stupidity and they don\u2019t seem to feel much conviction in their fights, implying that they are too purely \u201cin love\u201d to have serious disagreements. The bumps in their road are superficial at best, including Eureka\u2019s adopted children, who have little point or personality beyond (over-)emphasizing the familial themes present throughout the series. As the primary protagonists, Renton and Eureka\u2019s failure to really make me care about them alongside the haphazard pacing of the story makes me wonder how I managed to finish the fifty episodes series at all, since unsympathetic characters is my #1 reason for dropping series.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Holland also falls down the immaturity path where many of his actions and views are decidedly juvenile and illogical. A believably character flaw, certainly, but as the story refuses to allow him to explain his conflicts and frustrations in detail, it\u2019s difficult to sympathize with the way he acts, and he just gets annoying after a while. Talho was the last character I had any respect for; her jealousies and frustrations were the easiest to deduce and thus the easiest to sympathize with, especially since she actually confronted them now and again. Sadly, the maturity of her character seems to take her out of the spotlight during much of the latter half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nDewey, the primary antagonist, takes his damn sweet time coming into direct relevance since he spends the entire first half of the series lurking in the shadows and vaguely putting together his grand plan. Even when those plans are put into motion though, his motivation remains unclear until the finale, so there\u2019s no chance for understanding or sympathizing with what he\u2019s trying to do. In the interim, Dominic never really presents himself as an enemy and never does anything particularly interesting or relevant; most of the focus is instead on his abusive relationship with Anemone, who, aside from being obviously tsundere for him the whole time, isn\u2019t properly explained until the last five episodes or so (and even then, not very well at all). Additional characters include Charles and Raye, who are unnervingly creepy in their parental affection, and Norb, who is an expository plot device more than an actual character (though he does have an ironic personality).\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE & ANIMATION \u2013 Eureka seveN has some really great battle scenes, but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from BONES. Everything is smoothly animated and fun to watch, so even though I has very little emotional investment in the characters and subsequently, the actual outcomes of the battles \u2014 I still liked watching them. The mecha designs are a bit reminiscent of those from Evangelion, but there\u2019s a lot more variety between the various suits, including the way they\u2019re piloted (especially when you consider the typeZERO VS the typeTheEND). The giant boards and surfing parallel seemed kind of ridiculous at first, but it really grew on me after a while (besides, Code Geass had rollerblading mechas, though Eureka seveN debuted first). At the very least, the concept makes flying sequences much, much more interesting, and the added danger of a pilot losing their board mid-fight is fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs in the series are simple and attractive, and I really liked that a few of the characters made a point to change their appearances at certain points in the story, usually in correspondence with a significant change in their mindset and goals. More series should do this, if only to accentuate the fact that their characters actually mature over time.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - There\u2019s obviously a ton of hiphop influence in this series, so it was no surprise to see it reflected in the music as well. It\u2019s always nice to mix up the game a little by injecting some atypical genres into the soundtrack, and Eureka seveN does a good job here. Additionally, there is a ton of really, really epic music that is occasionally paired with a scene that\u2019s quite a bit less than epic, which makes things feel out of place. \u2014 those tracks would probably sound better independent of the series so they don\u2019t seem so pretentious. About halfway through the show, I finally noticed Naoki Sato\u2019s name in the opening credits and had an \u201cahha! that\u2019s why the music is awesome\u201d moment. The last time I heard Sato\u2019s work was in the X TV series, where the music was its single greatest asset. It\u2019s not quite as true here, but it\u2019s close.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t pay attention to most of the opening and ending themes in Eureka seveN. I enjoyed the rap in the second opening, \u201cShounen Heart,\u201d by Home Made Kazoku, but most of the others were pretty forgettable, especially since I\u2019m indifferent towards most of the involved artists. All the themes were also much shorter than usual \u2014 they hovered around thirty seconds in length, rather than the usual minute.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING \u2013 I saw this series dubbed, which probably further contributed to my lack of sympathy towards Renton. I didn\u2019t realize that Johnny Yong Bosch was Renton for a long time since the voice was incredibly different from his other roles. Renton sounds (and acts) incredibly young, and his voice was both over-the-top earnest, naive, and whiny. On one hand, it\u2019s actually an incredible fit for the character; on the other hand, it was annoying as hell, especially when coupled with lots of fail dialogue. Stephanie Sheh as Eureka was also rather fitting, but much less irritating. Honestly, the dub cast did a great job: each voice was distinct and unique, and every voice fit their character very well. Crispin Freeman as Holland was pretty badass in particular.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there was a quite a bit of awkward dialogue and word usage. A lot of lines were unnecessarily corny or just outright awkward (like, \u201cMm, smell that? That\u2019s the smell of your Papa!\u201d \u201c\u2026It smells good.\u201d) though that can obviously be attributed to awkwardness in the original script. I found the use of \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cPapa\u201d in place of \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d kind of strange though, and it sounded unnatural coming from a lot of the characters, especially Renton. Lastly, there are a handful of slips in the pronunciation of \u201cEureka\u201d throughout the series. Most are by minor characters and not particularly notable, but it\u2019s an indication of sloppiness all the same.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Given all the positive recommendations I\u2019d gotten for this series, I\u2019m pretty damn disappointed with how things turned out, especially since the finale revealed that the story could have been ten times more interesting if presented in a more efficient manner. The pacing, along with the quick evaporation of my sympathies towards the cast, really destroyed the little enjoyment I was getting from technical aspects of the show. I really wanted to drop the series around the halfway point, but I figured I\u2019d already invested so much time into it, I might as well finish it (what a stupid train of logic rarely does it reward you in the end). A recap movie of this series might work a lot better since it would, theoretically, cut out a lot of the excess filler crap and force the actual plot out into the open much faster. The recently released Eureka seveN movie, Pocketful of Rainbows, isn\u2019t a recap movie though, so I\u2019m not going to watch it. I\u2019ve had enough of rainbows.\\n",

            "content": "Thankfully, Infinity (the first reviewer) posted a wonderfully analytic review of this anime already, so I can forebear myself to post another. Instead, I just want to reinforce his review with a few short comments on my part.\r\nFirst of all, this anime is, without *any* reservation whatsoever, the best anime I have ever seen. The storyline is engrossing, the character development surpasses anything I have ever seen before (although, admittedly, I don't watch many pure dramas), the animation flows true and clear even through the most active fight scenes, and the sound is perfect. \r\nThe anime begins with this immature kid we see expressing his'modest' dreams to be a great reffer (air surfer) like a great hero of his. Then as we follow this kid through the story, we see his development into a far more mature and responsible person. Similarly, we are introduced early on to a pretty little female character, looking for the world as the stereotypical innocent maiden. But again, as we go on, we learn that (surprise) she actually has a past, and a good story to tell about herself! Character depth is increased incredibly throughout the show!\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, as I stated before, its smooth and clear. I really like how this anime refuses to do the whole 'rinse and repeat' cycle with its scenes. We rarely see repetition, unless actually needed by the story.\\n\\n\r\nI'll finish this off now with a comment about the ending: It is one of the best endings I have ever seen in my life. I can say this openly; this is the *only* other anime aside from the Chrno Crusade that has ever made me cry. Trust me, I don't do that easily. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful show. It has singlehandedly made a spot for itself on my list. After watching this, I moved every single other anime aside from Chrno Crusade down a point because it had set a new standard for quality.",

When I say unpredictable, I hardly mean it in a good way. I enjoyed it in the beginning to some point (when I wasn't sleeping through it) but I was also annoyed by the basically completely unlikable cast (Renton, anyone?) Renton never EVER became anything good in my mind. He was obnoxious even when he grew a pair. Eureka was just too weak in my opinion. Whenever I liked or found a character interesting, they were either killed off or they woulddo something I didn't like. *sigh* I lament having watched this show in its entirety, as by the end, I hated every character and found no satisfaction in the romances or resolution. I also found the story quite whack. Anyway, I admittedly did enjoy the music. Open and End themes were good throughout and the background music was nice too. The art was good at times but often made the characters appear quite ugly. I kept watching this to the end, hoping it would get better but I feel like it got worse. I apologize if I've insulted anyone. I just did not like this anime at all, but I will not say it was a waste of time...",

            "content": "Story: 8 - Sweeping and poignant, but fraught with several filler episodes and inconsistent pacing.\r\nCharacters: 10 - Dynamic and well-developed cast all-around. Flawed, but likable heroes as well as sympathetic and compelling antagonists. \r\nArt: 8 - Fluid and emotive, but with a tendency to go off-model.\r\nSound: 9 - Fantastic use of music, memorable soundtrack, solid voice casting. \r\nEnjoyment: 10 - A fun and emotional ride with surprising complexity and thematic resonance. \r\nFull review:\r\nWhere do I even start with this? There\u2019s just so much going on in this thing that it\u2019s hard to organize my thoughts. Most stories tend to stick to one or two centralthemes, and explore those. E7 takes the shotgun approach, and decides it wants to talk about everything. It has multiple thematic elements, from coming of age, to anti-war messages, to quasi-environmentalism. Several prominent romance arcs. Tons of character development all around. Recurring flower motifs, allusions to American counter-culture movements, and countless nods to other sci-fi and mecha franchises(my favorite of which is the backpack in the episode titled \u201cRunaway\u201c being the same colors as Evangelion Unit 01. I see what you did there, Bones). I\u2019m kind of amazed how much they managed to pack into this show without it becoming nonsensical. And I think ultimately, it does make sense. The story is thematically and logically consistent, and with the exception of a few filler episodes, is reasonably well-executed. The entire first act doubles as foreshadowing for the third, and the third act despite being totally absurd, feels surprisingly free of plot holes and deus ex machina. Any lingering questions can be chalked up to purposefully ambiguous sci-fi nonsense, rather than inadvertently bad writing. I think what fundamentally makes E7 work as well as it does is that it feels less like a linear narrative, and more like a series of individual moments threaded to a common conclusion. Fate isn\u2019t always determined by one catastrophic event or miracle, and life isn\u2019t always a straight path. In that sense, E7 feels as true-to-life as an anime about sky-surfing counterculture resistance mecha pilots reasonably could be. It feels like if these were real people, and real events, things would play out exactly as the show does. In a lot of ways, even more so than RahXephon, E7 seems to be Bones' answer to Evangelion. It borrows a lot of Eva's themes, and character archetypes, but spins them in a much more optimistic way. While Evangelion uses post-modern existentialist ideas of subjective personal reality as a means to self-actualization, E7 takes the opposite approach. We're all stuck in this reality together, and even though interpersonal relationships can be painful, it's also what makes life worth living. And rather than simply internalizing your flaws, using your loved ones supplement those flaws instead. Which is an equally valid, and far more positive point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Bones is a name that carries a lot of weight in the anime world, and it\u2019s impossible not to have a few preconceived expectations going into one of their projects. Fortunately, E7 holds up pretty well. Shortcuts are taken largely where they won\u2019t matter, and special attention is given to the frenetic action scenes and somber dramatic moments. The character designs are distinct and expressive. Many a quiet forlorn glance speaks volumes more than any line of dialogue ever could. Use of color in E7 is all very deliberate and very beautiful. From Eureka\u2019s own soft feminine blues, to the gloomy grayed-out hues of a ruined cityscape. The world of E7 adopts a full range of sentiment and tone, feeling very organic and dynamic in the process. The cinematography is no slouch, either. Gorgeous sweeping landscapes and dramatic close-ups are used liberally and to great effect. With the exception of a few sporadic slips of model consistency, most egregious in the second act, E7 is everything to be expected of a Bones production. And that includes the anime\u2019s absolutely fantastic soundtrack. The electronic techno/hip-hop and cheesy Jpop, usually reserved for shows trying way too hard to be hip and cool, integrates perfectly with the sci-fi counterculture aesthetic. So much so that E7 makes it point to use them in-story on several important occasions. Episode titles are even taken from various song titles. The use of music as a narrative device in E7, while not quite Cowboy Bebop and Princess Tutu levels, is rather impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe series greatest strength, however, and Bones' decided strong-suit, is the characterization. There are at least six complete character arcs in this story, and several smaller arcs for key secondary characters. The characters are dynamic, with their own distinct personalities that color their actions, and inner demons that they struggle to overcome. The way they act, speak, and the decisions they make are all consistent with the people the story makes them out to be. The romantic entanglements are arguably the weakest part of the show, seeming rather forced and melodramatic in a few places, but are still handled more nuanced and naturally than most other attempts. Making the relationships overall emotionally engaging and gratifying. Renton\u2019s frequent missteps with Eureka are especially humanizing. I think everyone can relate to that awkward moment of talking to the girl/guy you like and inadvertently saying something stupid or insensitive. Renton and Eureka have easily the most complete and dynamic character arcs in the series, as well as the most fleshed out relationship. Renton\u2019s journey from immature classical anti-hero, somewhat annoyingly narrated by the other characters, is both satisfying and heartwarming. While Eureka\u2019s humanization is both subtle and endearing. Making the absolute most of her Rei Ayanami archetype, which may be the best I\u2019ve ever seen it executed in a story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eureka Seven is a fun, and remarkably ambitious entry into its genre. It has a lot to say, and articulates in a way that is equal parts simple and meaningful. Aside from some minor pacing issues(I feel the show could have been 39 episodes), a bit of overwrought drama, and a few logical inconsistencies(Eureka\u2018s entire existence doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense in the long run), I don\u2019t really have any major problems with this show. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a flawless masterstroke, but it is definitive proof that \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cthoughtful\u201d are not mutually exclusive. And I think that it\u2019s a testament to what shounen action/adventure anime can strive to be.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is one of those animes that I wanted to watch ever since it came out in 2005. However, I was a kid back then and I was still mainly watching children's anime like Digimon, Pokemon, Beyblade etc. I did, however, watch some of the episodes from some older anime like Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, Outlaw Star and The Big O but for the most part, I was stuck watching kids due to my age. Fast forward to 2012 where not only I was watching anime more regularly but it was the same time were I started to watchmore teen/mature rated anime with my own will on the internet. When I eventually decided to watch Eureka Seven on TV I sadly could not find a channel that shows anime in the UK not to mention the DVDs were going out of print thanks to Beez Entertainment the UK version of Bandi Entrainment closing its store. Now fast-forward to Spring 2016 where one fateful day at the weekend I decided to pick up the out of print Anime Legends DVD collection set from my local CEX store and during that same weekend I marathon it and I aboustly loved it. Now fast forward to the year 2018 where after that unholy train-wreck that was called Darling in the Franxx I decided to re-watch Eureka Seven because not only I wanted to recover myself from the wrath that was Darling in the Franxx but I wanted to see how it holds up since my last watch of it.\\n\r\nSo do I think that Eureka Seven still good?\\n\\n\r\nWell let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story for Eureka Seven follows a young boy named Renton\u00a0Thurston who is currently living a boring life with his\u00a0grandfather in a boring town. While living the boring life Renton dreams of\u00a0joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. However, his life would change forever when\u00a0he meets and falls for Eureka, a mysterious LFO pilot who serves in Gekkostate, an anti-military group under the guise of a counter-cultural commune.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Eureka Seven is brilliant for the most part. While the show is at heart a coming of age story it slowly introduces other story elements such as war, love, and religion, and the show does a fantastic job at slowly blending in other story elements to the core story itself without feeling forced and pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nThe love story of Eureka Seven is by far one of the best love stories I have ever seen in anime. Eureka and Renton relationship in the series was fantastic and well executed. Not only they take the time to understand each other but they chararter chemistry between these two was great especially in the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a brilliant at exploring the themes of growing up, love, understanding one another, reality, human modification, depression and the show does them all great.\\n\r\nI also really loved how Eureka Seven used its tone. The first quarter of Eureka Seven is light-hearted fun but after that, the show started to become pretty dark where we see characters suffering from depression to characters dying left and right. It may not be as dark as Neon Genesis Evangelion but it\u2019s still pretty dark enough. Not to mention the show becomes way more complex as the series goes where they not only the world of Eureka Seven gets beautifully expanded but most of the show's themes that were established now have a darker edge to them.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\r\nMy favourite part of Eureka Seven was when Renton leaves the Gekkostate where he goes on a journey to discover about himself. This is where the coming of age story element comes into play because not only we see the already beautiful world of Eureka Seven being fleshed out even more but we see Renton grow up as a person during those episodes. Not mention the moment when Renton meets Charles and Ray is where the show reached masterpiece status for me as it constancy got better from that point on.\\n\r\n(End Of Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on talking how great Eureka Seven is but I think it\u2019s time to address two of the show minor issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe first issue that I had with Eureka Seven was the pacing in the first quarter of the show. Eureka Seven has pretty good pacing for the most part in general as the second half, in general, is beautifully paced, however, I felt the first quarter of Eureka Seven was pretty draggy where the show seemed to move at a very slow pace. Many events in the first quarter seem to drag on way longer than they should plus it doesn\u2019t help the fact that the character around that point of the story isn\u2019t exactly the likeable bunch where we see Eureka kids being annoying, Renton whining to Holland and Renton screaming contests which usually end up Holland punching Renton in a form of child abuse. Honestly, this wasn\u2019t really an issue for me as I don\u2019t mind shows that have slow pacing but I can acknowledge that it a problem especially for some anime fans who hate slower paced shows.\\n\r\nThe second and final issue that I had with Eureka Seven was that random scorer episode aka episode 39.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, that episode felt like a waste of time because not only it was really awkward to watch but it was just poorly timed where at that point of the story Renton and Eureka have gone through 9 tenths of the character development. If that soccer episode happened in the early episodes than I wouldn\u2019t mind it but since it came in so late in the series it just became distracting.\\n\r\nOverall despite those shortcomings, I thought the story of Eureka Seven was nicely crafted\u00a0\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf you don't count the three annoying kids the characters in Eureka Sever are pretty great. Yes, the characters do start off a bit rough but they really start to grow on you as the series progresses to a point where they become totally different people by the end.\\n\\n\r\nRenton is a brilliant character. Sure he may be a pain in the beginning for some due to his whiny personality but as the series progresses he transforms into a more compelling chararter that I really loved who gets amazing chararter development. Overall great character.\\n\\n\r\nEureka is a great character that I really liked. She starts off as this borderline emotionless girl who has difficulties dealing with her emotions as well as interacting with others but as the series progresses she develops as a character where she starts to understand emotions. Her character development also leads to Eureka falling in love with Renton wherein the second half of the series they have fantastic character chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie I didn\u2019t really liked Holland in the beginning thanks to his psychical child abuse to Renton as being a ass however after a certain event of the series which I won\u2019t spoil he become a much better to a point where not only he becomes a good father figure to Renton but he becomes more of a competent leader.\\n\\n\r\nTalho is a pretty cool character and I really loved his relationship with Holland. She\u2019s the main source of Holland character development in the series however she does have her own character development where she has to fully understand her role in the Gekkostate.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I didn't care for Domanic and Anomone as first thanks to them being copycats of Eureka and Renton however after a short while I really started to adore especially Anemone who became my favourite female character in the show thanks to her wonderful character development and back-story.\\n\\n\r\nThe final character that I want to talk to mention is Charles. I really adored this character to a point where I consider him to be the best characters in the show at times. Not only he has a great manly personality but he\u2019s also the main key of Renton character growth to the show even more than Holland ever did.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were pretty damm good for what they were and they were all enjoyable minus the main villain who is sadly pretty generic.\\n\r\nOther than the three kids as well the main villain the characters in Eureka Seven are great and memorable.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Eureka Seven is a masterpiece.\\n\r\nThe background scenery is very well done as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of the series.\\n\r\nThe charterers designs are also great and charming in they own ways especially for Eureka and Anemone who are some of the best looking female characters I have seen in anime thanks to how charming and unique they are.\\n\r\nThe actual animation for Eureka Seven is wonderful and very well animated.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Eureka Seven are amazing.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nMasterpiece is honestly the best way to describe the music in Eureka Seven. There was an amazing blend of tense, upbeat, emotional and sad tracks that fits well the setting and mood of each respective scenes and conflict.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the opening themes in Eureka Seven are great in their own ways but if I had to pick which one is my favourite it would be opening 4 Sakura which is by far one of the best openings to ever exist in an anime. Not only that the opening was beautiful to listen from start to finish but the way it perfectly captures the tone and events of the final quarter of the series.\\n\r\nThe ending themes are pretty good overall but they are sadly not as memorable as the opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good overall for what it is but the dub is actually way better. Sure Johnny Yong Bosh as Renton can be a bit rough in the in the earlier episodes but once you get to the second quarter and beyond he improves a lot to a point where Johnny Yong Bosh nailed his performance as Renton. The main why I recommended the dub over the sub is because of the other voice actors in the show minus the kids nailed the performance from the respective characters. My favourite performance in the dub includes\u00a0Kari Wahlgren as Anemone, Johnny Yong Bosh as Renton, Kate Higgins as Tahio, and Patrick Seitz as Charles.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nEureka Seven is a great anime that I loved with a passion. Even if the show had some shortcoming I still hold Eureka Seven in very high value. The story for the most was masterfully well executed, the characters minus the 3 kids and the main villain are amazing and well written, the visuals are fantastic and the soundtrack was brilliant. If you\u2019re looking a great coming of age story that has great chararters, fantastic mecha action, and well-done story elements then I recommend Eureka Seven\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime that I will love as long as I live.\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10\\n\\n",

I've never been a big fan of mecha, but this one wasn't just mecha, Eureka Seven had something for everyone. At first I thought Eureka was a little strange, a robot maybe, and Renton's whining got on my nerves, but I was really drawn in, because every episode made me wonder more and more what Eureka was, and what the Gekkostate's goal was. I had originally watched the first five or so episodes in Japanese, but I could actually handle the dub, which Ifound surprising, normally I am totally turned off by the dub. \\n\\n\r\nThe mecha part was very interesting. Eureka's ability to speak with the Nirvash intrigued me, and I liked how the Nirvash developed just as much as Renton or Eureka as the story progressed, as if it was growing and maturing along with them. \\n\\n\r\nOnce Anemone and Dominic joined the story, I was beyond interested. I found the parts with the military very interesting. All of the characters were interesting and had very different personalities. The character development was amazing, you can actually notice Renton becoming more mature (somewhat) and Eureka slowly becoming more confident, and gaining feelings for Renton. The best part about their relationship was that Renton confessed his love, and Eureka didn't really understand or return it at first. It wasn't love she showed him, it was curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story, though it was a little hard to grasp and follow, what with having one plot-filled episode one day and then filler the next. \\n\r\nBut then again, that kept it interesting.",

If not, consider skipping it.\r\nThis anime has a couple of interesting ideas and moments, and it has some battle animations and a good soundtrack.

For thefirst 10 episodes, after introducing the rebel force, Gekkostate, their ship and Renton, the kid who joins them, it goes about aimlessly, showing everyday situations of life aboard the ship. I suppose the point was to introduce the crew and establish character but the fact is that by the end of this part we still don't even know the names of most of them. Actually, the same could be said upon finishing episode 50; that's how fleshed out crew members other than Renton, Eureka, Holland and Talho are. Furthermore, the episodes from this arc definitely fail to realise what the first two promise. The introduction of the series presents us with LFOs, giant humanoid robots that both the rebels and the army use to fight and surf the sky (ok, technically the military use KLFs instead of LFOs), and Eureka, the strange girl piloting a rebel LFO, who doesn't seem very aware of social norms but somehow establishes a connection with Renton. Well, for the following 10 episodes all of that is thrown out of the window: battles are scarce and dull, and Eureka barely interacts with Renton (or shows up at all). During the middle chunk of the series stuff starts to happen but the presentation of things is mostly regarding inner conflicts and personal growth and the sorts, without an actual overarching plot gluing things together. Lastly, around the final 15 episodes, Eureka Seven does get a plot but, honestly, who still cares by then?\\n\\n\r\nBut the length isn't the beginning and the end of Eureka's problems; many are there to be found. Like many mecha series, Eureka Seven draws a lot from Evangelion, and pretty much fails at it. This is not to say EVA is perfect or should be the benchmark for mecha series, but the fact is that Eureka Seven invites the comparison rather clearly. So, we have kids (but not only) driving some huge robots that are used for battle. Like in EVA these robots are not really man made: here they produced by the land and found in caves, almost like diamonds in mines. Interesting as this idea may be, it is never really explored much, which makes it little more than one of the weirdest super technology sources I've seen in science fiction. Some of these robots, the ones that are legendary and all that, seem to have some degree of sentience. That is, sometimes they go into a berserk mode of sorts and act on their own to protect the drivers. Unfortunately this is never really explained or explored; you're just left to accept that these machines move without input when they feel like it and no one worries about it. If this seems terribly similar to EVAs, that's because it is. But, if that's the source of the idea, I get the impression that the author didn't really realise what was happening in Evangelion. Furthermore, the LFOs need to have a thing called the Compac drive plugged in to work, but the berserk mode can stand on its own. Once again an EVA parallel, but the problem with this one comes from Eureka Seven doing too much rather than too little. At the beginning we're given the impression that Compac drives are very important objects, possibly even containing the key to the mysteries that the characters are later to face. Well, not really; they are just tools for the rest of the series. As for LFOs going berserk without the Compac drive, there's an egregious example when it happens as a result of the drive actually being pulled out from the Nirvash, Renton and Eureka's LFO. Basically, as the power source is cut the robot decides to get a mind of his own and walk away, and no one ever cares about why that happened or gives it five minutes of thought. As a last parallel, the Seventh Swell power that the Nirvash holds is deeply reminiscing of the Second Impact from EVA. At the beginning it is supposed to be a very big deal but after that, as usual, it is left on a shelf gathering dust.\\n\\n\r\nThe previous exposition might give the impression of some underlying inconsistencies but, to tell the truth, they are much more widespread, and they show up almost as soon as the show begins. On the first episode Renton is told to deliver the Amita drive, which is a sort of expansion pack for the Compac drive, to Eureka because the Nirvash is not performing properly without it. This Amita drive was a one off thing made by Renton's father specifically for the Nirvash and seems to hold some deep significance. In this first instance it unlocks Nirvash's hidden powers and lets Eureka win the battle; after that it's all but forgotten and it's meaning and purpose never explain (at least they don't forget to draw it). Speaking of Renton's father, Adroc, he is another source of trouble. According to what we're told, he is some sort of hero that saved the world. Now, obviously, governments always make use of such martyrs for their own purposes and so they \"adapted\" his story to fit they view they wanted to convene. Problem: we're never told what was that the government made up about it. We do see, however, that Dewey, the generic big bad guy, uses this to great effect in controlling the masses and overthrowing the ruling Council of Sages. In fact the whole relationship between Dewey and the sages is odd at best. He is a former military leader that had been imprisoned for reasons never quite explained. The sages feared what he might do if he was free but decide to reinstate him in a top position of the army. From this point on, even if he was supposed to confront Gekkostate, all we see him doing basically amounts to plotting to overthrow the sages. This culminates with him giving a public speech that can be more or less summarised as: \"People of the world, you don't know but we are being attacked by these things called coralians! But fear not, I, Dewey, will protect you. And for that I will overthrow the sages, who have been lying to us.\" And that's it, coup d'\u00e9tat done. Two sages die, one accepts Dewey as a leader. Obviously this one is quickly dusted under the carpet and forgotten. He also takes the chance during the speech to let people know on which planet they are living. Apparently the whole of humanity had relocated planets more than once in the last ten thousand years but forgot about it in the meantime. Dewey is as unconvincing a speaker as you get one, but then again the facts on which he is reporting aren't that convincing either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, if inconsistencies plague the bad guys, they're also on the Gekkostate's main menu. Firstly, for a one ship rebel force they sure are eager to seek pointless battles. This just isn't a problem because they are the good guys and so they obviously always win. They win battles where they are ridiculously outnumbered and even if their LFOs are destroyed they are lucky and don't really die, and happen to have a spare, older robot for replacement. Sure, sometimes they suffer some damage, but when a single ship can blast through the imperial capital's defences, holding it's own against everyone and everything, to \"buy time\" for some crew members to go on a rescue mission that lasts from noon to dusk you know something is wrong. Given the sheer insanity of such mission it would appear that its necessity was beyond the obvious. Well, the rescued character, Norb, a high priest of the conveniently oppressed Vodarac religion, did become a major plot driver from that point on, but until then he had never even been mentioned and the reason given for the need of the rescue was something akin to \"we must do it\".\\n\\n\r\nFrom the rescue onwards the series does seem to get a plot, but it is as inconsistent as everything else. Discussions with Norb lead to the conclusion that the world is about to self-destruct because the number of sentient beings living on it has passed a certain limit. Why this limit exists is, naturally, never given much thought. However, it is explained that to avoid this Renton and Eureka will have to cross the Great Wall and enter the Zone and that to, in order to do this, they will have to meet Sakuya-sama. Lots of names, little explanations: the purpose of all of this is never given and everything is done in a \"you must do it\" basis. Though, to be fair to Norb, the rest of the cast was already aware of the importance of the Zone. They had seen an opening to it when they first contacted with a coralian and it was revealed that their grudge with the authorities had to do with the coralians. And revealed really is the right word, as most of the crew had no idea of what a coralian even was. As for the significance of the Zone, just because it was described as important it doesn't mean it was properly explained. The same goes for the dream sequence the coralian encounter triggered and that seemed to hint that Renton and Eureka's minds were somehow connected but that was, to retain the pattern, merrily ignored. Lastly, as the plot is finally about to take off after 40 episodes Norb insists that they take a day off to play football, in which is probably one of the lamest fillers ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Eureka Seven's world is not very well designed and the plot doesn't add up. Is there any remission by looking at it as a character driven story? Not really, as most characters are both not very likeable and not very good characters anyway, of which Renton is a prime example. The whole series revolved around his development and learning and growth, a coming of age story. The issue is that he never really gets anywhere: he starts as an idiotic kid who acts without thinking, goes through many internal conflict and character development stages, where his supposed improvement is stressed by the storytelling, and after each of them manages to go back to square one and make an ill-considered move that hurts someone else. I don't know, but I believe that shouting \"Any normal human would know that!\" to a character that is not quite normal is not an episode 40 mark of a grown and mature character. Nor is hurting yourself in order to be \"closer\" to someone who is hurt. In this particular sequence his wounds got infected and he got seriously ill, almost dying; I just found myself hoping that he did (even if knowing he wouldn't). As for the rest of the cast, they are not much better. Eureka starts girl who is a little off but a distinguished fighter. After that her character development basically consists in making her a meek girl who is there almost solely to support Renton. It's true that her back story drives part of the events but she herself has little to offer. Even in fights, despite the fact that the Nirvash is supposedly a dual pilot unit (the workings are never explained), we never really see much of a team action. She simply gradually cedes her place as driver to Renton and starts supporting him the way he supported her before. Concerning other less prominent character development aspects, she also falls for the old clich\u00e9 of trying to put on make-up to look prettier for Renton and ending horrible. That episode has such a predictable and beaten structure that it just triggers feelings of \"Can we please skip this?\". From the remaining characters, Talho seems to be the only half reasonable and likeable one. Holland behaves like a spoiled brat most of the time and is a major source of conflict, often taking out his frustrations on Renton, (though that's just a facade because he is oh so troubled deep inside) and the others are just stock characters with just one or two defining traits, or none at all. The only exception worthy of mention, but not for the best reasons, are the little kids to whom Eureka acts as guardian. They are probably one of the most annoying trios to ever have gone on screen, and putting up with them for 50 episodes is a real challenge. Straight of the bat they take a disliking of Renton and decided they are going to make his life hell. Kids as they are, they are very good at this, bullying him to no end. I guess the idea was to allow for them to grow fond of him during the course of the series but, even if they do so in words, their actions remain consistently annoying and dislikeable until the end, not to say actually dangerous to them and others. They also prompt what is probably the best example of Renton's inability to grow: in one of the first episodes he flies with them on Nirvash during a risky mission and gets a serious reprimand for endangering them; come the end of the series and he goes full circle, taking them with him and Eureka on an even more dangerous flight. It would be laughable if it weren't so pitiful.\\n\\n\r\nAdding it all up, Eureka Seven is a series with a few good ideas and lots of promise but that ultimately fails to live up to the expectations and instead just becomes painful to watch as it drags on and on. After all this only one question remains to ask: seven? Why seven? The series is called Eureka Seven but the number seven doesn't play a special role anywhere on the story. Was it introduced in the title without thought because it sounded cool? Quite likely it was, as that seems to have been the pattern for most of the elements anyway.",

            "content": "I would like to start off by saying Eureka Seven is hands down my all time favorite anime series. From beginning to end it managed to keep me glued to the computer screen without so much as a blink of the eye. Sure, I lost my eyesight after watching the series from beginning to end due to the lack of blinking, but all I can say is; worth it, totally worth it! This anime has everything you would want, and then some! Ranging from humor, to a love story, to action/adventure, and one of my favorite's; things that deepen the plot, leaving you with somany thoughts and opinions after the series ends. With it's oh so lovable characters, awesome storyline, action, adventure, and love/feelings between the main characters and more, it is hard not to get emotionally attached.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most notable things about this series, in my opinion at least, is the music. I have never seen an anime series use a more amazing selection of music for the openers, endings, and throughout the series in general. They truly put it together in an indescribable fashion. The music in this series really sets the mood for each scene, whether it be emotional, or action based. They have a selection for EVERYTHING, and none of them disappoint!\\n\\n\\n\r\nI often wonder how the series has affected others, as it has had a great impact on myself. I for one had to re-watch the series at least two more times after my first taste, and was still left unsatisfied. Not due to the series itself lacking anything, but the sole attachment that was created between myself and the characters of the series. Each one of them leaves you wanting more, and the emotions felt during the series (laughter, sadness, happiness, etc) do not fade after the series concludes. For this reason, it has become the most memorable and cherished anime of mine. No other anime has affected me so deeply, emotions wise, and for that, I am grateful. It sorta gives a new outlook on life, just watching Eureka and Renton, go through the good times, and the bad. This series also gave birth to one of my favorite sayings, that I like to look to in all aspects of life. &quot;Don't beg for things, do it yourself, or else you won't get anything&quot;. There is a lot of truth to the statement, and plays a big role in the series itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those who haven't seen the series, I highly recommend you take the time to watch it, it will not disappoint. When I first finished the series back in 2007, it left me with an odd void in my life, like I was missing something. That something turned out to be more Eureka Seven. I scoured the net, dying to find out whether or not they were in production for a new series, a movie, anything, and only found dead ends and rumors. Then, in April, the movie was announced, and that void I felt for so long was finally put to rest. Just knowing something more is around the corner keeps the desire to re-watch the series again and again at bay (tho I have seen it more times then I dare admit). So in the end, I wonder, how will Eureka Seven affect you? Don't pass this series up, you will regret it! I'd recommend the English version personally, as I feel the voice actors really nailed it, but the Japanese version does shed light on a few things you might not have understood in the English. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Besides poking fun at Christianity, one genre that seems to be a writing gold mine for anime is the coming-of-age tale. Taking a character who is in their teens, a period where they start to shape themselves to soon ingress into adulthood, and make them face reality in its different shades up until they become completely rounded figures is a setup that offers a vast range of opportunities for writers. The deal is that, the main character being a kid or a pre-teen, you can make them as immature as you can get away without making the audience hate the little twerp and slowly improvethem into a better person. Also, being animation such a versatile media, you can deliver as much of that development in one full season without having to deal with the difficulties of live-action.\\n\\n\r\nSo, which one is the best coming-of-age story in anime? Of course, that is not a question with definitive answer, if any question in regards to art is, but I\u2019d like to offer my pick for the best one I watched so far: Eureka Seven.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven (E7 for short) caps at 50 episodes, which is by no means a shy length for any series. Any anime packing that number of episodes can be an absolute chore to sit through if it doesn\u2019t offer the content to hold the viewer and enough quality-development to justify its size. Luckily there\u2019s no shortage of either for this series. During its running time, E7 builds its fantastic world and addresses multiple character arcs and themes, from religious conflict to environmentalism, leaving very little to be fully explained, and even in these cases it\u2019s not anything that represents a driving force of the plot. Before we talk about that, though, let\u2019s discuss the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRenton, the main protagonist, is unusually relatable for a character of this kind of story. He is immature, sure, but also displays grounded morals and is, at least initially, driven by an adventurous spirit. Being the son of the late hero responsible for saving the world, Adroc Thuerston, he would have some pretty big shoes to fill, however, Renton doesn\u2019t really want to deal with that kind of responsibility. Like many other teenagers, he wants simply to enjoy his younger years dedicating himself to his hobby and expanding his horizons, which primarily motivates him to join Gekkostate. That would lead him to face a reality much harsher than what he was originally prepared for and forces him to strengthen his ideals in order to push himself through the struggles he faces. So, yeah, Renton is amazing, quote me on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe titular Eureka is Renton\u2019s love interest for the story and the center of many conflicts both in the overall plot, as well as the tension between Renton and Holland. While not exactly emotionless, she has difficulty properly dealing with the emotions she slowly develops, and Renton plays a big role in leading her to understand how to better interact with others. She is naturally kind-mannered and loyal, but when it comes to dealing with failure or regret, more complex feelings ion general, she has significantly harder time processing those emotions.\\n\\n\r\nHolland is the leader of Gekkostate, a cool figure outside, but a very contrasting person for those who get to know him closely. Jealous, easily angered, unusually immature and quick to lash out against weaker characters who dare to upset him, most of the time Renton and frequently with violence, he is possibly the one that goes through the most sizeable development in the series, and a very positive one. That development though, takes some time to manifest, so while he acts like an absolute asshole, don\u2019t be surprised if you find yourself enjoying his suffering. I sure did.\\n\\n\r\nTalho is the main pilot of Gekkostate and Holland\u2019s lover. Being the only person who Holland accepts to have challenging him, she is the main agent to his development, but before that happens she is also forced to grow and properly understand her role in the group.\\n\\n\r\nCharles Beams, along with his wife, Ray, is one of the antagonists, appearing mid-run in the anime. Even though he is technically placed on the \u201cbad guys\u201d side, he is still a very honored, responsible and loyal figure, which is why he plays a big role in Renton\u2019s development. He is also Eureka Seven\u2019s embodiment of MANLINESS. Seriously, I bet the guy had chest hair when he was 8.\\n\\n\r\nDewey is Holland\u2019s older brother and the main antagonist for the series. Initially very mysterious, his motivations seem to fluctuate as the anime goes on, up until they are properly revealed and sadly place him among the \u201cDestroy the World\u201d kind of villain, the least compelling kind. That was the only meaningful issue I was able to find in the series: villains of this category hardly ever work, and in cases they do work they often go for the type that is so crazy it doesn\u2019t matter or so powerful that destroying the world isn\u2019t a big deal for them. Dewey is mostly portrayed as a collected and calculating individual, so this motivation is all the more out-of-place. Lastly, there are Dominic and Anemone. Their role in the story is to serve as a parallel to Renton and Eureka\u2019s relationship, but at the side of the antagonists, for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nOk, tackling the coming-of-age aspect first, Renton\u2019s development is triggered mostly by the use of an interesting contrast: without giving too much away, halfway through the series he gets separated from the Gekkostate, who at this point were not the most responsible folks to serve as an example. While in their company, it was difficult to side against him, as there was a clear lack of proper orientation from the crew. The point where they get separated is the moment his character-arc truly starts to shine, it\u2019s the moment when he\u2019s able to do his biggest mistakes and witness the impact they have. As an effect of that, Renton begins to develop higher respect for other\u2019s resolve, as well as the importance of keeping himself loyal to the responsibilities he takes. When he finally reunites with the Gekkostate, he is better prepared to face the challenges they would find up ahead. His development doesn\u2019t stop there, however, as there\u2019s much work to be done in his relationship with Eureka and the strengthening of his values, but that is something you should witness on your own.\\n\\n\r\nIn Eureka\u2019s case, the development kicks in early on, since it\u2019s not so much focused on maturing but in learning to deal with issues she was never forced to deal with in her blank-slate condition. Due to Renton\u2019s influence, not only over her but also the Nirvash, she begins to be exposed to feelings she was not used to, not all of them positive. During the boy\u2019s absence, she starts to understand that the reason why she misses him might be romantic feelings and the sudden need for his companionship also plays a huge part on forcing Holland to mature himself. All of this makes for deeply dynamic characterization, as in Eureka Seven characters don\u2019t simply decide to change or shift on a whim depending on plot convenience (No, I\u2019ll not make a \u201ccough, cough\u201d joke!), they influence each other, stumble, hurt themselves and make amendments, the way well-written interaction is supposed to do. The side-characters in the other hand have fairly straight personalities and stay pretty much the same along the series. Is that a problem? No. Keep that in mind, folks: a large cast doesn\u2019t mean everyone should receive in-depth development, some characters are nice the way they are, just adding some flavor to the series\\n\\n\r\nNow, when learning that a series tackles subjects like religious conflict or environmentalism, many people would be immediately put off, in fear that it might end up featuring very preachy writing. Eureka Seven, however, gracefully avoids this trap. The subjects in question are all swiftly introduced as the plot progresses, and now and then play their role in the story by being naturally integrated in the arc, without any moralism being spelled out by anyone in ham-fisted manner. The environmental aspect, for once, is not directly brought up, but subtly conveyed throughout the series, as it\u2019s an integral part of the overarching plot, and the series manages to do such a thing even as these themes become ever more present in the story. By the end, it\u2019s not hard to grasp how such elements are a natural component of the world presented in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nBy the Gods, that looks beautiful!\\n\\n\r\nOk, professionalism dictates I have to be more specific. Made in 2005 by Studio Bones, Eureka Seven is, to this day, one of the best looking anime ever made. Bones is a studio used to make anime where characters are realistically proportioned, but still retain anime-like features and that allows them to have distinct expressions. You will hardly find a relevant character that expresses in the same manner as the others, tying perfectly with their personalities and demeanors. With the exception of some episodes of minor importance, like the soccer episode, the figures show steady consistency in their character models, retaining natural proportion even when seen from a distance. This is often the animation issue that is most noticeable in other works, but E7 manages to avoid it and deliver stellar animation with beautifully fluid movement without losing its consistency and detail. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are striking and memorable. They follow the seinen logic of packing details that by themselves are nothing special, but when placed together form a design that is at the same time harmonic and distinct. Now, all of that aside, the real kicker that makes the series such a visual marvel is its use of colors. From the character designs, both human and mechs, to the machinery, the effects and explosions, E7 always brings the most vibrant and impactful colors. The shining green of the trapar waves, the perfectly toned shades of orange used for the sunset, the lightly flavored natural environments and even pink-colored explosions, everything immediately pops out on the screen, and coupled with the sharp use of lighting, it drives perfectly the mood of the scene, be it action or just moments of important dialogue. When you consider that alongside the number of episodes and characters, it only makes the work Bones displayed all the more impressive. There is nothing I can complain in regards to the visuals that doesn\u2019t boil down to nitpick, as the overall package is consistently pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven\u2019s soundtrack has its fair share of exciting, blood-pumping tracks to help make the action all the more energetic and even some to evoke a grandiose feeling, but what stands out the most are its emotional pieces. They come in at the exact moment to make you know that you\u2019re about to watch a meaningful moment of character interaction or to highlight development that is about to happen. If you don\u2019t find these tracks memorable, better look for a medic, you might have faulty memory or be lacking a heart. On the voice acting department (Japanese, off course), the most notable detail is Renton\u2019s seyiuu, Sanpei Yuuko. Renton is another teenage-boy played by a female. Let that information sink in for a minute: does the acting, at any moment, denounce that the character is not played by a man? This is without a doubt the most convincing case of a female seyiuu playing a male role I\u2019ve ever seen and can easily dethrone Paku Romi or Takeuchi Junko in this category. Not to say that the rest of the cast doesn\u2019t range from solid to excellent. Fujiwara Keiji plays Holland, so if you are familiar with his work you know there\u2019s no worry and Nazuka Kaori\u2019s portrayal of Eureka reflects with no problem the image of a girl learning to process newly-found emotions, while maintaining a sweet vibe to her acting.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nNow, there\u2019s an aspect I\u2019d like to comment on this section specifically. Eureka Seven has some of those moments you could call \u201cshounen moments\u201d, where the logic is made to obey more the emotions the characters are facing at the time and the ones the anime wants to pull out of the viewer, then the internal rules established in the story. This might be just my bias speaking, as I have a soft spot for the shounen genre myself, but I believe these instances enhance the series instead of detracting from it. Sure, they may seem corny to some, but not just of logic you build a cathartic and fulfilling story, emotion is also important and as long as it doesn\u2019t stretch believability beyond what the audience was accustomed to give, or contradicts other rules of the setting, I say \u201cgo for it\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIf WattheWut doesn\u2019t mind me borrowing his rating system for a while, Eureka Seven is a Must Watch. Sure, this review might not have convinced you, as I spent little time dissecting how the story unfolds, but trust me, it\u2019s better that you experience that for yourself. Safe to say, I believe this series uses with effect its runtime, as there was a lot to be handled and the manner in which it did was very solid, paced out with no issue. You can call Eureka Seven a perfectly rounded series: it has a tightly fleshed out world with a story that fully utilizes its setting and dynamic, likeable and developed characters, fitting without a problem the universe they live in.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m running out of things to say, so go watch the anime.\\n",

            "content": "This could possibly be one of the best written anime series of all time. Dai Sato is defently one of the best screenwriters in all of Japan. Tomoki Kyoda is also a very talented director. With those two and  people like Chiaki J. Konaka, and Sayo Yamamoto involved it's no wonder this anime is a success. \r\nI started watching this anime on Adult Swim, from the day it first aired. It took a few episodes before I was hooked, but once they grabbed me, they never let go. So please give this series a shot. After it aired on Adult Swim I started buyingall the DVD's. I missed a few episodes in the middle and the ending the first time it aired, but watched that, plus the rest of it on DVD. Although this is one of my favorite anime series of all time, I'll try very hard to be fair and  as un-biased as I can be\\n\\n\r\nIt clearly takes many things from Neon Genesis Evengelion,FLCL, Fullmetal Alchemist, Gundam, and RahXephon. And I noted it acually takes some things from Shadow Star Narutaru as well (like some of the darker aspects of the series, and the Coralians  and anti- Coralians are clearly inspired by the dragons [creatures] in Shadow Star Narutaru, not to mention some other smaller things as well). None of this is surprising as many of the people heavily involved in Eureka Seven where involved in these series as well.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story: \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go deep into the synopsis of the plot. I thought it was a very well written story, and the plot was just amazing. Lot's of mystery and drama!! It's very interesting to watch the military conflicts unfold. We watch what happens (and the changes to) the government that runs the planet, and how war effects everyone. The series is also very deep, dark, and can get physiological at times (not unlike Eva). It does have it's fun and silly moments, and even an episode or two devoted to humor and jokes. This is very well thoguth out, as the drama and &quot;darker&quot; parts are well balanced by this. Comedy is used at the right moments not to depress the veiwer to much. Plenty of action and interesting plot developments to make sure you are never bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is written very amazingly, and complex. It gets dark, but never too depressing. All of this is important because this is partly a plot driven anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters were very strong. While it's easy to see how Renton was inspired by Shinji (NGE) and Naota (FLCL) he is still very much his own character. Same gos for Eureka (who some say is inspired by Rei from NGE). Talho and Holland are completely original. Most of the characters are well likeable. I found the &quot;bad guys&quot; of course to be much more interesting, likeable, and just overall cool however.  The Sage Council (my picture) are an amazing trio who run the country!  Dominic Sorel is very cool, likeable, and interesting!! Colonel Dewey Novak is also a great character and develops a lot throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is interesting, and helps show the viewer a little bit of the world this takes place on. They all are good characters, which is important because this anime can be very character driven at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice. It gets it's job done, plus some! It really amazes you at some times, but being a 50 episode series it does change up a little over the time. No real problems with it, but not incredbly high quality animation or anything like that. The backgrounds are great looking, and the character and mecha designs are very cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic- \\n\r\nThe music was just amazing!! The best songs, from the best bands were chosen for this anime!! But not just great opening and closings either, the insert songs where very powerful! Esecially the insert song &quot;Storywriter&quot; by the band Supercar.\\n\\n\r\ndub-\\n\r\nI only watched the English dub, and I can defently say this is one of Bang Zoom! 's best dubs ever!! Sure Renton (Johnny Young Bosch) could be anoying to some people, but I think he sounded really good. I didn't even know that was him, he used such a high pitch voice. Crispin Freeman will forever be Holland for me, because his voice fit so perfectly!! Peter Doyle was also spot on with Dominic. In fact every single character seemed well cast. Of course Stephanie  Sheh gives the overall best performance as Eureka. She's just great at anything she does. Eureka is brought to life with her voice.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Vertic:\\n\\n\r\nA more plot driven/character driven mecha then most people are used to, but acually makes this anime more apealing. It works for people who don't necessarily like mecha anime too much. Therefore it's not mecha-driven, but they do serve a point, and there is some mystery to them. The characters are well likeable. The plot is very well thought out, and just amazing. It gets philosophical, physiological and deep at times, but plenty of action to keep you entertained. \\n\\n\r\nIt has a good story to tell, and proves once again Dai Sato is the man with the golden pen. When it comes to screenwriting, he always manages to outdo himself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nA common saying that people often hear is, \"All is fair in love and war.\" Interpreted literally, what this phrase says is that there are no rules when it comes to the battlefield. That people will do whatever it takes to win, to obtain the ultimate prize: victory. In both circumstances, it's something that is quite difficult to achieve, but when it is, it's one of the sweetest, most exhilarating feelings in the world. To an extent, the tale of Eureka Seven is the manifestation of such an idea.\r\nSTORY\r\nEureka Seven begins with Renton Thurston being visited by twopeople, Eureka and Holland. Along with the Nirvash, a mechanical unit piloted by Eureka, Renton joins Gekkostate, beginning an incredible journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to a series like this, it's interesting to see a show with so much dedication behind it. Resting at 50 episodes, it takes a considerable amount of time to get through, relative to most seasonal shows. The pacing isn't so much slow as it is awkward. It starts off rather quickly, slows down immensely, picks back up, slows down, then charges towards the end. Now, this isn't technically a negative; in fact, I found this pacing to help. By being more lethargic towards the beginning, it allowed for the demonstration, characterization, and augmentation of the crew. This applies not only for Renton and Eureka, but for the side characters as well. In this way, when the story does pick up for a time, it has to spend less on the characters in question and more so on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nGoing off this, the story-telling is done in a sneaky way. Most shows have you learn the world as the main character does. And this is true for Eureka Seven as well. But what separates this anime from many others is that the world and knowledge is already established. To put it as best as I can, it feels like you are learning the world not alongside Renton but as Renton. Like a kid figuring out \"wonders\" for the first time, the gradual way in which information is given and learned as the story progresses worked quite well. Areas are left shrouded in mystery, both in the sub-plot and the over-arcing one, allowing the audience to not only care about the characters in play but also the environment surrounding them.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven is an anime about \"the power of love!\" Love, and the need to protect those dear to you, enshrouds people with very strong emotions. And for the most part, these emotions are what drive the narrative. Between Renton and Eureka, and a few other key characters, its love that gets them through the day, love that allows them to do the impossible. But there is a bigger idea at play besides just \"love cures all.\" It's the acceptance and understanding of someone inherently different from you. Whether by race, culture, or ethnicity, learning to respect the ideals and values of someone completely different from yourself is not only mature, but the right thing to do. And Eureka Seven explores this idea beautifully, with a variety of different cases, both jubilant and tragic.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the praise I give the show, it does two things sadly wrong: the details for the plot and the ending. Starting with the former, the show's way of expressing its world was done nicely. However, as it goes on, many ideas and plot points are either left unexplained or explained terribly. As the story ramps up, so does the amount of information thrown the audience's way. This, in turn, gives it more opportunities to either do it wrong, try something new, or both. As it neared its conclusion, it was usually both.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending, it's bitter-sweet. The bitterness comes not from how it all went down, but rather for how it stayed up regardless. In other words, the show leaves itself surprisingly open-ended. Not tying up loose ends in a couple of important areas, it makes the conclusion itself feel rather underwhelming, despite the incredible ride the final ten episodes or so provided. It feels rushed and somewhat sloppy, as if the final episode feels out of place in comparison to what came before it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven feels like an homage to days gone by.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself feels mostly gray. Not only with the constant clouds and decor of the airship, but also in the atmosphere given off. The show does a nice job of making it feel as if the world itself has experienced some rather melancholy happenings. But it isn't afraid to bust out the colors, especially with Eureka, the rest of Gekkostate, and during the fights themselves. And of course, the \"Seven Swell Effect\" is always glorious to see.\\n\\n\r\nAt this time, it's important to give a big shout-out to Studio Bones for drawing the mechanical units in 2D. This may seem lame to say, but with studios opting to go with 3D because its either cheaper or easier, it was almost refreshing to see the robots flying around as paper and not as polygons.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation is usually pretty good. The show incorporates great facial detail and expressions when it wants to, alongside good character movements. The battles utilize both faraway shots of dodging and explosions, and closer, more detailed gun-firing, trapar-riding, and sword-wielding.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Eureka Seven is placed in a rather peculiar predicament. I'll focus on the big four: Renton, Eureka, Holland, and Talho.\\n\\n\r\nTalho is the lead pilot of the Gekko. Girlfriend of Holland, her commanding attitude and cold demeanor make her somewhat of a \"wild child.\" But deep down, she cares a lot for the crew she steers on a daily basis. And when it comes to Holland, his safety, both physically and mentally, comes first. She is also affected by jealousy of a past she wishes would be forgotten. For her, her greatest struggle is coping with her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nHolland is the leader of Gekkostate. Handsome and quick to anger, he believes in the friends he has come to make over the years. His intentions seem unclear, but his determination to accomplish his goals are anything but. For some reason, he has a deep-seeded hatred for Renton. His issue is not coping, but handling the emotions he has.\\n\\n\r\nAs a young boy, Renton dreamed of lifting with the cool members of Gekkostate. As the main character, Renton is kind, trustworthy, and wanting to do what's right. From the very beginning until the every end, he has one simple goal: protect Eureka. It seems lofty and perhaps even nonsensical, but his drive to protect the girl he loves brings him farther than he could have ever thought possible. Renton's issue was always understanding what feelings he currently had.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character from the show is Eureka. Mired in mystery from the get-go, the turquoise-haired, purple-eyed, quiet-speaking girl is definitely a little strange. Besides her outward appearance, she appears to be a normal teenager. But as her origins are explained and questions are answered, it becomes apparent that her inner-self is just as different as her outer-self. Emotionally, her biggest hurdle was simply learning about what she was feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCoping, handling, understanding, and learning; for these four characters, the way in which they handle their emotions is vastly different when compared to one another. And this is important, considering the main themes revolve around love. The first half of the show nicely explores Talho, Holland, Renton, and Eureka's journey towards dealing with each of their separate obstacles. Putting it another way, the first half is each of them growing up. Whether through a new perspective on life or a new outlook provided to them by a fellow crew member, the four of them experience significant change during the first leg of their adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that the second leg focuses entirely on the plot and ignores the characters. After they overcome their personal challenges, there is little to no development afterwards. It may be argued that the relationships between them are affected, which is certainly the case, but their individual selves are not. Coupled with the convoluted story-telling mentioned earlier, this causes the shift in focus to be more of a step down than a step up.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note is Dewey, the antagonist, and Anemone. Dewey is the villain, but not a conventional one. His tactics and ideas are political rather than confrontational, making him interesting to watch as he goes about his plans. Anemone is similarly interesting because she is the complete opposite to Eureka; she knows the feelings she has but refuses to acknowledge them. Both characters become supremely important in the second half of the show, but their inclusion within the show allows the audience to view the ideas at play from a different angle, providing us not only with more insight but also a new way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP takes a bit of getting used to. The drums and guitar provide a nice beat, and the vocalist in the second half comes through with good emotion. It sounds somewhat \"old school,\" which fits nicely with the old school feel of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is the best of the four. The trumpet, drums, vocalist, and lyrics work wonderfully. They mix together to provide an incredible beat that is easy and fun to follow. Plus, who doesn't love to sing along with \"Let it bloom!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe third OP comes in second, with its rough singing and nice tempo. The \"I wanna fly away!\" in conjunction with the visuals is actually pretty powerful the more it's viewed, given everything that goes on during this OP's arc. It's also quite nice to bob your head to.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth OP's best quality is easily the first ten seconds with \"Amazing Grace.\" At this point, the show is nearing its end, so emotions are high. Meaning, it works to ease us into the coming episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED, like the OP, takes a little bit of time to get used to. The singing sounds rather choppy, but it actually has a rather mellow feeling despite the range put into it. And the final violin arrangement is beautiful yet sad.\\n\\n\r\nED two sounds somewhat all over the place, unlike its OP counterpart. However, the \"Fly away!\" helps to bring it back into focus. The beat is slightly too quick and jumpy to follow easily, making it not too great to listen to on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe third ED is the best of the EDs, with its good tempo, nice vocalist, and lyrics. The visuals are also quite interesting in what they portray. And the \"tip taps\" is fun to sing along with.\\n\\n\r\nThe final ED isn't so much a song as it is a story itself. It's more important to read the lyrics for this one as opposed to listening to it, but the many people singing it together makes it feel that much more alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is actually very good. The piano pieces, the heart-pounding frantic-ness between Nirvash and The End, and the grand orchestral music make it a feast for the ears time and again.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, I found Yuuko Sanpei as Renton and Keiji Fujiwara as Holland to give above average performances as their respective characters. At times, you could really hear the emotions they were attempting to portray.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to anime, romance is something I place higher than anything else. So, seeing it not only as prevalent within the show but being used as a literal plot device made me exceptionally happy. All of the blushing, the smiling, the name-calling; it had it all and I would have loved to have seen even more of it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are humorous moments during the show, but they are mostly around during the first quarter or so. Afterwards, it sticks mainly to dramatic elements. They never feel forced, just sometimes questionable because we never really have all the answers. The show, however, almost got to me a select few times in the crying department. Not all the way, but it was getting there. So much was riding on their actions, and the feelings they had for one another at certain points bubbled over, and I almost cried alongside Eureka.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the best moments come from the Nirvash kicking some KLF butt. Watching the two of them, Renton and Eureka, work in harmony to take out the bad guys time and again never got old. If anything, I wanted to see just how far their love was going to take them.\\n\\n\r\nI never fully got invested, however, into the show or the characters until the final stretch. At that point, I really had to know what was coming next. Sadly, the ending just didn't cut it for me after promising so much yet providing so little.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I think Eureka Seven had the potential to become a masterpiece. All of the elements were there, but the mistakes kept piling up the further it went along. Despite these missteps, I still had a wonderful time. And even after getting through it all, \"All is fair in love and war\" still stands truer than ever.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, strong first half becomes convoluted the further it goes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, 2D, fluid, and pretty when it needs to be\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, nice mains and supports that could have been great\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OPs, EDs, amazing soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, romance, baby!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "This anime, is beautiful. Not just in animation or sound, but also in how the story and characters are laid out. However, each gem comes with it's own dents and scratches, and this is no different. Just a heads up that although I easily would give this anime a ten because of how amazing it made me feel at the end, I'm going to try my hardest to not be incredibly biased and point out flaws just like any other review. \r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory:\r\nFirst, lets start off with both a positive and a negative point. I found that for a lot of the time, many, many thingswere left unexplained, even though they were referenced fairly often, especially in the earlier episodes. Now, I realize that this was to emphasize how little our protagonist, Renton Thurston, knew about the world, but it still left gaping plot holes by the end of the series. Still, it isn't really something I can completely fault the show for, because by leaving many things unexplained, it showcases how naive and clueless Renton is at the start. Still, it felt like driving through a thick cloud of fog. We weren't given any sort of main goal to reach, so we were subject to following the Gekko State meander about doing something to provide for a greater cause. This more or less doesn't matter, however, because we really aren't supposed to focus at all on the story for the first half, as the characters were the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story does pick up when nearing the midway point, and it sure does pick up. We finally realize why Gekko State are rebelling against the military, and the themes that start to arise are spectacular. We see that it is easier to conquer obstacles with the help of a trusted partner rather than being a lone wolf (screw you Kirito) and the power that comes with wanted to protect and be with the one you love. There is also some fairly obvious religious symbolism, and in this regard, it is fairly easy to draw parallels with Neon Genesis Evangelion. Still, it was handled rather well. I do feel as though the story was more or less a vessel to carry the amazing characters contained in it, but as a stand alone story, it's simplicity holds up nicely.\\n\\n\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the animation, other than it's Bones at it's finest. The art is stylistic, fluid, and fits the overall feel of the show perfectly. The animation was also just as fluid, especially when dealing with the epic LFO fight scenes. The bright colours really fit the tone of the show: very uplifting and passionate. Lastly, the character designs. A while back, I watched another great show called Planetes. I was pleased to see the person doing the character designs for that particular show doing the character designs for Eureka Seven. All of them were completely original, and fit their roles in the show perfectly. Holland and Talho had very surfer-like attire to go with their rebelling against the State, Eureka's entrancing purple eyes embrace her mysterious yet beautiful side, and even the military uniforms were stylish. For a show made in 2005, it's animation still managed to keep me glued to the screen even at this day and age.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nOnce again, very high production going into this soundtrack. When the show needed to be serious, the music helped to produce suspense and tension. When there was some kind of powerful as all hell romance scene, the music was the driving force to give you butterflies in your stomach and feel like everything is perfect and beautiful. Also the openings were not just pleasing to the ears and eyes, but they actually replicated the stages of Renton's emotions at the time. In the first opening, the music and animation is very cheery, which is implies of Renton's laidback, carefree attitude at the time. Later on during the 3rd opening, he is shown falling through the sky, going to catch Eureka. This shows his boundless love for Eureka, and how he has grown and matured because of that love. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the dub was solid, with breathtaking performances by Johnny Yong Bosch and Stephanie Sheh as Renton and Eureka respectively. However, you can't just say it's a coincidence when you see Ichigo Kurosaki and Orihime Inoue in the lead roles of a budding romance. I won't spend time talking about the other cast, as they are just as good. I did have a bit of a problem with the script at times, however. Sometimes the dialogue seemed a little bland between Renton and Eureka. It just doesn't seem to fit with the actions that are taking place at any given time. Fortunately, these moments are few and far between.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAnd of course, I have saved the best to last. The characters are what make Eureka Seven one of my favourite anime of all time, and I'm sure many people agree with me there. Let's start off with Renton Thurston. Honestly, he isn't the most original person in the bunch. He is a whiny, annoying protagonist forced to fight in a mech because why the heck not. However, it's the journey he goes through and the development he gets that makes him such a phenomenal character. By the end, he becomes someone people can actually depend on to make the right choices, and cares more about the people he loves rather than himself. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Eureka. I hate to keep making Evangelion References, but I will. At first, Eureka seems to be the Rei  Ayanami clone: very quiet, keeps to herself, you know the drill. But once again, its the journey she goes through that turns her into someone with actual emotions. She begins to feel the strength of love and the weight of guilt, which turns her into a very \"human\" character by the end (which is funny for obvious reasons).\\n\\n\r\nIts weird for me to say this, but I don't think there is one character I really disliked all that much. All the side characters in Gekko State had enough development and personality to make an extremely well rounded cast. Like seriously, every single character on the Gekko got at least a little bit of development by the end. However, I didn't really like how one particular old man was fleshed out at the last episode of the entire series. It was just a completely unnecessary plot twist that did nothing significant in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the characters in the military were also just as strong. It made me pleased to see that Dominic and Jurgens were more than just military dogs, and turned out to have a mind of their own. For a while, I thought Anemone was an annoying little brat who treated Dominic, the one who loved her and actually treated her with respect, like complete shit. However, after learning of her past, her motivations, and how she changed thanks to Dominic, she came to, like Eureka, be a very human character. Speaking of Dominic and Anemone, even though their relationship was just a side plot, it even held a candle to Renton's and Eureka's. It went from rock bottom to soaring heavens, and it was a delight to see the end result.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the best part. Renton and Eureka, as a couple. I couldn't help having a wide grin on my face whenever those two were on the screen. The dedication and passion the two have for each other is astonishing. It really makes me long to have that relationship with someone someday. There are so many roadbumps along the way, but it doesn't matter to them. They can do whatever the hell they want because of their trust and unrequited love for each other. They are what make this anime so spectacular, and so groundbreaking.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThis anime was a complete rollercoaster. The start was a slow, gradual, and for the most part, boring. one. However, the payoff was more than I could ever want. Even though the show was slow to start, they did it for a reason. Even the flaws I point out in this show are done to emphasize some kind of key theme or symbol. It just made you feel immersed into the whole setting, like you were actually there, watching the whole thing unfold through Renton's eyes. The production quality was borderline perfection, and I just hope that I can find someone with whom I can share the same love that Renton and Eureka did. However, even though in my heart I want to give this show a perfect rating, I can't. This is a review, and my opinion shouldn't be biased to completely overlook the flaws this show had.\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I've been looking forward to typing up this review ever since around the 25th episode. For me, Eureka Seven has been bouncing between, and around an 8-9 for the rating. But it really didn't take long AT ALL to make me change that score. It was in my \"Plan to Watch\" list for far too long as well. And deserved to be looked into a lot sooner. So, first, what I mean by this is, if you haven't seen Eureka Seven yet, DO NOT WAIT ANY LONGER. Especially if you absolutely love incredible love stories. \r\nI'll start with story, I gave it a 10because:\\n\r\nWell, it's kind of hard to tell you why I gave it a 10 without spoiling the story, but I'll try it out. During the entirety of Eureka Seven, the story is a HUGE emotional-roller coaster; one that I didn't want to end. They really give life to every character that is on screen often, give you the needed background information to make them feel real. I got connected to these characters and what they were fighting for. Making me sad every time I finished an episode, knowing its one episode closer to the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere are ups and downs, people learning what they're doing wrong, everyone working together to overcome such amazing obstacles. Truly one epic tale, that makes you envious that you can't do what they do. But sometimes are glad you don't need to go through such heart-wrenching moments in life. Eureka Seven actually left me teary-eyed at some points, especially at the end of an intense episode, Eureka and Renten say \"To be continued\" together, but sound incredibly sad after something bad that happened. It's like getting dumped, then having everyone laugh at you. It feels terrible. But it's good because they actually make you feel for the story, and what the characters are going through. I'd give it a 100/10 if I could, but that isn't possible. \\n\\n\r\nNow for Art, I gave it a 9 because:\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here, most Anime that Bones works on (that I've seen) looks amazing, but there were very small parts that I don't think were up to par, but it might have been because I was watching DVD quality on a 40\" HDTV without being upscaled to fake-HD. But no complaints, a well deserved 9.\\n\\n\r\nFor Sound, I gave it a 10 because:\\n\r\nNot much to say here either, they nailed all the effects, all the voices (I watched it dubbed) were perfect on all the characters. They all seem to fit so perfectly. Kari Wahlgren played Anemone, and she is one of my favorite voice actors, so I was happy to hear her in this doing another amazing job. So no complaints here, top notch sound for a top notch Anime, i'd say. \\n\\n\r\nI gave Character a 10 because:\\n\r\nWell, I kind of explained why in my reasons on Story, and sort of, in sound.\\n\r\nThe characters are well thought out and expressed. Leaving no holes to make them feel fake, or robotic. Emotions are no where near lacking, character style is unique enough and how they all are made to interact just surpasses incredible. Basically, if you made a blind person \"listen\" to Eureka Seven, he/she would think it was something real happening around them, and that these people really exist. Hard to be done, but Eureka Seven excels here. \\n\r\nAnd also to mention, I'm glad to finally see a 10/10 worthy Anime that doesn't include overly-big sized chests and girls that are too spunky for life as the main character.\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I've said why I gave it a 10 for Enjoyment, but I'll do a quick recap:\\n\r\nAmazing characters, heart-wrenching story that pulls you in and DOESN'T let you go, top notch action scenes, and incredible plot that didn't confuse me and was easily understandable but deep enough to keep you hooked and it feeling fresh. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though I gave Art a 9, that IN NO WAY brings down the overall score. Since the story was so amazing, with the support of an amazing character cast and amazing Voice Actors; all this amazing could only add up to an outstanding Anime. So if you haven't seen it yet, I'd suggest you watch it as soon as possible. I downloaded it first, but after finally finishing it, I'm going to buy both Box sets, and buying the \"Pocket Full of Rainbows\" movie when it comes out. Just to own and help possible future Eureka Sevens to be released, or Anime like it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, my final words are, I'm glad I watched it, and I never plan on regretting all the emotions I felt while watching Eureka Seven. And I'm sure you'll fully understand what I mean after you watch it for yourself.",

            "content": "*Notice: This review contains some spoilers. And a lot of this contains sarcasm, depending on the portion of the review you're reading. If you\ufffdre not prepared for either, stop reading. Also, if you haven't seen the series (or most of it) you probably won't understand a lot of what I'm talking about to be completely honest. Which is why I have that summed up below, but even that has a couple of references to scenes late into the series.\r\nThe first 25-30 episodes were an absolute bore for me (think slightly more enjoyable than the 9th level of Hell), but in the latter episodes there weresome decent fight scenes which made it more enjoyable. There were also two \ufffdromance stories\ufffd in the end which I also found to be enjoyable (being a fan of romance). There were some parts where certain characters\ufffd personalities got overhauled in some respects to quickly and I felt it seemed unnatural and odd (like Renton suddenly going from \ufffdDamn! Damn! Damn!\ufffd to \ufffdI\ufffdm gonna kick some ass and chew some gum. But I\ufffdm all outta gum.\ufffd There were also some episodes that were fairly entertaining but basically worthless (soccer game, anyone?). I also felt that some of the characters in those episodes *coughRentoncough* acted worthless. \ufffdDude, I\ufffdm sweet at soccer because I leave the ball completely open to an attacker and they can\ufffdt get it due to their lacking coordination! Oh snap! Moondoggie just did! Shi-zo!\ufffd Those kinds of moments irritated me since passing a ball is pretty basic concept, and Renton couldn\ufffdt seem to grasp the concept within a matter of seconds but understood how to jump off of a teammate and perform a coordinated kick on the goal with Eureka somehow. Makes perfect sense, I know, but I digress. Most of the later episodes helped to advance the plot and provide a little bit of character development, although some of the development seemed \ufffdoff\ufffd (with respect to each character) and felt unrealistic. However, because some of the characters didn\ufffdt seem to mature realistically, it allowed for some hardcore moments. Except for Maurice holding a bolt-action rifle which was assumed to be loaded (despite making zero sense since it was stored in the back of an LFO and only takes a few seconds to load one round into it. Much less that none of the characters in the Nirvash at that time probably even knew how use it). Maurice is a wuss, by the way.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nHere\ufffds the story in a nutshell: There\ufffds a kid named Renton who wants to be Tony Hawk except in the air. And using a mech. Then a girl crashes into part of his property and he falls in love with her. He joins a group called Gekko State and whines for lot of episodes. Then he meets a guy that likes frilly tops and a woman who cooks well. He wants to think of them as his parents and pays no attention to their being complete strangers, but has utmost trust for them from the gitgo. Then they both die. He goes back to Gekko State. He whines some more and claims that he\ufffdll protect the girl that destroyed his property. There are some cool battles. Holland acts like a jerk and then becomes mildly hardcore later on. More sweet battles. Eureka, Renton, and some kids end up going through \ufffdthe Zone\ufffd and end up a ways underground. Eureka undergoes some physical changes. A guy named Dewey comes to power, tries to wipe out all Coralians, tries to destroy the Nirvash. Then Dewey dies. Renton saves Eureka using a new version of the Nirvash (like the Nirvash 2.0). Then an old man is revealed to be a Coralian and leaves. Dominic gets it on with Anemone. The show ends.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the shortened plot synopsis: A kid named Renton meets a girl named Eureka. She pilots a big mech (the first one ever). Renton falls in love with the girl. Then he joins and anti-government organization to fight &quot;the man.&quot; He and Eureka pilot the mech (the Nirvash) together and fall in love. Stuff happens, Renton whines a lot, matures extremely quickly at some points, and almost gets killed a few times. Then the lead man of the government dies and Eureka ends up in a &quot;state [of being]&quot; where she needs to be saved, which only Renton can do. Renton saves her. The show ends.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Animation\ufffd\\n\r\nThe animation in Eureka 7 was decent. Nothing awful by any means, but also nothing particularly astounding. The characters all had their own definite \ufffdstyles,\ufffd and had a distinctive look to them. But at the same time, their clothes were typically drawn with great detail and some of their other features (like Holland\ufffds \ufffdbeard\ufffd) were lacking, too. The environments also left some to be desired. Most of the backgrounds typically were fairly bland and didn\ufffdt have much attention to detail, but this wasn\ufffdt nearly as noticeable since the show rarely focused on the environments themselves. Where the animation did excel was with the LFOs (the mechs). They were reminiscent of Neon Genesis Evangelion (compare the Nirvash and the Type 01), although still had some of their own nifty features (hoverboards, anyone?). The animation was also very fluid and done well for the battles, and the effects for explosions among other things almost always looked good. The reason animation gets an eight from me is because although there was some to be desired, the animation involving LFOs was done well (as were battles in general).\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Sound\ufffd\\n\r\nI thought the sound was done very well. The first two openings weren\ufffdt terribly appealing, but the third one was very enjoyable and the fourth one still had some of its own merits. One of the ending themes was decent but none of them really stood out or grabbed me. The voice acting was done well for each character, and no particular one really stood out, but that can be seen as good or bad depending on your perspective. The battles or \ufffdintense\ufffd moments generally had great music accompanying. One of my personal favorites was the music that sounded like the tango played near the end of the movie \ufffdTrue Lies.\ufffd Then again, I\ufffdm a fan of the tango so that may be more personal preference. All in all, I thought the insert songs felt fitting for their scenes and I liked the music (Storywriter by Supercar I thought worked really well).\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Character--\\n\r\nEach of the characters had their own personality and attributes, although I didn\ufffdt feel most of them developed too much in ways that made great sense. For instance, like I stated earlier in the review, Renton goes from \ufffdwhine whine whine\ufffd to \ufffdGet to the chopper! If you want to live, come with me,\ufffd in a Schwarzenegger tone. While I definitely liked it more when some of the characters were like that (as oppose to not), it didn\ufffdt feel \ufffdfitting\ufffd for them based off of their previous actions and emotions. It was supposed to be a sign of them developing but I never got the impression that it truly \ufffdclicked\ufffd for most of them. Eureka\ufffds personality progressed in a way that seemed natural, but at the same time according to the story she learned basically everything from people, so how she experienced or developed different emotions was never fleshed out. Then again, she\ufffds probably just supposed to already retain the ability for different emotions like hatred, love, etc, and it\ufffds a given. So I didn\ufffdt dwell much on that issue when I was watching the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nIt\ufffds a fun show overall. Was it worth sitting through almost 30 episodes of boredom to see some exciting and uplifting parts later on? Maybe, but that\ufffds questionable. It\ufffds a decent show, and it has some ups and downs. If you really like mechs and action you may want to watch it, but I\ufffdd stick with something like Full Metal Panic for mechs myself. A lot of people enjoy Eureka 7, and while it\ufffds not absolute top-notch or anything like that, a good portion of it is enjoyable and interesting enough for you to finish an episode and want to see what happens in the next. \\n\\n\r\nHere are the basics for whether you might like the show or not. If you:\\n\r\n-like mechs\\n\r\n-like romance stories\\n\r\n-like hoverboards\\n\r\n-like watching stuff get blown up\\n\r\n-like decently cool battles\\n\r\n-enjoy watching characters go from being total pansies to suddenly owning everything in sight\\n\r\n-enjoy having a &quot;tragic&quot; hero who does well but has some flaw\\n\r\n...then you might like this show. Those are the basics.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRatings (This is how to understand what I have it you think it doesn't match up with the numbers):\\n\r\n10- Astoudning, fantastic. This is the alpha-male. It wins on more levels that I can count.\\n\r\n9- Excellent and better than most of what you typically come across. Not the pinnacle of greatness, but still close.\\n\r\n8- Well done, although flaws are definitely present. It does a lot of things fairly well but you can see the errors in it. Could use some work or it's still fairly enjoyable, but not a lasting impression.\\n\r\n7- Decent. Doesn't execute anything to any amazing extent or anything really poorly. Very middle of the road.\\n\r\n6- Limited appeal. This may appeal to some but it's very on the edge between average and being poor.\\n\r\n5 and Below- 100% craptacular goodness. The lower the score here is, the more you realize how much you hate the material in question.",

            "content": "\"Even our favorite things in life have flaws. Even so, we continue to love them regardless.\"\r\nAs I thought of this generic, cheesy, probably already existing line, the first anime that came to mind was Eureka Seven. Not only because it's the main theme throughout the show regarding its characters and their relationships, but also because it perfectly describes my general thoughts on the show itself.\r\nLet me start off by pointing out where Eureka Seven truly shines. In my opinion that would be the general lively atmosphere and vibrant color palette. Man, this show is the definition of fun! The character designs are award-winningly awesome, theanimation (while still having dips and hiccups here and there) is gorgeous, the background art mesmerizing.\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Not only are most of the OP/ED themes memorable, but the OST itself is FILLED with absolutely amazing, memorable tracks, most notably including catchy techno beats that fit surprisingly well with action scenes on one hand, and captivatingly ambient experimental rock tracks which make you feel like you're lifting on trapar waves without a care in the world on the other. \\n\r\nEverything about Eureka Seven screams creativity, and you can tell that the whole project is filled with love and passion from its creators.\\n\r\nAll of these components give it that special, nostalgic feeling that kicks in as soon as you start the show and never goes away.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that this nostalgia in particular is what makes people love this show so much and sometimes even neglect the show's problems, which, if you manage to wake up from that ecstatic, youthful, pure fun feeling this show puts you in, you'll realize aren't that small.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to point out the show's length. It's 50 episodes long, which is not the most common length. Maybe one that you see once a year or once every 2 years. This relatively chunky length springs up 2 major problems.\\n\r\nThe first one is the fact that the show is filled with unnecessary filler. I'd dare say almost half of the show is weird, out of place slice-of-life stuff that drastically slows the story down. Now don't get me wrong, I'd take the development of the characters (most of which are, mind you, surprisingly deep and realistic already) over awkward, badly explained politics/military/sci-fi shenanigans we will get into later. However, most of the filler doesn't even develop the characters much, but instead puts them in weird, one-episode gag situations which end up serving little to no benefits to the story later on (for example the mission where Renton goes out in the field as an in-disguise spy, or the infamous soccer episode).\\n\r\nThe second problem which is sprung up by the length is the show's \"identity crisis\". What I mean by this is the fact that the show changes its core genre way too much. It starts off as a shounen-esque adventure story, but shortly after switches to an organization-based rebel story. Then, it starts really focusing on the characters' psyches and problems, which works fine until the show starts focusing on Renton's and Eureka's relationship, at which point the other parts of the story get more and more neglected and unexplained in order to focus on those two as much as possible. The show's final... let's say approximately third focuses on the sci-fi part of the story which still somehow manages to be outshined by the beloved Eureka-and-Renton part. That, combined with the aforementioned filler chunks make the pacing of the story feel like one big mess.\\n\\n\r\nI saved the most glaring problem for last, that being the sci-fi/politics/worldbuilding part of the show. Let's face it, it's not the smartest thing ever. Most concepts that are introduced (and there's many) are either explained very briefly/poorly and not in the most understandable way, or just... not explained at all. It's not uncommon while watching this show to start thinking things like \"Wait, am I supposed to understand what they're talking about? Did I miss something? Am I dumb for not understanding it?\" only to realize that you indeed were not supposed to understand it, at which point a character just pulls out a bunch of info out of nowhere. However, you then realize that if they knew that all along, they could have done something about some situations that have already happened beforehand, which then makes you pull out your hair in frustration because of how dumb these decent characters end up looking because of weird directing decisions. And yes, I do blame the aforementioned two problems for this one to a certain extent. If only the pacing was better and some of the filler left out, they would have been able to explain and flesh out these concepts properly and make them feel less dumb/shoehorned in.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nEureka Seven is not a perfect show. Far from one, in fact. However, its real charm lays in its characters, world, atmosphere and just sheer fun factor.\\n\r\nIt's like that one game from your childhood that isn't anything amazing objectively, but it still feels special to you no matter when or how much you play it because it brings you back to those simpler, better times when you were just a daydreaming playful kid without a care in the world. \\n\r\nIt explores themes such as family, love, jealousy, happiness, loneliness, etc. in such a way that really makes you invested in these characters to the point where they end up feeling almost like best friends to you.\\n\r\nWhen I look at the members of Gekkostate, I don't just see a bunch of fictional characters. I see a group of friends, a family, people who'll always be by my side no matter where I am.\\n\r\nRenton, Eureka, Holland, Talho, Stoner, Hap, Mattheiu, Hilda, Maeter, Linck, Maurice, Moondoggie, Gidget, Mischa, Jobs, Woz, Ken-goh, Gonzy, and last but not least, Nirvash. They'll always hold a special place in my heart and I'll never forget the fun times I had on Gekko alongside all of them.\\n\r\nThat feeling is something that's really hard to find nowadays, even in the best of shows. That's why I think Eureka Seven deserves all of the love it gets, and why it should remain to be a timeless classic for all of eternity.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "So much unrealized potential. I began watching Eureka Seven on the basis of the many positive reviews here and elsewhere, but was gravely disappointed in what I experienced. There is indeed the foundation for a great work here, and there is within it some exceptional parts, but they are too few and far between to support a fifty-episode run. \r\nMy principle issue is certainly with the lead characters, nearly all of whom are more frequently frustrating to watch than endearing and spend far too much time whining and lazing about like some useless wretches. There are numerous secondary characters who are far more intriguing andwho barely get any screen time, or are elevated to a \"mauve shirt\" before vanishing or being killed off. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a good balance between mystery and explanation of the tech, which I like. Not too much is revealed but enough to give it some plausible functionality. Similarly with the historical background; much is left for you to fill in but this is more a benefit than a detriment. The score(s) have been universally praised, and with good reason, but the art is strangely inconsistent. Some of the design is clearly shared with Bounen no Xamdou (also produced by studio Bones), but it pales in comparison on all counts to it otherwise. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Whenever you (re-)watch this show, keep in mind this phrase: Boy meets Girl. That's the essence of the show, its central thesis. You might not find it as interesting as \"a bunch of ragtag rebels fight against a massive military power with surfing robots\", or you might object to the inevitable brooding teenager in the dumps because he hasn't had a good conversation with the girl of his dreams in weeks. They might drift apart, they might even fight and split up, only to miss one another, seek one another, and end up back together stronger than ever. That's youth. That's teenage life. That's EurekaSeven.\\n\\n\r\nAll right, to be fair, not every teenager gets to ride an obscenely powerful giant robot. Renton, you lucky bastard.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is beautifully planned and executed, although it tends to take a back seat to Bones' artistic influences or interesting if unorthodox perspectives on life and the universe. One episode took quite the wild tangent away from the main story for no other reason than \"Well, it was fun, wasn't it?\" The second cour did tend to drag (as did the third), but it builds up to a mini-climax scene in Morning Glory. If you didn't go \"Yes!!\" at that scene, well... I'm sure there's something out there you'll enjoy more. The \"mirror\" characters of Eureka and Renton start as antagonists, but they have a journey of redemption of their own, a fantastic sequence that culminates in another fan favorite episode, Ballet M\u00e9canique. While the writers take their sweet time and scenic routes, the plot threads weave their way through the show without feeling like a soap opera, and the climaxes to the story arcs are well worth the wait.\\n\\n\r\nOther studios can learn from Bones' idea for making a summary episode: Half of the episode is a counterculture news report by Stoner, and the other half is a military report by Dominic, with heavy influences from Gainax shows like Evangelion. This was miles ahead of how a lot of big studios did it at the time-- Sunrise would just have the ship captain's voice actress narrate over clips, and SAO's version was also a report, but the flashbacks are basically recycled from the show proper. In Eureka Seven, Bones did a great job of making those clips seem as though they were in fact part of the reports-- we get a better sense of the world after seeing what has happened thus far through Renton's eyes. The down side is that, well, the editing may have taken longer than other episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI like it when a studio gets creative with episode titles, and just about every episode title is the title to a song. And it's not like the song titles are there just because someone at Bones liked the song-- some of the titles are repeated to indicate important turning points in the story, others offer strong hints to the feel of the episode, still others are dead giveaways.\\n\\n\r\nJust about every giant robot show involves guns of some form, missiles, and jet/rocket propulsion. This show made the idea of robots surfing on waves of \"light particles\" believable, without making it seem like a shonen manga gimmick. Better yet, this is even like snowboarding or skateboarding, it's both a sport and a means of transportation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Naoki Sato isn't the musical mastermind known as Yoko Kanno (he went on to write the score to NHK's hit \"Taiga fantasy\", the live-action Seirei no Moribito series), he still demonstrates a wide range of styles, among them straight-ahead rock, electronic, modern classical (film score), and reggae. A good composer creates atmosphere with music, and his music captures the moments perfectly-- at times, evoking the wide world around Renton, at times depicting fierce combat, at times reflecting the desperation of the scene or a character moving forward despite dire circumstances. And if memory serves, he did all this with a keyboard and a computer, meaning he uses a fantastically good instrument library and took full advantage of its dynamic range.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese title translates to \"Symphonic Psalms Eureka Seven\", and I think that's not a bad way to describe the series. It's like a good classical symphony (albeit on the long side, kinda like Mahler or Wagner), only with fantastic animated drama and giant robot combat.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nI first learned about Eureka Seven when I saw Eureka on the cover of a magazine back in 2006 or so. She was very intriguing, and the series looked interesting, but I wasn't much of an anime watcher back then, so I didn't watch the series. Eureka has always been stuck in my head though, so now that I watch anime as a hobby, I figured I'd give the series a go, even though I don't generally like mecha-related series. \r\nFirst Impression: 4/10\r\nAfter the first couple of episodes, I really didn't see a reason for so many people giving this anime a 10. Renton actedlike Naruto (Who I've never really liked), but somehow more annoyingly. Eureka quite emotionless and frankly much more boring than I'd hoped. The beginning of the series gets no more than a 4/10 from me. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the first 25-30 episodes is something close to non-existent. It was mainly time for character development, which gave some story, but what was there had little to do with the story that shows up in the last 20 or so episodes. You don't get answers to much of anything until 90% of the character development is done. The character development is not mixed in with the story, which makes both seem a little less realistic. If they had mixed the two, the anime could have been shortened to 30-40 episodes and become much more enjoyable. The story that does show up at the end though, is a very good one, and is pulled off very well. It doesn't seem rushed, and doesn't seem dragged out, things make sense, and you think you know what's going on, but there are surprises at every turn. So, my score of 8/10 for story can be further explained with a 3/10 for the first half of the series, and a 10/10 for the second half. If you're willing to sit through 30 episodes of mediocre story, the last 20 episodes are worth it. Though some things are never explained, I didn't really feel like they were important to know.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe anime almost seems to be divided in two by every category, actually. In the first half the art was decent, but not great. Many backgrounds lacked the detail I've come to expect from Japanese animation and the animation itself didn't wasn't that great. The second half, however, improved in both these areas, and many scenes were just gorgeous. The fact that the characters always looked very well drawn was always the same, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm never really a fan of opening/ending songs, and this was no different. The only song I sort of liked was the last opening song. The songs did fit with the tone of the anime though, so much of my opinion on them is simply that, an opinion. There didn't seem to be anything different about the songs. They were your typical opening/ending Japanese pop songs, and were sort of pointless to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music was simply wonderful though. It matched the scenes and mood 99% of the time, and increased the effect of whatever is shown on the screen. If I left out my opinion on the opening/ending songs, sound would have gotten a 9/10, if not a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters at the beginning were not very good. They were either incredibly dull, annoying, naive, or just plain idiotic. I kept watching though, hoping that they would learn something, and luckily they did... 30 episodes later. It just took far too long for these characters to learn anything. Once they do learn though, they become quite likable. The character development was very good, but it just took too long. \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect of the first 30 episodes I loved, though, was how much trouble some of the characters had with killing. Far too often in anime you see young teens running out into the battlefield and start killing people without looking back, and they never really suffer for it. I congratulate the creators of Eureka Seven for their amazing job of bringing up this subject and pulling it off well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment in the first 25 or so episodes was fairly low. A few exciting things happened now and then and a character did something cool maybe once every 3-4 episodes, but that was it. Once all the major changes happened though and the story started moving, enjoyment shot straight up and I watched the last 20 or so episodes in one night. The first half of the anime gets maybe a 4/10, while the second half gets a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though every category individually gets a lower score, the overall effect of the anime deserves a 9/10. Being able to see how the characters have grown almost makes up for the 30 not-quite-so-good episodes. Almost. If I was rating just the last 20 episodes, I would easily give it a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nIn Closing: \\n\\n\r\nThis is over all a very good anime, but it's one for people with patience who won't hold grudges for too long against the characters for doing something stupid, which they do. A lot. The series turned out amazing and lived up to its potential, if only for the last 20 episodes.",

But maybe that is the reason I love anime, there doesn't need to be a laid out reason you love it. You can just feel it in your heart. That is how I am now. I just finished the final episode after watching Eureka Seven over the course of a week. I cried at the end, but not out of sadness or remorse, but from pure happiness from within. I know this sounds weird while reading this, but I cannot put into words how much I enjoyedthis anime. I would recommend this anyone. I have put it in my Top 5 most loved Anime. \\n\r\n   After watching this almost exactly 13 years after its release, the Art and Sound of this anime are still exquisite. I honestly had to check the release date multiple times just to make sure I was seeing things right... Though you may not think 13 years is a long time for an anime, I would put it on par or even beyond some anime I've seen recently. I think this anime will continue to shine brightly within those of us who have watched it and witnessed its joys and sorrows.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso this is my first time writing a review! Eureka Seven made such an impact that I would try and portray how I felt about this anime. I will never forget this anime!",

            "content": "Eureka Seven was the first anime that I ever binge-watched. For that reason, it will always hold a special place in my heart.\r\nNow, on to the review! (which is, for the most part, spoiler-free)\r\nThe story is quite good. The anime is 50 episodes long so there are some lulls in the action. I would describe Eureka Seven as a love story that happens to have fighting robots. The main enjoyment (at least for me) comes from seeing the relationship between Renton and Eureka grow. You spend a lot of time inside Renton's head and, by the end of the series, he is one of themost fleshed-out characters that I have ever seen. You understand his motivations, his insecurities, and his goals. You become emotionally invested in the characters which makes it all the more heart-wrenching when some of them inevitably die. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is consistently good throughout, props to Bones.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing and adds much to the atmosphere. \\n\r\nFavourite track: \"Eureka\". \\n\\n\r\nNow, I think something should be said about whether to watch the dub audio or original Japanese. I have watched both, and I can say with some confidence that the dub is superior. Without getting into matters of authenticity and adaptation, I think that the voice actors (especially for Renton) give a superior emotional performance in the dub. If you're open-minded enough to give it a try then I would recommend watching it in English. Try both though, maybe you'll enjoy the sub better! Whatever floats your boat :)\\n\\n\r\nI won't reveal plot details because I think it's best to take it on completely fresh. I stumbled upon the DVD at my local electronics shop and, knowing nothing about it besides the blurb on the back of the case, I picked it up. And it blew me away! Give it a shot, it won't disappoint.\\n",

            "content": "Eureka 7. It completely stands out from any other Mecha/Romance anime's out there. First few episodes were great but when it came to the last few episodes it was Phenomenal. The setting was great with a awesome story to back it up. the art and animations looked amazing as the music went in well with certain scenes. The characters are all great and compelling. \r\nIt starts out with a 14 year old teen named Renton Thirston. Everything about his life sucks until it all changes when a huge LFO comes crashing into his house.Out comes A very beautiful girl named Eureka. Soon after Renton joinsEureka on board the Gekkostate. A massive ship with a crew of Anti Government members with the leader being the person Renton looked up too Holland. \\n\\n\r\nAs i dont want to give lots away i will say that the story was amazing. It had many plot lines that kept you wondering until the very end and for 50 episodes they did an amazing job keeping it so good for that long. As the story was very great it did have some stuff that was never explained which could be very annoying if you were curious about it but never the less it was spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animations on this show was top quality i had never seen so much detail and visuals that looked amazing until of course this show. The way they created the trapar waves looked amazing and Characters had so much detail going on. As for The Art they did get a bit lazy with some backgrounds but none the less it looked incredible. Some of the most notable art was the nirvash and what it leaves behind they put so much work to it.\\n\\n\r\nThey really did go all out with the soundtrack. The way they implemented certain tracks at certain scenes was brilliant and they have their timing down perfect. For the songs themselves they have excellent quality in the sounds and they made certain songs go with certain scenes which added to the quality of this anime. If you can go download or buy the OST's of Eureka 7 their well worth it. As for sound Effects the way the LFO's move through the trapar waves sounds great and the shining of the nirvashes eyes was incredible.\\n\\n\r\nAll the Characters in Eureka 7 are very pleasing to see. Renton and Eureka together always makes me feel happy for them and when they do things together. as for the other members of GekkoState Holland had an amazing personality. Taho who is Hollands girlfriend had a personality that changes during the story she was really fun to see. Other members such as Stoner was very interesting. Stoner is the photographer of the Gekkostate he doesn't like resorting to violence. He is also the one who created Ray=Out the official magazine for the Gekkostate. As for Matthew and Hilda, they made a great couple and both were great in their own way. Hap, Hollands life long best friend was really funny character who liked playing pranks but was also serious at times. As for Eureka's 3 kids Link Mader and Maruice, they play a very important part in Eureka 7. Other members such as the  the Vodarac and government played a great role in the anime. It would remind people lots of how in world war 2 the Nazi's killed hews just because of their beliefs and views. Overall the characters of Eureka 7 are all unique in their own way but as they are good something very irritating is their back story and how they came to be there in the first place. but for 50 episodes they did a great job in making the characters very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 is in many ways an incredible Anime that is well worth the watch. The story is compelling and keeps you watching until the very end, Animation and art was Fabulous and remarkable, the sound makes all of it even more enjoyable to watch. The music were great and the way they implemented it. As for the voice actors both Sub and Dub had amazing Actors but Dub did put more emotion into their acting. The characters were all unique and had different personalty's that kept you liking them. Overall this anime is well worth the watch and will always be in your heart for the days to come. You will feel emotionally happy you will feel Sad you will feel great and enjoy it all the way through.",

            "content": "50 episodes ago I thought I was mad for watching such a long mecha anime. 7 days later I'm wondering why it's already finished. My expectations for Eureka Seven were high, though I never thought it would be more then a stereo-type mecha anime. And guess what, Eureka Seven is a top notch mecha anime, but it's also much more then that. \r\nEverything starts with a 14 year old boy named Renton Thurston. He's entire life up until then turned around ref-boarding, a popular sport in the world of Eureka Seven, and mechanics. So when the Gekkostate drops by, a group of rebels leaded bythe famous ref-boarder Holland Novak, it's as if his greatest dream comes true. During  the 13 following episodes, Renton gets acquainted with the crew and is introduced to the beautiful lady Eureka with whom he falls in love instantly. Being a newbie, quite a bit of pestering is awaiting Renton once he gets on the ship, so lots of fun and humor is to be expected in this arc. You best just sit back and enjoy the adventures the crew  lives through, the outstanding character designs, some neat mecha fights and lots of amusing hip hop tunes.\\n\\n\r\nAround the second quarter of Eureka Seven this \"no worries\"-state of mind which existed on the GekkoGo (that's what the ship is called) makes place for some vicious down-spiraling melodrama. Everything goes from bad to worse to even depressing. Renton is having a hard time with Eureka and the GekkoGo crew while everyone else has it's own problems to worry about.\\n\\n\r\nIt's around this time you really get a good view of how deep character relations go in Eureka Seven. This is what Eureka Seven is about: character development. And boy did the producers do a good job here! Not one character is alike, all are unique, and they all have their own way of being attractive to the audience. I can't really chose a favorite since there are many whom call to one's heart. Eureka Seven has many supporting characters and all are treated with the same care, making sure they are important to the main story. \\n\\n\r\nAfter going through this drama bit, the clouds seem to have shrunk a little and Gekkostate is back on the right track with their goal clear in mind: saving the world! \\n\\n\r\nA new party is introduced to the game, the army, lead by an evil man named Dewey (I had a hard time not laughing when I heard his name, I mean come on! Dewey?!). Many secrets are unraveled after the second half of the anime, meaning more ability to sympathize with the characters and ease to understand the meaning behind their actions and reactions. Pieces of information are given about the Coralians too, though I can't tell anything about it without spoiling. \\n\\n\r\nYou can await many mecha battles from now on, but they never get boring as more important matters surround them. By now there have been 3 different intro and ending songs too. I especially liked the first pair, I felt they worked really well with the anime. I was disappointed by the second pair because they didn't match the feeling the series had by then. The third pair was better and supported the events going on in the series. The fourth opening and ending were great, equivalent to the first. The animation was amusing too, except for the last ending, which wasn't even animated. It made it seem as if the producers got bored of it all. A shame. The music throughout Eureka Seven isn't comparable to many other soundtracks. If you're into this kind of music, you'll like it. But if you're not, you might have a hard time listening to the same tunes over and over again. I myself found they gave a modern and joyful twist to Eureka Seven.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the final arc. Everyone, in all three camps, the Gekkostate, the army and the Coralians, is getting tense as the apocalypse is near. This is where the romance between certain characters shows it's best side and where children like Renton become real heroes (though his childish side never fades, after all, he's only fourteen).\\n\\n\r\n I've heard people say Eureka Seven is too childish and idyllic and there is truth in that statement, but I can't say I see it as one of it's flaws. Eureka Seven stirs up your wildest dreams and makes possible what's impossible in real life. Maybe the concepts in Eureka Seven are childish, but the series is mature enough to bring them in an attractive way for most anyone.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure about the final episode of the anime, the final battle was great and the climax sent a strong message to the world, but little is said about how Gekkostate is doing after these decisive events. What you believe has become of them is up to you. \\n\\n\r\nOver all I enjoyed Eureka Seven. The animation was beautiful and detailed to the very end and the soundtrack was catchy and fun to listen to. The story was interesting, maybe not too original but very well brought and never boring. But what Eureka Seven makes such a good anime is it's character development and the relationships that are sketched at the start and fine-tuned near the end. So, omedeto to Eureka Seven's developers who brought us this wonderful piece of art!",

Do that and you'll succeed\u201d - Adrock Thurston\r\nThis is my second time going through \u201cEureka Seven\u201d so I decided to write a review for it.  The first time I watched this series, I saw it dubbed on adult swim.  I really enjoyed it! The English casting seemed great and I would spend Sundays just laying on the couch watching a whole lot of episodes I built up on the DVR. The second time through I went for the subbed version. Right now at this point, I liked the subbed version better. I donot remember much from the dubbed version. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Renton Thurston is a 14-year-old boy who lived with his mechanic grandfather in a backwater town. Every day he dreamed of being with the mercenary \"Light Finding Operation (LFO)\" aircraft pilot group \"Gekkostate\" and riding \"Trapar\" particle waves-- a sport called \"reffing\"-- with their charismatic leader Holland, especially when faced with his father's acclaimed past or his grandfather's desire to protect him. When a young girl named Eureka riding the original LFO, the \"Nirvash typeZERO\", asks his grandfather for a tune-up, she inadvertently brings the attention of the military to the garage; as a result, the garage is destroyed and Renton is forced to deliver a new type of interface-- the \"Amita Drive\"-- to the Nirvash. After a heated fight in which the Nirvash destroys the military LFOs by unleashing an immense amount of power, Renton is invited into Gekkostate. However, he quickly realizes that behind the facade of a traveling group of mercenaries is a very bitter reality. \\n\\n\r\nI personally loved the story it had a lot of moments where it kept me up until 2 in the morning because I couldn't stop watching it. So I give it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm don't rate for art style, because it does not matter to me when I watch a series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This was probably my favorite part of the series. The soundtrack was really epic. There were many times when something epic would happen and there would be a awesome moment where to music match perfectly and would give you chills down your arm. The openings we're great too, I loved each one of them. But there was one that stood above them all: opening 4 \u201cSakura\u201d. This epic ending song made the ending even more epic. It felt so well with the overall theme of the ending. I will made sure to but this one on of my mixes. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This was another awesome thing about the series. There was so much character development. The Renton and Eureka you meet in episode one evolve and change that you wouldnt even believe it if you were told about episode 50. At first I thought Renton was incredibly childish and I got angry at him a lot. But, near the end he became really awesome :) The same goes with Holland, he was a jerk at first but then he became awesome. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 This is one series I'll be keeping on my hard drive to watch again. It really intrigued me. It makes me with that you could Ref in real life. Wouldn't that just be awesome? Hopefully technology will make that possible one day!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 This was a really good series and recommend it to anyone. It has action, romance and epic moments. At first it will be hard to get into then once you get to know the characters and watch them evolve this series will becomes a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhen you think of music or movies, instead of remembering what they are about you're more likely to be reminded of the memories you have of that time and the people you knew then.\u201d - Stoner (Eureka Seven)",

            "content": "Emos ! We've all heard of them! We've listened to their music, we've heard of their ridiculous /wrist attitude and we've made fun of it! Now they're here trying to save the anime 2d world fighting with mechas and spaceships.\r\nI'll start by commenting the two most important aspects of any anime. The characters and the story. The word that fits best the characters is the word i used to start this review. EMO! And what exactly defines an emo character you might ask. Well here is a rough description of emos  : \r\n\"Complete idiots. So called \"emotionals\" often attempt to get depressedabout anything and everything and over react emotionally for no reason other than to be attention whores. They wear their hair down over their face, often looking like it was used to wipe someones butt, or so we assume form the attendant acne that most have because they don't shower. Probably because showering makes them sad that it's wate that the fish could have, or that they can't take their camera in with them or it will be broken so they can't express the emotions that the moving water swells up inside of them with it's radient beauty.  Rightfully they feel that every thinks they suck. This is because they do, but only because they have brought it on themselves. Had they not been emo we wouldn't make fun of them. Despite this, an that fact that they're not, they tend to think of themselves as hardcore and so can cop an attitude when they finally stop crying about how much the world hates them. Usually about how much better they are than everyone because they understand the emotional side of things and we \"don't\". they dress in drag and so are usually made fun of for being gay. Cause they are.\"\\n\r\nThis describes exactly their attitude. To be honest the anime doesn't start like that. The first episodes look much better than the rest. The characters are introduced nicely and they look fun and interesting. However after around 13-15 episodes there's a dramatic change of mood and everything gets screwed up badly. The anime from being light and fun turns to an over-dramatic tragedy. The characters start to fit the \"emo\" description more and more with each episode. Their irrational behavior, their way of over-reacting even for the most simple thing becomes ridiculous even annoying. \\n\r\nThe word \"pathetic\" kept circling my mind the whole time and i was abit surprised to find out that it's the word that's used  for the rating \"1\".  \\n\r\nFitting...\\n\\n\r\nThe story was almost equally bad. I'm not sure if i was supposed to know more  about E7's world by reading some manga or novel before, but for a newcomer like me it made little sense. There were gaping plot holes. I kept saying \"whatever\" episode after episode. There's simply no logic behind the weather effects in this world. I never understood what exactly where those waves or how exactly the lifting worked and many other things including the mechas, the aliens etc. Maybe if i watched it a second time i could find some more explanations. But it was so uninteresting and so dull that i would do this only if i was payed good.\\n\\n\r\nThe redeeming features of this anime are the music and art. Both are great. The fighting sequences are nice and the animation is flowing. Spaceship models etc are nice. Artistically everything looks and sounds awesome. Too bad that's not enough to make up for the pathetic characters and the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : I enjoyed the first 15 episodes. I was very happy there were 50 in total and couldn't wait to see how would the story and the characters evolve. I almost dropped it around episode 40. I took a huge break from 40 to 50. Gathered all my courage and finished it just to be able to write my opinion on this. Some people seem to have enjoyed this thoroughly. Personally i didn't. Feelings of anger and boredom overwhelmed me while watching it. \\n\r\nI the end i suppose it's up to each individual to decide whether to watch it or not. Iif it's an amazing anime or not.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven was truly a HUGE letdown for me. I was quite baffled by the experience of watching this Anime because prior to watching it, all I heard was praise for the show only to let me down. Instead, this show felt more like a chore for me to watch rather than actually enjoying it.\r\nEureka Seven is an Anime from the mid 2000s created by studio Bones. When it first began airing on the spring of 2005, it went on to become one of the most critically successful Anime's of the first decade of the new millennium. The show won numerous awards from both Japanand the West. Most notably winning the 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair. The series is often praised for it's interesting story with unique concept and theme along with it's character development with symbolic messages and mix usage and references of 1980s and 1990s music. Not to mention that almost every episode is named after real songs. \\n\\n\r\nBut my perspective with the show is much different to what it was and what it's said about it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nEureka Seven actually had an interesting story. Set on a alternative Earth where the story is about some little pipsqueak named Renton Thurston who is striving to have his life changed because he is bored with his life and that his town sucks because there is nothing to do there. Of course suddenly a chick with blue hair named Eureka appears to him and then he is suddenly dragged into conflict and is allowed to go with her and be with a mercenary group called Gekko State that treats him like absolute garbage in the beginning so that his boring life can change forever! The setting is humanity is living on somewhat of a post apocalyptic setting with rather unique giant robots called LFOs being one of the main focus of the show and the deep lore and it's deep background history. Like trees, plants, and bushes, clouds, robots surfboarding, religious cults, with the military trying to kill those who oppose them, and some chick with pink hair holding an importance to the story. This all sounds interesting at first. But when you realize it, it's really only interesting on paper. You see, do you wanna know the real problem with the story for me is?\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven is to me a prime example of when concept itself can't save a series from being boring. Sometimes even Anime with the most crappiest and horrible concept can be interesting. E7 does no such thing. The majority of the Anime revolves around mundane filler episodes which really result in absolutely nothing other than nonsense and being a HUGE waste of time. For most of the show I had to literally wait for the *it starts to get good now syndrome*. Around episode 21-28 is when I thought things really were about to start getting good, and for a short while, it ACTUALLY DID GET GOOD. Until on episode 29 and onward it was back to the same problem with the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor most part, the entire show is literally just talking, talking, talking, and talking. For most part most of the episodes were mundane filler of our cast doing normal things in life. And if there was a serious episode most of the time it was talking about the whole entire topic for at least 15-20 minutes of the entire episode and then important things are shown at the very end of the episode and then it repeats. Half of the topics were really boring and for the most part struggled to keep me interested. Some of the focus on the topics too were so pointless and unnecessary. The drama is lame and stupid. Just pointless upsets and a stupid way to progress the story. At the beginning, Renton is going through BDSM from the Gekkostate crew because suddenly he's the biggest scum on earth for NO GOOD FREAKING REASON all because he's thinking about his beloved Eureka. The drama between him and Eureka was probably some of the most garbage and annoying thing to get through the show and the cause of the drama between the both of them results in some HUGE dumb reason which would take up at least half of the show and dictate the progress resulting once again in unnecessary arcs.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest problem of the show for me was the pacing. Eureka Seven is SLOW! Again, I thought I would suffer from the *it gets good later on so be patient syndrome*. But after around episode 30, I realize that the pacing of the Anime would very much remain the same until it finishes. This caused me to go through an episodic struggle of dropping it, and then watching it again, dropping it, and watching again, and rinse and repeat. I am still surprised that I didn't drop the Anime till the very end when I had the chance too. I will admit that I was becoming crazy in the head and getting literally bored to death to the point where I was doing other things because I couldn't keep my interest. I guess it was a mistake for me to even have believed that I thought it would get good later on. Instead it just became a chore later on.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS: Did you know that on episode 39 of Eureka Seven. The episode was about playing Soccer. Yes... Playing Soccer for the entire freaking episode. Like seriously... \\n\r\nIs this Eureka Seven or Captain Tsubasa now...?\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nI have always been a sucker for early to mid 2000s art theme. The art designs were really good. I liked the way the characters were designed. A almost real, yet traditional Anime art style of the characters. that have some early-mid 2000s pop vibe and outfit. The animation was spot on too. For a 2005 Anime, I'd say that it was way beyond it's time. Especially the scenery. I'd say Studio Bones nailed it on this one really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music was actually pretty good. The Anime itself had mixture of music. Ranging from the traditional Anime music, to music that sounds like retro pop music and Disco, to orchestra, and did I mention that the OPs and EDs had nice music? That's definitely another praise I'll give to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nOh boy... This is when things get REALLY complicating. The character development of Eureka Seven is spot on and at the same time an absolute mess for me and I'll explain why. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Eureka Seven have one thing in common and it's that sometimes I really like them, and then they really TICK me off. For starters I'm going to be mainly talking about the important characters of Eureka Seven.\\n\\n\r\nRenton Thurston is one of those characters that \"mature\". At the beginning he is literally what you call a wuss. A coward, a crybaby, and a weakling. But despite being that, he can pilot the oldest LFO called Nirvash along with his beloved Eureka. He has a sudden love interest for Eureka and the love interest was started from love at first sight. At the later half he grows up to be a so called \"cooler and more mature\" guy.\\n\r\nRenton is hard to endure at the first half. His crying, yapping, and moaning and complaining about almost anything is what drives me up the roof. Not to mention that he vomits a lot during the first season and can't even clean things for crap. Sure he does things that at least matter like always doing something useful, and not standing their and do screw all for the entire problem. At first yes he is a kid, and that's understandable because what he is seeing with his own eyes is adult problems and war, and lets be honest. War is something none of us want to see. Especially if the person is being literally killed in front of your eyes. Death is sad and we mourn for it all the time. But surprisingly the pipsqueak matures later on. He turns from this little weakling to someone that can actually do things and change the tide of the ranking of what's around him. In fact, the final episodes were his peak as a character. Renton isn't that half bad at all. In fact, of all ordinary guys that are losers, he is probably one of the best ones around in Anime. He is certainly much better than the ordinary light novel losers you see in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut here is the problem about Renton. It's his love for Eureka and the way it's displayed and progressed through the show. Renton's love for Eureka is VERY questionable for me because no offense. But his romance with Eureka is some of the most stupidest, lamest, and boring things he does with her. Now I love me some Romance Anime. I love the romance genre, but Eureka Seven doesn't do it well and to be honest. Renton and Eureka are honestly a lame couple in my opinion. It's not cheesy, it just feels bland and forced. There was nothing deep and emotional and over the top. It was him just caring and saying he loves her. Also his constant shouting of Eureka's name would give me anxiety attacks of how annoying and irritating it was to hear this over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nEUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!EUREKA!\\n\\n\r\nThe way he acts with others is a 50/50. At times he shows adamant courage, and then he squeaks out like a coward. Not surprising with an young protagonist he shows some teenager problems *like Charles said about him*. I admire him for standing up against his odds and enduring the pain and mistreatment of the Gekko state crew. *Especially Holland, Talho, and those 3 annoying little craps*.\\n\\n\r\nAlright. I'm going to make everyone mad here. But I personally DESPISE Eureka. Eureka is one of the most irritating Anime heroines ever. She is to me the most BIPOLAR doofus I have ever seen in Anime. Eureka is happy, and then sad. Her cold treatment towards Renton REALLY MADE ME FREAKING MAD. Renton does SO much for her and then all she does is act all cold, mean, and then starts getting all moody. Come to think of it, this isn't just in the beginning. IT'S FOR ALMOST THE WHOLE ENTIRE FREAKING SHOW. She's mainly there just to fill in the story and she is one of those chicks that need to be there because they hold the key to the cluster mess of a story that happens. She also has her romance with Renton and it's pretty much the same thing. Lame, and boring. I really have nothing much to say about her except that she is a cold clutch that is there for the story. That's all. Also she suffers the same problem Renton has.\\n\\n\r\nRENTON! RENTON! RENTON! RENTON!RENTON! RENTON! RENTON! \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the Gekko state is a mix bag. Holland and Talho were also irritating jerks and pricks that gave Renton the BDSM for stupid reasons. But they changed later on and honesty they turn to my favorites later on. Yes I'm not kidding you. At times I kinda wish they were both the main characters. The rest are alright, and I like it on how at times they stand for up for Renton against Holland's abuse towards Renton. Those 3 little craps were annoying, but understandable at times.\\n\\n\r\nRei and Charles were the most underrated characters in Eureka Seven and I really wished there was more of them. Watching them was like watching sunshine for me.\\n\\n\r\nDomenic is a normal dood that is part of the military and wants to do good for the world but keeps seeing injustice and suffering through the world and is in love with this pink haired chick named anemone who is just as annoying as Eureka because she is bipolar just like her. Like Renton and Eureka there romance is also poor and there love for each other is questionable and it's bland and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest are standards for Anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nIt depends really. If you can stomach the slow pace of the story of having to watch and listen to at least 15-20 minutes of very useless and pointless topics along with filler madness of playing soccer or trying to play pranks and maybe enjoy some of the characters development while admiring the theme and concept of the show with it's beautiful scenery and designs then maybe you'll enjoy it. Personally for me the enjoyment was a mediocre experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning Eureka Seven was a HUGE letdown for me. I expected to see myself marathoning the entire show only to find myself being BORED to death and trying my best to keep myself interested. But instead I went through a crisis of either dropping it or watching it while doing other things simply because I'm not interested. You can say watching the show turned into a chore for me which is something I really hate when watching Anime. Eureka Seven is an Anime for me that simply suffers from poor pacing, some episodes being really pointless with added  filler, and a overall lame experience. I would say that the characters were decent and maybe a bit interesting to watch. The art designs were good and so was the soundtrack but that theme and concept don't save an Anime from being boring and it certainly doesn't mean that having a good theme and concept would keep me interested in watching something especially if the story is boring and a chore to watch. This Anime was a huge disappointment and I have no interest in this Anime whatsoever anymore and I have NO plans to watch it's sequel AO.",

            "content": "I've watched quite a few Action-Romance-Mecha series before this one, non of the others  comes close to Eureka Seven. This series is basically the best combination of pretty much every genre out there I've ever seen. Add to that great music and art, and you'll get a must-watch.\r\nWhile watching the first episodes some may think: \"This might suck\", since, quite frankly, Renton isn't likable at first. That's when the main thing starts.\r\nthis series excels at making the viewer identify with the characters. It passes all the feelings of all the characters through to you exceptionally well, so well actually, that I believe if yourpersonality is slightly similar to that of a character, you'll feel like you have gone through the same changes after watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe second best trait here is the story. the story is awesome, and the way it is unfolded is even better. you'll never get bored here - something is always happening and it never feels like a side story. The plot twists a lot, though i don't want to mention details(spoilers) in this review. Go watch it yourself and you'll understand.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the SOUND. Hell, the sound changes everything. the sound makes you cry, laugh, feel encouraged  it enhances EVERYTHING. What I'm getting at is that the sound is superbly done, the OP and ED songs are catchy and you'll find yourselves humming them every now and then. the sound effects are great as well, but i doubt you'll really pay attention to them.\\n\\n\r\nI really really really do recommend to watch Eureka 7. it's a truly unique story, with unique characters and their development. If you watch it you're bound to take something from it with you.\\n\r\nYou'll enjoy every second.\\n\\n\r\nSo just as Adrok said:\\n\r\n\"Don't ask for it, go win it, and you'll be rewarded\".\\n\\n\r\nhave a great day people\\n\r\n         -Martaine\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've always wanted to write a review for Eureka Seven, As it is my favourite anime.. but for whatever reason i always feel like words i say can never live up to how Amazing Eureka Seven was. The anime is action packed, heartwarming, beautiful, dark, scandalous, funny, cute, romantic, packed with morals and so on.\r\nEureka Seven actually one of the best anime I've ever watched. From the first opening i saw on TV back in 2006 i thought it was going to be creepy and hard to understand just like .//hack sign... But it really wasn't. As long as you don't skip an episode andlisten/read carefully it shouldn't take long to catch onto. There are only 50 episodes so considering most Shonen it isn't very hard to catch onto.\\n\r\nI think the story in Eureka Seven is just magnificent. Its profound and questions the morality of the futuristic society that it takes place in. It is also very deeply romantic but also quite funny at the same time, as the main character is 14 year old, awkward pubescent teenage boy. \\n\r\nthe art in Eureka seven is defiantly one of the things left to be desired in Eureka Seven, even if its not actually that bad. The art is probably one of the only major fall backs in Eureka Seven but it is easy to get used to. There are some points when it is dead horrible, but others where it is absolutely amazing\\n\r\nthe sound in Eureka seven is average, just like listening to another anime. I think it will probably just depend on the quality of the Upload or DVD you're watching.\\n\r\nCharacter in Eureka seven is amazing. They are complex, multicultural, relatable and very unique or individual. Look deeply, every/almost every character has their own amazing and deep back story. \\n\r\nEureka seven is easy to enjoy with humor, romance, action and learned lessons. It jam packed full of fun hand has something related to everyone. The only thing you wont enjoy about Eureka seven is how short it is.\\n\r\nOverall Eureka seven is one of the best anime i've ever watched and i could recommend it to almost everyone.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is first a decent show but turns out to be a masterpiece. It can take time to get into it, but you will not regret watching it. I was new to mecha when I watched this, but well it made me interested in mecha later, and I really recommend it.\r\n_____Story_________________(9/10)\r\nThe story was not that great in the beginning. It took me five episodes before I started to like this show. The first ten episodes are mostly about getting to know the characters. After about five episodes the plot starts to flow in. Yes it takes some time, but when the story really start,it may really capture you. Eureka Seven has a lot of funny moments and romance. After a while you'll really see an outstanding and amazing story. You just have to be patient. \\n\\n\r\n_______Art_____________(8/10)\\n\r\nThe art is really good, especially the fights are very well drawn. The characters are also looking beautiful, but there's of course things that could have been done better.\\n\\n\\n\r\n________Sound____________(10/10)\\n\r\nThe voice actors are all  very well fitted for their roles. Renton's voice may be very annoying, but once you get used to it, you'll se how he's voice actually are perfect. \\n\r\nThe Openings and Endings are all great and matches the feelings of the show.\\n\r\nThe music in Eureka Seven is composed by Sato Naoki. I really love the music and the OST is amazing! They're all unique and I recommend listening to them. It was actually the music that made me watch this anime. The music is so beautiful that it may give you goosebumps ore make you cry. And it's not just classical music in this shows, but alot of trance/electronic music by other people.\\n\\n\r\n__________Characters____________(9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in Eureka Seven are all outstanding with their own struggels and fears. They all develop alot throughtout the series, especially Renton does. He changes from being an annoying little boy to a cute, understanding young man. The relationships between especially and Anemone and Dominic is remarkable. This show has alot of romance, and many of the characters fall in love.\\n\\n\r\n______________Enjoyment____________(8/10)\\n\r\nI did really enjoy this show. It's problem is the many episodes before the plot actually starts. Some of the first episodes were like fillers for me. If you don't have the patience, there is a chance you may not see this show. But anyways, don't give up! When the story finally begins, it's great! And even if you don't have an interest in mecha or romance, don't worry! There will be surely something interesting for you in this show.\\n\\n\r\n___________Overall_______________(10/10)\\n\r\nIf I look away from the \"fillers\" in the beginning, this show is the best. Many of the sad things in Eureka Seven is very alike things happening in our own world. I loved it because of it's unique story and relations with our own world. This show has everything; comedy, romance, action,psychological\\n\r\nstuff , drama.... It is definetely one of the most amazing animes ever made^___^\\n\\n\r\n(I'm not an English speaker, and I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes. I hope this review is understandable and helpful)",

            "content": "Eureka Seven\r\nOnce upon a time, there lived a young boy who knew nothing of his past yet had a dream to become the best lifter of all time. One day that boy would come face-to-face with his hero and learn that his idols were not the fantastic heroes he had thought them to be. But this anime is about more than that. Much more. This anime is about a boy and a girl who grow up in a world of adversity and grow through conflict and strife, given no option but to push forward and become greater than they had ever imagined.\r\nThe story follows Reneton,a young boy who is being raised by his grandfather because his father died long, long ago. Reneton's father was the hero of the world some time ago, and Reneton was judged because of it. Yet, Reneton was a normal boy trying to follow his dreams and live HIS life. One day, he got an opportunity to leave him home that would change his life forever, and for good reason. He was following a cute girl that he wanted to know better, plus his favorite idol and lifter, Holland, was involved. What better reason to leave than that?\\n\\n\r\nThe story elements in the show build up at a very slow pace. Slow enough that you have a chance to learn about and understand the backgrounds of almost EVERY CHARACTER, and there are a lot of characters involved in this show. My favorite understanding is that of the evil villain. The viewer learns that this villain can do terrible and horrible things to humans and this world and what he strives for is justice in this life. He is able to sacrifice a life knowing that this world will be better off for it. And he takes this to dire constraints. \\n\\n\r\nBy watching this anime, you will follow through many different stories of many different characters being given different sides of the story from adults and children. Ultimately you are forced to follow along with Reneton's views, who is a young teenager, but are held down in chains by the decisions of adults at times. You will want to adventure with Reneton, but see the rationality behind the decisions of the adults and it all makes sense. Sometimes. Other times, the adults think they know what they are talking about, but are too scared to try anything else, and that's where the brave youth comes into play. Other times, even, the adults can be the brave ones in situations that the youths don't understand. You are given a mix of emotions and morals at all times.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy watching an anime packed with drama, decisions, and moral dilemmas then this will be a good anime for you. Besides, it's packed with great action and mechas if you are into that kind of thing, or even if you are not.\\n\\n\r\nLast note before the ratings, the story progressed very naturally, however at times I was confused on certain matters of the storyline. The anime does a great job of filling in the gaps very slowly, but few topics require additional analysis from the viewer to piece things together.\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\r\nStory - 10 - Beautifully pieced together, not giving too much information too quickly and always trying to fill in any gaps as the story progresses. I feel like I grew up with Reneton along the way.\\n\r\nArtwork - 10 - I'll give the artwork at 10. It is well drawn, even more so in the second part of the anime. Nothing mind blowing like today's work because this anime came out in 2005, however it was top-notch for it's time.\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 10 - Oh my! There are some seriously cool vibes in this anime, as they attempted to add a very groovy feel to the anime in many aspects. I have not come across many other anime with such a groovy feel.\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 - NO CHARACTERS ARE PERFECT. No characters are perfect in this anime and all characters show fault. We are all human after all and all make mistakes. We are constantly reminded of this through the anime. For starters, Reneton is young and naive. Eureka just doesn't understand so many things. Holland is not the captain you thought he'd be. And there's more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - Beautiful, beautiful anime. I'm glad I watched this. It is not fast paced by any means, so keep an open heart and an open mind and you might just fall into this anime as you are watching it.\\n\r\nRecommended - Yes, though you must drop all expectations of how this anime will play through and how it will end. Nothing is fast paced, and you must be prepared for a long build up and ready to enjoy each episode for what it is and nothing less.",

            "content": "Eureka 7 is one of my all-time favorite anime. I believe that if I had seen this anime when I was 14, this would be my undisputed Number 1. However, I still am glad to have seen this at 19, because I could understand the story much better than my 14 yr old self could've, as well as notice the faults therein. Nevertheless, it still captivated me and awakened the 14 yr old soul within me. \r\nI'll try to keep this spoiler-free, but no guarantees.\r\nStory- (8/10): \r\nI honestly believe that Eureka 7 had a very good story. The first few episodes may come off asslow (and sometimes confusing) for some people, but I don't think that was the case. The first few episodes in particular showed us character interactions and foreshadowing future events. The specifics of events that occurred were vague but it still all made sense. The first half of the anime did a solid job of showing character interactions, as well as some minor-to-major character developments, with each character varying in degree. The second half of the show was very narrative heavy, but it wasn't without build-up. If you pay attention to the things that they were talking about, you could actually piece together all these information and have it make sense in your head. Granted there were terms and events that they didn't specifically define, it was still relatively easy to connect the dots with other information given. The world building in the anime was great. It got me interested and intrigued. I had to pause and think about stuff from time-to-time and that was great. I don't think my 14 yr old self would've grasped the nature of the world and the events in the anime, and for that I am glad to have watched it at 19. Sure, there are still major plot holes and things that don't make sense (especially in the last two episodes), but that's where the romantic element of the show takes over.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation- (8/10): \\n\\n\r\nI came into the show not expecting a whole lot from the animation quality, but I shouldn't have doubted BONES. It LOOKS AMAZING! I love the Character Designs, the world's style, and the designs of the mechs. \\n\\n\r\nThe one character design I really love is Eureka. Some may say that her character looks bland, boring and seem like a lazy alternate version of another character but I don't see it like that. Her looks were very intriguing from the very start, and you could tell that she was different. The design helped made me feel that way. Her paleness, her emotionless expressions, her hair color- all of them screamed oddity and mystery, and that made me want to know more about her. That also helped me root for Renton. Her hair transformations throughout the series was also a great representation of the changes in her personality and interactions with others. It helped convey the things that the plot wanted you to understand.\\n\\n\r\nI also absolutely love the design for the Gekko crew members. I thought that they were all interesting and cheerful to look at!\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the mechs and the action sequences were all fantastic-looking! The Seven Swells and all the other OP things that Nirvash can do all looked AMAZING.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the criteria that most people would give Eureka 7 a perfect score.  Each OP and ED are very catchy and fitting (with exceptions of maybe the 3rd OP and 4th ED: they were catchy but not too fitting). The BGMs were especially great and fantastic. The music's influence in Eureka 7 is also very prevalent and really made for a very pleasant experience. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, about the 4th OP of the series- IT'S SO GOOD!!!\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if you haven't already, listen to Storywriter- FREAKING AMAZING!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- (9/10): \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series really did a good job of showing character interactions and development to the two main protagonist- Eureka and Renton. It also introduced us to TWO OF THE BEST CHARACTERS OF THE ENTIRE SERIES: Charles and Ray. They were supposed to be antagonist but you couldn't help rooting for them until the very end. Holland, however, was especially rough on Renton. In the second half, though, we learn why that is the case and his character gets redeemed. Whether it excuses the things he did is up to your judgement. Talho got an interesting development in the 2nd half as well. As the narrative exposition became more and more prominent, we did lose some of those character moments in the first half, most especially with the Gekkostate. Anemone and Dominic's relationship was also not as explored as I would've liked. Sure the conclusion of it was great but I wish they explored more on it. The antagonists of the show didn't feel as threatening towards the end as well. They had this mysterious aura that just goes nowhere as the show concludes. However, Eureka and Renton carried it. The show's second half focused on them and that was great. As annoying as the children were (and they were very annoying), I liked that they had some kind of closure as well. I loved the ending too, although I wish they showed us more than what we had.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- (10/10): \\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't obvious already, I absolutely loved the show! I hold a deep affection for it  to that I can see its flaws and still accept it and think that it is a part of the reason why I love it so much. I haven't seen AO yet, but I will despite the negativity around it. I also loved the movie, albeit a different thing entirely. I love Eureka and Renton's relationship, and at the end of the day that is the one thing that everyone who watched this series will remember it for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- (9.00/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo those who read this review, thank you very much.\\n\r\nThis is my third one, and I hope it was at least remotely helpful.\\n\r\nI just wanted to express my love for this show and if my passion for it made you atleast want to check out the show then that would be wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have finished this anime and maybe trying to find an anime similar to this I highly recommend Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann! It is also a very popular and very well-loved mecha show for multiple reasons! The main couple there is also absolutely adorable! They're just as lovely as Eureka and Renton! TTGL is just as good, if not better, than E7- that judgement is yours to make!\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day! :)\\n\\n",

What you need is Eureka seven.\r\nSorry for this introduction worthy of a carpet dealer, I wantedto do it.\\n\\n\r\n Now the critical :\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you notice when you look at Eureka seven, of course, is the visual aspect. The only word that fits in is \"wonderful\". Everything is extremely neat. Thanks to Kenichi Yoshida for the characters design to Shoji Kawamori for the mecha's (the Nirvash, theEnd, the vessel or the Gekko-Go are all sublime) without forgetting the scenery. Eureka seven boasts one of the best artistic directors of the decade. Bones forces, the animation as the mecha's move in the air with incredible grace. Eureka seven humiliates not only his contemporaries as for example Gundam Seed (Destiny) but in addition this series would almost put everyone on their knees even if it came out as it is today. Here we are in the \"heavyweight category\", a series that as a Stand Alone Complex still shines for years after. \\n\\n\r\nBut if Eureka seven was a pretty empty shell, I would not bother to tell you. Far from trying to hide the emptiness behind a beautiful fa\u00e7ade, the artists of Bones just wanted to create a setting worthy of their jewel. \\n\\n\r\nThe use  format of 50 episodes is brilliant. Instead of spreading unnecessarily, to scrape by repeating the same pattern as a Gundam\\n\r\nThe team made the opposite choice: because it has 50 episodes,\" we'll take the opportunity to change patterns, genres, tones. Thus we will find adventure, crazy comedy, drama, slice of life, romance, without forgetting the fighting mecha\". Instead of repeating itself, the series takes the opportunity to be rich and varied, taking the time to portray the characters with the application and the world around them. No episode is unnecessary or free. This slice of life anime is a great tool for development, characters who will gradually discover and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed lets talk about the characters .The cast is rich and colourful as in few other anime. Renton the hero, is the boy we were all a little at a time. Living his daily routine in a quiet town, he dreams of adventure and lift, this precisely \"surf\" practised by his idol Holland and his band of dissidents, the Gekko-State. The adventure will come to him when he attends the crash of the Nirvash a white and red robot and Eureka a pretty member of the Gekko-State where Renton will immediately fall in love. With it, he can join this group he so admires, even if they turn out quite different from what he imagined.\\n\\n\r\nRenton is an interesting character. Followed during the 50 episodes will help to bind him, as we see change in its relations with other characters, and their reactions towards events. We will thus see his mood change and move from its original state \"I am part of the Gekko-State because I like Eureka\" to the disappointment \"I am part of the Gekko-State because I lead a war\" and Finally, the acceptance and re-elect \"I am part of the Gekko-State because I lead a war to Eureka.\" Unlike some anime hero who finish as they started, you really see Renton evolve into an adult. A process borrowed from shonen and Gundam but really applied.\\n\\n\r\nPaired with Renton, we have Eureka. A little strange, mysterious and withdraw girl. Her relationship with Renton, far from giving me the buttons as I expected, touched me. We can say that those two are a beautiful couple. Eureka who \"adopted\" 3 children on a battlefield, give some of the most moving scenes in the series. One gradually discovers humanity and feelings behind the apparent coldness of the lady.\\n\\n\r\nBehind the star couple we found many other characters just as successful. The crew of the Gekko-Go is a collection of colourful individuals with high capital sympathy. I think especially of a another couple, Holland and Talho. Idol of Renton, Holland proves to be a tortured man, a difficult and complex character . Talho, the charm of the series, is a much more worked than a  bimbo at first glance. She is essential as a \"support\"to Holland. It's different from the couple formed by Renton and Eureka, less fantasy, more realistic, but also with its share of problems. The relationship between these two couples is also very interesting.\\n\r\nOne couple remain, the most difficult and tortured,  formed by Dominic and Anemone, which are among the opponents of the Gekko-State. Here it is an unrequited love, that of Dominic for Anemone, super soldier with an unstable psyche, forced to take drugs to escape her crisis, a real psychopath in charge of theEND in conclusion.. We can only admire Dominique for his determination to take care of this girl who can not return his affection, stuck in this pitiful condition to which we sympathize. Like the main couple, their evolution is visible, well-written and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIt is difficult to talk about the story without spreading in spoil, but it is very rich. One of the prowess of Eureka seven was finally to resolve the question that arose since 1996 \" how to make Gundam / Macross while integrating the legacy of Evangelion?\" Thus the series will mix these influences while affirming its difference. Eureka seven is one of those series that are part of a tradition while adding a stone to the edifice. The story told here is rich, sometimes surprising, varied, rich in emotion, action and surprises. It's both intelligent and honest, never taking the viewer for a fool while launching the pseudo-philosophical crap to give the illusion of depth. It is a story of adventure and love, nothing more, nothing less, but that's a lot, because it is well done. The idealism of a little blue flower that runs through the series will perhaps make some cringe, but if you love it or you ignore that, it's a wonderful world that awaits you. Because it's one of the best anime of the 2000s. Do not wait. Get it by your hands, like Holland would say.",

            "content": "Nostalgia is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about Eureka Seven.  I was about 17 when this Anime first dropped, and I had watched bits and pieces of it for about a year, never quite devoting myself enough to it until now.  It took me about two months on and off to finish this series, but its 50 episodes flew by before I knew what had hit me.  An enjoyable storyline with a great cast of characters offers Eureka Seven to be a great Anime for virtually any fan to enjoy.\r\nI feel like the world of Eureka Sevenwas so vast and complex that it actually had to take the full 50 episodes to pace its story correctly.  It actually took me a good amount of time to fully grasp the entirety of the series.  Viewers follow the main protagonist, Renton Thurston, son of Adroc Thurston\u2026 the so-called savior of the human race.  Renton resides at home with his grandfather and leads a relatively normal life in the land of Kanan.  Normal is quite relative however, as there are quite a bit of flying airships and mech-style units known as LFO\u2019s and mysterious surf-like \u201cwaves\u201d in the air called \u201ctrapars\u201d that these LFOs use to fly.  Trapars are even used for recreational purposes, like surfers of our world would use to shred sweet blue rip currents. \\n\\n\r\nRenton quickly meets up with members of Gekkostate, a renegade group of vigilantes hell bent on opposing the military all the while producing an underground magazine, Ray=Out, basically showing how cool they are and what they stand for.  He\u2019s initially a nuisance to the group, but quickly demonstrates his usefulness in \u201cNirvash\u201d, an almost self-aware LFO piloted by the mysterious Eureka.  Throughout his time aboard Gekkostate, Renton discovers the secrets of the scub coral (the sentient beings sharing the planet with humans), Eureka, the military\u2019s real intentions as well as a lot about himself.\\n\\n\r\nI like the intricacies of the storyline in this series; every point of interest was carefully derived and clearly executed.  The introduction of religious ideals in the Vodarac and the struggle between right and wrong really made it feel closer to real life.   I felt like foreshadowing and hint-dropping was prevalent and existed only when necessary.  There were also not too many mini-arcs, and the ones that existed provided a great deal of value and depth to the overall story.  Filler episodes, which have plagued so many of our favorite shows, are slipped in occasionally, but nothing that would cause one to press the skip button.  My favorite was the one between Dominic, the military strategist and Anemone, the crazed pilot of the military\u2019s most prestigious LFO, TheEND.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say too many bad things about Eureka Seven\u2019s story, but I did notice that I didn\u2019t binge watch it as I do with some Anime series.  I could watch maybe 3-5 episodes a day at most, but my finger didn\u2019t really itch to click on the next episode.  It\u2019s a good anime to watch on the side, considering it took me over a month to finish it.  All in all, I really enjoyed the story and it is one I will remember for a long time to come.\\n\\n\r\nSo many good things to say here regarding the cast in Eureka Seven.  Few times with any series can I say that such a large character-base can be so well personalized and explained in fewer than 100 episodes.  Finally we have a younger protagonist that I didn\u2019t absolutely hate.  Renton acts like a real 14 year old boy would, ambitious but scared\u2026 in his most courageous moments he is still vulnerable.  Most of all, there are no harem-y aspects to this entire show.  And I love it.  I understand some sort of fan service is expected in Anime, but Eureka Seven did not disappoint or go too far.  Eureka, Renton\u2019s main love interest and pillar of the entire story is such a complex character.  Her transition from a stone-faced robot to a loving, caring and emotional human being :) is pretty incredible.  Her relationship with Renton is pretty spot on for what I\u2019d expect from children his age and is innocent.  She can seem to many to be a stale, overused character type, but I feel she had enough originality to fit the bill.  The children that she takes care of can get annoying at times, and their premise is a bit odd\u2026 but even I grew to like them as side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe crew of the Gekkostate were the strongest and most likable characters in the entire show to me.  Holland, the leader of Gekkostate was a fantastic character.  You were always wondering what he was truly thinking on the inside, despite his hard-headed attitude on the outside.  He always had hidden intentions for the job at hand, even if he was the only one that knew about it.  His girlfriend, Talho provided a small bit of fan service with her skimpy outfits but piloted the crew\u2019s ship while keeping Holland himself in line.  The rest of the crew all formed a great team together and were all multi-dimensional.  This supporting cast reminded me a lot of \u201cGurren Lagann\u201d in the way they all meshed together so well.\\n\\n\r\nEven the antagonistic military characters were interesting.  Colonel Dewey is cunning and mischievous, and seemingly impossible to defeat.  His enlistment of children to combat Gekkostate and the scub coral shows his deviousness to the full extent.  Dominic was most likely my favorite character in the show\u2026 a young, successful military brat whose own morality is tested as Colonel Dewey threatens to conduct the most dastardly of tasks.  There are a few episodes which feature him as the lead and really convey his personality and goals well.  His interactions with Anemone, who he is the keeper of, are emotionally complex and entertaining.  The mini-arc characters Ray and Charles Beams were also some of my favorites, due to their unrelenting devotion to duty and to each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe character base is what kept me coming back to this show, and is possibly one of the most well-rounded and best explained I\u2019ve ever seen in Anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe artists in Eureka Seven did a good job at illustrating the beautiful world the story was set in.  Obviously the animation is 10 years outdated, but I didn\u2019t see anything that looked tacky or outdated in nature unlike some shows made in the early 2000\u2019s.  The character designs were all pretty believable, with the exception of the Gekko\u2019s owner (what was up with that nose!?)  I really liked the design of the LFOs, and they brought me back to my small Mobile Suit Gundam obsession from late high school.  I really enjoyed the first two openings as well the third ending.  The last opening was really odd how they incorporated \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d within it, but I guess it was just me.  The show\u2019s music wasn\u2019t too repetitive, and I liked some of the techno/dance music they played over the radio \uf04a\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, Eureka Seven is a fine Anime, and one I would recommend to most anyone.  I would especially recommend it to those who are fans of mechs and Gundam-Style shows.  Some of the fight scenes are pretty top-notch and I actually re-watched a few of them.  If you can wrap your head around the world and complex story, you will find a heart-warming story of a great cast of characters fighting for what\u2019s right in the world.  It\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t receive the proper sequel, Eureka Seven AO disappointed many fans of the show.  Thank you for reading this review, and enjoy the show!",

            "content": "Length: 50 episodes\r\nDemographic: Shounen\r\nGenre: Sci-fi, Adventure, Mecha, Romance\r\nPlot Synopsis\r\n\"Giant robots that surf in the sky on things called Transparent Light Particles\"\r\n     Sure the premise to Eureka Seven is quite sketchy... but don't let yourself be fooled... This is probably the best anime released this decade.\r\n    The storyline takes place 10,000 years in the future, after humanity has made a mass exodus into space. At the start of the series, we see that humanity has settled down onto what is called \"The Promised Land\".\r\n     The story is of Renton Thurston, a 14 y.o. \"punk\" who'slooking for a life bigger then the one he has. He dreams of joining the Gekkostate, a group of counterculture outlaws, and pilot an LFO, the large robots described above. He gets his oppurtuinity when the typeZERO LFO, nicknamed the &quot;Nirvash&quot; crash lands at his grandfather's garage. Piloting it is Eureka, a young emotionless girl, with a blood stained past. But to Renton, she is the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. Soon after, Renton gets his chance to join the Gekkostate. However, he soon learns that the life he reads about, isn't actuality. Renton's journeys are solely fueled by his crush on Eureka... however these feelings quickly become something more...\\n\\n\r\nPersonal opinion\\n\r\n     After watching the first 5 episodes, I felt i was watching a happier version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Then by episode 10, it had eerie similarities to Fullmetal Alchemist. These similarities soon end and Eureka Seven takes off.\\n\r\n     The first thing I did when I heard about this anime was read it's Wikipedia entry. Unfortunately it wasn't detailed at all. Following that I decided to watch the openings for the show and make out what i could of the plot. The first opening was enough to convince me to watch it. From battle scenes to the grand setting, it's an ideal opening for a series like it. I watched the first episode and was hooked right then. I'd never had watched a show that had gripped me that much from that early on. And it only got better.\\n\r\n     A common complaint I got was that it takes too long for the main plot to start (all the way to episode 26), and that the first half of the series moves too slow. While i can see the former... it didn't affect me at all. In my personal opinion, the first half of the series, although slower then the remaining season, was still quite entertaining. Had the series ended there I would've given it decent reviews (3.5 ish). However upon entering the second half... the pacing picks up and the plot becomes much darker. By the final 10 episodes... Eureka Seven becomes legendary.\\n\\n\r\n     As a few words of warning, romance is a core theme in the series... so if you're not into lovestories... then this isn't the anime for you. Also, there aren't great extended battles, however... whatever battles there are, are quite amazing. They aren't disorienting (like in NGE and Blood+), but they are still quite grand. Eureka Seven is unique in this way; having a central romantic theme in an action based anime. At times it felt more like a shoujo (animes aimed at girls... has more romance, ie Sailor Moon) then a shounen (animes aimed at boys... has more action, ie Bleach, Naruto). An easy of putting this... Shoujo meets Shounen and Eureka Seven is the result.\\n\r\n     Somewhere between the romance between Renton and Eureka, the dark and amazing storyline, and brilliant animations... i realized that Eureka Seven is the best and most beautiful anime i've seen thus far.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Neon Genesis Evangelion\\n\r\n- Fullmetal Alchemist\\n\r\n- D.N.Angel",

            "content": "I was very cautious about starting Eureka Seven because I generally don't like original anime based in the futuristic apocalyptic setting with the inclusion of giant robots and the potential end of the world looming. This includes shows like neon genesis evangelion and guilty crown (there were giant robots in it and voids are even more ridiculous) just to name a few. Both shows that while enjoyable at rare instances, spent the majority of their running time focusing on minor details and never explaining in depth about anything that was going on behind the scenes, hoping that if it sounded vague enough, it could bemysterious and thought provoking, instead of just pretentious and lazy writing. This doesn't mean that there wasn't any thought behind them or that only smart people could see behind the curtain of subtlety and piece everything together, but I digress. In these anime, generally nothing makes sense and stuff just happens (especially in guilty crown). However I was optimistic since it was animated by studio bones, who have yet to let me down with a series...until now.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven surprisingly has a lot of good attributes which by themselves should have made this show at least an enjoyable watch. However it was all butchered by the directing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation for this series was pretty good and at times gorgeous, however there are some very choppy action scenes and a whole bunch of awkward camera angles which at times take the viewer out of the moment. The character designs are decent as well, especially for eureka and anemone. Something else worth mentioning is that the action scenes didn't hit with much impact because they didn't want to break up the scenes of mechas fighting with character emotions, which made the fights feel bland and boring. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The ost in this show is outstanding and there are a lot of great tracks thanks to naoki sato (assassination classroom and sword of the stranger), and this might even be his best score yet...but this again is ruined by the directing since most of the time the music doesn't fit the scenes. For one thing, it never shuts up, even when a scene would be better silent, and there are times where the music completely contradicts the tone of the scene. The sound directing was done by Wakabayashi Kazuhiro (ghost in the shell, wolf's rain, seven deadly sins, sword of the stranger, and soul eater) and while he is brilliant and this is a outstanding ost, I don't think the music for the series was integrated well. I don't know if it was his fault or the directors fault, but the only themes that worked for me was the nirvash theme and the vocal OSTs. \\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs unfortunately don't fit with the show at all and were a chore to watch. I generally never skip OPs and EDs, but I ended up skipping all eight of them most of the time. Definitely the worst bones OPs and EDs that I have seen.\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the english dub (which is how I watched it) was good, nothing was cringe-worthingly bad besides for the hippie Woz, which is weird seeing that the voice acting was done by dave wittenberg who also voiced Kakashi from naruto which I liked, but his performance here was terrible. But the rest was okay, Renton, played by Johnny Young Bosch (ichigo, lelouch, etc.), was annoying at times, but I don't blame the voice acting, but the character itself, who complained a lot and was a teenager.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are like a shallow dirty pond. They have a dark past and are hard to see through, but are shallow and one dimensional as they could possibly be. Renton and Eureka are in love for no reason and the adults act like there is nothing at stake and that it is all a game, when it is clear that it isn't. Holland acts like a child, and the rest of the crew is one dimensional. And the villain is evil for stupid reasons, if you can even call them that. The only characters that aren't bad are talho, who I will call two dimensional seeing as she still doesn't feel like a character that i am supposed to care about, and Charles and Ray. Charles and Ray are the best part of this show hands down, and they should have been main characters or at least present throughout the majority of the series. They are the Isaac and Miria of this show and every moment they were on screen my undivided attention was on them. There were other characters, such as the three kids, dominic, and the rest of the crew, but they were all pretty pointless characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is the biggest weakness of the series. Since this is an original show, it doesn't have a source material with good writing to take from or bad writing to improve upon, thus it stumbles through the narrative acting like an episodic show even though it clearly isn't since it needs good characters to pull that off and it was hinting to a story that the entire show was trying to get at but failed miserably. In the end, it stuffed exposition and awkward explanations for long periods of time at random moments, especially at the end. The villains motivations and plan make no sense and things just happen with no reasoning behind them or explanations afterwords. I understand that this is a love story (although a over dramatic one) and it wants to spend time on that instead of other things, but the length of the series, 50 episodes, was more than enough for satisfactory backstories and explanations of how the world came to be. If this show was 25 episodes and focused more on the story and less on filler episodes and love drama, this could have been an amazing series. However there is a good reason it isn't: The directing. The director Kyouda Tomoki, never had experience before this. You heard me right. This was his first time directing a full length show. So that is the reason why nothing makes sense and events just happen without reason and the music doesn't flow with the scene and the characters are flat and not interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed certain episodes and I finished the show quickly, but I wouldn't watch it again and there were times that I just didn't care about the show, especially about the characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a good show with bad directing. There are so many more problems I had with this show but I don't think insulting it more would be necessary because despite the flaws, it had a lot of great elements.\\n\r\nI wanted to give this show a 7 but I gave it an 8 because of Charles and Ray.\\n\r\n8= Good and had a lot of great elements, but I wouldn't rewatch it.",

            "content": "I had been wanting to watch a good action-romance anime for a while now, and while there are lots of them that I could have chosen from, Eureka Seven caught my eye. I decided to watch this show after watching a youtube video by Gigguk about what's been the greatest thing anime has done in his eyes (or something along those lines.) In the video, he shows a clip of The two leads-Renton and Eureka-embracing. I then came on here after finding the title in the comments and found that I already had this Anime in my Plan to Watch section. 50 episodes later, andI'm glad to say that this show was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7-  The story is good for the most part. The beginning was really good at setting up the world and the characters in it well. It has its ups and downs, but it never really slows down to a sudden halt at any point. But the plot starts to get a little confusing near the end, and it kind of lost me(But I'll chalk that up to me watching the episodes late at night). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8- The art was really well done. Bones did an excellent job with animating this show. The action scenes are done really well and backgrounds were very good as well. The character designs were good but were iffy sometimes. All the characters have about the same sized eyes, which I enjoyed because they didn't look too goofy. But sometimes when the eyes would be off center at certain angles and oh boy did it stand out. But it only happened ob=nce or twice, so it didn't take away from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9- The sound design and songs were fantastic. I watched the show dubbed, and it was pretty good, making me happy to take a break from keeping my eyes glued to the bottom of the screen to read the subtitles. The music was amazing, with a lot of powerful and emotional scores, as well as softer more lighthearted scores with soft electric beats in them. The first OP and ED are my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8- The characters are really diverse and relatable. Renton and Eureka are good protagonists and develop their personalities and relationship really well throughout the series. Holland and Talho are Good secondary characters, both funny and badass, while also commanding authority when need be. The supporting cast is good and mostly all of them get a little bit of time in the spotlight. My one complaint with them, the characters seem to have major mood swings. one minute they're mad at someone or crying, the next it's all happy and the problem suddenly disappears. That's one of the real problems I had with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9- This series had me hooked. I was glad to have the feeling of wanting to continue watching, to see what would happen next. It finally helped me scratch that itch of action-romance and had characters that I really did care about. Even when I was slightly confused as to what was going on with the plot near the end, I enjoyed every minute of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven was an anime that was a heck of a ride. Although its over, this anime will have a special place in my heart...and my favorites list here on MAL.  \\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is another very well done series by BONES. E7 is a lot of things all put together in one 50-episode package from action-mecha to SOL to philosophical piece, but the true heart of this series is the developing romance and characterization between the two leads Renton and Eureka. This is the one thing that remains constant throughout the series entire run, gets developed very well and imo is the strength of the series (although Renton can get on my nerves at times). The rest of the large cast is excellently developed in particular Holland who serves as a dynamic and intriguing foil toRenton. One thing is that even with 50 episodes, we only really get the background for the main characters like Renton, Eureka, Holland and Talho but I guess that is better than the anime being too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe action and animation stand the test of time and still look great. I also like how Bones ambitiously incorporates tons of elements and themes from previous sci-fi and mecha franchises (hello EVA). The biggest weakness for the series is that there isn't a very clear overarching plot for the first half of the series and there are quite a few filler episodes dispersed throughout (even though they are enjoyable). Thus, if you don't keep at it, this is definitely not the easiest series to finish with its 50 episode length. The ending is a bit ambiguous also but you can piece together what happens. The manga fleshes out what happens at the end a lot better so read that if you aren't sure.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this series does a lot more things right than wrong and is very enjoyable to watch all the way through. Just avoid Astral Ocean...\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "First impression:\r\nAccompanied by the pop-rock tunes from FLOWS, the introduction to \"Eureka 7\" has begun. Even though the melody and the text are fairly good, the animation is not the time worth it. It looks terribly humdrum.\r\nAs the audience you get thrown directly into the plot. Lots of unanswered questions turn up and you get this small idea about where the show is heading. \r\nRight after a rather weak cliffhanger, a pretty decent ending song comes out from the speakers, but with a similar animation theme like the opening, the potential is gone.\r\nBut hey, interesting girl this Eureka &ndash; let me watch more.\r\nFew episodes later&hellip;\r\nWaita minute, haven&rsquo;t I seen this before? With that been said &quot;Eureka 7&quot; starts out really slow. It feels like re-watching episode 1 again and again, lots of new questions but no answers. The plot is not getting anywhere, but the character development is interesting to follow, or can I say bothersome (Renton). Somehow I feel the design of the characters fits to their behavior, that&rsquo;s an upside. But I also feel like the male protagonist is borrowed from a shonen show like Pokemon/Naruto, really simple-minded and dense. (Don&rsquo;t remind me that &quot;Eureka 7&quot; actually is a shonen (teenager) show).\\n\r\nThe music is not getting many points either; it is a personal opinion though.\\n\r\nSo what is keeping me from dropping the show? I will say it is the other characters&rsquo; development and interactions, the themes and references throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe story revolves around Renton Thurston, the 14 years old son of Adroc Thurston, a hero who died saving the world. Renton is a fan of a renegade &lsquo;reffing/lifting&rsquo; group called Gekko State led by his idol; Holland and he is dreaming about the day he joins them. \\n\r\nA sudden meeting with the legendary mecha robot, Nirvash and its pilot, a mysterious girl called Eureka, turns out to be Rentons way to get out from the boring life of his and the adventures together with Gekko State is about to begin.\\n\r\nBut a beginning towards what and end where? The first many episodes are trivial and somehow can be considered as fillers. It is first around the 30ish episodes, the main plot starts to kick in and the questions getting answered one by one.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe character design and animation are great. You get to see various expressions and colorful backgrounds, but when it comes to battles, it is like watching animations on a blue screen. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe BGM and insert songs were not creating the atmosphere as they were supposed to. Most of the times it felt like background noise instead.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a good job with voicing the characters expressions like anger, sorrow or joy. Yet again the voice of Renton became an obstacle to fully enjoy this anime. 50 episodes with his never ending yelling are really tiresome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nRenton Thurston: A very emotional and outgoing boy with strong ideals and compassions, but on the other hand he is naive and jumps very often into conclusion/matters before understanding the whole context. \\n\r\nRenton falls in love with Eureka at first sight and as the show progress&rsquo;; it develops into a love relationship with many misunderstandings. \\n\r\nHe is driven by the hope of seeing his sister Diane again and the need of protecting Eureka.\\n\\n\r\nEureka: A mysterious female pilot of Nirvash, which she treats like a living being. To other people she can seem to be distant and awkward, plus she has trouble with communicating with others and understanding their feelings. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nThe most prevalent theme is about racial and religious tolerance and harmony. It also shows how the media can control the crowd and how easy it is to point fingers in the way to find scapegoats.\\n\r\nI mean I can only think of the recent conflict between Denmark and many Middle East countries.\\n\r\nIt is funny the environment theme also turn up, when I think about it. I mean in &quot;Eureka 7&quot; &lsquo;Kute-class Coralian&rsquo; appears when the &lsquo;Planet&rsquo; (Scub Coral) receives heavy damage and how an understanding and communication is needed to avoid any further destruction. It is almost like the global warming and CO2 discussions we have today.\\n\r\nAt last a common fairy tale theme is seen in &quot;Eureka 7&quot;. Renton Thurston sets out a grand tour by leaving his childhood home in order to search after his lost sister, to find himself and overcome all the obstacles when he protects Eureka.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is a good anime show with very good character developments. But it is tough to cut through the shadow made by the monotonous sound/music and the very slow story progress. Plus when it is a shonen show where action/battles are the highlights, it hurts to see how poorly done the action scenes are.\\n\r\nOne big positive side is the girl Eureka. I must say she is one of the candidates to get the last spot in my favorite character list.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you&hellip; \\n\r\n&hellip; are looking for an anime with very good character developments, but you must also overcome the childish attitude from Renton and the eventually frustration.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is a masterpiece plagued by flaws. What I have trouble understanding is why I enjoyed it so much despite this. On one hand, you have beautiful cinematography, a colorful cast, and a romance that makes Kirito and Asuna look like 5th graders handing each other cards on Valentine \u2019s Day. On the other, you have a profusion of plot holes, one of the worst antagonists I\u2019ve seen to date, and a very rushed conclusion. I\u2019m going to separate the good from the bad because I feel this is the best way to categorize everything. Here we go!\r\nBefore getting started, here\u2019s a brief synopsis:\r\nTheseries follows fourteen-year-old Renton Thurston, son of Adroc Thurston \u2013 a military researcher who was renowned for his efforts to protect the world. He lives in the boring town of Bellforest with his grandfather, Axel. He engages in a sport known as lifting, which is similar to surfing but with a medium known as trapar waves. He often reads ray=out magazines published by a member of the airship Gekko Go, and fantasizes about becoming a member of the infamous Gekkostate, led by Holland Novak, a former soldier of the military. By chance, a strange member happens to crash into his room \u2013 piloting the legendary Nirvash typeZERO \u2013 who goes by the name of Eureka, whom he immediately falls in love with. As the military closes in to capture Eureka, Renton\u2019s grandfather tells him to deliver his father\u2019s creation, the Amita Drive, to the Nirvash, which ends up releasing a powerful force known as the \u201cSeven Swell Phenomenon\u201d, destroying everything within its radius. Intrigued by Renton, Holland invites him to join Gekkostate, who accepts wholeheartedly only to find out that life aboard the airship isn\u2019t nearly as alluring as it seemed. Little does Renton know, this is the beginning of a journey that will change the fate of the world. Will he be able to work alongside the mysterious pilot, Eureka, and the less-than-glamorous Gekkostate? \\n\\n\r\nThe Good (aesthetics, cast, themes):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Bones studio who produced series such as Soul Eater, Darker than Black, and Fullmetal Alchemist. They did an impeccable job. Aerial combat is very fluid and each battle scene is complimented by astounding background music.  Character designs are fairly modest creating a sense of normalcy, even though the story takes place thousands of years in the future; there are no risks taken in this area with outlandish costumes, which can be very hit or miss \u2013 usually the latter. One of the most impressive feats lies in the setting. The producers clearly allocated a lot of time into creating an exceedingly detailed atmosphere with breathtaking results. \\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven features a broad collection of characters. They are all very unique and original. Their interactions with each other are enjoyable to watch and once the main protagonist, Renton, joins the fray he incites a lot of change in their behaviors. As a result, there is a hefty degree of character development in both the main and supporting cast; it is amazing to see them evolve over the course of 50 episodes, which is plenty of time to see significant growth.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is the source of most of the comic relief, a much needed sentiment since the plot can become Attack-on-Titan-esque at times. They even go as far as giving Renton an \u201cimportant\u201d mission just to publicly humiliate him on camera. He tends to be at the short end of the stick a majority of the series, which helps counter the intolerable aspects of his personality, namely his immaturity. Luckily, he has quite a few heroic moments and becomes more likable as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot touches on some very interesting themes such as the morality of war, religious persecution, and coexistence between species, but in the end it\u2019s the relationship between Renton and his significant other, Eureka, that overshadows everything else while the others are barely delved into. These two build upon their relationship starting from the first episode all the way to the end; even when they\u2019re apart they manage to strengthen their relationship through pure introspection.  They don\u2019t fall in love instantly either. In fact, it\u2019s incredibly one-sided, initially due in part to Eureka somewhat lacking primal human emotions \u2013 unfortunately, I can\u2019t expound on that without spoiling anything. Their relationship is definitely the driving force behind this anime and I enjoyed every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad (underlying plot, main antagonist, pacing): \\n\\n\r\nWhile Eureka Seven has some spectacular moments that deserve praise and that I absolutely cherished, they could not hide the undoubtedly large plot holes and poor execution of the main plot, which is a shame because there was a lot of potential. The set up within the first few episodes is vague in that it did not explain what the purpose of the vagrant group \u201cGekkostate\u201d is nor did it introduce the main antagonist, Colonel Dewey Novak, very well (more on that later). It isn\u2019t until over half way through the series that it becomes evident what they\u2019re trying to accomplish, and even then it seems to lack direction until the final arc. At one point, Renton even explicitly states that Gekkostate doesn\u2019t seem to possess a clear motive. It\u2019s obvious they are fighting the military, but why? I found myself asking that question a lot. Often times, I was more focused on the antics of the supporting cast and the Renton-Eureka love story than the main plot because of this. \\n\\n\r\nMany of the elements presented in the plot go largely unexplained as well (origins of LFOs, trapar waves, despair sickness, etc.) By the end, I had so many questions left unanswered. One in particular that really bugged me was the specifics of something known as the \u201cAgeha Plan\u201d, proposed by Renton\u2019s late father, Adroc. It supposedly describes the truth behind the coexistence between humans and \u201cscab coral\u201d, but is only lightly touched upon. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the enigma of a main antagonist. If it wasn\u2019t the aimlessness of Gekkostate that mystified me, it was Colonel Dewey Novak. There are two huge issues with him: 1) He barely shows up throughout the series; aside from a scene of him smirking here and there, he isn\u2019t important until the final arc. 2) His motives lack even more direction than Gekkostate\u2019s; I wish I could say more without spoiling anything, but let me just say there is almost no basis for his actions or claims. The supporting antagonists are far more viable and interesting. He proved to be quite an underwhelming antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is good until the last few episodes. I wish they would have stretched out the conclusion into two or three more episodes because a lot happens \u2013 emphasis on \u201ca lot\u201d. The buildup happened so quickly I barely had time to process everything that had just occurred, which made me feel slightly less than satisfied with the conclusion. There were some loose ends along with the unexplained elements that would have made for a much better ending had they been clarified. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also one of the most random, pointless filler episodes I\u2019ve ever seen. Episode 39 involves them playing soccer. Yes, soccer. In amidst all of the chaos, one of the crew members says something along the lines of, \u201cHey guys! I know we\u2019re being chased by the military and the world is in danger, but let\u2019s engage in a friendly game of soccer! OHOHOHO!\u201d No reason behind it, or at least one that\u2019s explained. It was definitely a surprise when it came up and I definitely could have lived without it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nTo love this anime, you\u2019re going to have to overlook the main plot. It\u2019s just stable enough to keep you engaged, but it will most likely come second to romance. If you\u2019re looking for a complex and well thought out plot, you won\u2019t be impressed with Eureka Seven. However, if you\u2019re interested in an action-packed adventure with a romantic plot, this anime may be for you. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I had a lot of complaints, I couldn\u2019t help but adore this anime. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time and I would definitely watch it again. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped! Feedback is appreciated (:\\n",

So after i finished watching episode 50 i spent hours trying to think about the ending of the anime it was something I had never done before, I got on my social networking websites and recommended this to all of my friends. Now that might now sound like much but this anime was truly something else. I came into this anime knowing that it was popular and i hadn't watched it because it had 50 episodes and i heard bad reviews about AO( Sequel to Eureka Seven) I was blown away completely by this anime. It came out in 2006 but the graphics still were nothing to make a joke of. The character development was amazing and had you sitting on the edge of your seat from episode 1 The only thing that took this anime from a 10/10 to a 9.5/10 was the ending. It leaves a lot of things up to the individual and i don't like to be left guessing. That's all for my first review ever and hope it wasn't too messy.",

            "content": "The trials of adolescence is never easy, and the prospect of love in the horizon may lead to some questionable choices that can stain the future. But can those choices be reversed, or would we just have to deal with the consequences? Eureka Seven is a show that is in the vein of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann due to its association with mechs and psychology. However, it delves much more into the psychology of all of its characters compared to Gurren Lagann, and does not suffer from dissociated references and abstracted plot such as Evangelion. In my opinion, Eureka Seven strikesthe perfect balance between the two, combining the portrayal of adolescence with the themes of love and conflict, all while saving the world.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9/10\\n\r\nEureka Seven's plot is very well-written, leaving almost no plot holes for people to examine or to criticize. The story comes together nicely in the end, and it has classic points of climax and rising action, even in the middle of the show. Although the falling action, which is only detailed in the ending credits of the last episode, is quite abrupt and brief, it does bring about somewhat a sense of conclusion, that the world is safe and everyone is okay. The climaxes, however, are something this show excels at, as each season of roughly 12 episodes has fluctuations in the plot that keeps the viewer in anticipation of the next episode. The rising action, however, is slightly poor, often struggling to catch up with the rapidly advancing climaxes and often playing catch-up even after. Overall, however, the story is very well written.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing too spectacular here, although for a show made in 2005, it does have some fairly impressive visuals and character designs. The art is crisp and clear, although, being from 2005, it obviously doesn't have the modern type of hair physics or billowing clothes that technology now offers. The opening were also enjoyable, with Taiyou no Mannaka he by Bivattchee being my personal favorite. The endings were slightly forgettable, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nIf nothing else, Eureka Seven is a character-driven story, and it fully explores each character's motivations and background in detail in as little time as possible, making them feel real and enjoyable, sometimes even painful, to watch. Some types of stock characters are present, but stereotypes quickly get blasted away, thus the character concepts feel like fresh air. Though Eureka and Renton, the protagonists, do develop the most through the show, side characters such as Holland, Talho, and even Moondoggie have a wonderfully new feel to them by the end of the show. If nothing else, Eureka Seven absolutely nails the formula for wonderful character development and writing, resulting in characters that truly mimic real life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nI do admit, the first and second season really pissed me off. But I guess that was the goal of the show in the first place, and they did a wonderful job of accomplishing that goal. By the end, I was thoroughly engrossed with the plot and the characters, while, admittedly, at the beginning, I was a bit lost and even thought about dropping the show. Nevertheless, the little hiccup in the beginning, when everything seemed so pathetic for Renton and how he wallowed in his own self-pity, does prevent the score from being a full 10.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven delivers on aspects that previous, and even future, shows of the same genre do not. Wonderfully real characters, coupled with an entrancing story that highlights the both the positive and negative side of human nature, coupled with a good OST and great art direction, leads to a show that unites the best elements of a show into one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "I first watched Eureka Seven when it premiered on Adult Swim in 2006.  As I am writing this, we are on the verge of 2017.\r\nI still think about it all the time.\r\nSome shows might have a bit better art or a slightly more original story, but nowhere have I found a package nearly as complete as the one that Eureka Seven presents to us.\r\nAs with any great show, its greatest strength lies in its characters.  Front and center is the protagonist, Renton Thurston, a bored youth, the son of a scientist who apparently saved the world and abandoned Renton in the process.His prayers for excitement are answered when a representative from his heroes, the rogue military unit Gekkostate, comes crashing in on his house looking for something that his father invented.  That representative's name is Eureka, and she instantly becomes Renton's raison d'etre. The show is mainly about Renton and Eureka's journey together, but alongside them come an absolutely stellar cast of characters, good and evil.  Fans of the show come to love all of them (yes, even the kids).  I've watched and re-watched some great shows. Even with my favorites, I tend to only end up remembering the one or two main characters: the rest are blurred faces in my memory.  However, to this day, 5 or more years since I've watched an episode, I still remember essentially the entire cast of the show, from the Gekkostate members to the one-offs.  It's good, folks.  Renton frequently gets maligned for being \"whiny\", but it's a stupid criticism.  At the very beginning, he has the whininess of a dreamy, naive teenager who longs for the grass on the other side, but as you'll see, this gets squeezed out of him pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nNext stop: the music. The creators of Eureka Seven were huge music geeks. The show is absolutely littered with all kinds of musical references, particularly to 80's house and acid. I caught very few of them when I first watched the show, but as I got older, I'd randomly stumble upon an amazing track, look at the artist name, and realize, \"Shit, that was another reference?!\".  Over and over. Just last week I had another one of these revelations.  My point is that the creators knew their music, and it shows.  It definitely shows.  E7's soundtrack is only rivaled by FLCL's, in my opinion.  From the more standard fare of the OP's and ED's, to the classical soundtrack by Naoki Sato, to the squelching tracks ripped out of an 80's club and dragged through '00s Japan: everything is stellar. Episode 35, Astral Apache, features one of the coolest uses of music that I've ever seen in a visual medium.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the story.  It's epic. It's romantic, it's exciting, sad, moving. It's also deep. Pretty much everyone after finishing Evangelion will immediately go online to figure out WTF just happened, yet I feel that E7 frequently isn't given the same respect, though it deserves it.  That's not to say that it is at the same level of mindfuck as Eva; in fact, I think one of E7's strengths over its spiritual mother is that because of its longer length, it develops the story in a more clear and understandable manner.  However, it is still definitely complex, and it took me years of working it out with others on a forum before I felt I had a sufficient grasp on the intricacies of the series. I'd recommend doing the same and finding answers to your questions once you finish.  But having said that, ultimately the centerpiece of the show is the relationship between Eureka and Renton, which needs no explanation and is more than satisfactory for many.  I took a point off for story only because, as I said, this show clearly finds a spiritual mother in Evangelion, so it isn't 100% original.  That is not at all to say that E7 is an Eva \"clone\", though; even the archetypes that E7 borrows (most notably Rei in the form of Eureka) are HEAVILY altered.  It will be clear after the first few episodes, particularly after meeting Maurice, Maeter, and Linck, that Eureka is NOT Rei.  Even with the Eva homage, Eureka Seven's story is one of the most original and well-crafted that I have seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the art and animation.  I've seen Bebop, I've seen Samurai Champloo, and in terms of sheer cool, Eureka Seven right is up there with them. A lot of this comes from the music, but it comes just as much from the art.  The character designs are unique and creative, commonly echoing the same rave influences that run throughout the show. I don't think I could have previously pictured what a group of rebel ex-military surf bums would look like, but the Gekkostate characters nail it for me. Throughout the show, we're able to see some fantastic landscapes and cities, with more unique cultures and flavors.  The transforming mech designs are also top-notch.  The show might shine most when we see the glorious sport of lifting in action: the literal surfing in the sky on top of Transparent Light Particles, or \"trapars\", using a board called a \"ref board\".  Lifting was mindblowingly cool when I was thirteen, and it's still cool today. In this world, not only do people lift, but the mecha do as well.  Combat happens mostly in the sky, at high speed, with heaps of acrobatics.  For the most part, the show is extremely well animated, which makes these sequences gorgeous to behold. All in all, visually, Eureka Seven is a treat.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch the show? Probably. It's over ten years old now and it still holds up extremely well.  I firmly believe that it deserves classic status and is not nearly as popular as it could or should be.  But I'll be more clear on which audiences I think will and will not enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven can be approached in many different ways, but above all, I think it should be looked at as a dramatic romance. People looking for more straight action, or a more comedic romance, might want to avoid E7.  Also, the romance is very sweet, possibly too sweet for older, more hardened otaku.  That's why this one goes out to the shounen.  If you are 13, 14, 15, 16, and you have big dreams and you're a romantic, then this is absolutely, 100% the show for you. I'm guessing it will be as memorable for you as it was for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The story of a boy who wanted to grow up surfing like his idol, who then became a man and went across the world for his family.\r\nFrom the very beginning the story puts you into a sense of episodic learning, much the same way as someone growing up would experience. It does it in such a way that you can tag right along as Renton slowly finds himself in the world around him. That's not to say however, that the growing is limited to just the protagonist. The scale of the message conveyed about learning and changing is truly breath taking, suggesting that no one,at any age quits actually growing as a person. That growth is stemmed from both hardship and hope, and from making the conscious decision to fight for what you believe in, your place, or even for who you love. Most of all, acknowledging that happiness isn't something that can be experienced all the time, but is something that you carry around with you, even in little doses, everyday. To live in a paradise, is to not truly experience what the world has to offer, as life will seemingly pass you by if you did.\\n\\n\r\nThe character progression in Eureka Seven is phenomenal, slowly spoon fed as everyone interacts and finds their place in the puzzle of life. The last couple episodes make you look back on even the smaller details to have little moments of realization about what the writers were going for, both at the time, and then farther down the line with the bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nSound and art were stunning. Each piece of music that came on gave me goose bumps, as the score fit so hand in hand with the scenes being shown. On top of that, everything was drawn beautifully, from the crescendo of colours we get during battle, even down to simple expressions as the characters interacted with each other.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Eureka Seven yet, this is an amazing watch. All 50 episodes offer a little something that you can take and think about.",

            "content": "Let's just get straight to the point.\r\nPlot 4/10 \r\nEureka 7 is a mecha show about a boy called Renton, who has a chance encounter with a girl named Eureka, stuff happens and thus begins their \"adventurous love story.\" The story shifts focus so many time throughout the show that people just stop caring. At first it's about Renton's desire to join the military and follow his father's footsteps and become humanity's saviour. Then it's about this religious cult who were oppressed. Then it's about this imbecile guy trying to take over the world. And finally it's about inter dimensional beings, a library purgatory, saving theearth from this interstellar creature who has taken over earth. There are many elements of the plot that are introduced but are never resolved.\\n\r\nFor example, the show was delving deep into the question why are the mechs shaped like humans, and that was a really intriguing plot point but it's forgotten as quickly as it was introduced.  \\n\\n\r\nWe know very few things about the world of Eureka 7. There are these mysterious occurrences called \"trapar waves\" but we never get around to discussing how they are created and why people can surf on them like they can on regular water. The story goes full on Evangelion at some points, and frankly those 2 or 3 episodes were the only ones that had any semblance of good writing in it. The world building is just bad. We don't know what happened to earth until the third last episode. At the end of the show our main cast has to fulfill a mission and they are transported underground which looks just like earth but we don't get any logical explanation as to what caused that. Sure we do get a half assed narration as to why earth became a barren wasteland but why the underground looked just like earth is never touched upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself doesn't know what it wants to do. The initial 17 episodes were boring and banal, but at the end of episode 20 or so you get a scintilla of hope that this show just might be good, but it's cruelly snatched away from us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 is praised for its characters and \"romance\" if for nothing else, but that's just empty praise. The characters act like cardboard cutouts, there is no sense of depth to them with the exception of a few. Holland, the haughty captain of the ship gecko is angry at Renton all the time, because apparently Eureka like Renton more than she likes him. Our main couple Eureka and Renton just need to have some drama between them. Renton, the most irksome character in the show, is also our protagonist, unfortunately. Characters start beef for no apparent reason, get angry at each other for the sake of drama etc. Renton didn't know his father very well so he jumps at every opportunity that could give him more insight into the life of his late father. People tell him about his father, he listens calmly; Eureka says she knows his father, he goes ape sh*t. Just for the sake of some awful dramatic moment. He is 14 and is stupid enough to take a girl on life support out of the hospital to \"take her to a better hospital\" knowing that she was from a rebellion group and no hospital would take in a terrorist, but he does it anyway and the girl dies. You might think this would've changed him as a character and made him more scrupulous, but he just forgets about it and does more stupid stuff. I was ready to give up on the show when he purposefully broke his arm using a rock so Eureka wouldn't be the only one who is different. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Eureka, she has 3 children; kids whose parents she killed in front of them and to rectify her mistake takes them in as her own. The kids show no sign of rebellion towards the girl who killed their parents, they warm up to her instantly. Sparks do fly (between her and the oldest of the kids she rescued), and such an heavy issue is resolved without them even talking about it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother couple worth mentioning is Holland and Talho. Some stuff happened to them in the past, of which only glimpses are shown, and apparently Holland runs away from his problems. Let's talk about a normal day in Holland's life inside the Geko ship:\\n\r\n1. Wake up \\n\r\n2. Be a douche to Renton\\n\r\n3. Occasionally hit Renton\\n\r\n4. Get hit by Talho for hitting Renton\\n\r\n5. Go a secluded place\\n\r\n6. Talho arrives and says - \"Don't run away\"\\n\r\n7. Holland - \"I'm not running away\"\\n\r\n8. Go to sleep\\n\r\n9. Repeat\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the members of the Geko are plain forgettable. They kill off the only two interesting characters in the show in the most stupid conflict ever. Conflict that could've been resolved with a simple chat. Characters abstain themselves from interaction, are clandestine about their feelings, accentuate their own problems just to create some misunderstanding which in turn gives birth to melodrama. The villain is just horrible. He had multiple occasions to kill the good guys and achieve his superflous goal but chooses to take the \"what can they do to me\" path. \\n\\n\r\nAt first Eureka's kids didn't like Renton for some reason but they accepted him at the middle of the series, but at the end conflict arises for no reason whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good and the art is fantastic. The mech and ship designs are awesome and the fights, though largely unimportant, are very well choreographed and executed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nIt did its job of creating a cacophony of noises and forgettable pieces with the exception of the first opening and an insert song.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nEhhhh...\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 is part wannabe Evangelion and part wannabe Gundam. The plot is basically non existent until the last 15 or so episodes and the pay off is so disappointing. The characters are annoying and the only redeeming quality about this show are Ray and Charles. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Reviewing longer shows is always hard for me. Over 50 episodes, it's impossible to consistently be a 10/10 experience, it will have low points, but at the same time, it's extremely impressive to get me to keep watching for 18+ hours. To do that, you gotta do something right, or in this case, a lot of somethings. There's not any one thing I can point to to explain why I liked this show, it's the collaborative effort of the characters, plot, setting, presentation, and soundtrack. If I had to pick one thing to focus on though, it'd be the setting.\r\nEureka Seven takes place in afuturistic world where people are extremely environmentally conscious about polluting the air, but people, as well as large combat mechs, are still able to fly around by surfing through the sky on invisible \"trapar\" waves. In this world, the government, run entirely by three mysterious sages, has achieved complete control of the planet following a global civil war, and is suppressing various groups while withholding information from the masses as a whole. What's so brilliant about all of that, is that none of it is explained in a boring exposition dump, we learn it all through watching the characters live in the world. Later in the series, some more complicated plot elements get introduced that do need a bit more deliberate of an explanation, but by that point, it's earned it through making you invested in the plot and characters enough that you care about finding the answers.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they're what really bring the show's setting to life. Most of the series is shown from the perspective of the Gekkostate, a group of resistance fighters...that also happen to run a lifting (what they call surfing on trapar waves) magazine. This weird duality is what makes the characters feel real, pretty much every single person is a soldier that has fought and killed people, and they all feel the weight of that in their own way, but at one point near the climax of the story, they stop for an episode and play a random game of soccer, and it feels totally normal! In fact, it ended up being one of my favorite episodes! \\n\\n\r\nWe see this best with the main character. He starts out a stupid, love struck 14 year old, then he turns into a legitimately traumatized and broken 14 year old, then he turns into...Renton. By the end of the series, he's still really stupid (by this point he's 16, but that's only mildly better), and he's still hurt from all the crazy stuff that's happened to him, but he finds it within himself to keep fighting to protect the new family he's built for himself. If I had to pick one thing I didn't like about the show, it'd be that they did too good of a job representing 14 year old boys, I cringed more than once due to him saying the exact wrong thing, but that's a pretty personal complaint because I'm pretty sure I was exactly the same way at that age, I've just been trying my best to forget about it, and looking back, his immaturity was always turned into a payoff down the road.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be remiss if I ignored the animation, sound effects, and music though. Despite being the aforementioned 18+ hours, there was never a time I felt they really skimped on the animation. They kept it simple when they could, but the visual presentation of lifting was just cool to watch, and when they wanted to hit you with a major story beat, they didn't pull their punches with some really nice color design. It's also one of those shows I can totally see myself listening to the soundtrack just for fun in the future, I never once skipped the OP or ED, and the background music was the final piece for putting together the unique feel of the show, in combination with the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people call this show one of their all time favorites. I'm not going to go that far, maybe it would be if I'd seen it when I was younger, but now all I'll say is that it was a fun show that I thought was well worth my time, and really, what more can I ask for?",

Each episode was loaded with comedy, action, and romance.\r\nART (10)\r\nNot much that can be complained about. The art is good and has never stopped looking good. The character and mecha designs are memeorable.\r\nSOUND (10)\r\nFantastic soundtrack with great mood setters and inserts songs. The Openings and Endings are also good and never dissapoint or get old.\r\nCHARACTER (10)\r\nA likeable male lead who is ACTUALLY normal instead of justbeing called normal but having a not-so-common personality. Renton's actions are ones the viewer could see themself doing whether good or bad. He is completely relatable. Eureka isn't emotionless and goes through just as much development as Renton. The rest of the cast is involved in the story and actually worth caring for.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10)\\n\r\nNever got boring, fun to rewatch, this show will make you feel good.\\n\\n\r\nOVERRALL (10)\\n\r\nIt's a masterpiece and totally not overrated.

            "content": "Eureka Seven is a science fiction romance mecha drama that tingles the heart and soul of a viewer's emotions. Studio Bones' success with Fullmetal Alchemist demonstrates their ability to tell a compelling story with intense themes and plot devices. The writers make Eureka Seven a classic through the use of Renton and Eureka's unique relationship. While the supporting characters help to distinguish the importance of the story's background and Renton's longing for Eureka, anime fans become more entangled in wanting to see more of the cute relationship that unfolds throughout the series. At first the viewer could become confused when trying to focus on Renton'semotions, while trying to keep track of the overall plot. The episode layout, for episodes 4-20, focuses on the crew's journey in maintaining their lifestyles and the harshness of reality. But the show's progression smoothes out the rough edges in the beginning once a climactic moment occurs between Renton and Eureka in the episode 25 plus range. The physical, emotional, and spiritual transformation of the characters exemplify this series' evolving narrative techniques that makes this show a marvel to behold. I really recommend blu ray, the animation is pure eye candy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe television series visuals through the animation sequences are top-notch. The intricate details of the Nirvash, the Scub Corals, and Eureka and Renton's growth over the show reinforces the passion put into this stunning anime series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise, the show emphasizes on cuing in on the dramatic moments with orchestral instruments that yanks at the viewers' hearts. The show's usage of multiple opening and ending themes demonstrates the change and development of the characters and the show's story.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifty episode series relays the importance of communication and connectivity between two races that can end conflicts by just listening to one another. The movie of eureka seven which recaps on the show's finer points, the journey to soar into the sky and become both apart of the world and a hero is a dream that everyone wants to have. Seriously i highly recommend this show, its a pure masterpiece in every sense of the word.",

            "content": "I began Eureka Seven with moderately high expectations based on a close friend's recommendation. After watching more than a fifth of the show I have dropped it. I found the plot and characterization lacking. The animation is extremely good and the soundtrack is incredibly well done.\r\nPlot-\r\n-Pacing is poor at best, after 1/5 of the season all we know is that the  Gekkostate  is ex-military (they did bad things), Renton loves Eureka, and the military has brought back a talented officer.\r\n-The show seems to be more concerned with riding trapars and immaterial interpersonal relationships than any plot advancement.\r\n-Includes fairly stereotypical plot devices such as:ex-military rebels, OP rebels, mysterious girl, rebel leader with a troubled past, etc. (I an not saying that a show needs to be entirely original to be \"good\", but that this show seems to mostly unoriginal, in that it brings few new experiences and therefore is not an easily justified use of time)\\n\r\n-pacing, lack of original devices\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization-\\n\r\n-Voice acting is pretty good, but the lines are mediocre\\n\r\n-Renton is annoying; he is supposed to be ~14 but acts more like the children than anything else (I understand it is has a coming of age theme, but that should be Renton going from teen to adult, not child to teen)\\n\r\n-Eureka seems to be the stereotypical mysterious girl that is really good at X (again not saying that type of character is bad in and of itself, only that there is little or no explanation or variation on the theme)\\n\r\n-Holland is a pretty cool guy but my sympathy for him waned very quickly, he seems intelligent but acts impetuously with no explanations provided (he is almost as childish as Renton sometimes)\\n\r\n-Many of the less important members of the Gekkostate are very interesting, I believe that is the case because they are departures from stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have failed to enjoy the show enough to continue to watch it. The plot is paced so poorly that after more than 1/5 of the show I still seem to be watching exposition; the story has not been adequately framed in 11 episodes. In fact, the only major plot points are these: Renton's family had the Omata drive, Renton goes off with the Gekko State, Renton loves Eureka, the Gekko State has a troubled (ex-military) past, and Eureka is mysterious. Unfortunately, only around half of the episodes advance the plot at all (and always slowly), the other half are about unimportant money making ventures and having fun (and the \"fun\" ones aren't particularly funny either). The supporting characters seem more interesting than the main ones. Nothing the characters have done has had any consequences to speak of. A show that seems to sell itself as \"deep\", \"coming of age\", etc. shows very little of any of those aspects. I am not saying that plot needs to be advanced at a breakneck pace, however too slow is too slow. Bottom line is that the show failed to hold my interest and at the end of the day, that is the only reason one needs to consider.",

            "content": "50 Episodes is a big investment. \r\nStory: \r\nEureka Seven is a happy-go-lucky airship adventure, packed with angsty adolescent themes, slice of life comedy and sentimental moments (all of which held together by the mushy, yet familiar, \u201clove conquers all\u201d theme). The story is about a naive, 14 year old boy, Renton, and his journey to explore the adult world with an oddball group of mercenaries. The primary focus of this anime is adolescence, family and young romance. It\u2019s important to establish that early on as this is in no way a legitimate action anime. \r\nI realized pretty early on that I am too old, rationaland cynical to get everything I might have out of this anime but I\u2019ll do my best to highlight the positives of ES while still remaining honest.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the introduction into the Eureka Seven universe was lacking. I\u2019m not asking ES to give everything away in the beginning but I see no reason to withhold basic information such as what planet are we on? What is the world like? What kind of government controls \u201cThe Military\u201d? Many of the shocking revelations that are introduced later on are actually no-brainer plot points that should have been explained to me much earlier on. It\u2019s like your little cousin on Christmas giving you back the car keys she\u2019d hidden for the past month-- \u2018Thanks, I appreciate it but my gratitude is offset by the knowledge that these really shouldn\u2019t have gone missing in the first place.\u2019 \\n\r\nI would have liked to have had a 2-minute voiceover narration or conversation between characters that explained the state of the world. Oh, and one scene with a comprehensive map of the world like in Full Metal Alchemist. \\n\r\nAs for the actual plot of ES I\u2019m going to have to say that it\u2019s largely irrelevant. We have a plot skeleton and some vague attempt at conflict but it\u2019s not coherent enough to properly scrutinize. How can I explain it? It\u2019s not like they tried to pull something risky off and failed, rather, ES just didn\u2019t invest a lot of effort into building it up. You will end the anime with many questions about the plot. \\n\r\nTone: I would classify the tone as a lighthearted and sentimental. There isn\u2019t a real sense of urgency or mortality, and characters don\u2019t display realistic reactions to danger. But why should they? Enemy mecha and gunships are little more than plastic toys that shoot confetti. Every once in a while we\u2019ll see a severed arm, a massacre or a submachine gun emptied into someone\u2019s chest but the moral lessons and horror are usually short-lived and quickly forgotten to make room for the slice-of-life comedy on the ship or the next little adventure. If you\u2019re going for a psychological anime or a gorefest, then you\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed. However if you want a touching, light action anime that\u2019s punctuated with some serious moments then ES is a good fit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It\u2019s hard for me to classify. At times it was extremely detailed and other times it looked very simple. As a general rule it was gorgeous though. I liked the character designs too, especially Eureka. She wasn\u2019t sexualized or ecchified at all. I thought this lent credibility to innocent romance angle of the series. The battle scenes and the trapar surfing concept was visually pleasing. It\u2019s almost like watching kata or choreographed fight scenes, it\u2019s nice to look at but hard to get too excited about. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I wasn\u2019t blown away. None of the songs really stuck with me and the last intro, a remix of Amazing Grace was just weird. The main theme wasn\u2019t bad but not particularly memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is the selling point or the breaking point (assuming you made it past the \u2018no real action\u2019 disclaimer). A lot of the character interactions revolve around Renton's 14 year old world-view and crush.\\n\r\nMost of the mains undergo several significant changes as the series progresses. The characters are not amazingly complex by themselves but you do grow fond of them over the series and appreciate it when they start to evolve. I feel like the side characters are underdeveloped though. They get plenty of screen time but not a lot of depth. For the most part, they are confined to a specific supportive role i.e. encouragement, advice or wisdom etc. Nonetheless you still appreciate them.\\n\r\nOverall: It\u2019s hard for me to score this one. If you\u2019re willing to forgive the narrative shortcuts and bland action scenes, and focus on \u201cOMG! Will the couples end up together?\u201d then you might like it. If you have already developed a taste for anime with darker, adult themes then this will probably bore you.\\n\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: a bit but it\u2019s brushed over.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: It\u2019s the heart of the anime if you\u2019re into that.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: A few suggestive conversations. I was a little surprised. But no\u2026",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is one of the most awful anime series I've ever had the displeasure of attempting to sit through.  The show got so bad I actually had to stop about 60% of the way through and drop the anime. Don't get me wrong, every action scene of this series had incredible art and for the most part it kept me on the edge of my seat. The real problem here is the character development.. That's what ruined it for me.  Not all the characters, but particularly in the case of the two main characters Renton and Eureka.  The way the show'sset up you have about equal (if not equal, 60:40) screen time between romance and action, and I was fine with that.  But as the show went on the relationship between Renton and Eureka felt so weird, and almost forced despite them being anime characters.  And it felt even more weird when you realize the two main characters are 14.  The show slowly continued inching towards the 70:30 line between romance and action, but I figured if I can look passed all that just for the action\u2014 the show might be good, it might even be as good as all the reviews say.  Sadly.. Unfortunately I was sorely mistaken and sat through about 20 more episodes before realizing Renton is a poor excuse for a main character. Why? Because he's always too scared and rarely knows how to solve a problem.  The real hero might as well be the type zero for constantly saving the day.  Eureka on the other hand seems emotionally displaced 90% of the time.  And when the writers try to bring her out of her own bubble of self pity it makes her seem bi-polar and inherently crazy.  It got to the point where it felt like Renton was watching four kids (including Eureka) and he's only 14.  That to me, isn't an enjoyable thing to be watching.  And maybe I interpreted the anime wrong but for now Eureka Seven is NOT my cup of tea.",

            "content": "Filler Ratio: LOW\r\nDub Quality: AMAZING (see below)\r\nEureka 7 is simply one of those anime that must be watched for the experience of feeling the aspects of character, soundtrack, animation and story all blend harmoniously. The anime itself is a beautiful symphony of imagination and color. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a long time and the animation (as expected of BONES) is fluid, smooth and exquisitely done. Eureka 7 had me hooked on its concepts even before I started looking into the characters.\r\nThe characters of Eureka 7 are NOT flat. Each has their own psychology, their own space within the series,and side characters feel just as real as Holland or Renton. The female characters are strong; the development the characters experience from episode to episode is retained (each of the main characters change throughout the series as events happen to them- a departure from the Naruto or Usagi complex*) Villains have actual motives- and at times, you feel as if some of them truly aren't 'villains' at all. \\n\\n\r\nI am not a huge mech fan, but the concepts behind the mechs for this series were well conceived and executed. The show is NOT about the mechs- they exist within the story and have their own histories, but it is yet another element that blends seamlessly into the overall story arc. The only reason I gave this show a 9 instead of a 10 for Story is that the ending seemed to meander a bit- though it quickly gets back on track. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended- I watched the English dubbed version (which is way more than tolerable- the voice actors did a fantastic job), but both versions are great!\\n\\n\r\n*-I don't mean to \"hate\" on Naruto and Sailor Moon's main characters, but the psychology for these characters -is- low. Usagi is roughly the same character she was in episode 200 as she was in episode 1. This is not the case for the main players in Eureka 7.",

            "content": "10/10 - Anime\r\nI'm going to keep this one short since everyone here has an essay it seems on this anime. Watching this when I was 12 years old on cable I was intrigued only by the Mecha that was showed and the cool fight scenes since I was born in the Gundam Seed Era. \r\nRewatching this series about 3 times over, I must say it is my favourite series for a number of reasons. The mecha is obviously just a front for the themes of  post-adolescence, overthrowing the government and hopeless romanticism. The reason why most people love this series is the relationship betweenthe main characters Renton and Eureka. It is a very typical tale of romance weaved between 50 episodes of constant action, plot, and very little fillers - but when the fillers are fillers they are always enjoyable (soccer episode) and make you fall in love with the characters to an even further extent. The boy is Renton, the hopeless romantic whom is desperately in love with Eureka (the girl) from the first episode of the series. He goes through what many guys go through - being in the friend zone, not knowing if he should hold her hand, and general awkwardness. Eureka on the another hand, is a archetypal Rei Ayanami, short blue hair, pale skin, red/purple eyes, who is cold and somewhat emotionless in the beginning for the series, unaware of Renton's unrequited love. Through character development of Renton's mental psychological transformation from boy to man \"You're gonna carry that weight\" he is constantly looked down upon from his higher-uppers and feels the need to always be better at piloting his mecha to save the world (this isn't as cheesy as it sounds).\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of this, the secondary romances between the crew of Gekkostate and the soundtrack are very, very good - it basically made me fall in love with Japanese music. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you're looking for an anime that is cute and lovey-dovey tinted with unrequited love (but finally gets the girl in the end of course) and also is filled with great action scenes (pink clouds of explosions inspired by GS/GSD) then this is for you. Imagine a Code Geass, but much much better without the cocky Lelouch and a love story, and better animations and actual comedy - yes I went there Code Geass fans. In general this anime probably takes features from all the greatest genres and puts them into something unforgettable, and worth rewatching every summer. The Summer of Love.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is an anime series made by Studio Bones in 2005. Unlike most anime series, E7 is not based off any pre-existing material; it was originally made as an anime.\r\nAt first glance, E7 doesn\u2019t appear to be anything out of the ordinary. The story is about a fourteen year old boy named Renton Thurston. His life is thrown upside-down when a giant robot crashes into his house\u2019s garage. Piloting the robot is a girl named Eureka. Apparently, she is the member of a rebel faction called the Gekkostate, which fights the government for unknown reasons. But before he knows it, Renton gets caught upin their battles, and becomes inducted into the Gekkostate almost by accident. He stays for two reasons: one, their leader is Holland Novak, someone Renton looks up to. Two, Renton is hopelessly in love with Eureka. That\u2019s . . . the best introduction I can give if you haven\u2019t seen the show, but take my word, Eureka Seven has a little bit of everything in it. There\u2019s action, for most of the fighting is done in Light Finding Operators, or LFOs. LFOs are basically giant robots that are armed, can fly through the air on \u201cLift\u201d boards (thus making it look like they\u2019re surfing through the sky), and can also transform into other vehicles. There\u2019s comedy, for the members of the Gekkostate are a quirky bunch, and there\u2019s drama, for every action has its consequences.\\n\\n\r\nBut what\u2019s impressive about Eureka Seven, more than anything else, is the characterization. The characters in this show feel like real people. The villains aren\u2019t simply one-dimensional \u201cevil\u201d people who want to cause harm; they have motives for their actions. The characters develop and grow throughout the series. Renton is a very different person by the end of the series, as is Eureka. The same could be said for most of the rest of the cast. The show also show poses many tough questions for both the characters and the audience: do the ends justify the means? What makes a great leader? Is love worth it? What is the truth? All this and more is explored.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Eureka Seven does not fail. The animation varies from average to amazing. Scenes where people are standing around talking don\u2019t look impressive, but fights between LFOs never cease to amaze. The character designs are not some of the best I\u2019ve seen in an anime, but they are unique and serve their purpose. The soundtrack is an eclectic mixture of orchestrated scores, techno, and rock, all of which is impressive. The voice-acting, both in English and in Japanese, is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nBut this show is special. Why? Because E7 did something no other anime series, no, no other tv series -period- has ever done before; it made me cry. I cried real tears of joy at my favorite moment in the series. I felt -that- strongly for the characters. You see, E7 is an emotional rollercoaster ride: one moment, you\u2019re smiling out of warmth, the next, you\u2019re depressed, and hope that the pain ends soon. In the next scene, you\u2019re terrified at the awesome power of the LFOs. And, yes, you may even be moved to tears. I have rarely seen a tv series able to do that effectively, and E7 is the only animated series from Japan that I know can do that. That in itself is incredible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so it stands; Eureka Seven is now my favorite anime......\\n\\n\r\n.......Most of the above is from an essay I wrote back in 2008, when I first watched E7. I never published it online, just kept it to myself. It\u2019s 2015 now, and after nearly six-and-a-half years, I watched E7 all over again. To my surprise, not only does everything I wrote back then still hold up in my mind, if anything, E7 has gotten better over time.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the series is perfect. Perhaps because E7 was originally a tv series, and not a manga or video game, but every episode, save for the 39th, contributes something meaningful, and things never slow to a crawl, nor does it overwhelm you with too much content at once. Some people criticize the show for not starting off on a high note. Personally, I feel the early episodes are good, but it\u2019s not until about eighth or so episode in that it starts to get really strong, and even stronger by the second half. Even then, I feel the early episodes are a necessity, for it gives you an idea of what Renton is, what the Gekkostate is like, the sort of shenanigans that will occur, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characterization, again, I\u2019m simply amazed by what Bones accomplished. Renton is not a bland cypher for the audience to slip into like many other anime protagonists, nor is he an impossibly perfect deity. He\u2019s a kid, he\u2019s impatient, he\u2019s overly emotional, and he\u2019s entirely relatable. Eureka is not \u201cjust another Rei Ayanami ripoff\u201d; she\u2019s a fascinating individual who undergoes incredible growth as the series progresses. Holland is a massive prick, true, but he\u2019s also complex, and is more humane than he lets on. And let\u2019s not forget Anemone, my favorite anime character of all time, the one partially responsible for that certain scene that, even today, still makes me cry.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve watched many more anime since 2008. I\u2019ve grown myself, not just as a person, but as a critic, and as a writer. I\u2019ve seen many works of animation, some that I also love with all of my heart. And yet, after all these years, it\u2019s a shonen mecha series I like above all else. Even more than Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Death Note, hard as it is to believe. E7 is also my favorite televised action series, and if Futurama didn\u2019t exist, would be my favorite animated series of all time, yet even THAT is currently being contested.\\n\\n\r\nWhy though? Why do I love this show so much? A show that some people scoff as \u201cjust another mecha\u201d, \u201cjust another Bones anime\u201d, \u201cjust a ripoff of Evangelion\u201d? Well for one thing, I have noticed some elements in E7 that are similar to Eva, as well as various Gundam series. I don\u2019t feel E7 ripped them off, but rather, took elements of older mecha series, did them its own way, and effectively improved upon common mecha tropes. It\u2019s really hard for me to describe without going into spoilers, but I think what separates E7 from everything else, even its own successor Eureka Seven Astral Ocean, is that it\u2019s about hope. Renton hopes to be with Eureka and impress his idol Holland. Eureka hopes to do what she thinks is right. Holland hopes to make amends for the sins of his past. Anemone hopes to find something meaningful with her life, and somehow, everyone tries their hardest to make things better. Amid strange phenomena, surfing robots, loud techno music, and violent deaths, everyone, in one way or another, says, \u201cScrew how things are! I\u2019m gonna set everything right!\u201d It\u2019s a rejection of cynicism, and a statement about making dreams come true, even if you must risk your life, your sanity, and your livelihood to do so. For the longest time, I couldn\u2019t find the words to describe exactly why E7 is my favorite anime. Even now, I\u2019m not sure if these words will suffice. All I know is this show grips me in a way no other anime has, and may continue to do so for the rest of my life.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t beg for it, earn it. Only then will it be granted to you.",

            "content": "I learned to speak Eureka as Aristotle said it: as Yoo-rhee-ka, not eh-oo-rae-ka. But then again, I'm just joking around. No matter how much I pretend to make fun of Eureka's name pronunciation, I will always love this anime from the bottom of my heart. As someone who watched the whole first season, I will give you a SPOILER. Not one on the story, but one on the music. The music is PHENOMENAL!!! Here is a link to one of the most amazing emotional anime ost you will ever hear. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BCZ64DxnrA\r\nSeriously, just listen to it and concentrate it on only it. Stop reading this reviewand just listen to it first. Then come back if you want to continue to read my review. If you don't I don't care. What I care about is that you COPIED that URL and PASTED it on a new TAB. Then LISTENING to the music. My favorite is Distant memory and To Wish Upon a Star. The order is listed on the youtube description.\\n\\n\r\nAnywho, after that tangent, there are several faults within this anime, however, I really enjoyed the plot. Albeit, I could not understand the whole background of the story until the final few episodes of the anime. If you are looking for a clear story line without any hidden messages or sidetracks then you will get ABSOLUTELY frustrated. I did at some points because it got so frickin slow. However, it was worth the wait because the background of the story is so complex and amazing that it was worth not understanding the whole concept behind Eureka and other things for 46ish episodes. The background story might also be too complicated that some people will have to wiki it. The story is good and the staff even added Fyodor Dostoevsky's work, \"Crime and Punishment\" within the anime, although it was only a couple lines. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did not like from the anime is the characters. Renton is the male protagonist of the anime. I do know that he is young but sometimes, he really acts immature. Although I say I don't like it, I also like it because the emotions and the characters are real and flawed. Nothing is artificial. Almost all of the problems are real and the emotions do get dirty because that is how it is in real life. Nothing is superficial and everything is down to Earth. well, maybe except when they fly on skateboards. The emotions are intense and dramatic in both the children, teenagers, and adults, and that is what makes this anime very different from the rest. To the characters, it really means the life to them. I'm not saying that there aren't any other anime that show genuine emotions through the anime characters. It is just that the characters are really flawed and set in their own ways that is different from other anime. To me that is what set this anime apart from others.\\n\\n\r\nArt is amazing. I always wondered how they can create such a masterpiece through one drawing at a time. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you see this anime and don't fall in love with the music, ... we're never going to be friends. Bye bye. Go listen. Simply awesome.",

            "content": "For the anime fanatics that had watched Evangelion well this anime if for you, why because this anime has all most the same frame or similarity in a way. Eureka seven has a robot action similar to Eva (similar brutality in some episodes to) and some of the characters seem similar to Eva series. But this anime is not your typical robot blasting fight scenes, it focuses more on the characters relationship development in the story than what happens in the action scenes. And the art is so cool the robots here uses boards similar to surfboards or snowboards so there movement can&rsquo;t be predicted.The song are good to I really like the song they use when Renton show&rsquo;s his capabilities in Nervash.    Hey this anime is one of the most intriguing anime that I have watched. In the sense that the ideas that the author of the story is so ingenious, that person knowledge about how people feel sadness, sorrow and the pressure of the responsibility of one&rsquo;s action in life will affect there surrounding, that the character experience of cores in some of the episode in the series. But still I don&rsquo;t like the ending of this anime there are so many characters died near the ending of the series that I don&rsquo;t know may be didn&rsquo;t need to die, characters that were killed by accident(meteor fall from the sky that killed most of the population). And when the main characters didn&rsquo;t return to there companions in the end they were lost or something in some forest, &ldquo;well again we can&rsquo;t get what we want&rdquo; that&rsquo;s  what I always say. I don&rsquo;t want to be a bad guy so I give it A good grade of 7 mean&rsquo;s &ldquo;Not bad and not good ether&rdquo;.",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nWith Eureka Seven Ao coming around the corner, I thought I would head back and re-watch the first season just because I enjoyed it so much.  I mean I can't believe this show is getting a sequel 7 years later!  I will try not to be biased in this review but I genuinely enjoyed Eureka Seven a lot and the second time through turned out to be no different.   This review will be as spoiler free as I can make it so sit back, take your time and read my first ever review on a personal favourite of mine!\r\nStory: [10/10]\r\nNow I\u2019mnot going to go too much into depth here, or really explain the story at all as you could just check the synopsis, but generally the story of Eureka Seven follows the protagonist Renton Thurston, a fourteen year old boy, and his adventure and development with the outlaw and protagonist group, the Gekkostate.  The story which seemingly starts off slow picks up very quickly, drawing you in and making you want to see more and more after each episode.   There are 50 episodes in total, which will put a lot of people off but there is little to absolutely no filler (I\u2019m not even sure if there is any filler as I did not read the manga).  The 50 episodes also let them take their time telling the story and nothing seems rushed or in a hurry.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story in the long run is very well knit together.  There are almost none if any loose ends, everything is explained rather well by the end.  Something that was also nice about Eureka Seven compared to other mecha anime series is that most mecha shows focus mainly on action aspect, whereas Eureka Seven focuses on a lot other different genres as well.   Now this story isn\u2019t revolutionary or groundbreaking, but I think the way it is presented and in the end told determines how well the story was thought out.\\n\\n\r\nEureka seven has wonderful storytelling and there is a perfect blend of action, drama, adventure, romance, and even comedy throughout the entire story.  Some episodes might really tug on those heartstrings, others might make you laugh and I can guarantee this show will make you feel something.   That\u2019s the beauty of a good narrative and storytelling.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not one to judge too harshly on art, but Eureka Seven clears this section with flying colours! (I\u2019m so punny).  You know the saying, \u201cDon\u2019t judge of a book by its cover.\u201d? That saying is something to always follow up on.  The character designs of Eureka Seven don\u2019t look like the average anime cut outs.  Each member of the Gekkostate is well designed and gives off a kind of cool, hippie feel to them.  You\u2019re easily able to tell apart each and every character from each other (unlike some shows where they are pretty much only differentiable by hair colours XD).   Even in the antagonist group it is easy to distinguish one from another.\\n\\n\r\nThe mechas themselves also have a very unique design and for example, don\u2019t look anything like the ones you\u2019d see in a Gundam show.   The scenery is very vibrant and action scenes and trapar (A kind of wave) flowing behind the mechas as they surf them (Yes surfing mechas) are very colourful and are just a blast to watch.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nPossibly one of the main deciding factors of why Eureka Seven, or actually pretty much anything can be so awesome.  The soundtrack was used PERFECTLY in Eureka Seven.   Nothing was played too much or too little.  All of the music was also always used at the appropriate time.  There are times when you\u2019ll hear certain tracks and just be like \u201cOHHH YEAHH!!\u201d just at how they used it.  I believe sound is one of the most important things in pretty much everything.  Sound acts as a stimulus to pump you up, make you sad, it helps change the mood and can really draw you into the story and characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs of Eureka seven were also F.  F FOR FABULOUS!  The first two openings of Eureka Seven perfectly captured the feel and atmosphere of what was actually happening.  All the ending songs were really really good as well.  What I thought was cool though is that they were change the opening once something actually significant happened in the story, and the new opening would reflect that change or happening.  By the last opening song you feel like you\u2019ve really just watched the crew develop along the course of the journey and it gives you a real nice satisfying feel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Eureka Seven have to be my all time most favourite thing about this show.  Now I think I\u2019ve said it a few times earlier in this review, there is character development.  I\u2019ll clear this up now.  There is a LOT of character development in this show and I believe that characters along with a good story can carry almost any show to greatness.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, all of the characters go through some sort of change or realization throughout the 50 episode journey and it is really something to behold.  Just watching how much the entire cast changes and grows throughout the show is amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really say too much because then there would be easy spoilers but I guarantee you that the characters in this show are top tier.  You might not like some or even hate them but with given time you\u2019ll understand the reasons for their actions and maybe even really connect with a few others.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso the romance and drama between the characters will easily want you to follow up and continue watching this.  Eureka and Renton go through so much development that by the end of the show you\u2019ll be left in awe at how much they\u2019ve grown without you noticing.  It\u2019s that kind of weird feeling because everyone is so awesome.  The drama is great.  It isn\u2019t like some failed teen drama.  You can understand why they feel like that and it\u2019s all real actually good and got me interested my first time watching through.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow this should be really obvious and if you haven\u2019t noticed it by now, I seriously enjoyed this show.   The story, sound, and characters all blend so well together.  It really does feel like one massive adventure and which is why I enjoyed it so much.  Have you ever watched an anime that was so good that just makes you feel awesome?  Just because you watched and enjoyed it so much?  If you have be sure to check out Eureka Seven, and if you haven\u2019t still check it out! This could be the show that you\u2019ve been missing!\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion & Total Score: [48/50] \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to keep this part short and sweet.  I seriously recommend from the bottom of my heart that if you are even having the slightest idea on whether or not to watch this show, just give it a try.  It won\u2019t hurt and I\u2019m guaranteed you will have a blast.  Thanks for reading my very first submitted review on MAL and I hope it helps out!\\n\\n\r\n\"Don't beg for it, earn it, then it will be granted.\"\\n\\n\r\nP.S \u2013 Don\u2019t let the 50 episode length turn you off! Just take your time watching it or even marathon is all, but in the end it is COMPLETELY worth it, you\u2019ll understand what I mean!\\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is so close to being fantastic. So close. The plot is engaging. The theme of cross-species acceptance and understanding stays at the show's heart all the way through. The show has plenty of mecha action. All the major relationships actually feel real. And the relationships MATTER to the story. This is one of the only examples I know of an anime--that is not SOLELY a romance anime--where the romance is not just for fanservice. There are some serious feels to be had here. And that is awesome.\r\nThere is just one problem. You will understand if you watch the anime.\r\nThe god damn kids.\r\nThey areso annoying that they single-handedly knock my rating down 2 points.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the kids are ALSO an important part of the story. I recognize that. I just wish they weren't. I wish the writers could have written the story some other way. Perhaps if I was Japanese I wouldn't find them so annoying (because a lot of stuff that's acceptable or funny in Japan doesn't translate so well to American culture). As it is, I hated every scene that featured those kids because they destroyed the mood every time. And as I said before, they're important to the plot. So they're in quite a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Eureka Seven is an otherwise great series with one fatal flaw that I cannot get over. If you CAN, however, I would definitely recommend this series. You can even just watch maybe 5 or 10 episodes. If you find the kids too annoying to deal with, no, it doesn't really get better.",

            "content": "Well this is my first review in a while as well as watching an anime in pretty much 1-2 sittings. I haven't watched anime in a while but the introduction to this series was very gripping and interesting up until later into the show... but we'll talk about that later in review\r\nStory:\r\nSo the premise of this story begins with a boy named Renton who has joined the group of his dreams the \"GekkoState\", and how he interacts with everyone on the ship especially a girl named Eureka.\r\nPlot:7\r\nThe premise of this anime was a real rollercoaster ride for me. At first I really enjoyed it upuntil like episode 17. The first few episodes were filled with a little bit of comedy, action, and romance After that things got away from action and/or romance and was just about Renton finding his own path. Then it got good again with the romance and action. But then it became confusing and slightly ok towards the end of the series. The show was littered with random points of confusing explaining and things that did NOTHING to progresss the plot. I also didn't like how it like 30 eps. to explain something and when it did it was like a mouthful. I literally had to keep writing notes about the series so I wouldn't forget certain parts of it. Don't get discouraged though, it's still a pretty good series in my book, but a letdown towards the early middle and and ending of the story. Also, the story is like Black Lagoon for like 15 eps because the plot literally goes nowhere, the team is literally just going around and doing jobs to get money. You only really know the team's true objective like three fourths of the way into the series. Which bothered me a ton because after a while I'm like \"Why exactly am I watching this series?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n It was from 2005-2007 and it was pretty solid and consistent. Tell me why Eureka lookin like Gaara after the mining incident XD\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8  Soundtrack was pretty good, the background music was pretty average though. The tracks are reused for the anime scenes but they do their job. A romantic scene comes on, and romantic music play. Just that simple. I will say that the majority of openings and ending were pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 \\n\r\nThe main characters in the anime were very realistic. They weren't static and often had multiple layers to their personalities. Although what I couldn't get over was the fact that when it seemed like they had gotten over a problem, they would go back to being friggin childish and make the same damn mistake.There were some extremely forced  emotional shifts here and their but it wasn't too bad. The other characters were often one dimensional and didn't have much going for them. Which is ok,a series always needs balance. Although I would've liked a little more insight on the backgrounds of the characters who were aboard the Gekko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7.5-8\\n\r\nAs I said before, watching this anime was a rollercoaster ride, in the begging I would've given this anime a 9.5 for enjoyment. the middle probably 7, and the end like a 6. Whenever it went back to it being really based on teamwork, mechas, and romance was when i enjoyed it most. All in all, I think that there were barely more nejoyable moments that not very enjoyable ones so. I give it a 7.5-8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5-8\\n\r\n I think Eureka Seven was a pretty well put together anime. They knew how to draw your attention but after that, they didn't really know how to keep it. The show leaves you with a lot of how?'s, what?'s, and why?'s. While some of those questions were answered much later in the series, most of them were just left there. I was very confused only towards the end of the series with what exactly was going on. The show does a pretty good job on showing how adolescense can affect teenagers and \"adults\". The romantic scenes were nicely executed (except for most of the ones involving Holland) The artstyle was pretty consistent while the animation is pretty much the same but is better within the last few episodes. The soundtrack for the scenes were generic but did their jobs. The Openings and Endings were pretty good. Characters were pretty life like due to the fact of actually growth within the characters themselves. I enjoyed this series and it was a blast to get that rush of watching something new and amazing again. Although it had a lot of wasted potential with where the series could've gone, it's still a show that's fun to watch!",

            "content": "Watched 10 episodes of Eureka Seven on me Ipod. I have to say that this is a very good anime. I mean, the storyline is well present, with some unexpected slots in between that will makes you think a little bit about what might happen in  the future.\r\nI won't compare the art of Eureka Seven with Transformers, because they are totally different class of it. Transformers is more like robots fighting with robots but with Eureka Seven, I feels its more like people fighting with people, with good cause, of course.\r\nCan't complaint about the sound, because they got the sort of music that Ireally heart ! Music with that anime is a very good compliment I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment of the character is one vital element of the anime. Without a good growth of the character, the storyline will be trumble. Eureka Seven makes sure that this not happen, by plotting the suitable situation with the correct character. Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ? One of the best.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, this is my favourite as it contain many elements that I fancy with, such as against the war, environmental and human life. Good good good !!!",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is to mecha what Cowboy Bebop was to sci-fi anime: A rich collection of characters and cultural references looking both east and west, while telling a good story in the process of challenging the trivia nerds among us. Eureka and Renton are immensly likable, while Anemone is disturbing on a lot of levels. The rest of ensemble is not as well developed, except for the Beams', Holland, Norb, and Dewey. The characters, mecha, and overall enviroment are all superbly designed, but mechs on 'surfboards' do strain crediability just a bit. The music is excellent, lending a lot to the atmosphere of what isalready a very atmospheric show. If Eureka Seven has a drawback, its the plotting. The story, epic in many ways, takes nearly 15 episodes to really get going, and doesn't really take off until the half-way point, which can turn off the less paitent anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nA must for mecha fans, and generally recommended for anime fans in general.",

Renton is quite cool and you can not help but like the kid and wish he kick Hollands ass for treating him like crap. If youwatch any two Manga series then this is the one to watch besides Bleach because they invoke such a range of emotions and you will not help your self but feel for all the characters plus they both transcend generations so old or young you will enjoy every minuet.",

            "content": "A really nice work of anime storytelling.  There are no less than 5 romantic subplots woven into the story -- two with love triangles.  Add to that 3 or 4 rivalries, and you have an action packed drama that you won't be able to escape from until the last episode.\r\nI liked the series mostly for the drama and character interactions.  Because of the length of the series, you get to know all the characters of GekkoState pretty well, which was nice.  You also get to know many of the other characters, including various villains, pretty well too.  This is whyEureka Seven stands out as a great story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of space age war violence, yet it deeply explores an anti-war theme.  This complexity adds to the quality of the show overall.  I thought this was well done too.\\n\\n\r\nPraise aside, aspects of this series can be frustrating at times.  The \"science\" of the world is never explained at all, leaving you constantly wondering how the LFOs work, how the weapons work, how ANYTHING works.  We go through the first 26 episodes without really understanding the true nature of this strange world, and what it is all about.  This was a true oversight.  I am not sure if is because it spanned a total of 4 seasons -- perhaps episodes 27 - 50 were written at a later time.  Season 3 (episodes 27 - 40) does a good job of explaining the true nature of the world the story takes place in.  Ultimately though, the \"rules of the world\" are pretty fluid and seemed to change especially towards the end of the story.  This was not good. \\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven, is a show that debuted in April 2005. In a couple of weeks it will be the tenth anniversary of the show's debut. Eureka Seven is a show that achieves so much, it swallows such a large pill and still manages to do so much right. Its really a first for most things, but does have references to other shows of its genre. It has won many awards, and today I will explain why they earned it. \r\nThe story follows a boy named Renton Thurston a young teenage boy who enjoys the sport known as lifting. Like most people of his age, helooks up to various individuals specifically Holland Novak a famous lifter who is currently in a group known as \"Gekkostate\" a sort of anti-military resistance. Moving on with Renton, he strives to be like his idol, and this opportunity literally fall right over his lap. As a giant white machine crashes into his home, where we meet the gekkostate pilot Eureka, whom Renton instantly falls in love with. After a series of events, Renton ends up being apart the gekkoste and this is where the adventure begins. The story as a skeleton. Is so open ended and simplistic which would be a negative for a 50 epsoide series, since there would not be enough premise to fill that many epsoides without adding filler content. But what's unique about this show in particular is that it is not character driven rather world driven. Eureka Seven manages to pack so much world exposition. Like loads of it. From world views to spirituality to war to discrimination to science to religion to the media. eureka sevens society is well constructed and is very rich in detail from a narritave stand point, literally to the point that I was worried that some part s from the main Arch's would be ommited, but I was wrong. E7 manages to squueze in to much and make it more or less complete (at least 95%). From a content standpoint it is a pure joy. It delivers so much without it feeling irrelevant For people to say that E7 is exclusively romance is a shame, this show packs so many themes and although its art design tells a different story, it can be a very grim place. So many themes get covered in this series which his great, not obscure and easy to find and deconstruct. We then go to pacing Eurekas pacing is ingenious. Its spikes up fast then goes at a snails pace only to spike up again. The slow part is a absorption part as this part is where more of the world buldong takes place. If you are not a fan of slower shows do not worry as the show throws events and information that cpativate your inate sense of wonder. Its like the writers already knew their flaws and took full advantage of those flaws to cover it up. Overall eureka seven delivers a complete, rich and content packed Archs that fail to dissapoint. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\\n\r\nEvidently if a story is good than so is the characters that manifest it. Eureka sevens characters are very well thought out. None of them give the viewer the impression that they exist solely for plot convince. Each character has a story or at the very least a desire, and considering how many characters e7 has I was once again surprised as to how much they manages to fit. There are some characters that are not exposed but you gotta cut corners somewhere right? What's more impressive is how many fleshed our characters there were, usually there would be 1-3 but in here we got 6+ and by this I mean characters with a background,a motive, a position and a informative explanation as to why they are apart of the narrative. But for the sake of length I will only touch on the more interesting, complicated or important characters that make e7 unique. Starting off with Renton. Renton is an easily relate able character. He seems to be portrayed as a child but in reality he is quite mature for his age, its just that he does not know much. Rentons problem for the most part is his ignorance rather than his maturity and he hates himself for that. Which is why he tends to be on the whiner side. Which in my honest opinion is the most realistic portrayal of a 13 year old child in the middle of a war zone. Renton is used as a vessel for exploration. We the viewer use Renton as a means to understand the world as he seems to know no more than we do as viewers. And that's what really pops out with Renton, you feel like Renton, you feel that you are a manifestation of Renton, who is simply you if you were plucked into this world feet first. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHolland Novak is a wild card for me. He's a very complex character and an interesting one too. Of all the times I have seen eureka seven I never truly felt what Hollands real goals were or why he reacted in certain episodes. His character along with Thalo offers a much more mature and gritty story line. Once you get the premise of His desires though it can be quite rewarding. But what really shines with Holland is when he is in conflict with Renton. People tend to complain about rentons crying. But if it was not for Renton crying and agressive behavior tmwe would not have been able to witness the over the top verbal conflicts between Renton and Holland. The voice actors for these characters did such an amazing job. And I have to say, it is a reason as to why I keep going back to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have eureka. I absolutely love eureka as a character. For one reason her development. I think the reason why Eureka won the award for best character of the year is because of how they handled her personality. In most stories, when a dynamic character changes he/she does a complete 180\u00b0 and is a completely different person. Eureka on the other hand is treated differently. She starts off as very quiet and some what soulless just piloting and mercilessly killing, to very emotionally, motherly and well love struck as she cleans the gekko, makes food for the crew members and is fearful of killing people. If This is a completely opposite and permanent change I would of hated. it if eureka just threw away her past like most character do it would have sucked. But that was not the case. By the end of the show, eureka is a fusion of her past self and her new self. It feels as if she understands what she was and is now integrating what she has learned into her old self. She does change, but still takes her past into account and learns from it. Eureka is by far the most realistic character of the series. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen we have anemone. \\n\\n\r\nAnemone is the main enemy of Renton and eureka. As.they fight constantly throughout the series. What makes anemone interesting as a villian is how she is portrayed. She's not the typical rwar I'll kills everything kind of villain. She very in depth, she seeks appreciation, she is scared that she will be deemed useless. Anemone is a very poetic character and an interesting villain that's for sure. \\n\\n\r\nIk there are many more characters that deserve a mention but for the sake of length I picked the ones that had a larger impact for me as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nArt Animation and Sound is amazing a unique aesthetic combined with cgiless great quality animation and a sound track that you want to immortalize in your micro SD cards these three elements enrich everything in a superb manner. It bears some of the best and most uniqueness mech designs that I have ever seen and character design is unique for each individual character. Facial expressions are beyond on point it sets the bar. Nothing less too expect from studio BONES. To conclude, this show is fantastic. I know I'm over hyping it but I have to give it the praise it deserves. I'll be perfectly honest with you the reader of this review. I can't stand most anime. I hate slice of life, I hate romance and pretty much most modern anime. Its very difficult to find d something in this genre that I like and enjoy and eureka seven is one of those rare occurrences that achieves that. There is so much that this show has to offer in it 17 hour run time and it is by far one of my favorite no anime bit TV shows of all time.",
