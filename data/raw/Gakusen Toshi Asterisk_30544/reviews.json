            "content": "Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a series which starts off as one of the most uninspiring anime I've ever seen throughout its first few episodes, but past a certain point it starts improving quite rapidly. Granted that doesn't really say very much given how mediocre the opening is, but despite the lackluster start it manages to make a quite impressive comeback and eventually become a pretty enjoyable anime.\r\nFirst things first though, episodes 1-4 of Asterisk didn't exactly give me a very good first impression because they are *painfully* generic. Like if you've seen any typical action/fantasy/ecchi/harem magic academy anime before, you should know roughly what clich\u00e9sto expect, and I'll just say that initially Asterisk has effectively all of them. Our protagonist Ayato transfers into a new school and walks in on the tsundere female lead Julis in her underwear within 3 minutes of the first episode and 'accidentally' grabs her breasts, he meets his new classmates and immediately becomes surrounded by a bunch of girls who fall in love with him for whatever reason, he's given a powerful magic sword which he just so happened to be the 'chosen one' to wield and thus becomes super overpowered... you get the idea. Basically it's all been done countless times before and I'm really getting sick of it at this point. As a side note there's also this one scene which blatantly rips off the light sabers from Star Wars for some reason, even the sound effects were completely the same... well whatever.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, then starting from episode 5 (what I presume is the beginning of the second volume of the light novel), something happens to this anime which slowly but surely turns it into something different. And it comes with the introduction of a girl named Kirin; a very shy and nervous girl, yet also the top-ranked student in the school in terms of fighting prowess. The story starts putting a surprising amount of focus on her character and backstory, and in the process it downright sneakily goes *away* from the abundance of overused clich\u00e9s it had in the first few episodes. Suddenly the amount of fanservice and romcom shenanigans is severely toned down, and instead we actually get some real depth and character development. Sure, it only really involves Kirin herself and our protagonist Ayato, but it was still a breath of fresh air compared to just having content I've already seen a hundred times before in other anime. And plot progression aside, I personally found Kirin to be by far and wide the most likeable girl in Asterisk's character cast anyway so I guess it was a win-win scenario in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven't read the light novels of Asterisk, but based on the contents of the anime I'm presuming it's covering every volume in 4 episodes each. And thus I was a bit worried that it'd start to get worse again after the anime had finished up on the contents of volume 2 which seemed to be the Kirin-focused one. Fortunately however that didn't turn out to be the case, as starting with episode 9 we finally get into what I guess can be called the 'main' story of this series. Introducing the Festa: a grand series of tournaments where the students of the six different magic academies in the city of Asterisk fight each other to showcase their talent and technological development. The price they're all fighting for is the opportunity to have any one wish of theirs granted. Naturally, Ayato and the girls are competing as well. Normally I'm not a fan of action in ecchi anime since it tends to end up rather incompatible with its own fanservice, but Asterisk does a respectable job at keeping the two sides separate from one another. As a result, the duels in the Festa are actually not that bad, and A-1 Pictures' are not exactly newbies when it comes to creating fancy special effects in shounen battles, so the visuals are pretty decent too.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Gakusen Toshi Asterisk started airing, I considered it one of my least favorite shows of the season. Not that it's finished however; I'd say it's a perfectly acceptable show. Not anything amazing by any means of course, but if you just want an easily enjoyable way to spend 20 minutes every weekend... then this anime pulls it off very well. Discounting the generic and unimpressive opening, it has pretty decent fight scenes and production value, as well as good characterization for at least part of its cast. Oh and for you pervs out there who are just intending to watch this for the ecchi tag, I'd recommend you to look somewhere else; Asterisk really doesn't have very much of that at all.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot make a proper evaluation of the story as a whole though for the simple reason that... well this is a split-cour. At the time of writing this we've still only gotten to see half of what the anime has to offer, with the second season airing in Spring 2016. However the Festa is a huge event, and there's plenty of action left to showcase on that front, so the second cour might very well be even better than the first. Fingers crossed.",

            "content": "edit: don't read this review don't upvote it i don't want it to exist it's just a bad digibro impression read another review i am a better writer than this\r\nedit edit: oh no they're not listening this review is visible now ohhhhhhh noooooooooooooooo\r\nI'm not mad. I have only myself to blame for this, really. I tend to be more selective with what I watch. Something will be recommended, I'll hear about something popular, or it's just on my mind a lot. I've never watched anything expecting it to be bad; usually I have no expectations at all, but often I at least think it'll besomething that's enjoyable enough to pass the time and get a 5 or 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe Asterisk War is my first exception.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch this because I knew it'd be good. I watched it because I heard it was almost identical to Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, which I'd just finished, and all I wanted to do was see which is worse. Yes, WORSE. Not better. I mean, that's not to say it couldn\u2019t have been surprisingly good, but of course that couldn't happen. Of course, this review won\u2019t be spent comparing the two anime together, but I will give a verdict as to which is better at the end. Because that\u2019s what everyone asked me to do!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, so the mods won\u2019t be unhappy, I must inform you that I will spoil the first episode almost entirely, but spoilers will be toned down to a minor level beyond that episode.\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk starts off extremely rocky; honestly just about everything in the first episode is horrible, whether it's immediately evident or not. The opening scene is a fight with awkward choreography and absolutely no context at all, even as the scene comes to a close. It sets the tone, I guess, but the reason why this fight was shown at all just seems unclear after watching the whole season, as way too little is revealed in this opening, and its potential context doesn't have much weight on the following episodes. But I'm sure it'll be explained later... in another season... that I won't watch...\\n\\n\r\nSome exposition is given, which is fine I guess, but one very interesting thing stuck with me. \"The people gradually began to alter their sense of morality.\" This is apparently due to some event called \"Invertia\", and you really have to give the writer(s) props for making a new term for \"shitty writing\". It's a shame they couldn't follow up on it, though. There might be some stupid actions, but nothing horrible enough to make you really think that these people are really fucked in the head; these things instead feel forced so that the \"story\" (read: too little) and fanservice (read: too much) can keep going.\\n\\n\r\nThe first example of characters being idiots instead of morally questionable comes quickly. Icky--oh, sorry, wrong review\u2014Ayato (the main character) catches a falling handkerchief, sees and open window (and/or hears someone's voice from it), and sums up the obvious. He jumps into the window to return the handkerchief, only to see a female student only partially dressed. Here's everything wrong with this scene:\\n\\n\r\n1. He acts apologetic, knowing that it was an accident, despite not considering that he would've been obviously invading someone's privacy by jumping through their FUCKING WINDOW, MULTIPLE STORIES HIGH. If some awareness to the obviously horrible idea were present, even if it results in the MC being a massive douchenozzle, it could at least be pinned to people having fucked up morals. Nope, instead he tries playing this off like it\u2019s not just a prank, bro.\\n\\n\r\n2. We get a glimpse of someone\u2019s ass before knowing whose ass it even is. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not that important, this is only the female fucking lead. Where are the Japanese tumblrvists when you need them? If the fanservice wasn\u2019t so forced, this could\u2019ve been an OK scene, but god forbid someone has to go three minutes without popping a boner over their new waifu. By the way, you can stop taking the show seriously at this point.\\n\\n\r\n3. If your handkerchief is so important, why did you carelessly leave it sitting loosely near an open window? How the hell did the wind even suck a cloth out of a room, anyway? Why was Ayato surprised by seeing a girl in the room when he heard her talking? If he didn\u2019t hear her talking, why did WE hear her talking?\\n\\n\r\nThis goes into a very laughable fight scene that only exists because Julis\u2019s personality makes absolutely no sense, if she even has one. She thinks Ayato should die or something because he saw her naked (apparently wearing underwear = naked, k), despite being soooo grateful for getting a super-special piece of linen back. Maybe this could be some inverted moral bullshit like the story wants me to believe, but you\u2019ll later see how much of a clusterfuck this character is as the show goes on. The fight itself is full of weird technology and magic we know nothing about, plot armor, and overall poor direction. (Why did Ayato jump through an explosion unharmed? And why did the soundtrack suddenly stop just when a character is thinking, only to go to some mysterious-sounding tune? It\u2019s weird.) It ends with Ayato glomping Julis to avoid some assassination or something, and he later gropes her somehow because fanservice, or awkward comedy, or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Oh, did I say something about an assassination? Who cares? No one else does, so that\u2019s obviously not important. Let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nI could pick apart every scene, but I\u2019d just retrace the same points and conclusions the above have made, more or less: Characters are incredibly stupid, whether the writer made them do stupid things or the writer leaked his stupidity into the plot\u2019s scenarios at various points, and not because of some global event. The art is pretty generic and obviously tries to compensate by being flashy, the music is mostly uninspiring, and just the overall direction seems to be mediocre. All of this is taken from the first ten minutes of the first episode. That\u2019s all.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the show quickly establishes how fuckin\u2019 bad it is.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I\u2019ve been mentioning this \u201cInvertia\u201d thing a few times. It IS pretty important, and you should really pay attention to that scene, because it\u2019s the only time in the whole show that you\u2019ll hear about it! \u2026Wait\u2026 oh. Yeah, Invertia is mentioned once, or something. No one talks about it, and there\u2019s no noticeable impact from it (as far as morals go). Why did they bother mentioning this part of it? And you know that fight in the beginning? That kinda hints at some other \u201cmajor\u201d plot element that gets totally forgotten about after it\u2019s brought up. The first episode is basically spent teaching you things you will never need to know. It\u2019s high school algebra all over again!\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this fa\u00e7ade of a setup, there\u2019s some sort of plot, or at least there should be. Basically, Ayato comes to this school to kinda learn about his sister and mostly to find some path for himself, so he starts training for these fighting events, and wow I am REALLY bored right now. Along the way, he meets various girls who do all but tear out their reproductive organs and install them into exuberantly-colored fleshlights for his personal satisfaction. It\u2019s honestly hilarious how frequent the fanservice is, and how few reasons the girls have to each fall in love with the MC. Asterisk\u2019s girls come in different shapes so that everyone\u2019s tastes are satisfied, and they\u2019re exploited so commonly that I wonder if Asterisk is trying to trying to appeal to the hentai artists or if the creators are bragging that they have girls in their series. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all very satisfied with yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nIf you need to be reminded again that the characters are bad, this is your lucky day! The characters are bad! So here\u2019s my favorite part, the character roast section:\\n\\n\r\nAyato \u2013 Things worth saying/making fun of are as follows:\\n\\n\r\nJulis \u2013 Independent black woman who don\u2019t need no bodyguard. If you ignore the fact that she\u2019s a figure of royalty, a high-ranking student, and that your IQ is lower than that of an earthworm, then it makes a lot of sense.\\n\\n\r\nClaudia \u2013 You know what? This is the best character in the whole show, and all who disagree can fucking fight me. She\u2019s the most direct with her affection for Ayato to the point where she flat-out says she wants to fuck. At least there\u2019s no bullshit about it, other than her having no reason to like Ayato and Ayato being a scrubmaster about it. (Do I need to bring up Cavalry again? WHAT SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KID IS GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS? DON\u2019T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS, ASSHOLE.) Also, please note that her ending scenes to preview the next episode literally do not exist. Nope.\\n\\n\r\nSaya \u2013 Hi, I\u2019m a deadpan loli with no real reason for being in this show other than to be the loli in this harem. If the point of her personality was to match the audience\u2019s evident opinion of her, they nailed it on the fucking head. \\n\\n\r\nKirin \u2013 Kinda younger-looking girl with big tits. Apparently her dad\u2019s in jail, so she and her big tits need to win these festival things or something, and follow the guidance of her uncle who\u2019s abusive as hell for no reason. So, I guess at least this character and her big tits have some sort of conflict??? And then we can waste a couple episodes on her and her big tits?????? No need to thank A-1, I\u2019m sure they do it because they care. And for the record, the anime tells you at every waking moment that this character has big tits because we can\u2019t shove Claudia into every scene.\\n\\n\r\nLester \u2013 I\u2019M A DOUCHEBAG WITH MUSCLES. DISLIKE ME!\\n\\n\r\nIrene \u2013 Wincest.\\n\\n\r\nDid I miss anyone? Probably. Do I care? Probably not. \\n\r\nDid I have too much fun with that? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nKinda going into my next point, what the fuck is with everyone\u2019s hair in this thing? What sort of insane products are these people using that allow their hair to suspend in midair? Like holy hell, does their lack of personality somehow expel a gravitational field from their heads? It\u2019s insane, dude. They also have that wonderful, classic \u201cspot the major character\u201d look; if their hair is the color of something not really found in nature, they\u2019re important. If not, they might exist, but you won\u2019t remember them. Everyone below this line is some overly-generic CG filler person or something. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art might be dazzling to some, but I only see A-1 trying to compensate for their overall weak animation, and no amount of ass shots will redeem it. Even if you don\u2019t agree that the first episode is bad, you can\u2019t possibly tell me that, say, episode 4 looks good. Beyond the animation, the CG is the compensation part, as I couldn\u2019t ever get behind the flashiness and vibrancy of the magic and weapons. I mean, they\u2019re not bad\u2026 but they\u2019re certainly nothing special, especially since fights are so reliant on them.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, there\u2019s a lot of this CG technology that\u2019s omnipresent even outside of the fights, so it\u2019s not just a bunch of magic and glowing plastic weapons making lightsaber noises. This might\u2019ve been better to bring up in the setting/plot parts of this review, but whatever. Anyway, what the hell is all of this shit? All this technology and shit is literally omnipresent; everywhere you go, you see holograms of various functions. Where do these things even come from? How do they work? What can you do with this amazing technology besides open doors from across a room and use them as replacements for what we know as computers? Why am I asking questions that I know will NEVER be answered? \\n\\n\r\nLast thing about the art; who the FUCK is responsible for the next episode previews? You know, that shit at the very end of each episode where Claudia looks like she\u2019s in some visual novel but is animated like a 5-year-old edited it? Jesus Christ, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cringed so hard after watching something in an anime. I only watched one of these before deciding that I\u2019d never do it again, so please watch at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the soundtrack is\u2026 actually good. Some of it. I believe just one person (Rasmus Faber) did the entire score (my apologies if this is incorrect), and if that\u2019s the case, his electronic pieces are easily his strong point. (Which makes sense; I hear he\u2019s a DJ or something.) The OP and ED are pretty good as well. But unfortunately, the rest is mediocre at best. The more orchestral pieces don\u2019t quite stand out or are as memorable as the electronic pieces, but I don\u2019t want to seem more negative than positive in this section. I\u2019ll actually admit something was good in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut all those negatives aside, at least it wasn\u2019t as bad as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026Or was it?\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it\u2019s hard to decide on which is worse. I couldn\u2019t take either anime seriously, but Cavalry still made some attempt at being serious at one point. At least there\u2019s some sort of reason for the shit that\u2019s happening. Asterisk has nothing going on at all! But even if Asterisk did nothing, playing it safe worked to its advantage, because Cavalry\u2019s serious moments are heavily weighed down by the sheer awful, cringe-inducing scenes that infest it. I mean, Asterisk is bad, but it never made me uncomfortable. But Cavalry still did a couple things right, such as the art (mostly) and the romance (to a small extent). Asterisk has a few good songs, and that\u2019s about it. So my overall verdict as to which is worse\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSurprising myself a bit, I\u2019m giving that honor to The Asterisk War, mainly based on the fact that it did fuck all to help itself, while Cavalry at least made some legitimate attempt somewhere. And with that settled, I can walk away from this anime with a strange sense of satisfaction: that I was looking for a good match between two terrible anime, and I walked away with an unexpected, but satisfying result. Great job, Asterisk, you actually succeeded in something, by being the Worst One!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s all. Full score is below, thanks for\u2026 oh god\u2026 I just realized something. Invertia didn\u2019t change the morals of the characters, it changed the morals of the writers! And the producers! And whoever the hell else is responsible for this! Oh man, I think it\u2019s gotten to me as well! I went out of my way to watch a bad anime and I was just thankful for it being so terrible! Holy hell, this show is actually genius!\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 1/10\\n\r\nArt \u2013 4/10\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 1/10\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 1/10 \\n\r\nFavorite character \u2013 Claudia\\n\r\nFavorite episode \u2013 none\\n\r\nRecommended to \u2013 people who want to lower their MAL average score\\n\\n\r\nCongratulations are in order, for this is my very first 1/10 score. It was originally a 2/10, but after considering things more for this review, I can\u2019t think of any reason to give this anything higher. What did I like? The art was okay but pretty boring, and the soundtrack was pretty nice, but they\u2019re beside me for the most part. If they were actually great and really memorable, like, say, Guilty Crown, then that\u2019d probably let me raise it to a 2 or a 3. But even if GC is a pile of shit beyond the production, at least it made an honest attempt at writing a story and had some legitimately interesting moments. Asterisk has NOTHING that is interesting, whether it\u2019s due to a lack of explanations or just sheer unoriginality. I mean\u2026 well, I already wrote the review, so I won\u2019t go back. I guess all that needs to be said is that this anime is pretty ass.\\n\\n\r\nterisk.",

            "content": "Towards the end of 2015, two light novel adaptations became notable for sharing startling similarities between them. Chivalry of a Failed Knight was considered somewhat refreshing, occasionally playing around with awful tropes and channeling the power of competent screenplays and exciting directing to turn a school battle LN adaptation into something worth watching. Conversely, The Asterisk War failed to meet even the basic requirements to function as a generic work of fiction. It's barely worth the effort it takes to write about it, let alone animate it.\r\nBefore we start, I dare one of you to make a thread or a blog showcasing the exact amountof problems each episode has. Don't make a drinking game out of it, or you'll die of alcohol poisoning by episode 8. The show literally starts with the main puss ass lead walking into our Tsundere in the middle of undress, under the pretenses that she dropped something important to her. After she claims to owe him one, she tries to incinerate him out of nowhere, resenting him for the rest of the episode in the process. This sets a precedent as to how badly this show will execute and contradict everything, like being low enough to over-sexualize a 13-year-old who regularly gets slapped by her uncle and saved by Ayato, whilst simultaneously acting like her asking for a sparring match the main character she fought of her own volition before is in any way indicator of her strength as a person. Just to provide the illusion that broke as hell Ayato isn't obscenely powerful, they provide flimsy limiters that only work when he uses a specific weapon for too long, despite that he often goes past the time limit of the limiters with no problem until the match finishes. The show breaks its rules so often that its ravaged narrative arcs become that much worse. Even the interesting ideas this dreck presents aren't capitalized, let alone worth capitalizing on in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building is easily the most fractured part of this dumpster fire. The tournament arc has been hinted to be a tournament in which things can get deadly and bloody for competitors, but no one gets remotely injured or killed, aside from that one pointless and awkwardly done flashback scene at the very beginning., if students can summon hovering screens with their hands for no reason, then why do they need to hold them, and why is there actual paper involved? The world-building of this show is some of the worst I've ever seen, as if the narrative wasn't already cheap enough with its trite nonsense, missed opportunities, and romantic mood killers designed to preserve a terrible harem.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Ayato is as horribly characterized and intolerable as his harem, which is one of the worst in the mainstream anime hemisphere. Julis is a trash tier Tsundere who plays up that trope to obnoxious degrees, especially when she retardedly blows up her room in an attempt to scorch him alive for the crime of accidentally seeing her in her underwear. Saya is an obnoxiously possessive loli with all the intolerable tropes you'd expect. Kirin is an annoyingly squeaky pushover with a ridiculously lousy character arc As for Claudia, anything she has going for her can be boiled down to sass, sex appeal, and an insidious and mysterious nature that I guarantee this show won't capitalize on. The other characters are either stupid or wasted, with almost no middle ground beyond just being \"there\". Easily the most crushing case of the latter is Irene, who is a dangerous punk with a heart of gold and an interesting design. They go out of their way to do nothing interesting with her when it's time for her to fight our unbearable main lead in the finale, and the closest we ever get is how her younger sister keeps her in check, which has also been done a million times. When a character like her is the best character in the show, it speaks volumes of just how worthless this cast is.\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, this show isn't much better. The colors are certainly bright, and some of the character designs can actually be pretty neat and sexy but the artwork is pretty miserable. It's a low-budget SAO and Aldnoah.Zero style with even shittier and more incomprehensible choreography, and even more all-encompassing fugly CGI. Much like the show itself, the visuals are bad at even pulling off being generic and mediocre, barring a few relatively dazzling environments. Even the aesthetics are gaudy and nonsensical, and the cuts of actually good animation are few and far between. At least Andloah.Zero had some flourish to make up for generic style and cheap CGI.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is a mixed bag of vanilla background noise, awful dubstep, and ill-fitting emotional pieces. Even the OP is a milquetoast pop song, in spite of it being catchy. The ED titled \"Waiting for the rain\" by Maaya Sakamoto and Ramsus Faber is the only stellar bit of music in the show, as it's a pretty stellar emotional track to close out each episode with. Even the visuals are interesting, with the show swapping the positions of a bunch of color-coded silhouettes of each harem member, which are accompanied by some actually pleasant techno melodies and Maaya Sakamoto's warm, even uplifting voice. Still, if having one good track is all the audio needs to be unquestionably better than every other aspect of this show combined, then I really can't find a better way to call this show dogshit.\\n\\n\r\nPeople put themselves through hell slaving away at this, and no one did a remotely good job beyond the musicians. That's as sad as the show itself. This anime isn't even infuriating or laughable, just annoying and lifeless, which is one of the purest tells that this has no value I can assign to it, let alone any reason to be watched enough to garner a second season. It even fails to live up to its title in any way, shape or form. How this got popular is beyond me, and I'm glad it's dead.",

            "content": "When it comes to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk or the Asterisk War, there are a few things that can go side and side for me. On one hand the show wasn\u2019t so bad as I thought, considering the way the show went wasn\u2019t as terrible as I thought, in fact; I will say that there were actually a few things that I liked about the series and this would include my personal evaluation, some few of the expositions and the way they handled the battle tournament aspect which was really nice. On the other hand however, the show still has some flaws that holds the showback the scales which is not really a good thing considering having some issues to my standards can cause some difficulty to recommend the show (including someone that\u2019s looking for battle tourney series of this type of genre). So you would have a mind from what I am going up towards this review, but let\u2019s just see if Gakusen Toshi Asterisk of The Asterisk War is considered a show to at least be watchable even with the issues or it\u2019s just considered a bad experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nTo give a thought about the show, let\u2019s get into the synopsis.\\n\\n\r\n In The Academy City on the water (also known as Asterisk) is the world\u2019s biggest battle entertainment, \u201cStar Wars Festival.\u201d The young boys and girls belonging into six different academies made their wishes Shining Armaments in their hands.\\n\\n\r\nBasically in a way, our main protagonist Ayato goes to this said academy by an invitation from the Student Council President Claudia Enfield and suddenly he stumbles upon Julis, the main female protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words as how people call this show \u201cStar Wars: Harem Edition\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nBasically the start of the show goes to the same old generic trope, this usually happens and depending on the person this can go both \u201clet\u2019s go and just wait\u201d or towards \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this before\u201d. Of course we\u2019re going to see this every time, this is usually one of the trends actually, however what matters is the execution afterwards that introduction.\\n\\n\r\nTo start things off towards the anime, I will say I will give some props towards the show for giving at least enough information without feeling spoon feeding like Mahouka, because it in cooperates enough info without feeling left out for me. It\u2019s something I like about the show because it has a way to not get me bored enough or feel quite lazy about it, just giving at least enough details to know about said mechanics of the world and the aspects of the show so it would give a more decent idea of how it goes. However exposition can depend for people actually, for me I find the way they did the info nice without feeling like I can\u2019t comprehend stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the show doesn\u2019t really go and become too dragged out for me to get straight into the main events, it actually goes and build up the training at least for the actual things happening.\\n\\n\r\nTo not go into further details on the anime, even if the show goes to a generic way start as the episodes passed by, you would sooner or later notice that it goes to a degree into a different direction, where it mainly focuses on the Ser Veresta the battle tournament, which was the main event that the series has built up from my previous statement.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also focuses on the teamwork aspect along in battle tourney trainings and battles, now that\u2019s actually clich\u00e9 however for my personal eyes the way it\u2019s handled for say the least it was good enough considering the relationship between the two main characters and the other supporting character, but talking about the two main characters' partnerships, the teamwork between them weren\u2019t as bad at first, as the episodes passed by the relationship in terms of that was nice enough however not one of the best to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to keep another note the anime doesn't focus on the romance (since it has a romance tag in) and for my eyes it's kind of saying there's a romance but my previous statements are their main focus of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nPacing for the show seems rather nice and also perfect and suiting for the show considering for me if it does rush somethings I think it could break and destroy the buildup for the main event the anime has made throughout the anime and it just doesn\u2019t go well for it. Just my personal thought on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nInteractions are not one of the best but they\u2019re not as bad as I thought for the main cast of characters. In all honestly and this comes as rather personal but I liked some of the moments of the anime where I actually giggled upon.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least the anime has some sort of nice things to go across however there are somethings that could become out of place for the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing sometimes I personally think some the fights could have been less predictable in a way although there were a few nice surprises along the way, it\u2019s just at times I felt like it could have been done better for me, although the fights aren\u2019t really bad in all honesty, also predictability it\u2019s just depending for my perspective on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe second being the couple of clich\u00e9s being around the show which kind of affects some few things and little aspects of the anime because although it\u2019s not a bad thing it just how its utilizes kind of ticks the viewer off in some way to say the least for my personal eye, and as well with the fan service it just depends on the person as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe third issue being the main character, although this all depends on the viewer's eye, Ayato basically beats everyone. Anyone in the case, but I guess not to the point of being on the same level as Tatsuya or Kirito I suppose. I will state why down below in the characters category, and in the end of the day, this comes for different people. For me I felt rather annoyed with it a bit but it's better off than having one person giving a one hit K.O badly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the final part being the final episode of the first season. In other words the final fight, while the final episode was very good overall, I can't deny there was something that came out of place and that's actually something buggy and I really don't know if they can explain that later on in it's second cour.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day for the story department the show isn't really unique with its story in terms of the whole plot but the episodes made up for it decently enough for me, and to at least have this considered as passable due to the balance of entertainment and the exposition. The series isn't also one of the better written series since the writing of it can be considered either way simple and not everything so special in it's way. It's not also supposed to be a series that it needs a lot of stuff to make it better, in fact adding too much in this case would break the show, so that for me at least the story is passable enough for people to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t want to explain much in this department considering when it comes to anime characters in this type of genre they\u2019re not quite special in all honestly. They are your stereotypical archetypes and cast that you have probably seen in the previous shows. If you have seen anything like these of course. However it doesn\u2019t really mean they\u2019re bad either for my eyes unless how they\u2019re really presented. They are just\u2026 mediocre to a degree in the overall curriculum of character departments, which is a weak point on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nAyato being the main male protagonist is shown as your stereotypical dense protagonist with to say the least, copy and paste personality to say the least. However the only thing that makes him a little interesting for me would be his actual backstory that was brought after said episodes, in which he actually has a limit of using his powers due to that flashback being presented in the anime. It\u2019s nothing very unique in all honestly for my opinion but that at least is more interesting to see along. I give him bonus for that.\\n\\n\r\nJulis being your main female character which she acted like a Tsundere girl at the show from the start, I somehow managed to like her in all honestly because that was of course strayed away to a degree for some reason. She also has a motivation in this case in the anime which makes it more reasonable of why she was participating in the events in the first place. Now saying that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s nothing special for her but as I would say for Ayato, she gets bonus at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two girls from the main four characters, Kirin and Saya are your stereotypical Loli character and Kuudere, the only thing I would say about them is that for Saya, most of the time she makes me laugh with her commentaries and at the same time for Kirin, she doesn\u2019t really fight in all honesty (if I can say) like how the others\u2019 weapons. The only bonuses I can give is that they work together as a team and that\u2019s something nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe other girl Claudia doesn\u2019t really become presented or relevant most of the time in the first season and she only appears in some scenarios, other than that I would say I like how they put her later on in the anime however it\u2019s quite a sort of disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are quite forgettable with the exception at the moment for Irene since she did got a backstory at the final episodes, while it was kind of a awkward move I found this quite passable enough. Everyone seemed used as some sort of characters just for the sake to be there, unless they make them more relevant in the second season of the anime series which quite frankly I was impressed it got a second cour, which could mean more things would come for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I said the characters are overall mediocre to be honest. Yeah. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nIf anything I would say about the art, I would say the art style for this series is not quite one of the best out there, however it does look decent enough for its quality. As well for its background art it looks nice enough that it also fits with the designs of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are not really original to an extension however the designs looks above average enough and not that much complaining about it to say the least. Each character looks dandy in a way.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation standpoint I will say it\u2019s not one of the most fluid animation out there, but surprisingly enough it\u2019s not anything ground breaking to my eyes. If anything, it has a minor amount of choppy moments where the most it seems rather passable enough. It also can be an eye candy towards the viewer and depending on the person watching if you like battle tourneys you might enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nIn the angle standpoint they actually do a decent job with the angles and the moments when the characters are fighting against one another, it doesn\u2019t feel off for half time but for me half the time I would say I didn\u2019t liked how it actually looked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I suppose I could put the animation and art category as being one of those good ones overall because it really doesn\u2019t look that bad, and it has some little decent stuff into it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: \\n\\n\r\nI would say the music isn\u2019t one of the most memorable things around, however the music has a mix of techno and a bit of instrumental ost at times at the fights, where it seems really enjoyable and at the times it\u2019s quite catchy when watching. At the same time I would say the few comical osts seem very fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound I would say nothing stands out from the sound department as in the effects, however they\u2019re put at the right place and time without feeling quite cringey.\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice acting tone department (since by the time this review is released it will be reviewed with tone of the Japanese dub) I wouldn\u2019t say the voice acting was bad, however they\u2019re not all that great either in a way. Though I give props to the voice actors to say the least because it fits with its cast of anime characters and it\u2019s rather fine to say the least (despite me hating the voice actor for Ayato but not as the person voicing but for the voice for the character itself)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and Ending songs both are one of my most favorites of the season considering it goes to my personal taste to my eyes. In all honesty music is subjective, let\u2019s say that.  For the Opening it gives a catchy J-Pop vibe and the tone of the OP fits with the show, as for the ED it gives a harmonic in a sense feel when hearing it, and the English sounds right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest I liked the show a lot, this is rather a personal income due to the previous points above that the show did benefitted in a way that for me I felt satisfied with the outcome, in the end we\u2019re getting a second cour of the show, so let\u2019s expect for the better or for the worse. Just to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? This all depends on your taste on anime actually, or the genres in itself. If you want at least a show that buildups the events bit by bit (for this season) you can give the show a shot actually, and maybe you would have fun with this, however I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to people that do not like anything like that from a series, especially for those that hates or dislikes the ecchi/harem battle tourney. To conclude, I will leave it at your hands, you\u2019ll decide. \\n\\n\r\nUntil the second cour, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's totally okay to watch a show with low expectations. Sometimes to balance a great anime, you gotta watch a bad one just to put you back in your place. It's a requirement to have watched poorly done shows so you know where your tastes are and also broaden your horizons. The Asterisk War serves as one of those shows that will give you appreciation of shows like High School of The Dead and other shows that have poorly written stories and brick wall characters. This is a must watch if you need to remember that there are really uninspiring anime.\r\nStorywise, not much to say.Gary Stu comes to new school, all the ladies fall for him the end. Sounds like the typical harem anime because it IS a typical harem anime. The whole thing is a tease and shows snippets that relate to the protagonist indirectly, but fails to establish a basis for it. What I mean if that sounded pretentious, is the lack of an overarching conflict. We follow young Ayato, but for what? All we see is him turning red at every little female physical contact. \\n\r\nDeus Ex Machina phenomena is arguably always going to break a show. I think it works in this show's favor just because there weren't really any upsides to begin with. It gives a little more excitement in what was a lackluster show. Arguably it isn't phenomena but foreshadowed. Ayato's power makes zero sense considering the circumstances revolved around him and that the whole show seemed to have miss the point was just bad writing on many levels. But hey, what more to look forward to in a show then a guy's head in between breasts? \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters is awful and blame the story telling for that. None of the characters mesh well and there isn't any positive to get out of observing their actions and motives. They all suck. If gary stu didn't fit the description of the main protagonist, then I don't know what to believe. This guy is the most uninteresting (for lack of a better word) fuckboy. Something that works against the show is that it was really trying to take Ayato's circumstances seriously. The tropes are quite abundant and make all the female characters seem like cut outs of cariactures placed in an anime. And to munch the very uninteresting main protagonist at that. The Asterisk War really is a tease when it comes to scenes of sexualizing the females. Cuz boobs and butts sell right? I'm losing brain cells trying to think of anything to write for this show.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING IS VERY BAD. My ear was bleeding due too Saya and Kirin's voices oh my goodness. It is awful and to hear baby squeals and \"jealous\" grumbles is reason enough to AVOID this show. I say it's a must watch because this might set the bar low enough for anything to come after seem like a masterpiece. We're all masochists when it comes to anime though so it's okay. Sound is underwhelming but the EDM is a good twist in action scenes.\\n\r\nAs for animation, it is the Irregular of magic high school esque. Flashy colors and CG stuff. Considering how little action there is, animation isn't really great. Lot more exposition than there is fighting and we know how that works out in a harem. \\n\\n\r\nI came into this show knowing it was going to be bad so I didn't really think of it as anything I haven't seen before. It brings nothing new to the table, nothing inspiring, no noteworthy scenes. It's just a letdown in all aspects besides I guess teasing if that has any credibility. I'd surf the internet if I wanted to be uninspired but I guess the one thing the show has going for it is it's opening. Its pretty cool, not that cool but its okay. A typical harem that lacks a resolution is what can best describe The Asterisk War.",

            "content": "WARNING: Review contains minor spoilers, as the show has almost no story and some one off events need to be discussed to get across the show's quality.\r\nAsterisk Wars is a series which has been derided by many and lauded by few, although the most common consensus to this show is likely \"average\". In my opinion, though, the people who pointed out all of this show's flaws are pretty much perfectly on track: This show has an unlikeable and generic cast set in an ill-concieved setting with no plot to drive it and poor fights.\r\nLets take it from the top. Our show begins when Ayato Amagiri,your standard flatbread hero, arrives at one of the six elite fighting schools, Seidoukan Academy, so he can be a fighter, as he is a Genestella which is basically a superhuman. The first action we get to see is him returning a handkerchief to a girl...by leaping through her open window?! What rational person does this, even if they can superjump places? It is a total invasion of privacy and instead of just, say, getting to her door and knocking, or shouting to her, or hell going to the window and saying she dropped it or any number of things, he just leaps into the open window of a total stranger's house. Inside is our female lead, Julis, and naturally since this is a harem series, that means we need to walk in on her dressing. Don't ask why a beautiful princess would decide to undress with an open, undrawn window where anyone can see, take pictures or so on of her.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, Julis is upset about this! She is one of the top ranked fighters in the school and so you can guess her reply to this problem. The first few episodes are dedicated to showing off some of the main characters and exposition. Lots and lots of exposition, most of which isn't even true exposition, like Claudia telling the main character a bunch of terms and things about the city that the viewer will have no idea about. Right, on that note, the two other main girls introduced now are Claudia and Saya: Saya is one of Ayato's old friends and therefor has the hots for him, but we don't really get a lot of their history together, and she is your general emotionless girl or \"Dandere\" type. Claudia is the hot, very forwardly sexual student council president who flatout prepositions Ayato for sex multiple times (the first time, in episode 3, being a hilariously bad scene for Ayato's reply) and liking him for...really no well explained reason, she just kind of shows up to exposit at him and then wants to fuck him after giving him a strong weapon.\\n\\n\r\nA big issue is that all of these characters are pretty generic and have very little chemistry with each other: In fact, they very rarely even interact with people unless Ayato is directly involved and the focus, making them feel like they're just gone from the show when not existing, and we get very little insight to anyone's private lives aside from Claudia. Ayato is your generically overpowered main character, whose power seems to mostly be hitting really hard and his sword cutting things really well, with a cardboard attitude of \"I don't really care but I do\". I should also note that most shows in this fight involve Ayato aaaaand are boring, with most of the first season's tournament arc ending dedicated to Ayato/Julis and the other MC teams casually curb stomping their opponents in under a minute.\\n\\n\r\nThis is NOT how you write an overpowered main character. Overpowered main characters can work fine: For an example of that, Josuke from Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure would usually be considered pretty OP, with his stand Crazy Diamond being very physically powerful, pretty dang fast and having a potent ability to fix things. In fact, Josuke's stand for most of the Part 4, would be considered a lot stronger than the main antagonist's, but by giving the antagonist actual guile he becomes a menacing threat, and giving minor villains powers which can exploit Crazy Diamond through actual weaknesses, for example its short range, or having specialized abilities, ends up making some pretty great fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is practically based around the idea of the heroes being overpowered and weaves it nicely into the plot, taking a weakness and turning it into a plot strength.\\n\\n\r\nAyato is just...generically overpowered. He can move faster than everyone and hit harder to everyone and generically power himself up with yells and special effects to be even strongerer and then he beats up his opponents! Not once does Ayato display any battlefield tactics, special skills (the special attacks he calls are almost all literally a sword slash that doesn't seem to be any different than normal) or abilities of note to make his fighting interesting. Its the worst way to write an overpowered MC, especially since naturally in a harem series this means things like beating up the highly ranked female harem members because they are generically not as strong as the AMAZING Ayato Amagiri and now they will fall for him or he will carry them in his arm because they totally couldn't do it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nJulis is your generic Tsundere girl who will probably be the harem winner. She has very few motivations and is one of the most blush heavy Tsunderes I have ever seen, even when she is going through the heavy Tsun parts, and her power is to control fire, which is never used beyond \"circle of fire trap\", \"shoot fire\" or \"fiery explosion\", and most of the time she shoots fire at people and they just get owned. Saya is small girl with a huge gun, which is only used to fire generic laser blasts. Claudia actually has some neat powers, dual wielding triangle lightsaber blades with an ability to see the future, but she doesn't actually get any fight scenes so. Kirin's power is \"has a sword\" and gets paired with Saya for some quite boring fights.\\n\\n\r\nOh, right, Kirin. She's another main character introduced in a latter pair of episodes, which I hesitate to call a \"mini-arc\" given its anemic lack of plot or advancement, and is a 13 year old with large boobs which get way too much emphasis for her age and is also somewhat weird to have in Ayato's harem in the first place. She largely comes off as a superflous character who exists to give Saya a partner but since she is a female on this show she MUST also be added to Ayato's harem. Her voice also is very annoying even for the usual archetype and she has the spine of a jellyfish without actually acting abused enough to fit her supposed backstory. Also, she is somehow ranked #1 in the school when Claudia is #2. Kirin wields a normal, non-laser sword, one of the only people to do so in the show. Claudia dual wields lightsabers and can SEE THE FLIPPING FUTURE. The only possible explanation is Claudia does not give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to talk about a character who you would think is minor but frankly feels like he recurs as much, if not more, than Saya and Kirin: Lester MacPhail, whose name is quite literally pronounced MacFail. MacFail here is one of the most anemic attempts at a \"bully\" character I have seen in quite some time, being established as a loser who has lost to Julis 3 times but is itching to fight her and lose again. He is never displayed as a competent threat and nearly gets killed by one of the laser swords getting upset at him and flying around trying to murder him in a...hilariously awkward scene. He loses every fight he gets into, although SOMEHOW he is the one who gets the \"valiantly fights but loses\" fight scene to Irene, which if anything makes Irene look weaker by having to expend any effort on this failure. Its also hilarious because this guy is supposed to be kinda badass, like having built up muscle when Genestella are supposed to have trouble doing so, but he is basically a total loser in the show and one of the most pathetic strong man/bully types I've ever watched. This makes him more endearing than most of the main cast!\\n\\n\r\nFinally for characters, I will mention Irene, the only decent character on the entire show: Pretty generic, sure, but her and her younger sister Priscilla are basically the only characters with actual energy or personality to them which helps makes any scenes in the show feel alive. She wields a laser-scyche (basically every weapon but Kirin's in the show is lightsaber-esque) which can control gravity and turns its user into a vampire because it requires blood to function. Since Priscilla can regenerate herself rapidly, Irene can feast on her blood to power up without worry, while she tries to just stay out of trouble, a somewhat interesting team dynamic. Their backstories are pretty generic and their powers are ill explained, but they are unique enough and Irene is the only character in the show who uses her power in a variety of interesting ways, making her basically the only character to be remotely competently done in this show, although her boss and essentially loan shark Dirk is decently set up, which naturally means she basically is put on a bus to end the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, there just isn't much to comment on. Ayato gets to the school, acclimates to the school a little, gets into some fights, meets Kirin and has some more random fights, then they go to the tournament and fight some jobbers until Irene shows up for a mini-arc to close the season. Ayato gets some very, very light setup for plot involving his sister, Julis and Saya get some weak motivations (help an orphanage she did stuff in as a kid, she wasn't an orphan she just hung there, and advertise her father's guns respectively) aaaaaaaand that's pretty much it. Backstory for the series is vague, with Apocalyptic Event causing super people to show up and a really terrible Megacorp to take the place of nations, which doesn't really factor into the show at all. The tournaments are supposed to be gladiatorial, blood filled spectacles to satiate the populace, but less people die in them than the infamous \"Hallway of Running\" from Hunter x Hunter so it reeeally doesn't show up.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, most effects are dull and forgettable, with literal stock lightsaber sounds being used at times, and most background music is entirely forgettable. Not really good sound effects on the powers, either. The OP is fairly bad and that counts for a lot of the sound design, while the ED is okay, although stylistically even slice of life shows like K-On and Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon have done this ED style better. Art-wise the show actually usually isn't that bad, but it does suffer from not really having a very discernable style and bad looking effects in fights. The reason it goes down to a 2 is actually because of the horrible, Fates end of support style CGIs that are in the post-credits scene (usually involving Claudia), which already looked awkward in that, but here is done with way worse animation and ends up looking laughable and disturbing. This was so bad it dragged the animation score from a 4-5~ to a 2. Enjoyment is a 2 because it is a good show to talk to friends about the issues with and Irene's part was ever vaguely entertaining, but is a definitive 1 if you're not going to have anyone to go with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Asterisk Wars has quite little to get people involved and was a pretty miserable experience, if you want a good harem show there are far better options out there and if you want an action show there are far better options out there. However, it can be worth watching if you want to form your own opinion on it (it has ANYONE who likes it, after all) or because of all the analysis done on it, or simply if you like to ocassionally watch bad shows and see what happens. I'm still going to watch Season Two, after all: I gotta see things through to the end.",

I really did love that he was powerful (i guess not spoil). It does reminds me of SAO (Sword Art Online). Swords there and swords here.

Often announced simultaneously for example:\r\nShinmai Maou no Testament, Gate\r\nStory 8 / 10\r\nThe story begins with Amagiri Ayato a transfer student to the Seidoukan Academy and progresses as ground work for what's to come for the future of a student that does not care about the combat called festas that surely but slowly is getting himself riddled on something darker. \r\nSince this is a dual cour series I won't go into detail until I've seen 2nd courbut it's well executed giving the serious moments their bubbles and good portrayal of character bonding on an Academy where everyone it's everyone enemy.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Animation 8.5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk has great animation and above average art that combined are way more than decent. It's objectively good with no problems.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI caught myself singing the OP of this series and goes without saying that the choice of BGM and OST are very good. The voice actors are very good as well and the ED does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nOn the first cour the character are very well developed and their dynamics are quite entertaining. The chemistry of the female lead Julis-Alexia is reminiscing of normally black haired heroines that are usually portrayed as very confident and proud (Kanzaki Kaori from A Certain Magical Index). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this first cour and I'm looking forward to the second cour. Mostly from the choice of visuals that seem to be a mixture from (Strike the Blood and A Certain Magical Index).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to someone who doesn't get bothered by extended groundwork and light hearted comedy, romance with the bonus of spectacular short battle sequences. \\n\\n\r\nDo not watch if you're illiterate (Using the Term loosely) and couldn't or don't know airing formats nor like Harem oriented anime.",

Well, one can't make a review of this anime without compering to another anime namely \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" or at least on the story (up) side, since it both features the same plot where it involves the female MC who met the male MC in a very awkward situation and plot wise, both partners have to compete in a contest that would pit their skills against another opponent . I mean if one where watchingboth animes their is at 70% similarities, where I rather not discuss anymore details and both climaxes where focus on fighting the strongest female contender, which is why I gave this anime's category a 5. About this anime's art(up) thought there where some fanservice involve, it didn't focus much on it to sell, thought they did made Claudia and Violet's  bikini fanservice  a little bit bitchy, but the good thing was that it only appeared briefly, so that is why I gave it a 6 for this anime's art. Sound (up), actually I just have nothing much to comment on this anime's sound pertaiting to the VA who did the character's voices, but I don't have much love for both the opening and closing themes of this anime, so I just limit it to a 6. Charcter (up) ok, the relationship between Ayato and Julis maybe a bit in the ambiguous side given that Julis was just too pridish to admit that she like Ayato and Ayato was just this garden variety harem guy , it was still good enough to see the two being together and supporting one another so for that this category should be \"GOOD enough. Unfortunately this anime has introduced too many support characters that they're not given enough aired time let alone that those from diffrent school weren't that much of climatic when it comes to the competition, but still, it's \"Good.\" Enjoyment (up), since this is the season were I've been watching 3 animes with a harem genre, my enjoyment was just limited as to how it will end and that's as \"FAIR as it can be, so overall (up)this anime was decent enough to such level that it didn't rely on the fanservice to sell, but it lacks it's own identity that it can be compared to  \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" , so season 2??????? Why not?\\n",

Oh yeah, there's also something about a magical school and a competition. The world in not very well presented.\r\nThe characters are simply walking, talking stereotypes. You probably won't even remember their names, only the character tropes. There's the very naive and powerful main character who doesn't get that ALL the girls are in love with him. There's the mainfemale lead who's a tsundere (not even a good one at that), there is the loli dandere (she is also not very well made cause she looks and sounds like the supercritical dandere, but she's very active and not at all shy nor quiet), there's the big boob loli girl who is completely depended on the main character and etc.\\n\r\nThe only reason why i'm not giving this  the worst score is because the animation and the look isn't all that bad, even if the fight scenes are terrible. Ah yes, the fight scenes. The genre of this anime is ACTION! But the creators idea of action/fights is apparently flashing colourful lights really, really fast and hoping that you won't notice.\\n\r\nBut I must give credit where credit is due: the music isn't all that bad.

Of all the animes watched I can think of three animes namely Absolute Duo,Freezing and Infinite Stratos which has a similiar story and development. And this season (Fall 2015) an another similiar anime 'Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry' have been airing as well. Although both of them are good and intresting itmakes me wonder if if the money could have been used for a more creative and unique project.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art is great. Contains a lot of great scenery and special effects were good , not to mention battle art is cool as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - Opening song is phenomenal, sound track fits well and sounds good. Not much else to say at this point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 - Characters are pretty basic and its nothing new. I have seen same type of character many times. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 - I am without a doubt enjoying the anime, I look forward to the day each episode is released for the fun 22 minutes of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - It is a good anime without a DOUBT and have a lot of room for character development so it is one reason to watch it.

As a result of the fallout, a new society wasformed, one where people now possessed magical powers and were able to wield weapons made from the stones in these meteors called 'Luxes'.  And here, we follow the story of Amagiri Ayato, a boy who enters one of 6 schools (Seidoukan specifically) and enters the Phoenix Festa in order to find out what happened to his missing sister several years back.  Then he comes across a girl named Julis who starts to snap at him because of no fault of his own and  well, you get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk is generic.  There's no way around that fact.  The show focuses on Ayato as he progresses through his life at Seidoukan, entering the Festa, and coming across various characters along the way.  Most notably, harem members.  And really, that's about it.  He meets someone new (or old, since Saya is childhood friend), helps them, moves on.  Even during the fighting festival, he manages to help other girls in that.  Because of this, there really isn't much to say about the show.  The fact that it's generic makes it so that a lot of the plot points are very predictable, a lot of what happens doesn't really add much tension, and nothing really stands out as extraordinary or noteworthy to talk about.  It's not really bad, but at the same time it's not really good.  It's rather bland and I really can't express that any more.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Generic \\n\r\n-  Nothing really noteworthy to say about this show\\n\r\n-  This is just filler text.  Because there's nothing interesting to really say about Asterisk's story, I thought just add in this little bit so I could have three things in this section of the review.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in Asterisk reflect its story, by being as uninteresting as they can be.  (Because we all love anime tropes, right?)\\n\\n\r\nAmagiri Ayato is...well, what'd you expect in an anime like this.  He's a harem protag who's entire purpose in this show is to seek vengeance (or something) and help out any female human he possibly can before converting them to the Ayato religion where they worship his holy D.  (Sigh.  We've seen this a million times.)  As such, he doesn't really have anything unique about him to talk about.  Maybe the fact that he's not as OP as other harem protags that fit this category, but I don't think that deserves mention.\\n\\n\r\nThen the girls.  Let me line them up for you.  \\n\\n\r\nJulis = Token Tsundere\\n\r\nSaya = Kuudere Osananajimi (childhood friend)\\n\r\nKirin = Dandere Imouto\\n\r\nClaudia = Sexy Onee-san\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I really need to elaborate more, do I?  Ok.  Moving on then.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, well, they're not really all that important, according to the plot.  Most of the characters really serve to be plot-based and move what is happening in this series behind the scenes.  Others on the other hand are meant to be the main focus of the show, (aka, the harem girls), and as such are treated with a little bit more screentime.  Don't expect a lot from these people.  Most of them aren't really that interesting aside from a tiny handful.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Bland characters\\n\r\n-  Most of the side cast is meant to move along the plot\\n\r\n-  So, how's your day going?  (I ran out of things to talk about again.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Asterisk is something that I would say has more worth on it than its story and characters combined, and then some.  While the artstyle isn't really all that fantastic in terms of originality since it all pretty much looks the same as a lot of anime these days, the fighting scenes and its effects look pretty, so I'll give it that much.  Everything else, pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nice fight scenes\\n\r\n+/- Pretty standard animation\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Asterisk is also something that has a little bit more worth to the show as a whole.  Its OP \"Brave New World\" has a very techno and fast-paced feel that actually sounds rather good and fits with the show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand is another track that is rather nice to listen to.  It's quite somber and has a mellow tone to it that's relaxing and calm to listen to.  It's a good set of tracks to a not so very good show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  It's a harem; I tolerated it because of that, so there.  I'm not going to do my usual stuff because there really isn't anything good or bad to say about this show.  It's generic, and that enough should say enough about it.  It's a rather bland experience that doesn't leave too much to think about, and as such, isn't really worth talking about.  I don't hate it, I don't love it, I'm just indifferent to it.  If you want to watch a generic harem...well, you can watch this one.  A lot others are honestly crappier than this one.",

            "content": "I tried this just to see what a truly terrible anime is. I thought there might be some sort of sick enjoyment out of the complete shittiness.\r\nAnd there is, but it's buried deep under an extremely thick layer of pure unabated rage.\r\nI'll just say right now that I gave TAW exactly 4 minutes of my time. Because in 4 minutes everything was said. I watched Shinsekai Yori from the same studio, an anime I considered to have an excellent story and good characters but generally terrible production values and design. This is the same. Except the story and characters are shit too.\r\nSo why am Iwriting a \"review\" from 4 minutes of observation? Because it was, and I'm not being ironic, enough to be sure of a number of things:\\n\\n\r\n-This anime is godawful stupid\\n\r\n-This anime is godawful lazy\\n\r\n-This anime is just godawful, but with a special taste for mixing pretentious hardcore with stupidly stupid(I would have said lighthearted but come on, it's more stupid than anything)\\n\\n\r\nStory: A bunch of teenagers fight with swords because plot and the hero gets every girl on his penis. Think it's not enough? It's literally the entire plot of season 1. I checked. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: In less than 4 minutes I saw a bunch of random 3D models in a generic blurred background. More than that the art in general is generic and lazy, the characters look nothing fantastic, they have a pink-haired girl with long hair in there and they manage to make her look sort of ugly. Considering that long pink hair is pretty much my exact taste in anime girls, I don't even get how they managed that. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI was told the soundtrack is good and I want to believe it because less than 3 mins in I heard a super happy theme that was the most misfit and tone-shifting thing I heard in years. At 0:00 you're in a fight, at 0:05 the girl is crying in happiness and thankfulness, at 0:10 she's about to launch a fireball at the protagonist, and at 0:15 you're hearing the happiest theme there is. Was this even made by humans or computer generated by a first version AI attempting to appeal to us? So yeah it's a good soundtrack but if this is how they're going to use it, then 2/10 and holy god will anything about this not be completely lazy and sucky?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In 3 minutes I met:\\n\r\n-The teenager girl who is into a fight against a masked guy and says \"sorry x\" after she loses and dies\\n\r\n-The teenager guy who x was, who is the most generic here-to-help-all guy who's also crazy strong and is flustered everytime a boob is even hinted at\\n\r\n-Teenager tsundere girl with pink hair who manages to go from tsun to dere in less than 10 seconds then back to tsun then pulls a magic blast and destroys everything. And who could look a lot less shit.\\n\r\n-The teenager director(?) of the school who's as smily as her tits and sex drive are huge.\\n\r\n I would put 0/10 if possible, but I guess it'll be one. Pathetic is certainly a good definition, there is NO EFFORT at all. I won't even dignify this schlock with the word \"characterisation\", but at the very least, if your characters are shallow, make them fun. Here the production values are so low, the story is told in such a slingshot way, that even something as simple as a tsundere character comes off as false, and as not fun. I mean come on, could you get any lower for a professional studio? Actually don't answer that, I'm afraid of the answer.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 without irony again. If I could swallow this inane schlock for more than a few minutes I would probably find an extremely powerful sick enjoyment out of hating this with every cell of my body. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I can't, and I have less terrible things to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I didn't stop 3 minutes in because it was shit. If that was it, I'd have stood it to at least the end of the episode. No. My mind refused to carry along with this tremendous piece of lazy, barely shoved out crap, after two lines:\\n\r\n-After this event(the genostella children), the world was changed and a new order was made by [insert organisation whose name I can't even remember and who controls Asterisk Island]\\n\r\n-Due to the changes, a new morality was born in the world\\n\r\n-And now, panties\\n\\n\r\nWHAT? ARE YOU ACTIVELY TRYING TO FUCK WITH MY REMAINING BRAIN CELLS?\\n\\n\r\nYou literally took 3 sentences to go from \"a new world order\" to \"a new morality and set of social values\" to \"PANTIES\"!\\n\\n\r\nDo the people who put this mindless crap on the market even know that you can't throw stuff like \"new world order/new morality\" without actually showing how or what? That's like saying \"and thus the greatest soldier ever was born\". But then we don't see the soldier, we don't know how he fights, or even for whom.\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen such a sharp, poorly done storytelling in my entire life. I literally dropped it right then and there, paused the video, tried some more but the damage was done. In less than 4 minutes I was convinced that this wasn't just generic and poor, it was also horribly told and had absolutely no idea of what it was talking about. And lots of shows are generic and mindless, but this one is lazy and veeeeery poorly made to boot.\\n\\n\r\nIf I ever want to hate anime, I'll be sure to come back to this.",

The competition is about some Magical Fantasy Fighting Competition which up till now I still do not understand their powers and stuff relating to it. With the anime being completed, the ending ends offwith a fight and some unnecessary fan-service. Which I think is a bad ending considering that I did not understand it \\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThat art was pretty good as it shows the vibrant colours and the Art Directors must have spent large amount of time reviewing the art and improving it. And this is one of the good things and maybe its the ONLY GOOD THING about this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending was pretty good and the voice actors and actresses have played their roles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 3\\n\r\nJust like any other harem shows, there are unnecessary fan-service and annoying characters that always ruin the good moments of the show. It is very disturbing to find that it is also wasting screen-time. Although I'm a Fan of harem animes, the rating of 3 is mainly because of the annoying characters trying to act cute but got rejected by the main characters \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4 \\n\r\nThis show was not enjoyable and I'm not even expecting myself to be watching Season 2 which would be airing next year \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 4\\n\r\nOverall, The only good thing about this show is the Art and Sound but the rest is really terrible and horrible. \\n\r\nAnd Therefore I Warn Everyone Who Is Interested In This Show To Not Watch It.\\n",

Hasta ah\u00ed es pasable, lo que no es aceptable es que este chico se encuentre en varias situaciones en que una chica, aka la amiga de la infancia, la loli esa op, la presi o la pelirroja/rosa tundeare (\"algo nunca antes visto\") se le ponen delante invit\u00e1ndole con todas las de la ley a graduarse del club de los v\u00edrgenes y el decide salir por patas como si se hubiera dejado el m\u00f3vil en el autob\u00fas.\\n\r\nEsto se\u00f1ores, es algo pat\u00e9tico y que falla completamente a que simpaticemos con el personaje, ya que cualquiera, y digo cualquiera de los j\u00f3venes adolescentes de quince a\u00f1os que se le ponga a huevo tal oportunidad la desaprovecha voluntariamente, lo que hace que parezca un personaje irreal y dif\u00edcil de que nos agrade, a parte de que la mayor\u00eda de veces concluye en un gag ya mas gastado que el genero de este anime.\\n\r\nEl torneo es una excusa barata para que los personajes luchen, teniendo un premio mas abstracto que los cuadros de Dal\u00ed.\\n\r\nLas chicas de la serie, lo que suele destacar de estos animes con \"harem\" para hacerlos algo atractivos, son decepcionantes, no quedando nunca claro de que palo van.\\n\r\nLas peleas son un chiste, desde la primera de todas en que son dos rallas de colores chocando, pasando por la que lucha mientras lleva a la chica en brazos y vuela because yes, hasta las finales, cuya tensi\u00f3n radica en que no te metan un flashback con exposici\u00f3n sobre los personajes.\\n\r\nEn resumen, es un desprop\u00f3sito de anime, el cual gana mucho borracho y vi\u00e9ndolo con amigos, pero que pese a todo no recomiendo mirar.\\n\r\nPd: sigo sin saber a que viene el \"Asterisk\" del titulo. No me extra\u00f1ar\u00eda que el concepto saliera durante el anime, pero como cuesta mucho que te mantenga atento por su pobre trama y aburrido avance, pues ni papa.",

It tries to give a good and a little complicated story and plot, but because of it's short run time (will change when the new season comes out in april 2016 hopefully) the goal of the plot becomes unknow. I mean sure, so far its about a group of magical warriors who fight in a tag team fight tournament and the winner(s? not sure) can make their/his or her wish come true if it is in the power of the current world to fulfilll.\r\nIn the end of theseason they teaser that something might have happend to the protagonist his sister and that we might know the villian. I am looking forward to the second season to find out what will happen, but thats also the problem. The first season doesn't make much sense without the storyline yet to come and thats why i can only give it a 6 for now (might review this season again after next season has aired)",

            "content": "Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a series which starts off as one of the most uninspiring anime I've ever seen throughout its first few episodes, but past a certain point it starts improving quite rapidly. Granted that doesn't really say very much given how mediocre the opening is, but despite the lackluster start it manages to make a quite impressive comeback and eventually become a pretty enjoyable anime.\r\nFirst things first though, episodes 1-4 of Asterisk didn't exactly give me a very good first impression because they are *painfully* generic. Like if you've seen any typical action/fantasy/ecchi/harem magic academy anime before, you should know roughly what clich\u00e9sto expect, and I'll just say that initially Asterisk has effectively all of them. Our protagonist Ayato transfers into a new school and walks in on the tsundere female lead Julis in her underwear within 3 minutes of the first episode and 'accidentally' grabs her breasts, he meets his new classmates and immediately becomes surrounded by a bunch of girls who fall in love with him for whatever reason, he's given a powerful magic sword which he just so happened to be the 'chosen one' to wield and thus becomes super overpowered... you get the idea. Basically it's all been done countless times before and I'm really getting sick of it at this point. As a side note there's also this one scene which blatantly rips off the light sabers from Star Wars for some reason, even the sound effects were completely the same... well whatever.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, then starting from episode 5 (what I presume is the beginning of the second volume of the light novel), something happens to this anime which slowly but surely turns it into something different. And it comes with the introduction of a girl named Kirin; a very shy and nervous girl, yet also the top-ranked student in the school in terms of fighting prowess. The story starts putting a surprising amount of focus on her character and backstory, and in the process it downright sneakily goes *away* from the abundance of overused clich\u00e9s it had in the first few episodes. Suddenly the amount of fanservice and romcom shenanigans is severely toned down, and instead we actually get some real depth and character development. Sure, it only really involves Kirin herself and our protagonist Ayato, but it was still a breath of fresh air compared to just having content I've already seen a hundred times before in other anime. And plot progression aside, I personally found Kirin to be by far and wide the most likeable girl in Asterisk's character cast anyway so I guess it was a win-win scenario in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven't read the light novels of Asterisk, but based on the contents of the anime I'm presuming it's covering every volume in 4 episodes each. And thus I was a bit worried that it'd start to get worse again after the anime had finished up on the contents of volume 2 which seemed to be the Kirin-focused one. Fortunately however that didn't turn out to be the case, as starting with episode 9 we finally get into what I guess can be called the 'main' story of this series. Introducing the Festa: a grand series of tournaments where the students of the six different magic academies in the city of Asterisk fight each other to showcase their talent and technological development. The price they're all fighting for is the opportunity to have any one wish of theirs granted. Naturally, Ayato and the girls are competing as well. Normally I'm not a fan of action in ecchi anime since it tends to end up rather incompatible with its own fanservice, but Asterisk does a respectable job at keeping the two sides separate from one another. As a result, the duels in the Festa are actually not that bad, and A-1 Pictures' are not exactly newbies when it comes to creating fancy special effects in shounen battles, so the visuals are pretty decent too.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Gakusen Toshi Asterisk started airing, I considered it one of my least favorite shows of the season. Not that it's finished however; I'd say it's a perfectly acceptable show. Not anything amazing by any means of course, but if you just want an easily enjoyable way to spend 20 minutes every weekend... then this anime pulls it off very well. Discounting the generic and unimpressive opening, it has pretty decent fight scenes and production value, as well as good characterization for at least part of its cast. Oh and for you pervs out there who are just intending to watch this for the ecchi tag, I'd recommend you to look somewhere else; Asterisk really doesn't have very much of that at all.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot make a proper evaluation of the story as a whole though for the simple reason that... well this is a split-cour. At the time of writing this we've still only gotten to see half of what the anime has to offer, with the second season airing in Spring 2016. However the Festa is a huge event, and there's plenty of action left to showcase on that front, so the second cour might very well be even better than the first. Fingers crossed.",

            "content": "edit: don't read this review don't upvote it i don't want it to exist it's just a bad digibro impression read another review i am a better writer than this\r\nedit edit: oh no they're not listening this review is visible now ohhhhhhh noooooooooooooooo\r\nI'm not mad. I have only myself to blame for this, really. I tend to be more selective with what I watch. Something will be recommended, I'll hear about something popular, or it's just on my mind a lot. I've never watched anything expecting it to be bad; usually I have no expectations at all, but often I at least think it'll besomething that's enjoyable enough to pass the time and get a 5 or 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe Asterisk War is my first exception.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch this because I knew it'd be good. I watched it because I heard it was almost identical to Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, which I'd just finished, and all I wanted to do was see which is worse. Yes, WORSE. Not better. I mean, that's not to say it couldn\u2019t have been surprisingly good, but of course that couldn't happen. Of course, this review won\u2019t be spent comparing the two anime together, but I will give a verdict as to which is better at the end. Because that\u2019s what everyone asked me to do!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, so the mods won\u2019t be unhappy, I must inform you that I will spoil the first episode almost entirely, but spoilers will be toned down to a minor level beyond that episode.\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk starts off extremely rocky; honestly just about everything in the first episode is horrible, whether it's immediately evident or not. The opening scene is a fight with awkward choreography and absolutely no context at all, even as the scene comes to a close. It sets the tone, I guess, but the reason why this fight was shown at all just seems unclear after watching the whole season, as way too little is revealed in this opening, and its potential context doesn't have much weight on the following episodes. But I'm sure it'll be explained later... in another season... that I won't watch...\\n\\n\r\nSome exposition is given, which is fine I guess, but one very interesting thing stuck with me. \"The people gradually began to alter their sense of morality.\" This is apparently due to some event called \"Invertia\", and you really have to give the writer(s) props for making a new term for \"shitty writing\". It's a shame they couldn't follow up on it, though. There might be some stupid actions, but nothing horrible enough to make you really think that these people are really fucked in the head; these things instead feel forced so that the \"story\" (read: too little) and fanservice (read: too much) can keep going.\\n\\n\r\nThe first example of characters being idiots instead of morally questionable comes quickly. Icky--oh, sorry, wrong review\u2014Ayato (the main character) catches a falling handkerchief, sees and open window (and/or hears someone's voice from it), and sums up the obvious. He jumps into the window to return the handkerchief, only to see a female student only partially dressed. Here's everything wrong with this scene:\\n\\n\r\n1. He acts apologetic, knowing that it was an accident, despite not considering that he would've been obviously invading someone's privacy by jumping through their FUCKING WINDOW, MULTIPLE STORIES HIGH. If some awareness to the obviously horrible idea were present, even if it results in the MC being a massive douchenozzle, it could at least be pinned to people having fucked up morals. Nope, instead he tries playing this off like it\u2019s not just a prank, bro.\\n\\n\r\n2. We get a glimpse of someone\u2019s ass before knowing whose ass it even is. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not that important, this is only the female fucking lead. Where are the Japanese tumblrvists when you need them? If the fanservice wasn\u2019t so forced, this could\u2019ve been an OK scene, but god forbid someone has to go three minutes without popping a boner over their new waifu. By the way, you can stop taking the show seriously at this point.\\n\\n\r\n3. If your handkerchief is so important, why did you carelessly leave it sitting loosely near an open window? How the hell did the wind even suck a cloth out of a room, anyway? Why was Ayato surprised by seeing a girl in the room when he heard her talking? If he didn\u2019t hear her talking, why did WE hear her talking?\\n\\n\r\nThis goes into a very laughable fight scene that only exists because Julis\u2019s personality makes absolutely no sense, if she even has one. She thinks Ayato should die or something because he saw her naked (apparently wearing underwear = naked, k), despite being soooo grateful for getting a super-special piece of linen back. Maybe this could be some inverted moral bullshit like the story wants me to believe, but you\u2019ll later see how much of a clusterfuck this character is as the show goes on. The fight itself is full of weird technology and magic we know nothing about, plot armor, and overall poor direction. (Why did Ayato jump through an explosion unharmed? And why did the soundtrack suddenly stop just when a character is thinking, only to go to some mysterious-sounding tune? It\u2019s weird.) It ends with Ayato glomping Julis to avoid some assassination or something, and he later gropes her somehow because fanservice, or awkward comedy, or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Oh, did I say something about an assassination? Who cares? No one else does, so that\u2019s obviously not important. Let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nI could pick apart every scene, but I\u2019d just retrace the same points and conclusions the above have made, more or less: Characters are incredibly stupid, whether the writer made them do stupid things or the writer leaked his stupidity into the plot\u2019s scenarios at various points, and not because of some global event. The art is pretty generic and obviously tries to compensate by being flashy, the music is mostly uninspiring, and just the overall direction seems to be mediocre. All of this is taken from the first ten minutes of the first episode. That\u2019s all.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the show quickly establishes how fuckin\u2019 bad it is.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I\u2019ve been mentioning this \u201cInvertia\u201d thing a few times. It IS pretty important, and you should really pay attention to that scene, because it\u2019s the only time in the whole show that you\u2019ll hear about it! \u2026Wait\u2026 oh. Yeah, Invertia is mentioned once, or something. No one talks about it, and there\u2019s no noticeable impact from it (as far as morals go). Why did they bother mentioning this part of it? And you know that fight in the beginning? That kinda hints at some other \u201cmajor\u201d plot element that gets totally forgotten about after it\u2019s brought up. The first episode is basically spent teaching you things you will never need to know. It\u2019s high school algebra all over again!\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this fa\u00e7ade of a setup, there\u2019s some sort of plot, or at least there should be. Basically, Ayato comes to this school to kinda learn about his sister and mostly to find some path for himself, so he starts training for these fighting events, and wow I am REALLY bored right now. Along the way, he meets various girls who do all but tear out their reproductive organs and install them into exuberantly-colored fleshlights for his personal satisfaction. It\u2019s honestly hilarious how frequent the fanservice is, and how few reasons the girls have to each fall in love with the MC. Asterisk\u2019s girls come in different shapes so that everyone\u2019s tastes are satisfied, and they\u2019re exploited so commonly that I wonder if Asterisk is trying to trying to appeal to the hentai artists or if the creators are bragging that they have girls in their series. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all very satisfied with yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nIf you need to be reminded again that the characters are bad, this is your lucky day! The characters are bad! So here\u2019s my favorite part, the character roast section:\\n\\n\r\nAyato \u2013 Things worth saying/making fun of are as follows:\\n\\n\r\nJulis \u2013 Independent black woman who don\u2019t need no bodyguard. If you ignore the fact that she\u2019s a figure of royalty, a high-ranking student, and that your IQ is lower than that of an earthworm, then it makes a lot of sense.\\n\\n\r\nClaudia \u2013 You know what? This is the best character in the whole show, and all who disagree can fucking fight me. She\u2019s the most direct with her affection for Ayato to the point where she flat-out says she wants to fuck. At least there\u2019s no bullshit about it, other than her having no reason to like Ayato and Ayato being a scrubmaster about it. (Do I need to bring up Cavalry again? WHAT SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KID IS GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS? DON\u2019T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS, ASSHOLE.) Also, please note that her ending scenes to preview the next episode literally do not exist. Nope.\\n\\n\r\nSaya \u2013 Hi, I\u2019m a deadpan loli with no real reason for being in this show other than to be the loli in this harem. If the point of her personality was to match the audience\u2019s evident opinion of her, they nailed it on the fucking head. \\n\\n\r\nKirin \u2013 Kinda younger-looking girl with big tits. Apparently her dad\u2019s in jail, so she and her big tits need to win these festival things or something, and follow the guidance of her uncle who\u2019s abusive as hell for no reason. So, I guess at least this character and her big tits have some sort of conflict??? And then we can waste a couple episodes on her and her big tits?????? No need to thank A-1, I\u2019m sure they do it because they care. And for the record, the anime tells you at every waking moment that this character has big tits because we can\u2019t shove Claudia into every scene.\\n\\n\r\nLester \u2013 I\u2019M A DOUCHEBAG WITH MUSCLES. DISLIKE ME!\\n\\n\r\nIrene \u2013 Wincest.\\n\\n\r\nDid I miss anyone? Probably. Do I care? Probably not. \\n\r\nDid I have too much fun with that? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nKinda going into my next point, what the fuck is with everyone\u2019s hair in this thing? What sort of insane products are these people using that allow their hair to suspend in midair? Like holy hell, does their lack of personality somehow expel a gravitational field from their heads? It\u2019s insane, dude. They also have that wonderful, classic \u201cspot the major character\u201d look; if their hair is the color of something not really found in nature, they\u2019re important. If not, they might exist, but you won\u2019t remember them. Everyone below this line is some overly-generic CG filler person or something. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art might be dazzling to some, but I only see A-1 trying to compensate for their overall weak animation, and no amount of ass shots will redeem it. Even if you don\u2019t agree that the first episode is bad, you can\u2019t possibly tell me that, say, episode 4 looks good. Beyond the animation, the CG is the compensation part, as I couldn\u2019t ever get behind the flashiness and vibrancy of the magic and weapons. I mean, they\u2019re not bad\u2026 but they\u2019re certainly nothing special, especially since fights are so reliant on them.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, there\u2019s a lot of this CG technology that\u2019s omnipresent even outside of the fights, so it\u2019s not just a bunch of magic and glowing plastic weapons making lightsaber noises. This might\u2019ve been better to bring up in the setting/plot parts of this review, but whatever. Anyway, what the hell is all of this shit? All this technology and shit is literally omnipresent; everywhere you go, you see holograms of various functions. Where do these things even come from? How do they work? What can you do with this amazing technology besides open doors from across a room and use them as replacements for what we know as computers? Why am I asking questions that I know will NEVER be answered? \\n\\n\r\nLast thing about the art; who the FUCK is responsible for the next episode previews? You know, that shit at the very end of each episode where Claudia looks like she\u2019s in some visual novel but is animated like a 5-year-old edited it? Jesus Christ, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cringed so hard after watching something in an anime. I only watched one of these before deciding that I\u2019d never do it again, so please watch at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the soundtrack is\u2026 actually good. Some of it. I believe just one person (Rasmus Faber) did the entire score (my apologies if this is incorrect), and if that\u2019s the case, his electronic pieces are easily his strong point. (Which makes sense; I hear he\u2019s a DJ or something.) The OP and ED are pretty good as well. But unfortunately, the rest is mediocre at best. The more orchestral pieces don\u2019t quite stand out or are as memorable as the electronic pieces, but I don\u2019t want to seem more negative than positive in this section. I\u2019ll actually admit something was good in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut all those negatives aside, at least it wasn\u2019t as bad as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026Or was it?\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it\u2019s hard to decide on which is worse. I couldn\u2019t take either anime seriously, but Cavalry still made some attempt at being serious at one point. At least there\u2019s some sort of reason for the shit that\u2019s happening. Asterisk has nothing going on at all! But even if Asterisk did nothing, playing it safe worked to its advantage, because Cavalry\u2019s serious moments are heavily weighed down by the sheer awful, cringe-inducing scenes that infest it. I mean, Asterisk is bad, but it never made me uncomfortable. But Cavalry still did a couple things right, such as the art (mostly) and the romance (to a small extent). Asterisk has a few good songs, and that\u2019s about it. So my overall verdict as to which is worse\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSurprising myself a bit, I\u2019m giving that honor to The Asterisk War, mainly based on the fact that it did fuck all to help itself, while Cavalry at least made some legitimate attempt somewhere. And with that settled, I can walk away from this anime with a strange sense of satisfaction: that I was looking for a good match between two terrible anime, and I walked away with an unexpected, but satisfying result. Great job, Asterisk, you actually succeeded in something, by being the Worst One!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s all. Full score is below, thanks for\u2026 oh god\u2026 I just realized something. Invertia didn\u2019t change the morals of the characters, it changed the morals of the writers! And the producers! And whoever the hell else is responsible for this! Oh man, I think it\u2019s gotten to me as well! I went out of my way to watch a bad anime and I was just thankful for it being so terrible! Holy hell, this show is actually genius!\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 1/10\\n\r\nArt \u2013 4/10\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 1/10\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 1/10 \\n\r\nFavorite character \u2013 Claudia\\n\r\nFavorite episode \u2013 none\\n\r\nRecommended to \u2013 people who want to lower their MAL average score\\n\\n\r\nCongratulations are in order, for this is my very first 1/10 score. It was originally a 2/10, but after considering things more for this review, I can\u2019t think of any reason to give this anything higher. What did I like? The art was okay but pretty boring, and the soundtrack was pretty nice, but they\u2019re beside me for the most part. If they were actually great and really memorable, like, say, Guilty Crown, then that\u2019d probably let me raise it to a 2 or a 3. But even if GC is a pile of shit beyond the production, at least it made an honest attempt at writing a story and had some legitimately interesting moments. Asterisk has NOTHING that is interesting, whether it\u2019s due to a lack of explanations or just sheer unoriginality. I mean\u2026 well, I already wrote the review, so I won\u2019t go back. I guess all that needs to be said is that this anime is pretty ass.\\n\\n\r\nterisk.",

            "content": "Towards the end of 2015, two light novel adaptations became notable for sharing startling similarities between them. Chivalry of a Failed Knight was considered somewhat refreshing, occasionally playing around with awful tropes and channeling the power of competent screenplays and exciting directing to turn a school battle LN adaptation into something worth watching. Conversely, The Asterisk War failed to meet even the basic requirements to function as a generic work of fiction. It's barely worth the effort it takes to write about it, let alone animate it.\r\nBefore we start, I dare one of you to make a thread or a blog showcasing the exact amountof problems each episode has. Don't make a drinking game out of it, or you'll die of alcohol poisoning by episode 8. The show literally starts with the main puss ass lead walking into our Tsundere in the middle of undress, under the pretenses that she dropped something important to her. After she claims to owe him one, she tries to incinerate him out of nowhere, resenting him for the rest of the episode in the process. This sets a precedent as to how badly this show will execute and contradict everything, like being low enough to over-sexualize a 13-year-old who regularly gets slapped by her uncle and saved by Ayato, whilst simultaneously acting like her asking for a sparring match the main character she fought of her own volition before is in any way indicator of her strength as a person. Just to provide the illusion that broke as hell Ayato isn't obscenely powerful, they provide flimsy limiters that only work when he uses a specific weapon for too long, despite that he often goes past the time limit of the limiters with no problem until the match finishes. The show breaks its rules so often that its ravaged narrative arcs become that much worse. Even the interesting ideas this dreck presents aren't capitalized, let alone worth capitalizing on in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building is easily the most fractured part of this dumpster fire. The tournament arc has been hinted to be a tournament in which things can get deadly and bloody for competitors, but no one gets remotely injured or killed, aside from that one pointless and awkwardly done flashback scene at the very beginning., if students can summon hovering screens with their hands for no reason, then why do they need to hold them, and why is there actual paper involved? The world-building of this show is some of the worst I've ever seen, as if the narrative wasn't already cheap enough with its trite nonsense, missed opportunities, and romantic mood killers designed to preserve a terrible harem.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Ayato is as horribly characterized and intolerable as his harem, which is one of the worst in the mainstream anime hemisphere. Julis is a trash tier Tsundere who plays up that trope to obnoxious degrees, especially when she retardedly blows up her room in an attempt to scorch him alive for the crime of accidentally seeing her in her underwear. Saya is an obnoxiously possessive loli with all the intolerable tropes you'd expect. Kirin is an annoyingly squeaky pushover with a ridiculously lousy character arc As for Claudia, anything she has going for her can be boiled down to sass, sex appeal, and an insidious and mysterious nature that I guarantee this show won't capitalize on. The other characters are either stupid or wasted, with almost no middle ground beyond just being \"there\". Easily the most crushing case of the latter is Irene, who is a dangerous punk with a heart of gold and an interesting design. They go out of their way to do nothing interesting with her when it's time for her to fight our unbearable main lead in the finale, and the closest we ever get is how her younger sister keeps her in check, which has also been done a million times. When a character like her is the best character in the show, it speaks volumes of just how worthless this cast is.\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, this show isn't much better. The colors are certainly bright, and some of the character designs can actually be pretty neat and sexy but the artwork is pretty miserable. It's a low-budget SAO and Aldnoah.Zero style with even shittier and more incomprehensible choreography, and even more all-encompassing fugly CGI. Much like the show itself, the visuals are bad at even pulling off being generic and mediocre, barring a few relatively dazzling environments. Even the aesthetics are gaudy and nonsensical, and the cuts of actually good animation are few and far between. At least Andloah.Zero had some flourish to make up for generic style and cheap CGI.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is a mixed bag of vanilla background noise, awful dubstep, and ill-fitting emotional pieces. Even the OP is a milquetoast pop song, in spite of it being catchy. The ED titled \"Waiting for the rain\" by Maaya Sakamoto and Ramsus Faber is the only stellar bit of music in the show, as it's a pretty stellar emotional track to close out each episode with. Even the visuals are interesting, with the show swapping the positions of a bunch of color-coded silhouettes of each harem member, which are accompanied by some actually pleasant techno melodies and Maaya Sakamoto's warm, even uplifting voice. Still, if having one good track is all the audio needs to be unquestionably better than every other aspect of this show combined, then I really can't find a better way to call this show dogshit.\\n\\n\r\nPeople put themselves through hell slaving away at this, and no one did a remotely good job beyond the musicians. That's as sad as the show itself. This anime isn't even infuriating or laughable, just annoying and lifeless, which is one of the purest tells that this has no value I can assign to it, let alone any reason to be watched enough to garner a second season. It even fails to live up to its title in any way, shape or form. How this got popular is beyond me, and I'm glad it's dead.",

            "content": "When it comes to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk or the Asterisk War, there are a few things that can go side and side for me. On one hand the show wasn\u2019t so bad as I thought, considering the way the show went wasn\u2019t as terrible as I thought, in fact; I will say that there were actually a few things that I liked about the series and this would include my personal evaluation, some few of the expositions and the way they handled the battle tournament aspect which was really nice. On the other hand however, the show still has some flaws that holds the showback the scales which is not really a good thing considering having some issues to my standards can cause some difficulty to recommend the show (including someone that\u2019s looking for battle tourney series of this type of genre). So you would have a mind from what I am going up towards this review, but let\u2019s just see if Gakusen Toshi Asterisk of The Asterisk War is considered a show to at least be watchable even with the issues or it\u2019s just considered a bad experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nTo give a thought about the show, let\u2019s get into the synopsis.\\n\\n\r\n In The Academy City on the water (also known as Asterisk) is the world\u2019s biggest battle entertainment, \u201cStar Wars Festival.\u201d The young boys and girls belonging into six different academies made their wishes Shining Armaments in their hands.\\n\\n\r\nBasically in a way, our main protagonist Ayato goes to this said academy by an invitation from the Student Council President Claudia Enfield and suddenly he stumbles upon Julis, the main female protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words as how people call this show \u201cStar Wars: Harem Edition\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nBasically the start of the show goes to the same old generic trope, this usually happens and depending on the person this can go both \u201clet\u2019s go and just wait\u201d or towards \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this before\u201d. Of course we\u2019re going to see this every time, this is usually one of the trends actually, however what matters is the execution afterwards that introduction.\\n\\n\r\nTo start things off towards the anime, I will say I will give some props towards the show for giving at least enough information without feeling spoon feeding like Mahouka, because it in cooperates enough info without feeling left out for me. It\u2019s something I like about the show because it has a way to not get me bored enough or feel quite lazy about it, just giving at least enough details to know about said mechanics of the world and the aspects of the show so it would give a more decent idea of how it goes. However exposition can depend for people actually, for me I find the way they did the info nice without feeling like I can\u2019t comprehend stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the show doesn\u2019t really go and become too dragged out for me to get straight into the main events, it actually goes and build up the training at least for the actual things happening.\\n\\n\r\nTo not go into further details on the anime, even if the show goes to a generic way start as the episodes passed by, you would sooner or later notice that it goes to a degree into a different direction, where it mainly focuses on the Ser Veresta the battle tournament, which was the main event that the series has built up from my previous statement.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also focuses on the teamwork aspect along in battle tourney trainings and battles, now that\u2019s actually clich\u00e9 however for my personal eyes the way it\u2019s handled for say the least it was good enough considering the relationship between the two main characters and the other supporting character, but talking about the two main characters' partnerships, the teamwork between them weren\u2019t as bad at first, as the episodes passed by the relationship in terms of that was nice enough however not one of the best to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to keep another note the anime doesn't focus on the romance (since it has a romance tag in) and for my eyes it's kind of saying there's a romance but my previous statements are their main focus of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nPacing for the show seems rather nice and also perfect and suiting for the show considering for me if it does rush somethings I think it could break and destroy the buildup for the main event the anime has made throughout the anime and it just doesn\u2019t go well for it. Just my personal thought on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nInteractions are not one of the best but they\u2019re not as bad as I thought for the main cast of characters. In all honestly and this comes as rather personal but I liked some of the moments of the anime where I actually giggled upon.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least the anime has some sort of nice things to go across however there are somethings that could become out of place for the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing sometimes I personally think some the fights could have been less predictable in a way although there were a few nice surprises along the way, it\u2019s just at times I felt like it could have been done better for me, although the fights aren\u2019t really bad in all honesty, also predictability it\u2019s just depending for my perspective on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe second being the couple of clich\u00e9s being around the show which kind of affects some few things and little aspects of the anime because although it\u2019s not a bad thing it just how its utilizes kind of ticks the viewer off in some way to say the least for my personal eye, and as well with the fan service it just depends on the person as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe third issue being the main character, although this all depends on the viewer's eye, Ayato basically beats everyone. Anyone in the case, but I guess not to the point of being on the same level as Tatsuya or Kirito I suppose. I will state why down below in the characters category, and in the end of the day, this comes for different people. For me I felt rather annoyed with it a bit but it's better off than having one person giving a one hit K.O badly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the final part being the final episode of the first season. In other words the final fight, while the final episode was very good overall, I can't deny there was something that came out of place and that's actually something buggy and I really don't know if they can explain that later on in it's second cour.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day for the story department the show isn't really unique with its story in terms of the whole plot but the episodes made up for it decently enough for me, and to at least have this considered as passable due to the balance of entertainment and the exposition. The series isn't also one of the better written series since the writing of it can be considered either way simple and not everything so special in it's way. It's not also supposed to be a series that it needs a lot of stuff to make it better, in fact adding too much in this case would break the show, so that for me at least the story is passable enough for people to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t want to explain much in this department considering when it comes to anime characters in this type of genre they\u2019re not quite special in all honestly. They are your stereotypical archetypes and cast that you have probably seen in the previous shows. If you have seen anything like these of course. However it doesn\u2019t really mean they\u2019re bad either for my eyes unless how they\u2019re really presented. They are just\u2026 mediocre to a degree in the overall curriculum of character departments, which is a weak point on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nAyato being the main male protagonist is shown as your stereotypical dense protagonist with to say the least, copy and paste personality to say the least. However the only thing that makes him a little interesting for me would be his actual backstory that was brought after said episodes, in which he actually has a limit of using his powers due to that flashback being presented in the anime. It\u2019s nothing very unique in all honestly for my opinion but that at least is more interesting to see along. I give him bonus for that.\\n\\n\r\nJulis being your main female character which she acted like a Tsundere girl at the show from the start, I somehow managed to like her in all honestly because that was of course strayed away to a degree for some reason. She also has a motivation in this case in the anime which makes it more reasonable of why she was participating in the events in the first place. Now saying that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s nothing special for her but as I would say for Ayato, she gets bonus at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two girls from the main four characters, Kirin and Saya are your stereotypical Loli character and Kuudere, the only thing I would say about them is that for Saya, most of the time she makes me laugh with her commentaries and at the same time for Kirin, she doesn\u2019t really fight in all honesty (if I can say) like how the others\u2019 weapons. The only bonuses I can give is that they work together as a team and that\u2019s something nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe other girl Claudia doesn\u2019t really become presented or relevant most of the time in the first season and she only appears in some scenarios, other than that I would say I like how they put her later on in the anime however it\u2019s quite a sort of disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are quite forgettable with the exception at the moment for Irene since she did got a backstory at the final episodes, while it was kind of a awkward move I found this quite passable enough. Everyone seemed used as some sort of characters just for the sake to be there, unless they make them more relevant in the second season of the anime series which quite frankly I was impressed it got a second cour, which could mean more things would come for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I said the characters are overall mediocre to be honest. Yeah. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nIf anything I would say about the art, I would say the art style for this series is not quite one of the best out there, however it does look decent enough for its quality. As well for its background art it looks nice enough that it also fits with the designs of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are not really original to an extension however the designs looks above average enough and not that much complaining about it to say the least. Each character looks dandy in a way.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation standpoint I will say it\u2019s not one of the most fluid animation out there, but surprisingly enough it\u2019s not anything ground breaking to my eyes. If anything, it has a minor amount of choppy moments where the most it seems rather passable enough. It also can be an eye candy towards the viewer and depending on the person watching if you like battle tourneys you might enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nIn the angle standpoint they actually do a decent job with the angles and the moments when the characters are fighting against one another, it doesn\u2019t feel off for half time but for me half the time I would say I didn\u2019t liked how it actually looked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I suppose I could put the animation and art category as being one of those good ones overall because it really doesn\u2019t look that bad, and it has some little decent stuff into it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: \\n\\n\r\nI would say the music isn\u2019t one of the most memorable things around, however the music has a mix of techno and a bit of instrumental ost at times at the fights, where it seems really enjoyable and at the times it\u2019s quite catchy when watching. At the same time I would say the few comical osts seem very fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound I would say nothing stands out from the sound department as in the effects, however they\u2019re put at the right place and time without feeling quite cringey.\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice acting tone department (since by the time this review is released it will be reviewed with tone of the Japanese dub) I wouldn\u2019t say the voice acting was bad, however they\u2019re not all that great either in a way. Though I give props to the voice actors to say the least because it fits with its cast of anime characters and it\u2019s rather fine to say the least (despite me hating the voice actor for Ayato but not as the person voicing but for the voice for the character itself)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and Ending songs both are one of my most favorites of the season considering it goes to my personal taste to my eyes. In all honesty music is subjective, let\u2019s say that.  For the Opening it gives a catchy J-Pop vibe and the tone of the OP fits with the show, as for the ED it gives a harmonic in a sense feel when hearing it, and the English sounds right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest I liked the show a lot, this is rather a personal income due to the previous points above that the show did benefitted in a way that for me I felt satisfied with the outcome, in the end we\u2019re getting a second cour of the show, so let\u2019s expect for the better or for the worse. Just to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? This all depends on your taste on anime actually, or the genres in itself. If you want at least a show that buildups the events bit by bit (for this season) you can give the show a shot actually, and maybe you would have fun with this, however I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to people that do not like anything like that from a series, especially for those that hates or dislikes the ecchi/harem battle tourney. To conclude, I will leave it at your hands, you\u2019ll decide. \\n\\n\r\nUntil the second cour, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's totally okay to watch a show with low expectations. Sometimes to balance a great anime, you gotta watch a bad one just to put you back in your place. It's a requirement to have watched poorly done shows so you know where your tastes are and also broaden your horizons. The Asterisk War serves as one of those shows that will give you appreciation of shows like High School of The Dead and other shows that have poorly written stories and brick wall characters. This is a must watch if you need to remember that there are really uninspiring anime.\r\nStorywise, not much to say.Gary Stu comes to new school, all the ladies fall for him the end. Sounds like the typical harem anime because it IS a typical harem anime. The whole thing is a tease and shows snippets that relate to the protagonist indirectly, but fails to establish a basis for it. What I mean if that sounded pretentious, is the lack of an overarching conflict. We follow young Ayato, but for what? All we see is him turning red at every little female physical contact. \\n\r\nDeus Ex Machina phenomena is arguably always going to break a show. I think it works in this show's favor just because there weren't really any upsides to begin with. It gives a little more excitement in what was a lackluster show. Arguably it isn't phenomena but foreshadowed. Ayato's power makes zero sense considering the circumstances revolved around him and that the whole show seemed to have miss the point was just bad writing on many levels. But hey, what more to look forward to in a show then a guy's head in between breasts? \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters is awful and blame the story telling for that. None of the characters mesh well and there isn't any positive to get out of observing their actions and motives. They all suck. If gary stu didn't fit the description of the main protagonist, then I don't know what to believe. This guy is the most uninteresting (for lack of a better word) fuckboy. Something that works against the show is that it was really trying to take Ayato's circumstances seriously. The tropes are quite abundant and make all the female characters seem like cut outs of cariactures placed in an anime. And to munch the very uninteresting main protagonist at that. The Asterisk War really is a tease when it comes to scenes of sexualizing the females. Cuz boobs and butts sell right? I'm losing brain cells trying to think of anything to write for this show.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING IS VERY BAD. My ear was bleeding due too Saya and Kirin's voices oh my goodness. It is awful and to hear baby squeals and \"jealous\" grumbles is reason enough to AVOID this show. I say it's a must watch because this might set the bar low enough for anything to come after seem like a masterpiece. We're all masochists when it comes to anime though so it's okay. Sound is underwhelming but the EDM is a good twist in action scenes.\\n\r\nAs for animation, it is the Irregular of magic high school esque. Flashy colors and CG stuff. Considering how little action there is, animation isn't really great. Lot more exposition than there is fighting and we know how that works out in a harem. \\n\\n\r\nI came into this show knowing it was going to be bad so I didn't really think of it as anything I haven't seen before. It brings nothing new to the table, nothing inspiring, no noteworthy scenes. It's just a letdown in all aspects besides I guess teasing if that has any credibility. I'd surf the internet if I wanted to be uninspired but I guess the one thing the show has going for it is it's opening. Its pretty cool, not that cool but its okay. A typical harem that lacks a resolution is what can best describe The Asterisk War.",

            "content": "WARNING: Review contains minor spoilers, as the show has almost no story and some one off events need to be discussed to get across the show's quality.\r\nAsterisk Wars is a series which has been derided by many and lauded by few, although the most common consensus to this show is likely \"average\". In my opinion, though, the people who pointed out all of this show's flaws are pretty much perfectly on track: This show has an unlikeable and generic cast set in an ill-concieved setting with no plot to drive it and poor fights.\r\nLets take it from the top. Our show begins when Ayato Amagiri,your standard flatbread hero, arrives at one of the six elite fighting schools, Seidoukan Academy, so he can be a fighter, as he is a Genestella which is basically a superhuman. The first action we get to see is him returning a handkerchief to a girl...by leaping through her open window?! What rational person does this, even if they can superjump places? It is a total invasion of privacy and instead of just, say, getting to her door and knocking, or shouting to her, or hell going to the window and saying she dropped it or any number of things, he just leaps into the open window of a total stranger's house. Inside is our female lead, Julis, and naturally since this is a harem series, that means we need to walk in on her dressing. Don't ask why a beautiful princess would decide to undress with an open, undrawn window where anyone can see, take pictures or so on of her.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, Julis is upset about this! She is one of the top ranked fighters in the school and so you can guess her reply to this problem. The first few episodes are dedicated to showing off some of the main characters and exposition. Lots and lots of exposition, most of which isn't even true exposition, like Claudia telling the main character a bunch of terms and things about the city that the viewer will have no idea about. Right, on that note, the two other main girls introduced now are Claudia and Saya: Saya is one of Ayato's old friends and therefor has the hots for him, but we don't really get a lot of their history together, and she is your general emotionless girl or \"Dandere\" type. Claudia is the hot, very forwardly sexual student council president who flatout prepositions Ayato for sex multiple times (the first time, in episode 3, being a hilariously bad scene for Ayato's reply) and liking him for...really no well explained reason, she just kind of shows up to exposit at him and then wants to fuck him after giving him a strong weapon.\\n\\n\r\nA big issue is that all of these characters are pretty generic and have very little chemistry with each other: In fact, they very rarely even interact with people unless Ayato is directly involved and the focus, making them feel like they're just gone from the show when not existing, and we get very little insight to anyone's private lives aside from Claudia. Ayato is your generically overpowered main character, whose power seems to mostly be hitting really hard and his sword cutting things really well, with a cardboard attitude of \"I don't really care but I do\". I should also note that most shows in this fight involve Ayato aaaaand are boring, with most of the first season's tournament arc ending dedicated to Ayato/Julis and the other MC teams casually curb stomping their opponents in under a minute.\\n\\n\r\nThis is NOT how you write an overpowered main character. Overpowered main characters can work fine: For an example of that, Josuke from Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure would usually be considered pretty OP, with his stand Crazy Diamond being very physically powerful, pretty dang fast and having a potent ability to fix things. In fact, Josuke's stand for most of the Part 4, would be considered a lot stronger than the main antagonist's, but by giving the antagonist actual guile he becomes a menacing threat, and giving minor villains powers which can exploit Crazy Diamond through actual weaknesses, for example its short range, or having specialized abilities, ends up making some pretty great fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is practically based around the idea of the heroes being overpowered and weaves it nicely into the plot, taking a weakness and turning it into a plot strength.\\n\\n\r\nAyato is just...generically overpowered. He can move faster than everyone and hit harder to everyone and generically power himself up with yells and special effects to be even strongerer and then he beats up his opponents! Not once does Ayato display any battlefield tactics, special skills (the special attacks he calls are almost all literally a sword slash that doesn't seem to be any different than normal) or abilities of note to make his fighting interesting. Its the worst way to write an overpowered MC, especially since naturally in a harem series this means things like beating up the highly ranked female harem members because they are generically not as strong as the AMAZING Ayato Amagiri and now they will fall for him or he will carry them in his arm because they totally couldn't do it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nJulis is your generic Tsundere girl who will probably be the harem winner. She has very few motivations and is one of the most blush heavy Tsunderes I have ever seen, even when she is going through the heavy Tsun parts, and her power is to control fire, which is never used beyond \"circle of fire trap\", \"shoot fire\" or \"fiery explosion\", and most of the time she shoots fire at people and they just get owned. Saya is small girl with a huge gun, which is only used to fire generic laser blasts. Claudia actually has some neat powers, dual wielding triangle lightsaber blades with an ability to see the future, but she doesn't actually get any fight scenes so. Kirin's power is \"has a sword\" and gets paired with Saya for some quite boring fights.\\n\\n\r\nOh, right, Kirin. She's another main character introduced in a latter pair of episodes, which I hesitate to call a \"mini-arc\" given its anemic lack of plot or advancement, and is a 13 year old with large boobs which get way too much emphasis for her age and is also somewhat weird to have in Ayato's harem in the first place. She largely comes off as a superflous character who exists to give Saya a partner but since she is a female on this show she MUST also be added to Ayato's harem. Her voice also is very annoying even for the usual archetype and she has the spine of a jellyfish without actually acting abused enough to fit her supposed backstory. Also, she is somehow ranked #1 in the school when Claudia is #2. Kirin wields a normal, non-laser sword, one of the only people to do so in the show. Claudia dual wields lightsabers and can SEE THE FLIPPING FUTURE. The only possible explanation is Claudia does not give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to talk about a character who you would think is minor but frankly feels like he recurs as much, if not more, than Saya and Kirin: Lester MacPhail, whose name is quite literally pronounced MacFail. MacFail here is one of the most anemic attempts at a \"bully\" character I have seen in quite some time, being established as a loser who has lost to Julis 3 times but is itching to fight her and lose again. He is never displayed as a competent threat and nearly gets killed by one of the laser swords getting upset at him and flying around trying to murder him in a...hilariously awkward scene. He loses every fight he gets into, although SOMEHOW he is the one who gets the \"valiantly fights but loses\" fight scene to Irene, which if anything makes Irene look weaker by having to expend any effort on this failure. Its also hilarious because this guy is supposed to be kinda badass, like having built up muscle when Genestella are supposed to have trouble doing so, but he is basically a total loser in the show and one of the most pathetic strong man/bully types I've ever watched. This makes him more endearing than most of the main cast!\\n\\n\r\nFinally for characters, I will mention Irene, the only decent character on the entire show: Pretty generic, sure, but her and her younger sister Priscilla are basically the only characters with actual energy or personality to them which helps makes any scenes in the show feel alive. She wields a laser-scyche (basically every weapon but Kirin's in the show is lightsaber-esque) which can control gravity and turns its user into a vampire because it requires blood to function. Since Priscilla can regenerate herself rapidly, Irene can feast on her blood to power up without worry, while she tries to just stay out of trouble, a somewhat interesting team dynamic. Their backstories are pretty generic and their powers are ill explained, but they are unique enough and Irene is the only character in the show who uses her power in a variety of interesting ways, making her basically the only character to be remotely competently done in this show, although her boss and essentially loan shark Dirk is decently set up, which naturally means she basically is put on a bus to end the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, there just isn't much to comment on. Ayato gets to the school, acclimates to the school a little, gets into some fights, meets Kirin and has some more random fights, then they go to the tournament and fight some jobbers until Irene shows up for a mini-arc to close the season. Ayato gets some very, very light setup for plot involving his sister, Julis and Saya get some weak motivations (help an orphanage she did stuff in as a kid, she wasn't an orphan she just hung there, and advertise her father's guns respectively) aaaaaaaand that's pretty much it. Backstory for the series is vague, with Apocalyptic Event causing super people to show up and a really terrible Megacorp to take the place of nations, which doesn't really factor into the show at all. The tournaments are supposed to be gladiatorial, blood filled spectacles to satiate the populace, but less people die in them than the infamous \"Hallway of Running\" from Hunter x Hunter so it reeeally doesn't show up.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, most effects are dull and forgettable, with literal stock lightsaber sounds being used at times, and most background music is entirely forgettable. Not really good sound effects on the powers, either. The OP is fairly bad and that counts for a lot of the sound design, while the ED is okay, although stylistically even slice of life shows like K-On and Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon have done this ED style better. Art-wise the show actually usually isn't that bad, but it does suffer from not really having a very discernable style and bad looking effects in fights. The reason it goes down to a 2 is actually because of the horrible, Fates end of support style CGIs that are in the post-credits scene (usually involving Claudia), which already looked awkward in that, but here is done with way worse animation and ends up looking laughable and disturbing. This was so bad it dragged the animation score from a 4-5~ to a 2. Enjoyment is a 2 because it is a good show to talk to friends about the issues with and Irene's part was ever vaguely entertaining, but is a definitive 1 if you're not going to have anyone to go with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Asterisk Wars has quite little to get people involved and was a pretty miserable experience, if you want a good harem show there are far better options out there and if you want an action show there are far better options out there. However, it can be worth watching if you want to form your own opinion on it (it has ANYONE who likes it, after all) or because of all the analysis done on it, or simply if you like to ocassionally watch bad shows and see what happens. I'm still going to watch Season Two, after all: I gotta see things through to the end.",

Often announced simultaneously for example:\r\nShinmai Maou no Testament, Gate\r\nStory 8 / 10\r\nThe story begins with Amagiri Ayato a transfer student to the Seidoukan Academy and progresses as ground work for what's to come for the future of a student that does not care about the combat called festas that surely but slowly is getting himself riddled on something darker. \r\nSince this is a dual cour series I won't go into detail until I've seen 2nd courbut it's well executed giving the serious moments their bubbles and good portrayal of character bonding on an Academy where everyone it's everyone enemy.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Animation 8.5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk has great animation and above average art that combined are way more than decent. It's objectively good with no problems.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI caught myself singing the OP of this series and goes without saying that the choice of BGM and OST are very good. The voice actors are very good as well and the ED does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nOn the first cour the character are very well developed and their dynamics are quite entertaining. The chemistry of the female lead Julis-Alexia is reminiscing of normally black haired heroines that are usually portrayed as very confident and proud (Kanzaki Kaori from A Certain Magical Index). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this first cour and I'm looking forward to the second cour. Mostly from the choice of visuals that seem to be a mixture from (Strike the Blood and A Certain Magical Index).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to someone who doesn't get bothered by extended groundwork and light hearted comedy, romance with the bonus of spectacular short battle sequences. \\n\\n\r\nDo not watch if you're illiterate (Using the Term loosely) and couldn't or don't know airing formats nor like Harem oriented anime.",

Well, one can't make a review of this anime without compering to another anime namely \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" or at least on the story (up) side, since it both features the same plot where it involves the female MC who met the male MC in a very awkward situation and plot wise, both partners have to compete in a contest that would pit their skills against another opponent . I mean if one where watchingboth animes their is at 70% similarities, where I rather not discuss anymore details and both climaxes where focus on fighting the strongest female contender, which is why I gave this anime's category a 5. About this anime's art(up) thought there where some fanservice involve, it didn't focus much on it to sell, thought they did made Claudia and Violet's  bikini fanservice  a little bit bitchy, but the good thing was that it only appeared briefly, so that is why I gave it a 6 for this anime's art. Sound (up), actually I just have nothing much to comment on this anime's sound pertaiting to the VA who did the character's voices, but I don't have much love for both the opening and closing themes of this anime, so I just limit it to a 6. Charcter (up) ok, the relationship between Ayato and Julis maybe a bit in the ambiguous side given that Julis was just too pridish to admit that she like Ayato and Ayato was just this garden variety harem guy , it was still good enough to see the two being together and supporting one another so for that this category should be \"GOOD enough. Unfortunately this anime has introduced too many support characters that they're not given enough aired time let alone that those from diffrent school weren't that much of climatic when it comes to the competition, but still, it's \"Good.\" Enjoyment (up), since this is the season were I've been watching 3 animes with a harem genre, my enjoyment was just limited as to how it will end and that's as \"FAIR as it can be, so overall (up)this anime was decent enough to such level that it didn't rely on the fanservice to sell, but it lacks it's own identity that it can be compared to  \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" , so season 2??????? Why not?\\n",

Oh yeah, there's also something about a magical school and a competition. The world in not very well presented.\r\nThe characters are simply walking, talking stereotypes. You probably won't even remember their names, only the character tropes. There's the very naive and powerful main character who doesn't get that ALL the girls are in love with him. There's the mainfemale lead who's a tsundere (not even a good one at that), there is the loli dandere (she is also not very well made cause she looks and sounds like the supercritical dandere, but she's very active and not at all shy nor quiet), there's the big boob loli girl who is completely depended on the main character and etc.\\n\r\nThe only reason why i'm not giving this  the worst score is because the animation and the look isn't all that bad, even if the fight scenes are terrible. Ah yes, the fight scenes. The genre of this anime is ACTION!

Of all the animes watched I can think of three animes namely Absolute Duo,Freezing and Infinite Stratos which has a similiar story and development. And this season (Fall 2015) an another similiar anime 'Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry' have been airing as well. Although both of them are good and intresting itmakes me wonder if if the money could have been used for a more creative and unique project.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art is great. Contains a lot of great scenery and special effects were good , not to mention battle art is cool as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - Opening song is phenomenal, sound track fits well and sounds good. Not much else to say at this point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 - Characters are pretty basic and its nothing new. I have seen same type of character many times. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 - I am without a doubt enjoying the anime, I look forward to the day each episode is released for the fun 22 minutes of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - It is a good anime without a DOUBT and have a lot of room for character development so it is one reason to watch it.

            "content": "Ah, harem.  The genre that I mostly find myself gravitating towards is the one that has to do with lots of girls and only one guy.  (Don't judge me.  We all have our favorite genre.)  So, with Fall 2015 coming to a close, we have Asterisk, a show that...really isn't much different from the rest of the harem shows out there to be honest.\r\nStory: The age of Genestella came when meteors rained down and sent the world into near extinction, but surprisingly, not as many people as you think died.  As a result of the fallout, a new society wasformed, one where people now possessed magical powers and were able to wield weapons made from the stones in these meteors called 'Luxes'.  And here, we follow the story of Amagiri Ayato, a boy who enters one of 6 schools (Seidoukan specifically) and enters the Phoenix Festa in order to find out what happened to his missing sister several years back.  Then he comes across a girl named Julis who starts to snap at him because of no fault of his own and  well, you get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk is generic.  There's no way around that fact.  The show focuses on Ayato as he progresses through his life at Seidoukan, entering the Festa, and coming across various characters along the way.  Most notably, harem members.  And really, that's about it.  He meets someone new (or old, since Saya is childhood friend), helps them, moves on.  Even during the fighting festival, he manages to help other girls in that.  Because of this, there really isn't much to say about the show.  The fact that it's generic makes it so that a lot of the plot points are very predictable, a lot of what happens doesn't really add much tension, and nothing really stands out as extraordinary or noteworthy to talk about.  It's not really bad, but at the same time it's not really good.  It's rather bland and I really can't express that any more.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Generic \\n\r\n-  Nothing really noteworthy to say about this show\\n\r\n-  This is just filler text.  Because there's nothing interesting to really say about Asterisk's story, I thought just add in this little bit so I could have three things in this section of the review.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in Asterisk reflect its story, by being as uninteresting as they can be.  (Because we all love anime tropes, right?)\\n\\n\r\nAmagiri Ayato is...well, what'd you expect in an anime like this.  He's a harem protag who's entire purpose in this show is to seek vengeance (or something) and help out any female human he possibly can before converting them to the Ayato religion where they worship his holy D.  (Sigh.  We've seen this a million times.)  As such, he doesn't really have anything unique about him to talk about.  Maybe the fact that he's not as OP as other harem protags that fit this category, but I don't think that deserves mention.\\n\\n\r\nThen the girls.  Let me line them up for you.  \\n\\n\r\nJulis = Token Tsundere\\n\r\nSaya = Kuudere Osananajimi (childhood friend)\\n\r\nKirin = Dandere Imouto\\n\r\nClaudia = Sexy Onee-san\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I really need to elaborate more, do I?  Ok.  Moving on then.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, well, they're not really all that important, according to the plot.  Most of the characters really serve to be plot-based and move what is happening in this series behind the scenes.  Others on the other hand are meant to be the main focus of the show, (aka, the harem girls), and as such are treated with a little bit more screentime.  Don't expect a lot from these people.  Most of them aren't really that interesting aside from a tiny handful.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Bland characters\\n\r\n-  Most of the side cast is meant to move along the plot\\n\r\n-  So, how's your day going?  (I ran out of things to talk about again.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Asterisk is something that I would say has more worth on it than its story and characters combined, and then some.  While the artstyle isn't really all that fantastic in terms of originality since it all pretty much looks the same as a lot of anime these days, the fighting scenes and its effects look pretty, so I'll give it that much.  Everything else, pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nice fight scenes\\n\r\n+/- Pretty standard animation\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Asterisk is also something that has a little bit more worth to the show as a whole.  Its OP \"Brave New World\" has a very techno and fast-paced feel that actually sounds rather good and fits with the show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand is another track that is rather nice to listen to.  It's quite somber and has a mellow tone to it that's relaxing and calm to listen to.  It's a good set of tracks to a not so very good show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  It's a harem; I tolerated it because of that, so there.  I'm not going to do my usual stuff because there really isn't anything good or bad to say about this show.  It's generic, and that enough should say enough about it.  It's a rather bland experience that doesn't leave too much to think about, and as such, isn't really worth talking about.  I don't hate it, I don't love it, I'm just indifferent to it.  If you want to watch a generic harem...well, you can watch this one.  A lot others are honestly crappier than this one.",

            "content": "I tried this just to see what a truly terrible anime is. I thought there might be some sort of sick enjoyment out of the complete shittiness.\r\nAnd there is, but it's buried deep under an extremely thick layer of pure unabated rage.\r\nI'll just say right now that I gave TAW exactly 4 minutes of my time. Because in 4 minutes everything was said. I watched Shinsekai Yori from the same studio, an anime I considered to have an excellent story and good characters but generally terrible production values and design. This is the same. Except the story and characters are shit too.\r\nSo why am Iwriting a \"review\" from 4 minutes of observation? Because it was, and I'm not being ironic, enough to be sure of a number of things:\\n\\n\r\n-This anime is godawful stupid\\n\r\n-This anime is godawful lazy\\n\r\n-This anime is just godawful, but with a special taste for mixing pretentious hardcore with stupidly stupid(I would have said lighthearted but come on, it's more stupid than anything)\\n\\n\r\nStory: A bunch of teenagers fight with swords because plot and the hero gets every girl on his penis. Think it's not enough? It's literally the entire plot of season 1. I checked. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: In less than 4 minutes I saw a bunch of random 3D models in a generic blurred background. More than that the art in general is generic and lazy, the characters look nothing fantastic, they have a pink-haired girl with long hair in there and they manage to make her look sort of ugly. Considering that long pink hair is pretty much my exact taste in anime girls, I don't even get how they managed that. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI was told the soundtrack is good and I want to believe it because less than 3 mins in I heard a super happy theme that was the most misfit and tone-shifting thing I heard in years. At 0:00 you're in a fight, at 0:05 the girl is crying in happiness and thankfulness, at 0:10 she's about to launch a fireball at the protagonist, and at 0:15 you're hearing the happiest theme there is. Was this even made by humans or computer generated by a first version AI attempting to appeal to us? So yeah it's a good soundtrack but if this is how they're going to use it, then 2/10 and holy god will anything about this not be completely lazy and sucky?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In 3 minutes I met:\\n\r\n-The teenager girl who is into a fight against a masked guy and says \"sorry x\" after she loses and dies\\n\r\n-The teenager guy who x was, who is the most generic here-to-help-all guy who's also crazy strong and is flustered everytime a boob is even hinted at\\n\r\n-Teenager tsundere girl with pink hair who manages to go from tsun to dere in less than 10 seconds then back to tsun then pulls a magic blast and destroys everything. And who could look a lot less shit.\\n\r\n-The teenager director(?) of the school who's as smily as her tits and sex drive are huge.\\n\r\n I would put 0/10 if possible, but I guess it'll be one. Pathetic is certainly a good definition, there is NO EFFORT at all. I won't even dignify this schlock with the word \"characterisation\", but at the very least, if your characters are shallow, make them fun. Here the production values are so low, the story is told in such a slingshot way, that even something as simple as a tsundere character comes off as false, and as not fun. I mean come on, could you get any lower for a professional studio? Actually don't answer that, I'm afraid of the answer.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 without irony again. If I could swallow this inane schlock for more than a few minutes I would probably find an extremely powerful sick enjoyment out of hating this with every cell of my body. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I can't, and I have less terrible things to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I didn't stop 3 minutes in because it was shit. If that was it, I'd have stood it to at least the end of the episode. No. My mind refused to carry along with this tremendous piece of lazy, barely shoved out crap, after two lines:\\n\r\n-After this event(the genostella children), the world was changed and a new order was made by [insert organisation whose name I can't even remember and who controls Asterisk Island]\\n\r\n-Due to the changes, a new morality was born in the world\\n\r\n-And now, panties\\n\\n\r\nWHAT? ARE YOU ACTIVELY TRYING TO FUCK WITH MY REMAINING BRAIN CELLS?\\n\\n\r\nYou literally took 3 sentences to go from \"a new world order\" to \"a new morality and set of social values\" to \"PANTIES\"!\\n\\n\r\nDo the people who put this mindless crap on the market even know that you can't throw stuff like \"new world order/new morality\" without actually showing how or what? That's like saying \"and thus the greatest soldier ever was born\". But then we don't see the soldier, we don't know how he fights, or even for whom.\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen such a sharp, poorly done storytelling in my entire life. I literally dropped it right then and there, paused the video, tried some more but the damage was done. In less than 4 minutes I was convinced that this wasn't just generic and poor, it was also horribly told and had absolutely no idea of what it was talking about. And lots of shows are generic and mindless, but this one is lazy and veeeeery poorly made to boot.\\n\\n\r\nIf I ever want to hate anime, I'll be sure to come back to this.",

The competition is about some Magical Fantasy Fighting Competition which up till now I still do not understand their powers and stuff relating to it. With the anime being completed, the ending ends offwith a fight and some unnecessary fan-service. Which I think is a bad ending considering that I did not understand it \\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThat art was pretty good as it shows the vibrant colours and the Art Directors must have spent large amount of time reviewing the art and improving it. And this is one of the good things and maybe its the ONLY GOOD THING about this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending was pretty good and the voice actors and actresses have played their roles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 3\\n\r\nJust like any other harem shows, there are unnecessary fan-service and annoying characters that always ruin the good moments of the show. It is very disturbing to find that it is also wasting screen-time. Although I'm a Fan of harem animes, the rating of 3 is mainly because of the annoying characters trying to act cute but got rejected by the main characters \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4 \\n\r\nThis show was not enjoyable and I'm not even expecting myself to be watching Season 2 which would be airing next year \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 4\\n\r\nOverall, The only good thing about this show is the Art and Sound but the rest is really terrible and horrible. \\n\r\nAnd Therefore I Warn Everyone Who Is Interested In This Show To Not Watch It.\\n",

Hasta ah\u00ed es pasable, lo que no es aceptable es que este chico se encuentre en varias situaciones en que una chica, aka la amiga de la infancia, la loli esa op, la presi o la pelirroja/rosa tundeare (\"algo nunca antes visto\") se le ponen delante invit\u00e1ndole con todas las de la ley a graduarse del club de los v\u00edrgenes y el decide salir por patas como si se hubiera dejado el m\u00f3vil en el autob\u00fas.\\n\r\nEsto se\u00f1ores, es algo pat\u00e9tico y que falla completamente a que simpaticemos con el personaje, ya que cualquiera, y digo cualquiera de los j\u00f3venes adolescentes de quince a\u00f1os que se le ponga a huevo tal oportunidad la desaprovecha voluntariamente, lo que hace que parezca un personaje irreal y dif\u00edcil de que nos agrade, a parte de que la mayor\u00eda de veces concluye en un gag ya mas gastado que el genero de este anime.\\n\r\nEl torneo es una excusa barata para que los personajes luchen, teniendo un premio mas abstracto que los cuadros de Dal\u00ed.\\n\r\nLas chicas de la serie, lo que suele destacar de estos animes con \"harem\" para hacerlos algo atractivos, son decepcionantes, no quedando nunca claro de que palo van.\\n\r\nLas peleas son un chiste, desde la primera de todas en que son dos rallas de colores chocando, pasando por la que lucha mientras lleva a la chica en brazos y vuela because yes, hasta las finales, cuya tensi\u00f3n radica en que no te metan un flashback con exposici\u00f3n sobre los personajes.\\n\r\nEn resumen, es un desprop\u00f3sito de anime, el cual gana mucho borracho y vi\u00e9ndolo con amigos, pero que pese a todo no recomiendo mirar.\\n\r\nPd: sigo sin saber a que viene el \"Asterisk\" del titulo. No me extra\u00f1ar\u00eda que el concepto saliera durante el anime, pero como cuesta mucho que te mantenga atento por su pobre trama y aburrido avance, pues ni papa.",

It tries to give a good and a little complicated story and plot, but because of it's short run time (will change when the new season comes out in april 2016 hopefully) the goal of the plot becomes unknow. I mean sure, so far its about a group of magical warriors who fight in a tag team fight tournament and the winner(s? not sure) can make their/his or her wish come true if it is in the power of the current world to fulfilll.\r\nIn the end of theseason they teaser that something might have happend to the protagonist his sister and that we might know the villian. I am looking forward to the second season to find out what will happen, but thats also the problem. The first season doesn't make much sense without the storyline yet to come and thats why i can only give it a 6 for now (might review this season again after next season has aired)",

Eventually they take part in big tournament where they fight 2 vs 2 with other students. They dreams may come true as a prize cause everyone have some kind of desire.\r\nIn reality it's another, typical harem with story focused on grand tournament where our MC's have to win! There's nothing special, the romance is bad, ecchi is bad, harem ain't good at all..\r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nWell.. It's even worse than story. Our Protagonist-Kun is typical, boring MC whodoesn't have \"eggs\" at all. Literally, hot girl invites him to stay a night and he refuses.. Other than him we have mentioned by me Princess-kun who is tsundere and is also typical harem character. We also have little, no booby childhood friend who lacks expressions and is jealous of booby-one girl our Protagonist-Kun met during his school time.\\n\\n\r\nFor real I enjoyed side characters way more.. even If they air time is like 10 minutes in total.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing special but it's not that bad. Voice acting is just okay, altho i don't like Princess-kun voice. Sounds are meh, BGM is meh. Techno-like music during fight is okay. Overall music is just decent, okay?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBasically this is the strongest part of the show.. Animations and fights are good.. of course i've seen way better animations but I'm gonna let it be. Art is pretty standard, nothing special. Character design is not good, standard harem set. I liked side characters design more, for instance our Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe score is high because i like that kind of shows when I am kinda bored and some fight and story of Vampire is quite good for me but that's just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTl;Dr:\\n\\n\r\nIt's standard harem story with bad romances and nothing special in it.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I went to Disney World \u2013 that is the one in Florida (the good one) and not the one in California \u2013 for the first time, it was around my birthday. If you do not know, at Disney, they pamper you to no end. They make sure that every move you make and every event you experience fills you with nothing but happiness. It is pretty scary how good they are at keeping you smiling.\r\nSo there I was, at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth, and it was my birthday. True to Disneyform, they made me happy by giving me a special, green badge to wear. Wearing it around the parks meant skipping the long lines, extra signatures from the characters, and the regular restaurant staff giving me kind words and free desserts. Needless to say, I was a supremely happy kid.\\n\\n\r\nI speak of badges because Gakusen Toshi Asterisk gives badges to its characters, too. (Also, finding a tangentially relevant anecdote was pretty difficult for this one.) But Asterisk could learn a thing or two from Disney about how to make its audience happy.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues with Asterisk is that the anime does not have an established plot to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a split-cour anime, meaning the second season is realistically the second half, the direct continuation as opposed to a whole new set of ideas. What this means is that a lot of the events revolve around just introducing characters and establishing setting instead of actually having worthwhile events.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Julis gets the first couple of episodes which are shared somewhat with Saya and Claudia. Kirin gets a couple of episodes for herself, too. Then Kirin shares one episode with Saya, and then the last few episodes are (strangely) about two new characters that showed up at the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is all character-oriented material. Nothing that occurs within these separate scenarios \u2013 like Julis confronting an evildoer who sent her a letter or Kirin fighting off some monsters with Ayato helping her \u2013 affect the larger, overarching narrative.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is this narrative? A lot of it involves unnecessary sexual, harem-based content. It is almost certain that Julis is the one he will choose in the end, considering their partnership and main character statuses. Meaning, the other characters fawning over Ayato seems rather pointless. Furthermore, any and all advances are met with Ayato being too flustered to do anything or with Ayato too afraid to make a move, highlighting said pointlessness.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest driving force for the narrative is the \u201cFenix Festa,\u201d a tournament where the best students of the different academies duel one another. The issue here is that the tournament does not start until later on in the season. That is, for roughly three-quarters of the show, the most important driving force is ignored. Yes, the characters are constantly training for the tournament, but it is never a conflict that they have to directly deal with until much later.\\n\\n\r\nThen, once the tournament starts, the anime spends an inordinate amount of time on those aforementioned side characters, Irene and Priscilla. Not only do these side characters come too late into the season but also they divert attention away from Ayato, Julis, and the other characters who are easily more important.\\n\\n\r\nWorse still is the lack of world building. Very little information is given on the different factions throughout the city; only random snippets from conversations or quick rundowns let the audience understand how this society functions. Thus, the different fighters and weapons and groups have no basis and therefore no relevance.\\n\\n\r\nNarrowing the scope, Asterisk still has problems. A number of subplots go unexplained, like the Cat guardians, the backstory about Ayato\u2019s sister, and the behind-the-scenes dealings with Clauida to name a few. The idea is that these separate subplots will be resolved later on in the second half of the anime, but so little was given about them that they feel more like tacked-on inclusions rather than important pieces of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEven on a thematic level, the anime has trouble. Asterisk focuses on the theme of what it is that motivates people. Or as the characters phrase it, \u201cwhat it is I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d Protecting another, upholding tenets, and righting wrongs are all valid motivators, motivators that the different members of the cast hold fast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the extra aspects \u2013 namely the comedy and the sex \u2013 of Asterisk make it difficult to take its serious thoughts seriously. For example, Ayato (and the audience) seeing Julis and Saya\u2019s undergarments after getting splashed by a fountain is unnecessary. And when Irene sucks blood from Priscilla\u2019s neck, the action can only be described as sensual and thus distracting.\\n\\n\r\nBut to be as fair as possible, there is a second half to Asterisk, a half that presumably will sort out all of these narrative conflicts and inherent problems. So even though the show looks rough now, there is still an entire season left to go.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk\u2019s art and animation is a mixture of both solid and subpar offerings.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography is often standard, except for rare perspectives such as a shot taken from Ayato\u2019s point-of-view when Julis\u2019s hands are covering his face or when bullets are shown hitting other bullets in slow motion. Lighting likewise remains relatively standard. And the same can be said for the art itself. Locations feel \u201cthe same\u201d: an arena for fighting, a nice-looking room, and small parts of the city are as adventurous as the show gets. The lack of diversity can be attributed to the lack of world building \u2013 since the anime decided not to flesh out its world, the anime\u2019s art suffers, too.\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk also likes to use CG for many of its effects. The materialization of guns, the smaller particles, and the robots that Ernesta developed are a few examples where CG makes an appearance. The CG is not groundbreaking, but it is used in such a way that the scenes and effects are bolstered, not hampered, by its inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nBolstering occurs with the actual animation as well, remaining at an above average level throughout the season. Hair swaying and faces contorting are present as well as other nuanced effects such as sparkling eyes and moving limbs. The animation even keeps up during the numerous duels: swords swing, flames bloom, and characters run. Even Ayato\u2019s abilities \u2013 which more often than not devolve into a quick cut of him flashing across the screen \u2013 have their moments, like when he grapples Kirin or when he uses a massive attack in the final battle.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, their inclusion of color symbolism is nice to see. Julis\u2019s pink symbolizes hotness, Kirin\u2019s lavender symbolizes sweetness, Saya\u2019s blue symbolizes calmness, Claudia\u2019s yellow symbolizes happiness, and Ayato\u2019s purple symbolizes respectfulness.\\n\\n\r\nBut the colors are, unfortunately, all that distinguish them. Their hair is not gaudy and their eyes are pretty, yet they each wear more or less the same school outfit. And since they rarely switch out of their school outfits, they look less like their own characters and more like a specific color moving around on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAsterisk has a fair amount of problems with its cast, problems caused by the anime splitting itself up. Still, the cast partially holds its own.\\n\\n\r\nOn a thematic level, they represent the idea that everyone fights for someone. Ayato fights for Julis. Julis fights for the kids in the orphanage. And Kirin and Saya fight for their respective fathers. Claudia may be fighting for Ayato, but technically the audience does not know quite yet where her true thoughts lay. (Hopefully the second season will clear this confusion up.)\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, it is this need to protect another that pushes the characters forward. They take action not for themselves but for the person (or people) they hold dear. This theme is not explored outright, but having this commonality exist between each member of the cast proves that they were given at least a modicum of attention.\\n\\n\r\nMoving to an individual basis, perhaps it is best to start with the best. The strongest character of Asterisk is Kirin and rightly so \u2013 she was given three whole episodes to flesh out her character. She starts out in a rough spot: Her menacing uncle physically abuses her and, for some reason unbeknownst to the audience, she accepts said abuse. Ayato fights for her honor, but he surprisingly loses.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is not the end for Kirin. She speaks with Ayato afterwards, expressing how grateful she is to have Ayato even attempt to stick up for her. The two quickly become friends (Kirin seems to have a crush on the boy), and their morning practices become a ritual.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until Kirin and Ayato are attacked by a bunch of regenerating dragons (and while half naked) that she recounts her reason for suffering under her uncle. She has been, for years now, fighting to prove the innocence of her father who was accused unjustly. Ayato hears her words, encouraging her to take her own path.\\n\\n\r\nShe agrees, confronting her uncle and getting (backhand) slapped in the process. But she does not waver. Instead, she decides to fight Ayato once more, losing but realizing that this new path \u2013 her path \u2013 is the one that she wants to follow. And when her uncle confronts her again, Kirin sees that just because she has taken a path of her own volition that does not mean that she will be left to fight by her lonesome.\\n\\n\r\nThis whole character arc for Kirin is technically small, but she goes from introducing her traits, to dealing with her conflict, and then finally wrapping up said conflict, developing her character as best as the show could with the time constraints and the size of the cast. The rest of the cast, however, is not as lucky as Kirin.\\n\\n\r\nJulis is next on the totem pole. She pushes others away, believing that she can and should fight using only her own strength. When Ayato arrives, she comes to understand the value of camaraderie, placing her trust in the boy who vows to help her. She has a backstory with an orphanage that has yet to be used directly (hopefully in the second season), yet the biggest mistake is the part of her past relating to a girl named Elenshquigall Oph\u00e9lia (what a name) shown for not even five seconds before it is brushed over. (Again, hopefully the second season addresses this tidbit.)\\n\\n\r\nNext would be Saya. She is aimless to the point of getting lost while out and about, she is evidently in love with Ayato, and she is a fan of saying \u201cKaboom\u201d nonchalantly. Her listlessness only drops whenever the subject of her father is brought up. He was ostracized by his peers for his unorthodox methods in gun creation. She is mostly there for comedic relief, but she does form a connection with Kirin. For now, as a main-but-really-a-side character, Saya does what she has to; her time will come later on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the bottom of the totem pole rests both Ayato and Claudia. Ayato suffers from being a self-insert character: he is incredibly powerful, he is surrounded by beautiful women, and he is just the nicest guy ever. To be fair, his power is more a curse than a blessing since it hurts him and saps his strength. As for why this is, it has yet to be explained (more next-season knowledge). And as such, Ayato\u2019s character remains relatively static throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nClaudia is, surprisingly, the worst of the bunch. About halfway through the season, she, like Julis, very briefly mentions a trouble she is carrying: Her mother in the Integrated Enterprise Foundation is apparently someone who has no \u201cirrational sense of self-interest\u201d and has no \u201cpersonal desires.\u201d And, like Julis, this trouble is forgotten about entirely. It is not until the end of the season when she reveals her first important trait: Her weapon, Pan-Dora, forces her to view her \u201ceventual death,\u201d indicating her immense mental fortitude. The rest of the time, Claudia is relegated to sexual relief and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nCollectively, and given that this is a split-cour anime, Asterisk did not create a strong group of characters, but it did not create a weak group of characters either.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is undoubtedly the best part of the anime. It starts off slow and soft, lulling the listener into a peaceful mood. The piano and violins are gentle and beautiful, boosting the peacefulness further. But the track does not keep this tone for long; the halfway marker transitions the track into techno land. Here, the space-like effects fall more in-line with Asterisk\u2019s futuristic motif. All the while, the vocalist uses nothing but English lyrics, giving the track a unique feel. Overall, the ED is a powerhouse that should not go unheard.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is nowhere near the strength of the ED, but it does deserve some credit. The OP sticks more to the techno and space-like effects that the ED adopted, and it is certainly more intense, contrasting well with the ED. The track itself is nothing special, however, since it is a lot of beats and instruments crammed together. At the minimum, the vocalist sings wonderfully in terms of range and emotion, keeping the OP from being completely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is akin to the OP in that many of the tracks are fine for what they are but not much more. Flutes and bongos fill the slice-of-life moments. Dubstep and fast tracks make up the action-heavy moments. And a melancholic and mysterious piano track accompanies the equally sad and ominous moments. This last track is the only one that particularly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting performances are concerned, they are about average in their execution. Ari Ozawa as Kirin gives the young girl quite the cute voice, but the voice is almost too high-pitched. Ai Kakuma as Julis gives the short-tempered girl a fiery disposition. And Nao Touyama as Claudia provides a mature, sexy voice that is nice on the ears. And a (negative) shout out to Yuuko Gotou for using an annoying voice as an announcer for Kirin and Saya\u2019s duel, hurting their whole scene.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems I have with the anime, I still find it pretty fun at times.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially all of the romance asides. Kirin sidling closer to Ayato when she realizes she still has a shot. Saya calling Ernesta a \u201cthieving cat\u201d when Ernesta pecked Ayato\u2019s cheek with a kiss. And Julis acting like the stereotypical tsundere on a consistent basis. Then there is Claudia whose sexually aggressive nature is always a treat.\\n\\n\r\nI really do not care for the battles, though. Not too much is at stake and Ayato (inevitably) always wins. I would much rather the anime stick to the previous material: flirting, blushing, and romancing. Even then, there are certain moments \u2013 like Ayato and Julis\u2019s first match where he falls on her and grabs her breast (way too overdone by now) and Kirin and Saya taking a shower after their match (not very tactful) \u2013 that I can do without.\\n\\n\r\nThinking on it more, I like all of the members of the cast besides Ayato. The girls are some combination of cute, sexy, and funny. Kirin is beyond adorable, Saya is hilarious in her unemotional responses, and Julis wanting to get her head rubbed because the other girls got the same treatment is amazing. Of course, Claudia in nothing but a bathrobe or a bathing suit is more than welcomed. Ayato, however, is just not interesting. Obviously that is the point, but I wish he had more of a personality besides \u201cthat super-nice dude.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk is a split-cour anime that stumbles from the get-go. The narrative has major issues, and while the characters, the visuals, and the music avoid similar mistakes, they are not without their own. Disney levels of happiness are impossible to reach, but hopefully the second half of the show can give its audience their very own green, happy-birthday badge.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, lack of a driving force, improper world building, and thematic troubles each harm the narrative, but the knowledge that a second half is on the horizon helps to explain some of the misgivings\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, average art, cinematography, and lighting, with nice CG, above average actual animation, and okay character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, besides Kirin, the rest of the cast is either just primed for the second half or just not focused on enough\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, about average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Claudia, Kirin, Saya, and Julis are fun, but Ayato is lame and the battles are lamer\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "The story centers on a guy who is secretly more powerful than he lets on and his harem of girls who use magical weapons to battle...wait, that describes three different shows from this & last season. This review is for The Asterisk War but there may be some comparison to the other two shows, Anti-Magic Academy: The 35th Test Platoon & Hundred. It's inevitable given all the similarities between all three shows. Of the three The Asterisk War is the best, because it lacks the cringe worthy flaws of the other two shows. Though it\u2019s clear they all have feelings for Ayato it\u2019s not tothe point where they are throwing their panties at him. Or themselves. They actually take the time to build the relationships between the characters. Also the enemy is clearly defined, though there are some shadowy machinations behind the scenes. And the battles are energetic and entertaining. Something else praise worthy is the fact that Julis can stand on her own. She\u2019s not dependent on Ayato to save the day. They are more of partners than anything else.  It\u2019s not truly a harem show, or a school show. In fact I\u2019m not sure how to classify this show. It\u2019s set in a high school, yet I don\u2019t ever recall seeing them in a classroom. The thing is, it\u2019s also quite cliche. The characters are...how you say cookie cutter, sure to remind you of characters from other series. Sure we take a moment to explore them and their motivations but these come straight out of the \u201cHow To Create Characters\u201d textbook. And nothing relating to their powers their relation to their weapons is explained (NOTE: It might be and I\u2019ve just forgotten, but that just means it\u2019s unmemorable). It doesn\u2019t excel in any department except the fight scenes. In all honesty it\u2019s a mediocre show at best but it gets bonus points because it\u2019s better than the other two aforementioned shows. Hence why it got a second season. Normally I review anime objectively, but the three shows are so similar I thought I\u2019d mention the other two. So in conclusion I say watch The Asterisk War and skip the other two.",

            "content": "A perfectly good example of \"average\". Nothing in particular felt bad, or even subpar. However, per a review online, it did feel like the studio took a \"How To Make Popular Anime: 101\" guide book and followed it to the T. \r\nIt did feel generic, and the main reason it scores below an 8 for me is that I was hard pressed to 'feel' anything for the characters. Sure, the harem was likeable. But that does not equal being able to really invest in their character designs or personalities. It didn't affect me the way ReLIFE, Toradora, or even Infinite Stratos did.\r\nThe show was goodfor sure, but in a very technical way. The animations were great, the music was good, the harem was good, but it all lacked a certain personality, uniqueness, or air about it. It could have improved much more by going deeper into relationship development or even deeper writing. The political aspects were very interesting to watch and I would like more of that backstory. The writing simply did not strike a particular chord with me, despite being decent. Still enjoyable but fell a bit short, especially compared to Chivalry of a Failed Knight which is shorter but emotionally holds together better. \\n\\n\r\nI can see why people hate this show, and there are some valid points there. However, this anime wasn't particularly \"horrible\" at any aspect, and it gets most of its points of my rating from enjoyment as opposed to execution. It was a tad forgettable.",

            "content": "I managed to watch this anime all the way through, regrettably, not dropping it halfway. Oh how I'm disappointed. This anime is clearly very stereotypical, in all it's choices. How you ask? \r\nLet's begin with the characters. I think if they weren't plucked from each stereotypical character trope, and splashed with colourful hair, than I think the Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, would lose many of it's fans. (I persevered, due to my love for Saya.)  First you have your plain, overpowered male protagonist, who attracts all the girls, and gets caught up in a lot of events, as progression for the plot. We have thisin Ayato, who joins Seidokan Academy, the scene for most of the events in the anime. Then we have our tsunderes and lolis coming out. Before you know it, Ayato, and his friends (pretty much girls) are battling for victory in tournaments.\\n\\n\r\nThese tournaments, are what we are told about early on. This takes up a lot of the plot, besides, the problems, of our main characters. I feel that many there are many plot holes, and unanswered questions, that the viewer wants to learn about, during the anime, which saddened me. These story points, that I felt I'd learn about, I never did, so I'm at the very least pleased Season 2 is coming soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, is bright and attractive, but sometimes, it's lazy, outside of fight scenes. The music is half decent, but not memorable. In conclusion, I think Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a shambles. I'd only recommend it, if you are desperate, for your deres, but if you haven't watched it, don't bother.",

None of them truly stand out for me now that it's been weeks since I've seen the show, but the fight scenes are quite decent; I just don't remember any if someone were to ask. \r\nVisually,the show is saved by being so new.

            "content": "WARNING THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS. I TRIED TO REVEAL AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, WHILE STILL COMMENTING ON CERTAIN PARTS OF THE SHOW\r\nI don't write many reviews. When I finish a show I usually just give it a score and move on to the next one.\r\nHOWEVER\r\nSometimes a show comes up that I just need to rant about, for good or bad reasons. I would consider the scores I give out very generous. I have seen complaints about \"inflated\" scores on MAL where people give out scores on a scale similar to a school grading system where a 5 or 6 is the lowest theywill give a show, however I consider my scores generous because I rate them on the 1-10 scale but tend to give a lot of shows an extra point or two. I don't like giving out low scores and I try to find something good or something I liked in everything I watch. So naturally if give out a score of 1, it means I wasn't able to find anything I enjoyed in it. I rarely give out a score like this and I really just wanted rant about this show and why I gave it this score. Now after this really long introduction I present the meaningless opinion of a random anime fan on the internet about The Asterisk War.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 1\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the reasons I tend to be generous with scores. I usually don't notice any problems with the story of a show unless I find it confusing, boring, or has very obvious flaws. The Asterisk War was all three of these for me. I was confused, because I had no clue what the point of this show was. Ayato shows up at the school for no good reason and with no objective in mind. The show introduces a huge upcoming tournament between the other schools in Asterisk, so we are made to assume that the point is going to be to win this tournament BUT WHY. Ayato did not know about this tournament before coming to the school so he was not planning on participating in it at all, and also we don't know what winning this tournament will do for any of the characters or what the consequences of them losing are. There are also parts in the show where these \"antagonists\" say ambiguous things about needing to win the tournament (which it is still not clear what winning accomplishes) and about how Ayato needs to be eliminated. Why does Ayato (I will talk about what I think of his character later) have to be eliminated? He is shown to be completely overpowered, but he is also shown to know just as much about what is going on in this story as we do. How is Ayato going to get in their way if he has no goal he is trying to accomplish, and has no clue who you even are. We don't know why Ayoto is even here or why he does anything he does, we don't know what these \"antagonists\" are trying to accomplish, so basically THERE IS NO STORY. Over the course of an entire series we learn NOTHING about the goals of any of the characters, or what the point of story is. I also found this story very boring as well. I am a sucker for good action and you would think that one of the generic school battle light novel adaptations would at least have some good action, but many of the action scenes were boring and unmemorable. The only fight I really remember is the fight between Ayato and Harem Girl #4, because it was one of the only even fights in the entire show. Characters in this show are so overpowered a lot of fights tend to be completely one sided and will either end in a matter of seconds, or feature characters getting the shit beaten out of them for way too long. There are also a plethora of plot holes and contrivances that I noticed on my own, and noticed even more of after reading some other reviews of the show. I don' want to get into spoiler territory so I'll only mention the stupid moment from the first episode where Ayato saves Harem Girl #1 from being shot and HER ATTEMPTED MURDER IS COMPLETELY IGNORED. I wish I was joking, Harem Girl #1 was SHOT AT and after a cringeworthy boob grab the incident is never brought up again. The story (if you can even call it a story) is so bad I can't even think of a word that can describe how bad I think it is. There does not seem to be any point to this story, combined with the fact that it is just plain boring for 90% of the show, and all the blatant plot holes that are ever present I award the story with a score of 1. I honestly would give it a 0 if I could, because in my opinion a show needs to actually have a story to be given a score for one.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound : 7\\n\r\nThis show was done by A-1 Pictures, and A-1 Pictures shows tend to be 50-50 with me. Half of the things A-1 releases I will like and the other half I will despise, however one thing I always usually like about A-1 shows is the Art and Sound. I found the art in this show to be at their usual quality, the show was very colorful and had some decent animation. The only complaint I have is that there wasn't really anything that stood out to me, it was just the A-1 Pictures standard which isn't bad, but nothing worthy of praise. I feel the same way about the sound as well. The only track from the show that really stood out was the ending. (The ending song is one of my favorite endings of all time) Aside from the ending there wasn't really anything to praise about the sound. Even if I did find the Art and Sound to be okay it is not enough to save the show, and had very little impact on my overall score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 1\\n\r\nI forgive bad characters in shows a lot, because some of the shows I enjoyed the most didn't have the best characters, but I have never come across a show where I hated EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. Earlier I said I would talk about what I think of Ayato, but it is hard to talk about Ayatos character, as he has almost no character traits. Does he have likes, dislikes, goals, motivation, strengths, weaknesses, emotions, or anything that makes it seem like he has a fraction of a personality? NO! I thought I had seen the rock bottom of generic protagonists, because I didn't think it was possible to make a \"character\" without any character traits whatsoever. I would mention the rest of the main cast one by one, but I honestly don' think I can write more than a sentence about each of them. So the rest of the main cast or as I like to call them \"Harem Girls 1-4\" are nothing more than than the standard harem cast. They at least have some personality, unlike the protagonist, however only Harem Girl #1 and Harem Girl #2 seem like they are going to be important. Many of the characters just feel pointless, even members of the main cast. I just plain hated every character in the show and I don't know what else to say, because there isn't much character to talk about for the character section.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 1\\n\r\nWhat can I say that I didn't already say? I found no entertainment in this show, I don't know I didn't drop this show. The only reason I decided to write this review is because this was the only anime I have ever felt contains no entertainment value at all.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nUnless you are looking to watch something bad, I would not recommend this to anybody. Even if you are a fan of school battle light novels I wouldn't recommend this. This show is just plain bad, its not even the type of bad where its unintentionally funny, it has no redeeming qualities or anything that makes it worth watching. If you want to see just how bad a show can be then you can force yourself to suffer through this show, if you want entertainment then you are in the wrong place. To sum up my opinion of this show in one word \"DON'T\"",

That's a big achievement.\r\nLet's get right into this.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nLet me say, the plot is not the worst thing in existence, but how it was executed, was HORRIBLE. This plot has many, MANY plot holes, dumb coincidences, unneeded fanservice to the point where it was cringeworthy and even PREDICTABLE most of the time, and a very unstable pace of plot, usually sloooooooow. Oh, and also, it ends in the most unsensical place I've seen in an anime. The story is ahuge mess.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 8/10\\n\r\nThey were the only good points to this anime, and you know what? It's decent, both of them. But here's the thing. I DON'T GIVE A CRAP. The animation and sound, if it's good, good for the anime. I don't like a good anime with mediocre animation and sound as much as I do a good anime with good animation and sound. I think 100% of people will agree with me on that. But can it change the rating of a show? To me, no. So I don't give a crap, even though the art and sound is actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nThe Characters. Ah, the characters. What is this, a copy of SAO? SAO is a horrid anime. This anime copied SAO, and somehow made it even WORSE. Super op character? Check. Badass into Tsundere? Check. All the girls like the main, super op character? Double check. I don't get it. What's so good about Ayato? He's strong? He has purple hair? He looks EXACTLY like Kirito? All the characters are cli\u0107he cardboard cutouts that have absolutely NOTHING interesting going for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nWhy? WHY is this anime ranked higher and rated better than animes like Black\u2605Rock Shooter? Why is it rated so goddamn HIGH? How does ANYONE see good in this anime, so much so that they give it a goddamn 10!? This anime had GLARING issues, and I wish I'd dropped it before I reached the end. Why did I think it was gonna get better during the Festa? (Minor spoiler, but it's revealed in the 1st ep I think.) \\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\r\nWorse than SAO. A job well done, A-1, you topped your worst anime(maybe)with another anime. I wonder if that was your goal. Either way, it's downright horrible. Asterisk War gets a grand total of 1/10.

But none the less, it was a fun one to watch and what we have already is good enough to get your fill or thrilling action. Many of the characters though, are your basic archetypes put to the test, but isn't as heavy handed as other action harems like it.

            "content": "If I had to use one word to describe Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, it would be \u201cboring.\u201d\r\nThe story follows a generic harem MC named Ayato who just arrives at Seidoukan Academy. A school for people with magical powers. In order to help the students control their powers and to train them for a tournament, the school allows them to duel each other. \r\nThe setup is really nothing. It\u2019s just a way to have the characters fight each other. The fight themselves aren\u2019t really entertaining to watch. This is because Ayato is just overpowered. They use an excuse of why Ayato can\u2019t fight at full power, hissister put a limiter on him, which only allows him to fight for five minutes, then he needs a day to rest. This doesn\u2019t work because it just feels it\u2019s there to create tension, which it completely fails at. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are just what you expect to be in a battle harem. Ayato, the overpowered lead who ends up gathering women around him. Julis, the tsundere love interest. Saya, the flat childhood friend. Claudia, the mysterious beauty. And Kirin, the oppai loli.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the show thought it was being mysterious. It kept introducing characters, and new subplots. Every character who wasn\u2019t the main group, were all working in the shadows, or doing shady things.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about the show - the art and sound were just average. They weren\u2019t bad, but they were also not anything special.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t enjoy this anime at all. I felt it was below average, and not worth a watch. Even if you\u2019re bored, there are way better battle harems that you can watch.",

The main character's personalities are diverse since it is a harem anime which gives you laughter that brings you good vibes when you're down. The fight scenes are awesome for an action-sci-fi, fantasy anime because ofthe lightsaber-esque weapons and big guns found in most sci-fi anime and FPS games. The animation is awesome a big thanks to A-1 Pictures, the animation studio that brings you Blue Exorcist and Sword Art Online. The series music is very catchy and great thanks to Rasmus Faber for providing the series music including the series opening music \"Brand-New World\" by Shiena Nishizawa who is notable for contributing the ending of music of KanColle \"Fubuki\". \\n\\n",

So firstly I know people tend to hate on it due to the severe lack of any real character progression or depth. \r\nIn my opinion the anime redeems itself: \r\n1 - with its stellar visuals and sound,\r\n2 - with its likeable, fun and caricatured (although often 2 -dimensional) characters\r\n3 - by being fun to watch.\r\n(keep in mind  this is far from a masterpiece, but if you're looking for such, you are looking in the wrong place my friend)\r\nHowever, it does leave the plot asan afterthought, but it is kinda there. I hope the second season addresses this. \\n\\n\r\nIt has great action and the premise/setting is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are an SAO fangirl/boy - bless your soul - this anime will probably fill that Kirito shaped whole in your heart if you're unable to find another anime that quenches your thirst for too nice OP harem dudes with swords and scruffy hair.\\n\\n\r\nI think this review covered most of the bases...

            "content": "When you look at the genre tags, it\u2019s poster and watch the PV\u2019s for Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, the first thing that may come in your mind is \u201cWait, didn\u2019t I already watch this already\u201d. Yes, yes you have, and this anime is nothing special. Hell, there is another anime this season that has a similar premise and presentation. Yet it is able to entertain, even with its \u201cseen this before\u201d premise and its generic tropes used. Though a flawed anime, it\u2019s guilty pleasure anime may please some, though it may disinterest others too. Nevertheless, its high production values are sure to pull in some viewersin.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe plot focuses on Amagiri Ayato and how he transfers to Seidoukan Academy to find his missing sister, or it was supposed to focus on that. The anime quickly crosses out that storyline for the sake of focusing on Ayato teaming with with Julis, a rapier-wielding love interest for the protagonist, and together they compete in the Phoenix Festa. Along the way, Ayato meets other competitors such as Saya and Kirin, who are all just here to be added in Ayato\u2019s harem list. And\u2026 that\u2019s it! It\u2019s as generic as it sounds. As obvious as it is, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk\u2019s story isn\u2019t its strong points. It would have been a lot better if the story focused on Ayato\u2019s lost sister rather than the festival, as the festival storyline is filled with \u201cseen this, done that\u201d type of stuff. However it\u2019s not terrible, as it still works. However this is just the first half of what they will present to us, so hopefully its second half ends up breaking its generic storyline in half.\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nAs a fantasy action, ecchi, harem, school anime, it does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do. Main characters competes with skilled opponents, proves he\u2019s the stronger one, gets all the ladies, and rinse and repeat. A-1 Pictures probably didn\u2019t have an issue doing this anime as they have done things like these before. However, as expected from A-1 Pictures, the production value for this anime is splendid. And this anime doesn\u2019t seem like it wants to escape from its generic tropes as its having a fine time standing out because of its quality production values. Those who are fans of the genres this tackles will have a fine time with Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, but those who aren\u2019t aren\u2019t going think differently about these types of anime after watching this; it might just make it worse.\\n\r\nPresentation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk consists of one main male character and a near-handful of female characters, because it\u2019s a harem, what did you expect! Ayato is your typical fantasy-harem protagonist. He\u2019s an underrated competitor and most of the girls go gaga over him. He is particularly that interesting as he doesn\u2019t stand out much compared to other protagonists of similar series. The main female character, Julis, is also quite typical, clich\u00e9-driven too. They try to add a backstory for her to make her seem like a developed character, but it ends up ineffective. There are other female characters such as Claudia (I have no idea why she\u2019s so interested in Ayato) who is your typical \u201chorny-for-protagonist\u201d type of character, Saya, who is your typical emotionless girl who believe she deserved to be with Ayato because she knows hime more, and Kirin is your typical deredere kohai who gained self-esteem and confidence from the protagonist. As I probably mention before repeatedly, the characters feel very typical and their interactions between one another is nothing special considering it is an ecchi-harem. However, since the female characters are attractive, fun-enough, and cute, they end up being likeable, even if there characters you\u2019ve seen before. \\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nA-1 Pictures doesn\u2019t disappoint again as the art is beautiful in Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. The colors are vivid and a treat to the eye. The backgrounds are well detailed and it\u2019s just gorgeous to look at. The character design is also really good, and they help the characters be a little more interesting than they actually are. However, even the art style is very typical. It\u2019s the same type of art you would expect in a fantasy-school anime, but it works well. The character designs, though great, are still \u201cseen this already\u201d type of character looks. Never has this anime made me think that they could have made the art better here.\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nAnimation quality is also fantastic. The style is the same as every other fantasy school anime, but it works very well. Everything is very smooth and it looks gorgeous. Fight scenes were also animated really well. Although some fights were cut short in length, that\u2019s not a fault for the animation. A-1 Pictures tends to give all their best when it comes to animating anime and Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is no exception. Production values are top-notch and it\u2019s one of the bigger redeeming points of the anime. If you\u2019re not a fan of these types of anime, at least try it out for the animation quality.\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good in this anime, though really nothing special. Ayato is voiced by Tamaru Atsushi and he gets the job done. He\u2019s nothing too special, and he isn\u2019t than well know either. Interestingly, he voice acts another ecchi-harem protagonist this season; Kimito from Shomin Sample. Kakuma Ai voices Julis and she does a decent job with the character. For most of the time, she gives a masculine tone to Julis which is nice to see, and is able to make Julis have a deredere tone is a quick second. Claudia is voice acted by Touyama Nao, who happens to be one of the more well-known seiyuu of the cast, does a really good job making Claudia sensual and lusty. Izawa Shiori does Saya, and she also does a very good job being emotionless (it doesn\u2019t really require much skills, does it?). Ozawa Ari does a great job of being cute adorable for Kirin. Overall it\u2019s a decent job from the cast, even if it\u2019s them following tropes to fill in for their characters. Some characters were teased at the end for the second season, so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll find some characters I really care about.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s opening is pretty good and it built up on me more and more every time I watched it. It\u2019s got some pretty catchy beats, however it\u2019s the type of anime that will be in every other fantasy, school, harem anime. The ending is also really good. Actually, I like it better than the OP. It\u2019s solemn and beautiful. However, it totally doesn\u2019t match the anime much. The background music is okay, nothing too great. The techno beats used during fights are mediocre, nothing that will boost your adrenaline. That is prettt disappointing, considering most of A-1 Pictures anime consists of good OST, especially ones that are similar to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. Not to mention than A-1 Pictures didn\u2019t do the greatest with Subete ga F ni Naru\u2019s OST either.\\n\r\nMusic: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nThe anime is enjoyable at times, but mostly it gets irritating as it feels like as if I\u2019m already seen this before. The clich\u00e9-driven presentation, the story being unfocused at time, and characters being rehashes of what we\u2019ve seen before make me disinterested about this anime. However it\u2019s high production value pull me back in. And even if it\u2019s typical, it\u2019s typical for a reason; because people still find these entertaining. Luckily it was well paced, even with some episodes there just do waste time.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a decent anime that gets to be entertaining enough, even with its rehashed presentation because of its production values and animation quality. However, we only got to see half of what Gakusen Toshi Asterisk has to offer, we\u2019ll get the rest on spring. And hopefully it will be better, more enjoyable and will make this season look like more of a buildup of what it has to offer.\\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic production values \\n\r\n+ Gorgeous art and animations \\n\r\n+ Though clich\u00e9-driven, it\u2019s still somewhat enjoyable due to a cute cast.\\n\r\n+ The OP and ED are great.\\n\r\n- Plot is really nothing special at all, and it doesn\u2019t focus on its main plot at all. \\n\r\n- The characters are very typical and generic, even if they look good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.4/10",

            "content": "Spoiler free review:\r\nOh, I wanna cry! :( The beginning of the anime was so amazing and it looked really promising. BUT, when you find yourself checking your phone and constantly get an overview of how many episodes it is left before the anime ends then there was just one solution.... I just had to drop it. \r\nNow, I didn't really expect anything from this series. In a way, maybe that was a good thing. I think that the sad thing is that the main characters, Ayato and Julis both had good background stories for this anime to become something reaaaally good. Let's also look atthe art style, I gave it a 10 because LOOK AT THE ART STYLE! :O Originally that was what made me watch this anime in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the story progressed from outstanding in the 2 first episodes to just fading away. I watched 8 out of 12 episodes of this and I have to say I didn't really see where the whole series was going at this point. It's a shame it had to be in a harem setting because if there had been some more male characters and they had more duels the potential for this anime story line would have been endless. \\n\\n\r\nI put the second season on my to watch list as well but now that i dropped the first one i really don't think I will enjoy the second one either. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a series you don't have to put your mind into that much and you DON'T have other animes that you have to watch then I would say you could give this anime a try. Otherwise, save yourself the hours of watching this anime and go watch an anime that is more interesting.",

            "content": "I decided to write a review for this show because it's actually rather easy to.\r\nThis might even be the shortest review you will ever need that makes sense.\r\n*Some spoilers ahead*\r\nThis season, two very similar anime came out namely this one and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. While the battle systems may be different, they are in essence almost parallel anime. Both have \"overpowered\" MCs, red headed princess heroines that use fire. Both are in a school setting with a battle tournament going on. Basically when you've seen one, once you see the other you feel like you're watching the same anime. Except they aren't the samein which one outperforms the other, namely Rakudai Kishi is better than Asterisk in every aspect. You might think Rakudai kishi will start off as another harem romance anime, but it's not. There is a clear romance between the two main characters that actually makes it refreshing to see. They fight for the promise they made to each other, and it's a pretty simple yet believable reason to, unlike in Asterisk where typically the guy makes no real love interest and flirts with everyone while being oblivious, albeit choosing to \"fight\" for the red-head princess heroine. No motive, not love, just \"she showed me the reason to fight\" kinda cheesy shit.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main stories of both animes might be generic or even mediocre, it's the subtle differences in their execution that really makes the difference between \"I'm sick of this same old shit\" and \"that was actually quite nice\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk is basically Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, except Asterisk is below mediocre while the latter is better. Watch both if you have the time and like the typical harem/romance/school/overpoweredMC but otherwise watch Rakudai over Asterisk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlain and Simple.\\n\\n",

Future-themed anime with one overpowered main character that is surrounded by multiple girls that vary in boob sizes and the basic \"anime girl\" characters at the most. Of course this piece of work has it's brighter sides. Seems like there is an interesting romantic character development bewteen the two of the main characters which kind of kept me watching until the end of this season. There are two more characters, Saya and Kirin, which I think deserved a bit more attention inthis season. Sometimes it felt like they were being excluded on purpose so the main storyline could develop more but that, in my opinion, didn't really work out as the end, or rather the \"point\" of the end was disappointing in some ways. To be honest I didn't hop into watching this anime with any expectations at all, all I can say is that it definitely could be better. Fair piece of work, strong 6/10 in my case.",

            "content": "The Asterisk War is one of those shows that at first glance seems like every other show but ends up being something special as far as battle harems are considered.\r\nThat's not to say that the show is unique because its not but at the same time its not as generic as its competition either.\r\nIt has just enough to stand out but not enough to be remembered as a masterpiece of the genre.\r\nSort of like when your in school and you get a passing grade but cant be arsed enough to do anything else.\r\nThe series takes place in a relatively advanced world with not only greatadvances in technology but advances in genetic modifications as well.\\n\r\nOne thing i do like is how the genetic modifications are all subtle increases in our natural abilities such as speed and strength.\\n\r\nIts not flashy abilities like throwing fire balls, well some people can do that but not on their own they need special weapons for those kind of abilities.\\n\\n\r\nIn this setting are several schools who train students in ...... well to be honest we don't really know.\\n\r\nsupposedly each school works differently but the purpose of the schools isn't really expanded on aside from it being there for plot purposes.\\n\r\nThese schools however do compete with each other in a series of duels or atleast that's what we are led to believe seeing as how the big tournament the shows builds up isn't exactly a school event but all the schools have a stake in.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell the plot isn't all that thought out and we end up with several unanswered questions but hopefully we will get more explained in the upcoming 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that did stand out a little bit to me was the art-style that seemed reminiscent of the game \"Phantasy Star Universe\" which i wasted a unbelievable amount of hours on in the past so this was a good thing in my eyes.\\n\r\nThe animation is actually alot better than you would think, now its not Ufotable tier animation but still pretty good.\\n\r\nWell aside from a section in the final episode that looked like they were trying to experiment on which i respect trying something new but it did feel unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is probably the best part of this show is the soundtrack and it is certainly one of the better ones of winter 2015.\\n\r\nThe background music does its job perfectly and gets the audience hyped up for the current and upcoming scenes and the opening/ending is probably my favorite part of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters on the other hand are fairly mediocre with a few exceptions.\\n\r\nJust like with the setting the characters arnt really expanded on too much  and seem to be there just to push the story along.\\n\\n\r\nLets start off with the biggest complaint, that would be our protagonist Ayato who alot of people have referred to him as being worst than Kirito in terms of plot convenience.\\n\r\nI however don't really see it that way, i mean yes he is pretty generic and pulls his abilities out of his ass when he is losing however lets take a second and compare him to another battle harem protagonist from the same anime season.\\n\r\nLets compare Ayato to Ikki from Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, both are fairly generic and pull off random abilities when losing but i would like to give Ayato a little bit of credit from where Ikki falls painfully short.\\n\r\nFirst off Ayato has a reason to pull off his abilities when in trouble seeing as how his sister sealed most of his power away when he was a child making it painful for him to draw on it for fairly short periods of time.\\n\r\nIn a tactical sense lets compare it to Ichigo's Vizard mask where he could only maintain it for 30 seconds to gain a slight advantage.\\n\r\nHowever with Ikki he pulls wins out of nowhere from pure determination because of sloppy writing, what i mean is that he should not be winning every single fight when prior to the series starting he had never won a fight in his entire life.\\n\r\nThis is why i preferred Ayato over Ikki because it felt more realistic to have someone draw on hidden power and win than for someone to win because the plot called for it.\\n\r\nThe other thing i prefer about Ayato is he has a goal to try to accomplish where as Ikki just wants to get stronger, and yes i know all characters want to get stronger but Ayato has a reason to get stronger where Ikki on the other hand does not.\\n\r\nIkki just wants to be stronger because that's what the plot calls for not because he has some goal to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast most of it is just a bunch of anime tropes aside from one character in the end which serves to be the polar opposite of Ayato.\\n\r\nWhere Ayato wants to get stronger in order to find and protect his sister while still being a good and honorable person, This character Also wants to protect her sister but is willing to go to any length to do this even if it means hurting people who probably didn't deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is fairly generic but it was still enjoyable to watch each week and was far superior to that other battle harem we were introduced to in the same anime season.\\n\r\nIts not exactly something i would recommend of the top of my head but if i was asked what a good battle harem show would be then this would probably come to mind first......well this or highschool DxD.",

            "content": "Welcome to another review....today it's The Asterisk War which I marathon in a day for another site challenge. To be honest if you like a harem with boobs and a op main character then this is the perfect anime for you guys. Don't get me wrong I actually enjoyed most of it but there are clear problems with story and how it was set out. \r\nSTORY\r\nSo the story, there was quite a few holes by the end of the anime, implying a second season to come but who knows. The main problem for me was they tried to cram so much into this season thatit all seemed too rushed to actually understand half of it. Plus loads of unanswered questions still remain such as who was Ayato's sister really, was she that much of a big deal? or who wins the Festas that was ongoing that the end of the series...urgh now we just hope for another season XD\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThere was honestly not much wrong with the animation but there  were still moments where you though that 'this scene probably could of been drawn slightly better', mainly when it comes to the shots further away however there were scenes that captured this long shot very well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOpening was good and catchy however the ending I didn't feel it lived up to that standard, but it was still good compared to some I have heard and absolutely hated. The voice acting was mostly good, there was some times where I thought, maybe that characters voice doesn't really suit them but that was pretty rare.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAyato, one of the most OP characters ever, come on seriously it doesn't give the other characters a chance when they are up against him, yeah you have this whole limiter thing but still he can still defeat most people quite quickly. Yeah he lost once and nearly lost a second time but still....it's annoying, come up with a more interesting main. (It's Mahouka all over again). Now the female harem that developed...yeah they all have quite typical personalities so I don't want to go into much detail but I just want to say that the character of Irene I loved, she was just so different and her sister may appear as a bland character but still.\\n\\n\r\nBut that ends the review here, hope you enjoyed xx\\n\\n\r\n-AngelBeatsYui-",

            "content": "Having already written a review for this show some time ago that was taken down because I forgot to update my watch status to \"dropped\", I decided to write another one.\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk, or the Little Star Wars if you take the literal translation, is a generic harem romance magic high school shounen battle anime; quite a mouthful, I know, but it'll just get worse from here.\r\nI will try to run through this review and justify my reasons for harboring a high content of sodium chloride in my bloodstream.\r\n1) Story\r\nThe story is as cliched and uninspired as it gets. \r\nOur main character Ayato arrives inAsterisk City (oh look another academy island) to look for clues to his sister... kind of. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, we are told that most of the people in Asterisk City are teenagers with superpowers that attend individual academies, from which said academies will pit their best students against their fellow rivals in some sort of twisted deathmatch tournament for whatever reason.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have superpowered teens and a high school setting in a fantasy scifi setting. I wonder how many times had this premise been used...?\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't delve into any of the world building, instead focusing on the interactions of Ayato between his fellow schoolmates and acquaintances. I find that this is an incredibly lazy way to introduce the viewer to the world of Asterisk and in all honesty, it feels like the story is expressly trying to skirt the effort needed to establish a solid scifi/magic world, going even as far as to completely leave out the basic workings of magic and the \"disaster\" that had caused the aforementioned magic to manifest in some humans.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching through halfway of the show, there was still no sign of the world being established and the rules that supposedly binded the way everything worked were quickly broken seconds after being introduced.\\n\\n\r\n2) Characters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are walking tropes, I'm not kidding. That's how little they even stand to pass as generic characters. It's as if the author just pulled up the TV tropes page and started copying traits that they liked onto the character creation notes.\\n\\n\r\nAyato is the generic cool, strong and flat self-insert protagonist that has a conveniently tragic past that holds ties with the city he is currently inhabiting. He is literally brimming with shounen spirit, from his \"hidden power\" to the fact that his personality is as rich as a drab card of wet cardboard.\\n\\n\r\nSince Ayato is a run-of-the-mill shounen lead, it is natural for him to be surrounded on all sides by hungry hungry women out to get his man meat. The girls that fawn over him are red haired tsundere, big tits blondie, deadpan loli and the shy girl that can never stop blushing and/or stuttering.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Ayato does possess some form of flimsy evidence and motivation for his actions in the pursuit for his missing sister, most of the time his sister is never mentioned until the plot absolutely demands it. For the girls... their character motivations are hard to follow and most of the time they sit there waiting for Ayato to come save them.\\n\\n\r\n3) Art\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show feature a myriad of warm colors and solid animations. Just don't expect the show to live up to the hype it's getting.\\n\\n\r\n4) Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show was decent, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the VAs, they did their job well enough as a team.\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI did not manage to find enjoyment in watching this show. For me, it was a mess of cliches and ideas that were hastily stuck together with duct tape and superglue.\\n\\n\r\n6) Overall\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't want to recommend this to anyone, as the show had very poor writing and had little to no useful information. I would suggest checking out the other shows under this category as they likely have more entertainment value compared to Gakusen. Hell, Gakusen can't even serve as a good time-killer.\\n\\n\r\nBut who am I to tell you what shows to watch? Take this review seriously or with a pinch of salt, I don't really care. Cheers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

He forms an early friendship with a new student who happens to be highly rated, with minor romantic elements. The setting however is interesting and is similar to Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei with a mix of technology powering somewhat magical powers (note that the director is the same as Mahouka - Manobu Ono)\r\nArt - The character design is par for the course for 2015. I did enjoy the few fight scenes.\r\nSound - I think the OP and ED sequencesare done well but the soundtrack doesnt stick in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Enjoyment - after 5 episodes the series is at a crossroads in my mind. For the current season, it is being compared heavily with Rakudai Kishi no Calvary, since both started in similar fashion. However currently Gakusen is falling behind the former in that development is slow and the absence of significant 'hooks' in the story, either comedy, romance or tension is quite noticeable, compared to Rakudai which after episode 3 is really powering on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - I will probably keep going for at least 2 more episodes and will post an update. The story is run of the mill, but the show has good production values and an interesting setting so I'm hoping that they do something with it. Above all, there needs to be some sort of viewer involvement in the story, so I'm hoping they at least advance either romance, more twists or some character development. I'm still hoping they can salvage this series which seemed interesting in the first 2 episodes.",

First of all, I can safely assume this anime carries its inspiration on its sleeve. The MC, Ayato looks like Kirito in second season of Sword Art Online. He even has a same color laser sword or whatever. Though this anime has original concepts in it, its not exactly \"trying\" to be original.\r\nThere is nothing original about the MC or the other characters. Its like any action harem ecchi anime you've seen a thousand times till now. I feel like this was a quick-buck maker forwhoever made this anime so they copied popular anime stuff and called it a day.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good and so is the sound. The story is meh, something something battle stadium let's fighting love! Lol.\\n\\n\r\nIts an anime I wouldn't recommend because there is nothing memorable in it, but its okay for a casual watch as long as you don't expect much.",

            "content": "Only one time during my entire viewing of this, did I ever think to myself 'that is pretty cool'. That was in episode 11.\r\nThere is nothing redeeming about this piece of animation. The story is boring: its a rehash of your average tournament plot with harem elements that fails to make any sense. It attempts intrigue through plots and spying. It only achieves ennui as the show fails to explain its own plot points, or even the basic mechanics of how the magic system works. There is no world building here. I can only imagine that the light novel contains the information necessary to understandthe basics of what happens here.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of understanding of the system gets to be incredibly frustrating whenever there is a fight scene. The stakes of this show are never set. From the first fight scene there is no explanation of the power level. From the first episode, I had no idea what was an important attack, or what could kill, or if the point of all this fighting was to kill. The fireballs Julis slings seemed to do no damage whatsoever in the beginning of the show. However everyone seems to be afraid of these small yellow arrows that are fired from weird wrist gauntlets, to the point where anyone would think those arrows can kill people with one strike. In later scenes we see bullets are able to hurt the genestella, but when we come to the tournament everyone is using energy guns that, despite their seemingly immense power, rarely hurt other genestella. It leads me to question why this is happening. \\n\\n\r\nWe know from the first scene of the first episode that these weapons have the capacity to kill. But the tournaments themselves don't require a contestant to murder an opponent to continue. Are the weapons being modulated, so that they only stun people on contact? We know they aren't, because the protagonist is able to slice through weapons like a lightsaber through warm butter. Was it an accident? Or an actual fight to the death? We never find out. It seems like it would be pretty easy to find out, considering all of these duels between the genestella seem to be televised and incredibly popular, despite being incredibly dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the plot is nonsensical and the more you think about it, the more you are left wondering why you are watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are cliches. I would say only one character has an interesting moment as we learn about her and her weapon. Otherwise the characters make no sense. They were written first to be archetypes and characters much later. Rarely are the characters reasonable. If their actions are supposed to actually make sense in context of the universe, then the show fails to allow the characters to explain, or the explanations fail to justify their actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character himself is honestly the most annoying character there is. He is one of these Genestella, which are this race of supermen that apparently can kill people easily with their hands, and are able to easily survive drops from multi-story buildings. He is probably one of the densest MCs ever. His only redeeming quality is that he is not a jerk. And he is good with his super sword. That's it. I have no clue why he is attractive to any of the women in this show, except maybe the one 13 year old character. She would be, realistically infatuated with him from their interactions. I feel like the only reason this happened however is random chance. Considering how all of the other character motivations are a pit of tangled vipers that make no sense, I would attribute this one realistic interaction to accident rather than any sort of coordinated effort on the writer's part. After all, even a broken clock is right twice a day.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the characters make no sense. Their motivations are secrets that are usually not revealed, and when they are revealed its either in a ham-fisted manner, or the knowledge does not improve my idea of their previous actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright when the show isn't showing anyone fighting. Otherwise the fight scenes look like hell. It is difficult to tell what is going on at best. At worst the animation reinforces the confusion of the overall magic system.  The animation is also pretty inconsistent. For example, there is a scythe weapon in the show that in almost all scenes seemed to change size. One could argue that this is a result of fluctuating magical power, I would argue that its a result of the animation staff messing up the scale. The CG is also pretty mediocre, as it fails to blend well with the rest of the art on display. Overall, there isn't much to see here. Except for skirts sticking to asses.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is alright. It was used appropriately to help guide the emotional subject of the various scenes. The songs are pretty good, and they are nice to listen to outside of the context of the show. The end credit song is pretty good. The sound design itself is awful. The weapons all sound like cheap plastic toys when they are being handled. Also, I think the sound that the swords make while slashing through the air was actually stolen from Star Wars, and then slightly modified to prevent law suit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show bring little to the table. I would honestly question how this anime got made. I would not recommend this show to anyone, except as a way to deconstruct what makes a bad anime. In that regard I think this show would be very educational. Otherwise I had to force myself through the ending of this show. I only did this because I wanted to be able to follow a series of videos put out by a youtuber that I liked.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an enjoyable harem show, I recommend My Bride is a Mermaid. If you are looking for a show similar to this one, please see Strike the Blood(which at least delivers on its hints of fanservice).",

            "content": "(Spoiler-free review I suppose?)\r\nSo usually every season as most people know we always have that one cliche harem anime about a magical high school and becoming strong and boobs and magic, oh joy. Now I'm not saying that all of these animes are bad. For example, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry didn't seem special at first but it did a good job. Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is an example of the opposite. The plot could've been better, the storyline was ehhh, the development was crap, the... okay I'll just show everything I say in each category.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nSince it's ultra cliche and nothing new, I don't have muchto say. For a whole entire season of 12 episodes, it didn't really go anywhere much. Honestly I think it might get somewhere in the second season, with all those mysteries they've presented, but I still have my doubts.\\n\r\nAlso, what I HATE is about how the harem practically takes over the anime and wipes out the point of the story. There should be a balanced ratio between the harem and the actual plot, but there wasn't here. :/\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nArt wouldn't really affect how much I like the anime. The art was good, no problems with it, so that's that. Doesn't suddenly make it a good anime, though, if you were thinking anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe ED was nice, but I really didn't like the OP and the OST really wasn't all that memorable. There wasn't even one that left a mark on my brain as \"great\" or anything, so I wouldn't call their soundtracks that successful. They did establish the moods well enough during the scenes though, so it's not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nAlright so, like I said before, it's a harem (which by the way was done wrong). The main character, Ayato, is a boy who is quite strong and is probably the most bland character I've ever seen in anime. You can totally predict his reactions to things, and he's just so NOT well-thought. Then there are the girls who are part of the harem itself: Julis, Saya, Claudia, & Kirin. Pretty much all of them want Ayato's D, but the annoying part is that right after they meet him, they're already part of the freaking harem. They don't even have any reasons for liking him. I like the kind of harems where the characters' love for the MC slowly develops for a certain reason. This one was just adding random characters for the sake of a harem and ecchi moments because Why not? Not to mention that they don't even give you a choice about who you should ship with the MC, they make it so obvious who's meant to be with him; they just add the other harem characters so we can have more tits in the show. Sometimes that's okay if the other characters are still important, but I wouldn't call the other characters THAT important.\\n\r\nThe female lead, Julis, is also one of those cliche pink-haired tsundere girls that is just put with the role of the female lead and the role of being meant to be with Ayato just because she looked ideal. They really were running out of ideas, so they must've thought, \"Well all these types of animes have the pink-haired tsundere female lead!\"\\n\r\nAlso, I barely saw any character development so all the characters were quite boring. The MC being an overpowered yet empty-headed ding-dong, and all the other girls just taking up random roles for the harem, and all the other side characters somehow contributing for the sake of the number of characters... I can't even say that the characters were horrible; this was the most pathetic crap I've seen in a while, it's like all the way down there. (Not literally *coughs*)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI tried to be patient with this anime, honestly. At first it didn't seem special, but there are a lot of good animes that are based off of light novels so I gave Asterisk several chances to the point I even finished the anime. But I got no satisfaction. Not even ONE part of the anime happened to impress me. There was never enough suspense. I kept waiting, waiting, waiting for it to seem like a good anime for once, but it never happened. I guess you could say the last episode was suspenseful, but it still didn't work enough on me. :/ And really? Making it seem suspenseful only on the last episode? That was way too long of a wait for me, and they didn't even impress me enough by THEN.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nSo yeah, I wouldn't recommend this anime to you unless you have literally nothing to do with your life and have watched all of the good animes in the whole world. Or if you want to join us who don't like this thing. I REALLY hope it ends up being better in the second season (and oh yes, I'm giving the second season a chance, because I'm still trying to be a stubborn and patient anime watcher) but this season was crap whether the second turns out good or not.\\n\\n\r\nOh and also, a list of the cliches that I can think of:\\n\\n\r\n-Overpowered bland male MC\\n\r\n-Harem for the sake of ecchi\\n\r\n-Magic school with magic weapons where you master magic\\n\r\n-Magic school has a competition\\n\r\n-Pink-haired tsundere female lead\\n\r\n-No reason for the girls to like MC... they just do\\n\r\n-loli female childhood friend (part of the harem obviously too)\\n\r\n-the assertive female! (part of the harem as well!)\\n\r\n-the high-pitched tiny cute female! (Oh look another harem character)",

            "content": "Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is one of the shows you really hope would be good especially because how awesome the premise of the show was but after watching about six episodes, you will wonder if the show is ever going to get better, but then you realize the sad fact it\u2019s not and you really question if you will ever get that free time you had back from watching this show. \r\nThe story 3/10\r\nThe story to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is students in six different academies fighting each other in tournaments to see who\u2019s the best in the district is, also the winners can acquire money andbecome famous if they get first place in these tournaments. This sounded awesome to me because I thought it was going to be a competitive show with some amazing fight scenes, but the show didn\u2019t do that at all and went a completely different direction. What the show does focuses on is having the main character Ayato Amagiri save everyone time and time again to add more people to his harem which can get really repetitive and boring, this show also focuses on a lot on clich\u00e9s and you will start to question if you are watching something you seen before in the past. When the show does progress through the story you will feel like at times it doesn\u2019t really know where it wants to go so it tries to add new stuff without explaining where anything comes from, which can get really hard to follow and it sucks because I wanted to know what they were talking about. The show also feels like they rushed a lot of parts dealing with the main story, when they didn\u2019t need to do that because they had two filler episodes that didn\u2019t need to happen. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the worst part of the show because there generic, boring and not very relatable. The main character Ayato is probably the most generic character out of all them, he\u2019s that character that\u2019s way to strong and has nothing to him that makes him interesting as a character. For the other four main characters there\u2019s not much to explain but hear it goes. For the main female lead Julis, she is just one of those characters that gets angry at everything the main character does for no reason. For the second leading female Saya, she is just the character that\u2019s clueless most of the time and makes those repetitive jokes where she wants a bigger chest. The third leading female Kirin, she is the character that\u2019s really shy and gets nervous pretty easily from pretty much anything and for the last female lead Claudia she is the character that\u2019s just there for fan service, there is nothing to her that\u2019s unique. They did offer little things about their past for each character on why they wanted to fight in the tournaments and why they needed the prize money but surprisingly gave us nothing about the characters that was all that interesting or helping the characters grow from that experience and they were also way too short and some characters didn\u2019t have them at all, which was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art 5/10\\n\r\nThe art design on the characters were okay but it felt like they were very generic. The backgrounds were decent, there wasn\u2019t much to complain about. For the fight scenes though I felt like some were decent but then some focus way too much on these huge effects and made the fights feel poorly down which I felt they could have left out by not doing them or just doing them right.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 \\n\r\nThe opening song really didn\u2019t do it for me, it felt like every other opening song to any other show, which isn\u2019t bad but isn\u2019t good either but the ending song to me was really good and was the thing I was looking forward to for each episode. The voice actors to me weren\u2019t the greatest and some of them could be very annoying sometimes well watching the show, but mainly for the supporting cast not the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t enjoy this at all and it\u2019s frustrating because the only thing I enjoyed was the ending song which to me isn\u2019t a good thing, but I guess it could have been worse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nThis show is terrible and it\u2019s not because it\u2019s a harem anime, it\u2019s not good because of the story, the clich\u00e9s and the terrible characters. Stay away from this show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "One of the worst anime that I've ever seen. Even the name of the anime makes no sense. It's called \"The Asterisk War\", But there are no wars whatsoever. Maybe one will appear in season 2 but as far as I'm concerned it should have been called \"The Academy City on the Water\" because that's where its been taken place and there are 'NO' wars. It's terrible series with anime cliches, an annoyingly overpowered main character and forced in fan-service, (BTW, Fan-service is not my cup of tea in general, so that puts more weight into this shit fest of an anime). Even after finishingSeason 1, We are still in the middle of the arc. What kind of series would end a season in the middle of an arc?!  That's like Yu Yu Hakusho finishing season 2 at the fourth round of the dark Tournamnet. Ayato is perhaps the worst main character from any anime that I've ever seen. He's basically the textbook definition of a Gary-Sue, which I can not stand in storytelling. The supporting characters are also just as bad. We've got Julis, The Typical Tsundere chick. Kirin, The overly cute chick. And Claudia, a psychotic sexual predator, who is probably the worst character in this travesty. They even have the nerve to make the most interesting character a robot. I'm not even kidding, the best character in this anime isn't even a living being... What more can I say... My advice is to stay away from this trash. You'd get more experience from watching paint dry.",

Definitely not a masterpiece but it's a fun series to watch. I only wish they had finished it. Oh well, guess I'll just have to find and read the manga. \r\nOverall, the story was fairly interesting and I really enjoyed the battles. I found the music nice to listen to. The artwork was really nice and the colors were really cool to look at but, the CGI was just a bit bland. Reminded a bit of the CGI found in Miria Nikkiand, the previews at the end of each episode were such a bad CGI job that I found myself chuckling a bit every time I watched them. I think that was probably intentional on the part of the animators and I got a laugh out of it so all is well. Didn't really care for the whole harem thing in this particular anime but, that being said, it's not right up in your face like most others are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it's definitely worth a watch if you're looking to kill some time and watch a good bit of action.",

            "content": "The ONLY anime to have surpassed Sword Art Online in terms of clicheness and I get to talk about it. I'm going to be talking about this anime as a whole instead of just the first season, so let's get into it.\r\nHonestly, the writers probably tried to make this anime as cringey and cliche as possible. It's cliche in every way possible. We have boring overpowered harem dude and only main characters that's a guy, Ayato, unoriginal pink haired tsundere, Julis, childhood kuudere loli friend, Saya, big breasted dandere, Kirin, and the massive titted blonde slut, Claudia, her being the cringiest of all. Oh andthere's also a badass girl with a dandere sister(I think a dandere is suppose to be a clumsy girl who likes someone, but i dunno),boring psychopathic villains and a maid with a voice that will feel like you just got shot in the ear with an arrow. Kirito probably did it on Asuna and they gave birth to Ayato. Also the openings and endings also sound sorta cliche, but that second ending is too catchy to pay attention to its cringiness.\\n\\n\r\nSo the plot is that Kirito, I mean Ayato(did that on purpose), enters a tournament to find out what happened to his sister when she entered a different tournament revolving around the same principles of fighting as the one Ayato's going to . He meets up and befriends Julis while also making other lovers like Kirin, Saya, and Claudia. Surprise, only one main character is a boy. The rest is his harem. They all enter the tournament, except for Claudia(cause her big tits will get in the way), and fight to win. There's more background information on the tournament and their way of fighting, but it doesn't concern the plot. As for the ending, well I won't give out any spoilers, but it ends of on a cliffhanger with too many plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nI already talked about the characters in the first paragraph. They are all like reincarnations of SAO characters. Ayato is like Kirito with their overpoweredness(not a word) and always attracting a harem of girls. Julis is like Asuna, duh. I guess Silica is like Kirin and Saya. She's a loli like Saya and is a dandere like Kirin. Ok so maybe only Ayato and Julis are like SAO characters, but just about all the characters in Asterisk War are unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm tired of complaining, so I'll talk about the good part of this anime, the artstyle. Now it looks great, but that's only cause it's new. The characters do seem to have those eyes like in Darker Than Black where the characters have that look of boredness in their eyes. What's better than the art style is the action. They do have a lot of it and it looks spectacular. I really enjoyed watching all those action scenes cause it was intense, fast paced, and clever.\\n\\n\r\nSo that just about sums up what I think about Asterisk War. I know I haven't talked about the voice acting, but I watched it sub, so I don't really know what to say about it. But now since the dub is being made, I think it doubled it's cringiness. I'm not saying that I'm a sub fan, cause I'm not, but it's just that I watched the scene in episode 3 dubbed where Claudia is flirting with Ayato, and it will satisfy your cringe appetite for a month. So if you want to avoid cliche anime, this should be your priority, but if you want an anime to watch that you can talk about with your friends about just how cliche it is, I actually say you should. Seriously, me and my sister loves making fun of this anime for just how cliche it is (especially Claudia). This is like one of those things where it's bad in a good way.\\n\r\nSo that's my review on Asterisk War.",

            "content": "Hey folks, lets talk about Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. First let me say it is a generic harem, if that is a turn off then don't bother. That being said I feel like we can break down the good and bad and give you a more concise review.\r\n    Our story starts off with the introduction of the main love interest(Julis Alexia von Riessfelt) and the the male lead(Ayato Amagiri). The viewer is thrown into a transfer student situation. We start off with Ayato walking to school and what does he do on his way? Well our fine young protagonistpicks up a handkerchief and decides to return it to its owner by jumping up and entering its owners room through their window. Our Tsundere female lead doesn't take kindly to this as she was currently changing at the time. We get to be thrown into this new world quickly by seeing her rage spill out into magical fire and a duel. This is pretty much the start of our story and the basic information needed to begin our anime.\\n\\n\r\n   The story from this point forward picks up speed and somehow manages to cover the entire history of this built city, the existence of different factions, Magic, peculiar weapons and the inner workings of the school and the tournaments all in about 2 episodes. Along with the oddly quick pairing of our two leads Ayato, and Julis. This is way too quick and really is the reason this show is not very good. The term \"Generic\" gets thrown around a lot when it comes to Harems and IMO this isn't very fair. This show however unfortunate fits the \"Generic\" labeling pretty well. They had a few interesting concepts with the whole arena city, magical weapons with varying degrees of power and options..etc however they decided to blow past everything that could have made their show interesting and different.\\n\\n\r\n    The last 6 or so episodes begin to slow down and to try and add drama and suspense which unfortunately felt like a slap in the face because once you had gotten used to the speed you expected it to take you to its destination in a single season. However they decide to lead us through their lackluster story and leave us with a most annoying cliffhanger. Though this anime managed to receive a 6 in score, the story wasn't good enough to make me overly excited for a season two and I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\n   The characters are pretty \"Generic\" as well. This is truly an unfortunate experience. Having a definable characteristic like Tsundere is what I think people mistake for \"Generic\" which of course is incorrect. However this anime again goes to prove the naysayer's correct. The characters have little to no personality, and feel like vessels holding popular characteristic that would grab the attention of those who enjoy them or are new to anime. That being said this again was another chance for the anime to prove its worth. The characters all have goals and dreams and each is obtainable and makes sense. There is no Eren Jaeger here shouting about how he will kill all the Titans as he gets his ass beat. Each character has a selfish, obtainable goal which they hope to obtain through winning these tournaments and getting their wish granted. There were a few frustrating situations with a few characters as they were introduced through a forced drama series of events that didn't feel like it had a purpose other than to add in characters that were not introduced properly earlier.\\n\\n\r\n    I seen a few reviews telling people it was a poorly constructed political battle or regional battle and though the regional battle is technically true this doesn't seem to be about politics at all. It is basically a Twisted Metal like story, groups of people fight each other to win the greatest prize of a single wish granted as long as its obtainable on earth. \\n\\n\r\n    The art and sound were really well done. Art was fairly standard, nothing jumps out as bad or great. The fight scenes were bland which isn't good for an anime like this, though they seemed to try and spice it up at the end.The Music and some of the sound effects were really well done. The only negative thing here was the sound effects for the sword were like light sabers. I'm not mad at this because I like star wars but because it didn't fit the weapons. \\n\\n\r\n    In conclusion this anime isn't great, but it isn't terrible. The second season or the manga might be able to redeem the things this anime did poorly. It doesn't deserve the 1's but a solid 5 or 6 I think is fair game. Watch this if you a fan of Harem's. Though this is pretty low on my harem list.",

The animation is stiff and awkward, with bland character design, bland scenery, bland backgrounds, bland architecture, bland weapons, bland attacks and flat-out horrendous choreography... it's like a manila envelope taped to a white piece of paper. I have nothing to say about the protagonist, as I honestly cannot even remember his name (To be fair, I quit on the series very quickly, but I have seen scenes from later on and am familiar with the overall plot). He looks generic evenby light novel and harem anime standards. He's a blank post-it note on the manila envelope, if even that. The fanservice is also pretty bad, so don't let that be a motivator. If you're looking for an anime with cute girls and swords, there are tons of alternatives that far exceed this show. Please, do not just mindlessly consume this show and settle for its placid and uninspired characters. I highly recommend avoiding this series and spending your time with something more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is alright though. A little on the bland side, but still.

To be fair, the male protagonist does have to be nearly as strong as he is in order for the story to develop and move along. However, all of the main character development points and interactions with members of his harem are predictable to a \"T'\".\r\nThis anime reminded me a lot of Infinite Stratos except here the subplots of the MC's enemies were better done - and there were more of them with their own goals.\r\nFor those that read the light novels, the anime stays pretty true to themand you really don't miss much just watching the show.",

            "content": "A-1 Pictures has been a hit and miss anime productions studio. They have given us gems like Your Lie in April, The Flower We Saw That Day, Space Brothers, Gate Thus the JSDF Fought There!, Ao No Exorcist and arguably SAO. But they have also given us duds like  Denpa Kyoushi, SAO II, Occult Academy, Fractale, Uta no Prince Sama and sadly Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. While the list of A-1 anime is varied, the one thing that you can generally expect from an A-1 Pictures anime is good towards excellent art and animation. However every season the question you always have to ask isif the premise, plot and characters live up to that same standard. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nLet me first start of by addressing a certain problem I hope does not become a trend in anime. Before going into this anime it is important to note that there is a second season due out in April 2016. In this same season we got the second season of the harem series Shinmai Maou no Testament. The first season ended at this boss fight and the main crux of the story was never resolved. I haven\u2019t watched the second season but I\u2019ll assume it gets closer to having a real ending. In the past there have been harem anime with sequels. I\u2019m thinking of Highschool DxD, Zero no Tsukaima, Rosario no Vampire, Heaven\u2019s Lost Property, The World God Only Knows, Sekirei, Date A Live. Say what you will about these anime but the one thing I personally can say about them is that I feel as though they can stand on their own without needing a sequel. \\n\r\nUnfortunately Asterisk feels like a 3 legged chair, incomplete and uncomfortably so. From the premise I was under the impression that this would be a tournament style anime. There is a tournament called The Phoenix Festa but that only begins on episode 9 out of 12. Therefore I assume season 2 will be all about this tournament and mostly all of season 1 was really just set up for it. There are 4 girls in the harem so really the first 8 episodes was just about getting to know the girls as well as learning more about the protagonist. There were also the standard harem cliches which felt like a checklist of things that had to be in there. I do wonder if it would have been smarter for the tournament to begin earlier and we could have somehow learned more about the girls as the tournament went on. I get that the purpose was so that we would feel more for the characters when the tournament began, but to be honest the matches in season 1 are only the preliminary rounds so I felt no sense of danger for any of the characters. In comparison to Maou no Testament the last episode didn\u2019t even feel like a boss battle, it felt like a normal episode. So what we are left with is a action anime season where the audience feels nothing because there is no sense of stakes and there has so far been no real sense of danger to the characters. It really does feel as though season 2 should have been part of season 1. I really hope harem anime splitting into 2 seasons and having the 2nd season released 6 months later doesn\u2019t become a trend. If Shakespeare can write plays without a needed intermission I\u2019m sure a tournament style harem doesn\u2019t need one either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nYou got the main tsundere girl who's a princess, the shy/timid girl, the flat chested stoic girl and the voluptuous older blonde president. So yes everyone is a trope and to be honest I wasn\u2019t interested in anyone except the blond president Claudia who is obviously not the main girl. To me good characters have to be more than one note, they can\u2019t be 2 dimensional characters (pun intended). Yes every girl has this spontaneous and unexplained love for the protagonist but with Claudia there were these moments where you can just tell that there is more than meets the eye. That this girl is suffering and her cheerfulness is just a facade to hide the darkness inside her. Perhaps her interest in the protagonist is more out of a need to have someone to confide in. The problem is that season 1 didn\u2019t really explain any of it but just gave hints about it. I might watch season 2 just to learn more about her. The female main love interest seems honorable and noble (again pun intended because she\u2019s princess), but in no way is she interesting but simply transparent. In many ways she is Claudia\u2019s foil, where the main girl is usually on screen while Claudia rarely is. Finally about the male protagonist, I get that some people find him annoying and say he\u2019s the typical harem lead. However i would say that a typical harem lead is oblivious, that is something I wouldn\u2019t say of this protagonist. You can tell by the subtle ways the protagonist interacts with the girls that he thinks of some as love interests but others as friends or the little sister type. Also he isn\u2019t dumb either, in battle he is shown to be quite strategic and level headed. He isn\u2019t overpowered due to a concept known as a \u201climiter\u201d (which hasn\u2019t been fully explained) where his power is restricted. Therefore I would say he is a decent towards good harem protagonist. The only issue I have so far is that as with many other harem protagonists, he as person is not very interesting and always does the right thing. In many ways both the male and female leads of the show are similar in a most uninteresting way. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the one reason to watch the show. Just watch the opening and listen to the ending of the show to get an idea on the art, sound and animation. Everything is just so bright and vibrant, crisp and clean. The score of this anime is very fitting for whatever scene it is in. It uses subtle sound effects in certain places to enhances certain sensations which affects how you feel and interpret a scene. You have minor arpeggio scales on the piano for mystery or suspense, upbeat synth tracks that fit the setting of this high tech world, a snazzy jazz track for some humour. In fact it is rare to have empty spaces where there is no background music in a scene. I feel like it\u2019s important to talk about the battles in this anime. They are by no means the best I\u2019ve ever seen in terms of strategy but they sure are impressive to look at. In a battle there is not just one battle theme, the anime uses different tracks depending on the situation in battle. In battle there were some tracks that sounded like they were from final fantasy, but my favorites were the ones that used synths and techno beats. In terms of visuals, the action flows effortlessly with no drops in frame rate. I was particularly impressed by the use of lighting which made certain sequences seem to glow in surrounding darkness affecting the tone of battle. With the change in lighting they even made sure to effectively include shadow in battle. A scene that comes to mind was when a character is about to meet their end and you see their shadow against the ground representing their doom. There is so much detail, you see sparks, light particles change in air dynamics. I find it amazing that they were able to put so much detail in battle without sacrificing the overall look of the rest of the show. Lastly I want to talk about the weapons in the show. By the end of the series you realize that the weapons themselves are characters in their own right. The weapons are representative of it\u2019s wielder. There is particular care and thought placed into the weapons from their design, colour, sound effects, even the angle at which they are drawn in. Early on I found the scene when the protagonist first obtains his weapon to be downright scary. The vibrating sounds the weapon made were menacing and dangerous like hearing an electric saw inches away from your head. You begin the realize that the weapons themselves seem to harbour certain feelings, they can be joyous or noble, but others can be malice or evil. I commend the anime for using the art and animation to enhance the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall 5/10 (Note I deducted a 0.5 due to the lacklustre ending)\\n\\n\r\nFour episodes into the anime I gave it a 6.5/10. In my impressions I wrote \\n\r\n\u201cIn recent years similar shows to this series are decent and fine at best but this series could actually be good. I wonder if this concept has been rehashed to such a degree that the imperfections have diminished. Analogous to a chemist purifying or concentrating a certain solution. Perhaps so, perhaps not.\u201d \\n\r\nLooking back I\u2019m not sure why I was so optimistic, perhaps I was blinded by the gorgeous visuals and didn\u2019t put enough weight onto the characters. I was enamored by the setting and wanted to learn more about the high tech society. However by the ending of this season I have not really learned anything new about the world itself. Infact I have more questions now then I did at the start. That is the frustrating thing about this anime, there was opportunity to be better than it is. However the story is told in such an uninteresting way with mostly bland characters. I continuously have to ask and remind myself what the stakes of this anime were. Sure characters have their own motives for winning the tournament, purpose, money, reputation, discovery. The problem is that many of these motives/stakes are glossed over and we are never reminded of the stakes until the very end. The anime fails to follow up on the motives and fails to explain why these motives exist which limits the world building of the show. This makes the anime less engaging. The lack of interesting characters hurts the harem aspect of the show and the lack of emphasis on the stakes hurts the storytelling. So what you are left with is mindless action. However the tournament doesn\u2019t begin until episode 9. So for 8 episodes you have an anime that doesn\u2019t really excel at anything save for the few action sequences and some moe/kawaii scenes if that\u2019s what interests you. This is what I call popcorn anime, anime that is pretty to look at but serves little to no other function. If you are a fan of harems you may be able to get over the tropes and may even fall in love with some of the girls. Personally I\u2019m one of these fans, I come home from school and just want to mindlessly watch something that\u2019s cute, sometimes funny, and pretty to look at while I eat dinner. But for non harem fans, it is a waste of time, equivalent to staring at dynamic/animated wallpaper for a few hours. But hey, at least it\u2019s not static wallpaper.",

            "content": "Compared to others...MANY OTHERS i should add, i went into this anime blind. this was the first anime i watched to learn about seasonal anime. before hand i only knew the major or classics ex.(naruto, bleach, one piece, rurouni kenshin, etc.) after i finished it i watched a guy called digibro on youtube rant on this show. And many of the stuff he said was right. but i felt like he really over did it. but once this vid came up everyone started rampaging on this anime. So, here we are 3 years later, does it deserve all the hate its received? well lets lookat it.\\n\\n\r\n the story is....uhh...well it sucks. But it IS trying to get your attention. and at CERTAIN points it does that. Not very often, but it does occasionaly, the story felt to me a little rushed and was very predictable. it is a story and the fact that it can be intersting somewhat gives it a 4.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if there is one thing i absolutley loved about this anime, it is the next two categories.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off the art is AMAZING! i loved the designs and art of many of the buildings, character designs, weapons, animation, and effects. many of them were beautiful and made my jaw drop a few times. the animation is smooth and fluid, the art is crisp, clear and exciting, the fight scenes were beautiful, and some well executed (some better than others) i guess i should not be suprised on that note since A1 did the art and adaptaion of the light novel. still, for an anime, it's pretty awesome!\\n\\n\r\nSound wise i'm just gonna say it. GODDAMN EPIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TECHY AND JUST AAAAHHHHHHH all at the same time. I'm a musician, a drummer, saxophonist, flutist and bassist. i know good music and sound when i hear it. And the opening and ending of this anime represent that better than anything else. the sound effects are also very nice IMO. these are definitly the shows strong points. what isn't however, is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are some of the cheesiest, boring, and cliche around. i mean, i can't even describe some oof the characters some of em are just awful! look, you have Ayato(overpowered main), Julis(the most bland tsundere on earth) Kirin( loli but i actually kinda like her charecter) and many other non notable ones. the ones who ARE interesting hardly get any screen time and its a bismal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall do i think the show deserves all the hate? all the anger it has received?\\n\\n\r\nNO ABSOLUTLEY NOT!\\n\\n\r\nyes alot of the arguments are valid, and they all have a reason, but i feel like it was handled too much. the show has it's flaws and there are plenty, but it does have it's ups. the art is beautiful, the sound is superb, the story heck isnt bad in a weird way. if you are one who hates the story, you probably got confused from it. so what did you hate?\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT PROGRESSION\\n\\n\r\nyes the story was mangled and screwed from how the story progressed if they had changed certain aspects or lines in the story...it may have not been that bad. the series has potential it truly does. if it was just slightly edited or saved certain parts for the story later, it would be easier to follow.\\n\\n\r\noverall i liked the asterisk war. yes it was cliche ( very cliche) but it doesnt mean it is immidiatley the worst one in exsistance. of course it aint perfect or not for everyone. every anime is like that. there are others far worse than this show. (eromanga sensei, umaru chan, highschool dxd season 4, any hentai with a plot) i hated how this show was turned to a \"harem\" but i don't see a harem here. i see a promising anime with tons of potential that was not handled correctly and it paid for it and then received too much hate a show could handle. many of the issues in season 1 get fixed next season and i'll review that one too.\\n\\n\r\nbut in short the asterisk war is an underrated missused anime that suffered from A1's greed. the story progression was handled in the wrong way and made many confused, but the art and sound of the show with it's combined potential made something rather nice to watch if i was bored. and thats the anime it is for me. i only wish people would stop treating it like it's the absolute worst anime when there others IMO out there. it just needs to find it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is the very first harem anime I've ever watched. This was my introduction to the \"generic\" harem tropes and what not. Because of this, I enjoyed the show when I watched it, and I even watched the second season, which I enjoyed even more because of the somewhat decent world building. Looking back at the show, I know it's bad. I know why it's bad, and I know why people don't really like it or even hate it.\r\nStory and Characters\r\nThe story and characters are quite generic. The story is ok, doing some things that I found to be innovative. The second season did muchbetter as far as the story goes, and the Pheonix Festa was fun to watch. The characters were the generic as hell. After seeing about two or three more anime with these tropes, I got sick of them. I would much rather see these tropes in the characters I first experienced them in.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, Sound, and Tone\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was nothing special. It was good, the special effects were great, but nothing stood out. It has that generic A-1 Pictures style. This said, the color palette perfectly matched the tone of the anime, and said tone was the strongest aspect of this show, in fact, I liked it quite a lot. The music was excellent. It did its job brilliantly and added to that aforementioned tone. If not for this tone, I would have dropped my overall score to 3 or 4. \\n\\n\r\nOpening and Ending\\n\\n\r\nWhile the opening did a good job introducing you to the world and tone, however, it was rather forgettable. The ending, on the other hand, is one of the best endings I have ever heard. The way that the end of an episode seamlessly flowed along into the ending really led to some memorable moments, even if said moments did not have any reason to be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nI have not read the light novel, but if the story and characters of the anime are faithful to its source material. Then the biggest problem lies here. As an adaptation, A-1 Pictures did a pretty good job. All the elements that could have only been done in an anime were done quite well, and as an adaptation, I would give this show an easy 8.

Its a typical harem anime, but the story is a little different from most so its not extraordinary or poor, just plain typical. I went back and forth between fair and good for this show but went with good and I'll explain. It doesn't really have to much fan service and focuses on telling a story, and the story is actually pretty good and they do a good job of moving it along forward with good timing. Its not choppy or slow or moves away from the plot and the character progressionis pretty good too. Battle scenes are okay and there is sub plots a plenty, I liked it and thought they did a good job of balance and recommend anyone who is on the fence, just go ahead and watch it.",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve ever read one of my reviews of an A-1 Pictures show, you know I\u2019m not \u201ca huge fan\u201d. Considering their track record of anime such as, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, I honestly wasn't expecting much from this, especially since this is a light novel adaptation. A-1 is known for their light novel adaptations, it\u2019s pretty much their brand, and they\u2019re good at making them. Good at making them popular, I mean. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like Your Lie in April, Doukyuusei and The Seven Deadly Sins, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. The fact thatI saw \u201cA-1 Pictures\u201d, \u201clight novel adaptation\u201d, and the dreaded \u201charem, ecchi, romance\u201d tag combo right next to each other, immediately rubbed me the wrong way. So naturally, I wasn\u2019t expecting much from this. However, the disappointment I felt while watching this show slowly unfold was unprecedented.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very basic. A futuristic, dystopian city where people have superpowers and your strength dictates your social status (So, basically capitalism, but with superpowers and swords?). The story mainly takes place in Seidoukan Academy, a school for Gestellas (people with superpowers) where they learn to control their powers and duel against other students in Vestas. There was some sort of war or virus or war or something among those lines which changed humans to obtain those superpowers, but rest assured you'll never hear of this \"Invertia\" be mentioned by any of the characters (remind you, I literally had to look that up, because I couldn't remember the name of this huge \"plot point\" which everyone seemed to ignore). It was pretty obvious from the start that this whole set-up was made purely so the characters had a reason to fight, but at least the reasoning exist. Is it coherent or does it make any sense? No, not at all. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I get on with the review, am I the only one who noticed all these weird names for really basic things? \"Vestas\" are just battles, \"Invertia\" is just a futuristic sounding name for a virus and \"Gestellas\" is just a weird sounding name for people with superpowers (and it makes me think of a dessert, I don't know why though). Maybe this is some kind of cultural thing. Considering the writer\u2019s Japanese, maybe he thought putting in English names would make them sound \u201ccooler\u201d and \u201cedgier\u201d. I honestly have no clue.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is bad. It's way too fast and all over the place. Couple that with the mess that is the horribly written exposition that takes place in the first episode, the copious amounts of unnecessary fanservice and the mind-boggling decisions and actions the characters perform, make even the very first episode of this anime seem badly directed, and overall, just badly written.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much it for the story. Right off the bat, let me reiterate something; the story is obviously not the focus and that\u2019s fine. If the focus is laid on creating and developing the characters, or on making a visual masterpiece, than the story doesn\u2019t matter. If the priority from \u201cstory\u201d is lowered, I expect more out of the \u201cvisual\u201d, \u201caudio\u201d, or \u201ccharacter\u201d department. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all just stereotypical harem tropes. The tsundere, Julis. The big-boobed sisterly girl, Claudia. The monotone, robot-esque girl, Saya. The loli, Kirin. Not much to say about them, but I definitely have something to say about the main character, Ayato. Four words. Horribly written power fantasy. It\u2019s practically an understatement to call him \u201ca badly written character\u201d. He has not a speck of personality to differentiate him from any other kind of main character, and his plain, featureless look doesn\u2019t help him in the slightest. It's only natural that the MC of a harem anime would be an otaku power fantasy, but this is taken to a whole new level of extreme. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, he takes down one of the highest ranked fighters of the school and makes it seem like child's play. It's just ridiculous and seems highly unlikely, since he JUST transferred to that school. Besides, there\u2019s not even a reason to why he won. He didn\u2019t outsmart her, she exactly didn\u2019t underestimate him (which he could\u2019ve taken advantage of), he didn\u2019t have some kind of \u201ctrump card\u201d, or anything. He\u2019s just strong. Period.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, he \"tames\" one of the strongest swords that is known to mankind in a few seconds without even breaking a sweat. Both of these events add up to give no weight to the fights at all, because you know he's going to win either way, I mean, he becomes the number one strongest fighter of the school within a week. Seriously. The writer obviously tries to give Ayato\u2019s harem squad some personality, but they all lacked depth. They weren\u2019t interesting characters, they were pretty faces who were there to swoon over Ayato AKA the viewer. Then again, it\u2019s a harem. I wasn\u2019t expecting stellar writing in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty solid, but this is all thrown out the window when you look at the horrible fight direction. Not only is it really boring, it makes no sense. A-1 Pictures, however, tried to cover this up by making it faster, so no one would notice. The sound design is nothing to write home about either. The background music isn't bad, but it isn't something I would listen to the music outside of the show. The weird laser beam swords sound exactly like light sabers (although that is kind of a given) and the designs look so bulky and awkward, I can't imagine someone actually fighting with them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, I really can't say that I liked the show. It's fun to rag on, but I wouldn't watch it normally. It\u2019s just not a show for me. As I said before, the story is pretty bland, the characters are (for the most part) unlikable and the fight direction is incomprehensible. The animation and sound design doesn\u2019t save the anime from a bad score, considering it\u2019s all pretty basic or, for a lack of a better word, \u201cokay\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, and I can\u2019t really sugarcoat this, the anime\u2019s bad. If Gakusen Toshi Asterisk still sounds interesting to you despite my very negative review about it, I\u2019d say the first few episodes. If the first episode doesn\u2019t already turn you off (there\u2019s a sex joke in there somewhere), then I\u2019d say this is the show for you. \\n",

            "content": "The Asterisk War was a bit disappointing. It's not that this anime was terrible so much as it was unmemorable. Even though I only finished watching it about a week ago, I can't remember the names of any of the characters; what they were like, what they wanted to accomplish, or why they were even in this anime to begin with. I think the biggest problem for me was that another anime had come out with almost the exact same theme - magical high school - but the other anime was better, which made my enjoyment of this anime wan.\r\nThe anime starts off stereotypically enough:New boy comes on campus, a napkin flies from a window, boy finds napkin and uses magic to fly up to the window, where he discovers the half-naked tsundere love interest in the process of changing. The beginning of this anime is so similar to Chivalry of a Failed Knight that I'm astonished they were made at the same time. However, where Chivalry distinguishes itself within the first episode, Asterisk pulls a cliche. Yes, the main character decides to do the Blush & Stutter (patent pending), then the half-naked tsundere decides to do the tsun act. From the moment this anime began to the moment it ended, I could predict everything that would happen with at least 75% accuracy. The only reason my accuracy wasn't 100% was because several side characters were introduced, and even then, most of the side characters were completely predictable after their introduction.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, all of the harem members - sorry, I mean, all of the female characters - are so static and boring that I couldn't root for any of them. There was only one character that I liked, and she wasn't introduced until the halfway point. I could pretty much pick out which trope these characters were, too. It's not like the director did anything to distinguish characters in this anime from every other anime of this genre. You've got the tsundere love interest, the kuudere loli who happens to be the harem protagonist's best friend, the himedere, and the flirty blond with hair drills. This is pretty much how I remember these characters, not by their names, but by their tropes. And while I don't normally compare anime in my reviews, I really have to. Compared to Chivalry, where I can remember the names of all the main characters, Asterisk's characters are completely flat and uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFollowing what starts off as a typical high school magical harem, we're given more cliche's in the form of an overpowered main character whose power has been sealed so he doesn't seem so overpowered. Supposedly, his sister sealed his power for... reasons. I don't know what those reasons are, as they are never explained in the anime, but I'm guessing they're plot reasons. His sister must have realized that having an overpowered main character would make for an uninteresting story, and so she decided to seal his powers away. What's his face main protagonist can only use his powers for five minutes before he falls unconscious, which happens to be another overpowered character cliche. Yes, I'm being serious. Every overpowered character falls unconscious at the end of every battle so they don't seem as overpowered, like having them fall unconscious afterwards makes the battle seem like it was oh-so-difficult. It's a standard cliche that's done to death in anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while there was a lot that disappointed me in this anime, there are some things that I did like. First, the artwork is very colorful and clean. In terms of art style, I think this is fairly top notch. The animation is also smooth. I never saw any real problems aside from the special effects used for spells. Those seemed a bit out of place, and I could tell they were CG, but I can forgive that. Also, while I think the battles in Chivalry were way better, I don't have any complaints about the fight scenes here. With how fluid the animation was, the sword fights in Asterisk were great fun to watch. It was actually the art and animation that kept me watching this. All that being said, this anime wasn't terrible. I think if it had come out before Chivalry of a Failed Knight did, I would have enjoyed it for what it was. Anyone who's into this genre will certainly enjoy watching it, and I hope that anyone who watches it finds it entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.5/10\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 3/10",

And I mean very horribly, this show is an insult to even those stories who have almost no plot to work with.\nHere, we are introduced to our main protagonist,Ayayto Amagiri, a boy whose mysticle powers are chained, meaning he has a (limited) usage of them, while others can use their own powers freely. He meets a girl named Julis, a violent tsundere whose past I cannot make sense of.\\n\nOf course, during their first meeting, he witnesses her changing and gets slapped (classic).

But if you like it...good for you.\r\nStory: 1\r\n(Sorta spoilers...? I don't know when I cross the line, so just a warning.)\r\nI gave it a '1' because it was very disappointing. I thought that perhaps if A1 took time to flesh out concepts and arcs the story might shine out of all of their shows and get a 6. For example, the holograms are a good idea but the consistency is not there. With consistency and and fleshing outthe concept, I would really get into this world and understand it a lot better. People are holding it AND controlling it with their mine. Wouldn't your hands pass through the hologram? I don't get it at all.\\n\\n\r\nAny foreshadowing in wordplay or symbolism is horrible. When Julis is sewing Ayato's jacket, she talks about coming to the academy for money to put into the orphanage where she (sorta) grew up and where her best friends grew up. The camera then zooms into a photo of the kids at the orphanage including Julis. \\n\\n\r\nWe automatically know a character is going to be important. Why?\\n\\n\r\nThe girl next to Julis has white hair, (everyone else has brown/black/dull purple hair), is the only one right up next to Julis, is grinning with Julis, and besides Julis has the biggest grin.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does it matter? She doesn't matter until LATE into the second season.  \\n\\n\r\nSo no consistency, generic plot, (which I didn't have to point out) horrible foreshadowing, and everything else (that is wrong with the plot) every reviewer has pointed out on every website from MAL to Youtube to Reddit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 4\\n\r\nThere is one pro before I jump into the cons. I love the color theory, which is the incorporation of colors that seem to go together. Julis's eyes and hair color contrast each other and a good shot of her face in the first episode shows that well! Also the ending theme kinda shows color theory in some shots.\\n\\n\r\nBut the animation is average most of the time to horrible in some shots. So I don't have much to say about. Lots of things feel unnatural, like Julis's hair looking completely still and dry due to hair spray...I guess, and Ayato's jumping animation is really, really choppy.\\n\\n\r\nFlashing lights and directing is fucking horrible and ruins what could've been okay fight scenes. Props to you A1.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI can barely ever hear music when I'm focusing on the stupidity of the plot and trying to put it together in my mind with no avail. Shit.\\n\\n\r\nI bet it's even more lack luster than the anime its self. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, A1 just wasted (the critically acclaimed) Rasmus Faber's time. The ending and opening isn't bad though but should've been used in a different, better sci-fi/cyberpunk not high school/romance/harem/ecchi anime.\\n\r\nYet it was great music and if the soundtrack had a better anime to work with I bet the music would've been EPIC!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nBeing my first review, I think that the rating system is a bit flawed but I shouldn't talk about this in my review, to me characters are apart of the plot but I'm going to talk at all about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHalf these characters are shit and worthless stereotypes. I wanted a yandere character to murder all the bitches in the anime then murder Ayato cause she realized he was an asshole.\\n\\n\r\nAyato is constructed horribly and is a fusion of all harem MCs and all light novel MCs (except Koyomi Araragi, he's cool) and becomes a Frankenstein I don't wanna read about. \\n\\n\r\nLets go through the bitches' 2% real personality and 98% stereotype/bad archetype characters! Yay!

So i gave it a 5 cause i laughed at myself for wasting my time and laughed at its dumb characters and almost meta-like story. Which it should've been but it wants you to take it seriously.\\n\r\nWhat, why? Meta-commentary about anime like this is genius and \"The Asterisk War\" has the perfect characters for it.

            "content": "Honestly, I was blown away by this show. After reading reviews describing it as derivative and generic, I had very low expectations and almost didn't watch it at all, but when I decided to give it a try I found it actually managed to achieve being pretty enjoyable in spite of its excessive and oblivious use of sad tired tropes.\r\nFirst things first, in many ways at its heart this show is nothing more than a very very poor imitation of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, although I'm unclear on which actually came first. Everything from the setting and drive, to a large portion of the cast,right down to the opening scene are virtually indistinguishable (although in this there's somewhat less colour both literally and metaphorically). Where they deviate drastically, however, is in the fact that Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is self-aware of its own positioning within the genre and uses that to both poignant and comedic effect, while Gakusen Toshi Asterisk takes itself seriously even in its most pitifully uninspired moments. This is not a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, despite this show's depressing lack of self-awareness, judged on its own merits it manages to rise up and deliver an experience that is actually not half bad. The story is uninspired but well executed, and the pacing is spot on, but both are really just padding for the action scenes which absolutely do not disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is a harem, it quickly dodges those shackles by establishing a primary romance that is solid and secure and enjoyable to watch, relegating the other women surrounding the main male to the status of thankfully uninvolved side characters: the main male doesn't explicitly make a choice, sadly, but over the short duration of the story that's pretty forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, artwork, music, and voice acting are all at the lower end of utterly average. However, despite their lack of distinguishing features, several of the characters are still pretty enjoyable to watch, and it is easy to be drawn in to their struggles and achievements. Though it is established early and often that the main characters are utterly overpowered, the threats they face still manage to be exciting, and that is quite an achievement.",

It's an OK one of those, so if you like them give it a watch.\r\nStory -  5\r\n------------------------------\r\nBasically, it boils down to - boy enters a school of magic fighting people, boy fights someone on his first day and doesn't lose. Everyone is slightly impressed, is forced into friendship with person he fought. Then a few more people come into the show, vying for strong boys attention. Meanwhile secret forces are at play, and know about strong boy. WOAH, surprise boy is most powerful, but at what cost... - That's theidea, scream if you've heard it before.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nNot much to say really, its as you'd expect from shows these days. Clean lines, nice colours, and plenty of frames.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 \\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nNow the sound, I actually quite liked. Both the OP and ED are good songs, and fit the feel of the show well. So good job anime show.\\n\r\nThe sound throughout the actual show, is nice too. Plenty of noise going on, good music triggers and nice voice acting. \\n\r\nYeah, not bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nWell, these characters - oh man. They're the same ones you've seen a thousand times. \\n\r\nTsundere - Check\\n\r\nLoli - Check\\n\r\nOppai Loli - Check\\n\r\nPervert Girl - Check\\n\r\nMan Man - Check\\n\r\nShy Man - Check\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nI liked it, at least enough to watch it week to week. So that's better than a lot of shows.\\n\r\nSo if you're like me you'll probably like it like me. (Good sentence.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nIn summary, this show is not bad, not great... but not bad. Watch it if you like these kind of things, and if you don't like them, don't - it's not gonna change your mind.\\n\\n\r\nBaiBaiBai \u30fe(^_^)\\n",

            "content": "The Asterisk War is not an online battle over who can use the most expletives in a sentence, but rather a series of battles fought on Asterisk Island, where the victor can claim virtually anything they want as a prize. Here we find our protagonist, Ayato, a purple-haired Genestellar, empowered by some sort of magical rip-off of Charlotte who is looking for purpose in his life after his doting sister vanishes from the island. Here, he soon meets a princess, much like that in Chivalry of a Failed Knight, and is soon subject to having to pay his life for accidentally walking in on hergetting dressed, much like Chivalry as well as Testament.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one season where deja vu is the norm in the action-based harem genre. Asterisk is ridiculously close in plot progression to what I'll call its sister show Chivalry. As I'm too lazy to list out the enormous list of similarities, I'll try to instead point out the few differences as we go through the paces of the review. Overall, as mentioned elsewhere, though the harems of the season are a little too similar for comfort, each is pretty good in its own right and above average in general. That said, this particular is rather weak in the romantic aspect so if that's what you want in your harems, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nWhereas Chivalry attempts a unique style and flair, Asterisk utilizes a clean and futuristic setting. The entire show is bathed in light blues, pinks, and purples - nothing stands out as overly-harsh or saturated. Likewise, there is a futuristic feel to everything as holographics pop up everywhere and weapons materialize as lightsaber-like instruments. Backgrounds are often blurred, but when they're not they show a super-modern city complete with lots of greenery and cobble-stoned streets. The characters are pretty good, I'd say even one step up from Chivalry in terms of style and facial animation. The show gets extra props from me as well for making the student uniforms match the feel of the city and for actually drawing robots rather than relying on ugly CGI; though it's not entirely free of CGI and some of it is really terrible early on when animating unimportant students. The show also uses visual-novel style episode previews, which is rather unique.\\n\\n\r\nThere is plenty of fighting in this show, and like Chivalry, you'll see a good mix of close ranged melee as well as ranged magic spamming. Effects are nicely done and attacks are varied and well choreographed. Expect a bit of blood though nothing as serious as either Chivalry or Testament. As for ecchi, this is by far the lightest of the genre. There are scenes of accidental exposure but otherwise it's all rather innocent. You won't even get too much in the kissing department relative to other shows in the season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is quite good and appropriate for the setting. The show opens with an energetic, electric-infused OP and ends with a mesmerizing and melodic piece by Maaya Sakamoto who unfortunately doesn't have a voice role. The show often uses a theatric-style fade in to the ED, which readers of my reviews know is a major weakness of mine. The BGM honestly could be better in terms of theme, but does have a few electronic-infused pieces that fit the bill, some of which are pretty recognizable after a few episodes. Expect a lot of sound effects to go with all the technology in the show, though I do believe the lightsaber sounds are a bit over the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice talent is pretty strong here with Ai Kakuma voicing the lead heroine, a bit more personality compared to her role in Amagi Brilliant Park. Ari Ozawa is still growing in terms of experience but her voice is a great fit for Kirin's shy personality. Nao Touyama is probably the most famous of the VAs here though at least for this season she's more of a tease character; she demonstrates great range here, a strong departure from her voice as Chitoge in Nisekoi. I do find it funny that she also voices a main role in Chivalry concurrently and wonder if she noticed the plot similarity. Last but not least, Chinatsu Akasaki plays a minor role but as a very playful character, and her interpretation definitely elevates the character above what one would expect. Overall, expect a strong sound presentation from this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhereas Chivalry has an almost desperate air with the protagonist at risk of being kicked out at any moment, the pacing in Asterisk is a lot less tense. There's ample room for comedic moments as well as very light romantic tension. I do feel that the exposition of the setting is a tad weak compared to the other harems of the season, not much is explained about the Strike The Blood-like island and only hints are given about why the world now revolves around a bunch of teenagers fighting each other in some tournament.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the story is divided roughly into three arcs where Ayato encounters a different adversary. First up is our tsundere princess, who doesn't lose outright to Ayato unlike in Chivalry. The second arc revolves around the school's number one fighter, Kirin- who happens to still be thirteen despite her ridiculous proportions. The last arc is the actual tournament and focuses on the vampire scythe user Urzaiz. Mixed in with all of this are pieces surrounding Ayato's blue-haired childhood friend Yuki Nonaka er... Saya Sasamiya. Each arc has its own rising action and climax and some even have semi-filler episodes to cool off (see the ones titled \"A Holiday for Two\"). The final arc's tournament climax is a bit too similar to that in Chivalry for my taste; to further the parallel, both shows also don't actually finish the tournament. In this case, the show heaps anticipation about the next season with all parties hinting on how to expect great surprises.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Chivalry, I think this story played it rather safe. There isn't as much tension with the characters and relationships are pretty bare minimum. The show differentiates itself by building on the technological aspect despite not actually explaining how anything works. Nonetheless, it is still an interesting show in its own right with lots of engaging battles and a few good laughs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is probably where this show differs the most from Chivalry. Whereas Chivalry had a great primary herione and junk supporting characters, this show has an average protagonist pair with some outstanding additional supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with our protagonist, Ayato. Unlike Ikki in Chivalry, he is gifted with unfathomable power at the onset and is only restricted by some unexplained curse cast by his sister. He is by far the weakest of the harem protagonists in the season, I mean come on he can't even properly turn down the multiple approaches by the student council president. Our princess Riessfeld doesn't fare much better either. She's proud and arrogant but is virtually unable to make any progress with Ayato throughout the show, a complete disappointment from a romance perspective and a far cry from what you see in the other harems in the season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show does make up some ground with the large yet strong group of supporting characters. Saya is a rather low-energy childhood friend who specializes in weapons, her attacks remind me humorously of Virtue Gundam and its slow yet overwhelming attacks. Kirin is in my mind the strongest character in the show, having both a thorough development and a strong personality. The semi-harem is rounded out by the student council president Claudia, who emits both powerful and mysterious auras that draws the viewer in.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a fairly extensive list of supporting characters, not surprising given that there are six separate factions in the tournaments. What makes this show stand out here is its development of these antagonist forces; significant development time is given to antagonists to give encounters deeper meaning. This is a fair improvement over Chivalry and a huge positive over the joke tournament in Testament Burst. This will hopefully pay dividends in the sequel, as they don't have to spend as much development time there.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nAsterisk definitely has a unique style, despite being a virtual mirror image of other harems in terms of certain plot elements. While the plot was a bit too safe to be anything close to innovative, the unique setting, strong sound presentation, and strong supporting characters help to keep the viewer interested. Despite the disappointingly weak protagonist pair, I think the show still came across as entertaining and am looking forwards to the next season. Reiterating from my other reviews for the seasons' action-based harems, they're all similar but all above average, you can't go wrong with either of them. Testament is the one for those looking for the greatest ecchi, Chivalry for the strongest heroine and most angst, and Asterisk for strongest supporting cast and most unique setting.",

            "content": "For a show that gets abbreviated as GTA, it seriously lacked sex, action and guns.\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk or Asterisk War is an anime that suffers from the A.S.S. syndrome, also known as Action Sci-fi School syndrome. What is this weird disease, you may ask me. It is a plague that hits dozens of light novels authors every year which forces them to write the exact same story over and over again.\r\nIf this anime had come out 15 years ago, I could have rated it as \"decent\". However, after having seen over 20 versions of similar plots with similar characters with similar personalities, I cannot helpbut feel... tired.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I dislike spending too much time on comparison so I will start off with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in short: In the future, people can use magic and swords (yes this is the future, not medieval fantasy). They can also use guns but for the sake of \"plot\", barely anyone does and blades are considered as more mainstream weapons. There was a war, bla, bla, bla, you read the synopsis. Why do I skip all this important background setting ? Why of course, because no one cares about it : neither the audience nor the anime itself. This is made obvious as all this backstory is dropped onto you in episode 1 and never mentioned in later episodes. This is the way of this anime to say \"Ok, useless information for world creation: done. Now onto the fan service.\"\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Kirito *cough* *cough* I mean Ayato goes to one of the several academies and enrols to take part into the Festa, basically your usual battle tournament. His reasons to take part in it are pretty unclear, as far as I could understand he is looking for his sister who disappeared and if he wins the Festa, he could potentially find her... but then again this is also useless forgettable stuff explained in episode 1 that everybody forgets after that.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are we left with here ? Well just 11 other episodes where nothing significant happens. If I had to resume, Ayato gets a harem for no reason whatsoever and he defeats his opponents because he's OP.\\n\\n\r\nI would go into detail about what makes the tournament battles interesting but even after trying very hard, I still couldn't find anything. After all, the female lead clearly states at the very beginning that Ayato is the highest ranked student to take part in this year's Festa. Way to rise the stakes.\\n\\n\r\nWe're introduced to a bunch of OP looking possible antagonists but then again, who cares ? They're not even going to take part in the tournament so what's the point of even introducing them ?\\n\\n\r\nHuh ? Oh sorry one second. I just got a report informing me that this anime got the green light for a season two. But that does not really matter because I'm not so much of a masochist that I would sit through another 12 episodes of the same recycled formula. Or maybe I will, just so I can review it for you here. Who knows ?\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed by now, the story and characters are very, VERY dull. The show is full of clich\u00e9s, be it the characters that can be defined with archetypes (tsundere, deadpan loli, big-breasted loli, blonde bimbo), the story that has the exact same synopsis as other shows such as \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\", \"Serei Tsukai no Blade Dance\", \"Infinite Stratos\", etc, or even the situations the main character ends up in (unexplained harem, overused fan service moments...).\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the main character. He could be Kirito, he could be Satomi Rentarou, he could basically be just about any high school student from A-1 Pictures and he still would have no personality whatsoever. He is just a massive pushover who does what he does because it's what is expected from him as the male lead of a harem show. Another thing that's expected from him is to be surrounded by attractive females but when they outright ask him if he wants to have sex with them, he shies away. This must be a curse, for him. The only trait I remember from Ayato I can remember, funnily enough, is that he sighs ALL THE TIME. Especially before and after helping members of his harem, yet he helps them anyway. It makes you wonder why he goes through the trouble if he doesn't accept their affection in return.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does the show have going for it ? My fellow friends from Reddit highly complimented the artwork and animation of the show. Well this is something produced by A-1 Pictures so the quality is regular I guess. But the character design is so poor that if you took the main character and added a filter to turn his purple eyes and hair into black ones, you'd have Kirito. I'm not even joking. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is... normal too. Nothing out of the ordinary... oh yes ! The very bad timing of the CG is something I have to mention. I have nothing against CG that's not noticeable but when it's used so badly like that... it lowers the show's overall aesthetic. \\n\\n\r\nFor the OST, nothing major. It's not bad but it's not good either. It's just there. Nothing in particular that I would listen to again but that's more of a personal preference than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my personal enjoyment. Truth to be told I did not enjoy this show. I feel like I've watched it 10 times already, and this is definitely not one of the better ones. I definitely think this is one of those anime that is way past its era yet it is still being produced because, well, there is still a market for it. People consume that kind of milked product and as long as there's money, there will still be other copycats of that story.\\n\\n\r\nBut if I can thank A-1 Pictures for anything, it'd be that they made my job as a reviewer much easier by having Asterisk War air on the same day, at the same time as another show with the exact same setting, the exact same main female lead and the exact same plot. This way, I could compare the two of them much more easily and I clearly know which one to pick as my favourite one out of the two.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously said, comparing two anime is not something I like to spend too much time on but here we have a situation where it's almost impossible not to mention Rakudai when talking about Asterisk.\\n\\n\r\nThey both suffered from a horrible start. The difference is that Rakudai got better and more original as it went on whereas Asterisk stayed true to itself and just kept increasing its pile of needless clich\u00e9s and boring turns of events. Rakudai tried its best to animate fight scenes and crowds, Asterisk just threw in lazy CG. Rakudai gave importance to its romantic subplot, Asterisk showed it the middle finger.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on all day long about how I enjoyed Rakudai more than Asterisk but that is probably not why you are reading this review. But if you are reading this review wondering whether to watch Asterisk, then I'd advise you watch Rakudai instead. At least Stella Vermillion might be able to remind you that a good tsundere needs to have a balanced amount of -dere to match the tsun- otherwise the girl just comes out as a bitch (much like Julis).",

            "content": "Welcome to a worse version of The Irregular at Magic High! And folks, this time there's even more of a harem! \r\nThat's right. The Asterisk(*) War is, in a nice term, decent at what it tries to accomplish. Personally, I'm just glad it isn't as bad as Magical Warfare (I pity you if you have any idea of what this monstrosity is). \r\nStory ~4~:\r\nI'll say it. The story is mediocre at best. Normally in my reviews I include a summary and ties many useful statements that no one asked for to make my point, but I feel rather lazy with this one, so just readthe provided synopsis . . . Read it? Great! Our main character, Ayato Amagiri (a name you will never forget cause I swear it's looped into the soundtrack), has no idea what he wants to do with his life or why he's even attending the main setting, Seidoukan Academy. Of course this gets fleshed out during the series, but the reason he finds is annoying and backwards. \\n\r\nEnter four pretty girls. They all want Ayato for some reason. Because he saw one in her panties, is a childhood friend with another, is doted on for no particular reason, and save one from child abuse. Okay, the last one is reasonable, but that's what makes her best girl (not like I'm gonna say who cause we don't want spoilersss). \\n\r\nAnd off people go to fight at another magical competition to have their wish granted. Only, this season doesn't cover the finish of the competition. Thank God for season two, right?! No, I'm upset I watched it. I ended up scrolling through Instagram while trying to pay attention. \\n\r\nSoooo decent story, almost non existent. It's kind of just made up as the series goes along.\\n\\n\r\nArt ~7~:\\n\r\nThe art is actually very good. Pretty designs, nice uniforms too. I had a feeling they were practicing with CGI because every preview was animated in that way. For most of the scenes, the 3D animation didn't clash too much. One could catch a glimpse of the change and then it would be gone. \\n\\n\r\nSound ~8~:\\n\r\nYou almost never can go wrong with music. The soundtrack is pretty nice, suits its theme well. You can find the playlist on YouTube and be able to pinpoint which song was played where. It helps add to the anime, as the characters don't exactly have much to add for themselves. But hey! \"Waiting For the Rain\" was produced because of this anime, so I will be very grateful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~3~:\\n\r\nYare yare dane~ As most weeaboos will say. And they'd be right. Or I would be right. Whichever, the cast was very poorly fleshed out. \\n\r\nEnter Ayato: The MAL synopsis state he has a secret, and while that may be true, it's not the reason he entered the Academy. Actually, Ayato has no idea why he entered the Academy other does \"Finding what it is that I should be doing.\" That's his whole character. Even after supposedly finding what he should be doing, he still searches for something to do. It was like looking through the eyes of a puppet. His only saving grace? He's hot, so I enjoyed looking at him. But really, why would any chick be interested in him for other than that? Oh right. He's extremely overpowered. Yay. \\n\r\nPrincess Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld: She is the standard tsundere character. Well, mix himedere and tsundere together, and that's her. She lightens up over time, but watching her scenes become dull and annoying, as that's all her personality is. \\n\r\nSaya Sasamiya: I actually enjoyed watching this character because she started out as a kuudere, but over time, I found out she's not at all. Just very quiet. She has goals and dreams and I have to say, girl. Ayato is not good enough for you. \\n\r\nClaudia Enfield: *commence eye roll* Miss Student Council President. She seems kind, but describes herself as cunning and then receives one questionable scene that never gets explained. Her entire character irritated me, and apparently she's hungry for Ayato as well. \\n\r\nKirin Toudou: I know earlier I stated that I would not disclose who best girl is, but how could I not? Kirin is absolutely best girl. She has a reason to really like Ayato, and she has a goal of her own throughout the series. My only ONLY qualm with her is that SHE IS 13 YEARS OLD. I just have an immensely hard time being comfortable with the scenes between this child and a 16 year old male. Just yikes.\\n\r\nA few characters deserve an honorable mention: Ernesta K\u00fchne and Yabuki Eishirou.\\n\r\nErnesta seriously pissed me off at times, but I swear she's the best character in the whole show. She's the perfect antagonist where they're for sure evil inside, and yet not purposefully antagonistic towards the protagonists simply because that is not her goal in the show. \\n\r\nYabuki is the carefree type that also gets a questionable scene that states his role may not be what the viewer is lead to believe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~6~:\\n\r\nI'm irritated, but I did enjoy the show. I don't hate it like others do, but I can admit it's only average at best. Maybe I'm being too harsh, perhaps I'm being too lenient, but that's my thoughts. If you're just kicking back and want a meaningless watch that has magic, action, and boobs, be my guest. If you want intellectual content steer clear. \\n\\n\r\nOverall ~6~:\\n\r\nYeah, the real score is 5.6, but eh. I'll give the show a break. It was entertaining until it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nFavorite Ship: AR-D X RM-C (Yeah they're robots, but they make an interesting duo. Kind of like a married couple, I suppose X3)\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Ernesta K\u00fchne\\n\r\nFavorite Song: \"Waiting For The Rain\" by Maaya Sakamoto",

            "content": "Note to self, siblings that want to surpress your power in order to protect you should be swifty kicked in the teeth. It will only hold you back in the end.\r\nSo now that that little piece, that only people who watched the show already would understand completely, is out of the way let's think up an opening statement for The Asterisk War......\r\nI got nothing. Let's just hit it.\r\nStory: 7\r\nLightsaber dueling academies duking it out in a massive tournament. Sounds like my kind of town. This is the scene of our main protagonist Ayato (I-ya-toe). You knew exactly what these guys had in store when thefirst thing he does on screen is go to do a gentlemanly act and ends up catching a female lead in the middle of getting dressed and staring for three seconds too long. Said female lead is named Julis (U-lis) and she immediately wants him dead while at the same time owes him for his good deed. One would think the two cancel out but who am I to suggest logic. They have a quick duel that proves they are both strong but get interrupted by the student council prez Claudia. She takes him to her office where to admits there was really no reason to stop the match, but she wanted him alone anyways. Sounds like my kind of chick. From there Ayato plans on partnering with Julis in this big lightsaber, tag-team, duel tournament.\\n\\n\r\nI mean there is something to this anime that keep me invested story wise. It may just be me wanting to see this tournament and the aftermath of it all or maybe it is just the characters and how they react to each other, like in most ecchi/harem animes. Either way, I watched most of this show on a binge night of insomnia and came out satisfied thus far so I have no major complaints. One thing that was always on my mind during the whole thing was who the antagonist was since the show just loved playing stage magician and tried to make us guess between the shady characters lined up before us. In the end, in it ended up being weakness itself. I'll let you figure it out from there or just watch the anime. It doesn't really have too much that brings it down but then again it doesn't really break any new ground either. It also re-affirms my earlier statement. As a whole, it is a good story, but not one that really draws people in. I just chose it as a random title selection. I'm sure that's the only way people are finding this show now-a-days.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 6 & 8\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I appreciate about the art in this anime is how they didn't force down your throat that this is a futuristic anime. You know what I mean, when the detail in how futuristic the world is is panned over more times then the fingers on your hand. When it takes every opportunity to show how the environment is so advanced in comparison to the one the person watching is currently in. They keep it down in terms of future shit. They will show off their nice toys but they don't make it a main focus of the show. They show us early on that A. weapons can condense into simple handles/grips and will materialize when needed and B. the schools, as well as the island city they are attached to, are all connected on one big mainframe and that duels between peers and rival alike can be announced automatically. Aside from that, holographic signs, AI robots, and integrated web and phone usage is now down SAO style. You know the whole wave hand to call up a menu and what not. Everything else is simply normal anime design. Which is good because it looks smooth and doesn't have anything that looks out of place. \\n\\n\r\nSound did better compared to art though. The opening, adequately named A Brand New, is really catchy and has made it's way onto my favorite openings list. It's that pump up jam that gets you excited for the episode to come and that's good. I normally skip over the opening when I binge to save time, but this was one of those times where I didn't care because of how great it was. The ending was also really nice, finishing each episode with what can really only be described as a dream send off. I could fall asleep to it anytime. The song is called Waiting for the Rain and it is so light-hearted it really doesn't matter what happened in the episode, you will feel better about yourself when you listen to it. Voice acting wasn't as good as the OP and ED but they weren't cringe worthy either. Everyone has a voice actor or actress whose voice fit the personality of the character, which is good because it would feel weird otherwise. Sound effects are also good but can we take a moment to talk about how the beam sword on and off sound effect sounds strangely, and almost copy-right worthy, to that of the lightsaber? I not saying we should make a thing out of it, I'm just saying that it is pretty close. It just has that feeling, like when you hear the door opening sound from Doom. In the end, I thought the sound was really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nAh dammit, another mid range score. Yes the archetypes are back once again. Let's rattle them off real quick. Ayato is a dense male who is surrounded by Tsundere Julis, Big chest flirt Claudia, numb feeling flat chest girl, and shy klutz girl. I say that they put a nice twist on them but honestly that would be lying and I honestly don't have the energy to provide enough BS to cover that lie up. To be fair, Ayato does decide by episode 3 who he will stay beside and will be ignorant to the rest. Except for Claudia; he will do the embarrassed run motion every time it gets good. Julis does warm up to the main protagonist quicker than most Tsunderes. Aside from that, pretty typical stuff. I will praise the fact that they gave the AI's personality here. Too many times have I seen AI with the flat tone voice. It honesty gets old and this is a nice change of pace. But main character-wise, you know what you are getting as soon as you see it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I was totally impressed here, but I will say I was entertained. I would add it onto my list of worlds I would love to take part in, but then again lists like those are already long enough as is. The show does it's best to make the world feel fun as well as intense and does a pretty good job of it. Although the lack in character variety leaves a little bit to be desired and the climax at the end kind of acts like a bottle rocket type of bang. Which is again sad since we were shown many different sets of grand finale packages. At the time of this review, I am watching through season two, so the show is good enough that you will want to finish it completely at least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAuthor update: I actually didn't go through season 2 after writing this. Kinda stopped because I got really bored. I also have a re-review for this season as well as season 2 in the season 2 review. I correct my thoughts on this season and give it a new score so check it out.\\n",

This show's story was the exact same as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry which aired at the same time. Read my review about that for in terms of the story. But this one was much more generic and poorly done.\r\nArt: Artwork was the same as SAO, not spectacular or amazing yet not horrible. \r\nSound: The intro to the show has to be one of my favorites. However that is where it ends. Most of thevoice acting makes me regret this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Just like SAO the downfall is the characters. I understand after 12 episodes it is hard to develop good characters. But at the same time, the author could have created characters I actually could struggle to give two fucks about. But no you have two overpowered MC (one male and one female) with absolutely zero chemistry between them. The interactions between them is like watching Brittney Spears in 2007; it is a train wreck waiting to happen yet you still watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While I have seen much worse, I expected something better from the same people that did SAO. Yet at the same time, I should have expected this piece of shit to come out of that studio. A show with so much potential to be very good ends up getting butchered because the studio gives up halfway through. They poorly develop the characters. The story goes off on random ass, useless, pointless tangents that it can't come back from. And of course the MC has to be Captain Save a Hoe, and he can't even redeem himself from that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I get around to doing my review for Season 2, expect it to be about the same but more brutal. This show had me at points, when the MC would do something, I would ask myself why is he so stupid? Is this a joke? Let that dumb bitch die. You can't save everyone. Maybe I might die from how terrible this show gets. But that is all season 2.",

            "content": "We all know the ridiculous amount of magical high school ecchi and harem anime and this is just another one. If you enjoy those types of anime then you can add this one to your roster. However if you're like me and are getting tired of seeing the same thing over and over again, I suggest you not to waste your time. Now with that being said, 5's and 6's seem to be very low ratings, however if you take a look at the scale a 5 means it is mediocre or average, while a 6 is fine or fair. So even if these scoresseem low, keep in mind that it doesn't mean the anime and its aspects are terrible, it just means they're average.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nHere we have a high school that trains students in the art of magical abilities. Students there are equipped with a sword or some form of other weapon and must harness its powers and abilities. In episode 1 we are introduced to a boy who has little to no magical abilities and is seen as a terrible student. But wait, we eventually find out he's pretty OP and is on his way to winning the hearts of basically every girl in school. And of course along the way he gets some slaps and hits upon stumbling and falling onto large breasted girls with ridiculously high pitched voices. The main girl initially treats our MC with hostility but eventually warms up to him while he listens to her tragic background story. --- Does all that sound pretty familiar to you? Have you watched 15 other anime with this premise? Well, that's basically Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. I guess in this story though you do have the added component of magical duels and competitions but considering Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is airing at the exact same time this aspect doesn't seem very unique either.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nThe animation is fine, every character is drawn nicely and battle scenes are fluid. However, there really isn't anything special about it. We also get a variety of hair colours ranging from purple to pink to blue.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nOP and ED are once again pretty average. I do enjoy the OP as its sounds plays along with the technological characteristics to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nNothing special to report about the characters. The main male and female protagonists are basically the same as all the other ones you've met. The MC (Ayato) is seen to be \"weak\" but has some secret abilities that make him pretty powerful. The female protagonist (Julis) is a beauty and high up in the ranks in terms of ability. She has a sad past and is working to make everything better. She also fight with other girls for the attention of Ayato.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -6\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I enjoy this anime, but I also wouldn't say I DON'T enjoy it. For me, this is a nice way to take a break in between studying or a way for me to relax on the weekends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nThis isn't a BAD anime per se, but there is absolutely nothing unique about it. Everything you see here you have already seen before. \\n",

            "content": "My thoughts on the show were heavily influenced by Digibro's \"The Asterisk War Sucks\" videos. I only watched one, but it did help me look at this show much more critically than I would've originally.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThere's NOTHING special about Asterisk War's story. A generic plot for a generic light novel. There's this academy, you see, and there are six factions. They all train people in this super cool magic technology fighting thing, where you have weapons called Luxes and magic called Prana and stuff, and there are races like Strega and Genestella, and you have battle terms and tactical messages like setting-type and-\r\nYeah, it isn'tgoing to cut it.\\n\r\nThe story of this isn't necessarily bad. It's incredibly generic, for sure, but I can see potential. A lot of the world was introduced but not gone over, so the watchers are left in confusion about what this item is or what that is, who this group is. That brings me to plot holes and foreshadowing. There is SO. MUCH. FORESHADOWING. In this show. It's not even funny. Watching this feels like every couple of minutes a new character or threat or even start of a new arc is put into action, and these things will be completely ignored for the rest of the show or foreshadowed multiple more times without any consistency, leading to a very contrived and seemingly dynamic plot that just has holes and confusion. On a technical aspect the story is a wreck, but this messy, generic, harem does have potential to be fleshed out for a legitimately good story. That's about all there is to it.\\n\r\nIt's typical of light novel adaptations though. Look at No Game No Life, they ended on a serious cliffhanger. Asterisk War isn't all that different. It wraps up like, half of an arc, but there's still too many things left unexplained to be considered acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThis art also has tons of potential that isn't used. Let me just say this, the animation is BEAUTIFUL. The effects are top-notch; they're flashy, colorful, fluid, all that. The opening is just a visual orgasm. The 3-D effects are amazing, and it's excellent how it zoomed through the bases of each of the six factions. Great job for the opening designers.\\n\r\nBut anyways, the art has potential that is wasted. I can only explain this feeling as the animators were \"lazy.\" The environment wasn't breathtaking nor was it abhorrent, but it was just lazy and didn't stand out. Another thing was, the art worked too hard to bring focus to one character. Some scenes felt like one character would speak or move around and the others would be frozen until their turn came. It was too linear and sequential.\\n\r\nAnother thing is the fights were lazily choreographed. Some of the fight moves seem contrived and forced, not to mention illogical. I mean, if you're going to block a sword swing, would you block it with the very tip of your weapon when you could be safe and use the main body? If you're going to attack, are you going to practically fall forwards if you miss, leaving yourself open for a direct hit on the back? Remind me how long your sword is; not that long, right, so you should probably move a bit closer before you attack if you want to hit anything. And some of the fights defy physics. I get that it's like magic and super powers and whatever, but we don't get an explanation on the limits of these magi-tech weapons and their users. They can block a lightning fast two-handed overhead strike with an upwards motion using one hand, yet they don't know how to redirect a weapon clash and slide forwards to attack?\\n\r\nTLDR, too many inconsistencies with combat limitations and physics. Everything just seems like everybody is in god-mode, except for the losers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nHey, I don't harp on sound or anything, I usually don't care. However, there were some extreeeeemely cringe-worthy voice actors that I realized, SUPER annoying. Kirin, Korona, for example. Everybody else is just a generic voice. Other than that, the music was fine. The sound effects were good- especially when Saya pulls Ayato's head into her chest. That was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nWith a generic light novel plot comes generic light novel characters. Here's the roster:\\n\r\n-Protagonist-kun Ayato is noble, overpowered, and usually random when it comes to how he behaves. Oh, and he's completely oblivious to his harem. Sound familiar?\\n\r\n-Tsundere deuteragonist Julis who is extremely predictable and also pretty overpowered.\\n\r\n-Deredere sadist Kurodia. She has huge boobs and is flirtatiously aggressive.\\n\r\n-Anti-social gun-loving childhood friend Saya. Loli, ahoge, laid-back, calm..\\n\r\n-Airhead Kirin. Loli with huge bust, squeaky voice, and vanilla sword skills.\\n\r\n-Autonomous robot AR-D. Mechanical, powerful, but still gets his ass kicked by RM-C through sexism.\\n\r\nThose are the main characters, protagonist-kun and his harem. AR-D only shows up in like, half of one episode, but he's easily my favorite character right after Saya. Everybody else falls under a couple of categories. One is \"mysterious character who isn't memorable and has too many ulterior motives.\" Two is \"villain with too many ulterior motives.\" Three is \"supporting character who shows up randomly.\" Four is \"not important generic NPC placeholder.\"\\n\r\nCharacters are generic, nobody special. Gets a 6 because AR-D is funny as hell and needs more screen time, and Saya is my favorite type of girl. But anyways, the most overused archetypes there are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI can't say I didn't enjoy the first 7 episodes. Until I watched Digibro's videos, I happily took in this show for what it was worth. Sure, it was generic and predictable and full of bothersome mysterious plot contrivances and nonsense, but I like that kind of stuff. Of course it was no longer a masterpiece after I started paying attention, but that's okay. I don't hate this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt was alright, to be honest. I enjoyed it, but there are problems with the show. Much like Sword Art Online, where the plot jumps around and doesn't make sense because nothing is really explained to you, and plot holes are skipped over in favor of random arcs and crap. Much like Sword Art Online, where the protagonist is just overpowered and doesn't have much trouble with anything because he's just naturally good. Much like Sword Art Online, where the side characters really don't have much screentime and personality consistency, and also the second main character is a tsundere. Much like Sword Art Online, where the art and sound weren't exactly shit but could have been put to much better use. Much like Sword Art Online, because I fucking loved it until I realized how bad it was.\\n\r\nYeah, I know it's a dick move to compare this show to SAO. Everybody does that these days. The two shows just share a lot of issues that led to their downfalls. I should write a recommendation for them.\\n\\n\r\nDon't take my words for granted. This show has a wide variety of reception: from people rating it complete garbage because of all the errors to people rating it ten because of how cool it was to them. If you're at all interested in the tags, give this show a try because it's a bit better than most of its kind. If you're interested in the plot synopsis.. don't watch it, the plot really is just an appetizer or something here.",

            "content": "Overall:6\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk definitely isn't a waste of your time, but that's about what I'll say for it. I might be a bit rough on it, but I was intensely underwhelmed by this anime, so I didn't feel like being nice to it either.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThis anime is a wierd combination of tournaments, a harem, and political intrigue. Despite its attempts, however, it cannot quite manage to succeed at any of these. In order, the tournament is the most put together of the three. The tournament happens, there are fights, and the anime gets through the prelims in the first season. The anime may have donebetter if they had spent more time developing the fights, which were more like short clips of the main characters instantly whiping their opponents. Starting the tournament earlier would probably have helped, because the payoff in this season was not very strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe harem element of this anime was lackluster. There are 4 main members of the harem who are all individually decent, but the harem gets stuck on the oblivious protagonist throughout the season. If the characters were interesting, or trying to win him over in cute scenes, then this would be fine. Alas, this is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe political intrigue in this anime is where a lot of the actual plot comes from, which is unfortunate considering that it's a mess. The basic factions are very rudimentarily explained, but otherwise the viewer must go to incredible lengths to pick up anything useful about the interactions of these factions. The goals of each faction are a mystery, except perhaps that their leaders want to win a tournament eventually. There are vague mentions of secret services and codes of conduct, but none of these are revealed clearly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art is generic, but it's decently done. This is an easy area to succeed in in my opinion if the anime is professionally made. I was tempted to make it a 7, but the severe limitation of character expression and the ability for the art to convey emotions makes it a solid 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe music was passable, but I never stopped to listen to it or anything. I certainly didn't feel like the ambient music improved the anime to any extraordinary extent. The voice acting wasn't terrible, but it could definitely be a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThe characters are all archetypical cutouts of other generic characters, sometimes even without any adjustments at all. It's essentially a strong and compassionate main character who is good at fighting, a tsundere that becomes increasingly dere, an awkward quiet girl, a cute junior high girl who's physiscally mature for her age, and one assertive woman who's all over the place character wise. To make matters worse, the character motivations in this anime are essentially nonexistent and are almost totally inconsequential to the plot. Furthermore, the means by which they intend to fulfill their superficial goals is irrelevant to the goal itself (win tournament, get wish, wish for thing). In this case, this makes the motivations seem even more inconsequential and offer little to no character development opportunities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI really like anime, and I was in the mood for an overpowered main character. I didn't get my fix in that regard, but it was flashing lights and terrible pronunciations of European names, so I had fun. Kirin was adorable, so I had extra fun when she was on screen, even if she is not a great character herself (probably the best in this anime though).",

Also does nobody else find it funny that two anime airing on the same day have a main heroine that is the princess of a small country, and that the main character accidentally sees them changing in both shows.
