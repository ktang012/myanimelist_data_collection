            "content": "Just finished this show a couple of moments ago, the hype I got before watching this was IMENSE, but after sitting trough it all I can definitely see where it comes from... for the better and the worse.\r\nI will refrain myself from commenting on the show before I give my view on specific issues. I will try my best to refrain myself from spoilers, but rest assured, some will exist SO if you didn`t watch it yet you are better jumping straight to my conclusion.\r\n---------------------\r\nAnimation\r\n---------------------\r\nIn simple words it\u2019s GORGEOUS. If you take into account it\u2019s from 2006 it gets even better, surely nothing that yearcan get remotely close to it, and even for today standard\u2019s it is top notch, specially on the color pallet department.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds, the CGI, the still animations, the fight sequences... everything clicks beautifully, but what really shines are the character designs and the color employed on the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely worth HD (I got the THORA release) and I wouldn`t settle for anything lower then 720p, it really deserves it.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nI`ve tried my best to find issues with the sound, but to put it simple it\u2019s not bad at all!\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are catchy in their own merits and somewhat memorable. They do come off occasionally on the wrong scenes but for the most of the time they are spot on.\\n\\n\r\nAside the soundtrack, the sound effects are also ok and fit the scenes they take part into.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also pretty well done, and I would like to add a special note that the English and German segments are amongst the best I have ever seen in an anime (as cheesy as they might be).\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nThis show reeks ambition so much it ended up being smacked down by the usual budget / time frame reality, and this is the part where we feel it the worse.\\n\\n\r\nMore than once I felt like I needed a manual to watch the show and it wasn`t included. Terms they use all the time never get explained and this gets in the way of understanding stuff every now and then, it\u2019s quite annoying and you have to put up some effort to understand stuff based solo on the sentence context.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc`s are well staged, but again the lack of proper treating and over ambitious director leave us with some problems. It is aggravating that some important stuff that happens later on have to rely on quick flashbacks to pack any meaning and even then the results are quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nThis gets the most aggravating when we deal with relationships between characters, but I will write about that on the latter topic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is nice and has a tremendous amount of care to it, sadly the director didn`t have time to fulfill all he had in mind and it suffers a lot from it. If I had to pinpoint what areas suffered more I would have to say the romance. The action can carry itself pretty well due to the beautiful visuals and the drama focus on the \u201csacrifice\u201d aspect most shounens drag from so no biggie, but the romantic relationships between Shirou and Saber are awkward to say the least, and his relation with Rin and Sakura are simply \u201cdeleted\u201d from the plot halfway through for no apparent reason!\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nAll the characters are well made. They all have distinct traits, they all have particular looks, they all have background, objective and dept, but the problem is most of the time this is all crammed up so much it end up not living to the expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on in this subject for hours, but instead of pointing out how obviously Saber lack proper introduction about her past, or how Shirou desperately needed some more development and diversity or even how some characters like Sakura disappear from the plot after a few episodes (and we actually miss the continuation) I will just use my favorite character as an example, Rin.\\n\\n\r\nRin is an astonishing character that actually carry the show trough its worse moments all by herself, but the lack of episodes this show is plagued with (it deserved at least another season) makes some of her most interesting aspects lack and most of her relationships with other characters underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does she care so much about Sakura? Is the preach a fatherly figure to her? Does she love Shirou? I really wish all these aspects where developed, but instead they throw a few flashbacks and rush everything out to the point they don`t make the slightest sense and hurt the otherwise REALLY cool character she is.\\n\\n\r\nEven her relationship with archer is crammed up to the point he barely shows his face and 5 episodes latter they kill him and we are supposed to care?! And that is another major issue, the servants have NO development AT ALL so all the cool traits they own are wasted since we don`t know who they are, why they fight for or even their origin... we don`t even get introductions to them it\u2019s just sad.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment & Conclusion\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nFrom the moment the show start to the end its quite clear the director set the standard on the stratosphere but sadly got smacked down by reality mid way through it. Either lack of budget, lack of time or both the fact is, most of the show builds such a tremendous hype around itself and sadly don\u2019t live up to it leaving many shortcomings by the end.\\n\\n\r\nI do however congratulate the director for taking the hard route and abiding itself for making a complete show instead of a \u201cfirst part\u201d that would never seen an end. Still, it hurts to see so much potential being left untouched.\\n\\n\r\nI would say this show is really worth for people that like the genre, this IS a shounen after all, and even though it have many qualities that deviate from the standard and make it different, the typical affair is all here\u2026 like people never EVER getting killed, the main weak protagonist with untapped potential and the usual good = good | bad = bad ordeal where every good guy is a saint and every bad guy have snake eyes, do rough voices and have a satanic smile\u2026 so it does tick all the boxes for the standard show.\\n\\n\r\nNow for other people that are not all that into shounen, I would still highly recommend this but with a warning, you WILL get disappointed. This anime was destined to be a masterpiece but it faced shortcomings that hindered expectations in every possible way. This would\u2019ve been bad on a regular show, but the amount of greatness this anime reeks is unparalleled and this just make it all the bitter.",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is a bit of a sore spot for me. It's the first time I ever sat down, giddy to watch a certain series and came away scratching my head thinking \"this is what all the commotion was about?\" But in all fairness, Fate/Stay Night is not a terrible anime, just a very overrated one.\r\nThe story takes place in modern-day Japan, revolving around a boy named Shirou Emiya and has reluctant participation in a city-wide battle royale known as the Holy Grail War. While this sounds like a shounen set-up, Fate is rather talkative. Scratch that, Fate is way too talkative for its owngood. Boring and pointless conversations about ideals and the ethics of battle get put up front in the first half and the action the premise attempts to indicate is shoved to the background. Fortunately for those of you who turned in for the super-powered free-for-alls, you won't be disappointed too much. There are a handful of extravagant fights, but only a handful.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half does its best to reward patient viewers with impressive revelations, some good twists, and an amped-up focus on the war rather than on whether its okay to fight in the war. Unfortunately in its quest to make up for all it wasted early on, Fate ultimately burns out and fizzles through the last few episodes, which unfortunately are constructed to make us think this is some kind of grand climax.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast runs the gamut from expendable to enjoyable. Those who watch will surely take not of complacent victim-turned-mage Shirou who does nothing but whine and whine and whine some more for 12 episodes. This is not a biased complaint. He really does complain about his situation that much. He does grow past this, but not enough to prove he's entirely past that part of himself. His servant, Saber, is hardly any better. The silent type for the majority of the series, she does not provide much for conflict or relationships. She's there and she occasionally fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe real stars though have to be Rin and Archer. Rin originally serves as an antagonist to Shirou and her blatantly in-your-face personality and no-nonsense attitude gives this series a much needed and appreciated shot of energy. More so, she's one of the more interesting characters, especially when her past is later called into question. Her servant, Archer, is mostly famous for one particular episode, but the episode demonstrates enough of his ability and a revelation about his identity which enables the series to be seen from a second parallel perspective. If it weren't for them, I'd probably have dropped this a few eps in.\\n\\n\r\nArt is often heavy-handed, especially with uses of light and shadow. Both are incredibly exaggerated at all times, often for dramatic purposes, but it only serves to annoy and makes the series look cheaper than it should. The series often cuts corners with long scenery pans, especially in the first part of the series. Fight scenes that aren't interrupted often show where the animation budget went for the series. They're extravagant and jaw-dropping, but only a minute or two each and then the energy drops off once more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs stay true to the game, inventive and hinting at future revelations. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into them and it shows in spades.\\n\\n\r\nSound had a few bright points, but it was often unmemorable. Voice work was standard, and the theme music was just below great.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, Fate/Stay Night left me wondering what all the commotion was about. It's a very uneven series that shows rays of hope often, but never capitalizes on any of their finer moments. Even more irritating, it never expands on revelations and expects you to go play the game if you want the full story. It's a 24 episode series with an animation budget for 12 episodes and a story that could have been 39 episodes long. You do the math.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Fate/Stay Night a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "This has to be one of the best animes I have seen a while. This review may come out a bit biased as I just finished the series and remain blown away by it. Fate/Stay Night (F/SN) is a seinen about a magical war between 7 magi and their powerful servants who were great heroes and demigods from across time. The Heroes are all mythological figures which give background to their motivation although only the main character\\'s servant is ever fully explored. The story lacks in that regard but can be easily supplemented through wikipedia. The message of the story was clear by the endand even though the ending is a bit tragic, it leaves you feeling content. (Although at the time of this review I\\'m feeling a bit of depression at its ending. I was so enthralled by F/SN that I watched it in a relatively short period of time.) The animation fits the premise. The premise resembles that of a shounen. Magicians summoning warriors of different classes reminds oneself of pokemon, digimon, shaman king but unlike those child friendly examples death occurs in the series, servants albeit not a true corporeal form shed blood and are injured similiar to the master\\'s themselves. Nudity is shown although not explicitly so (subject to opinion.) The servant themselves are not the typical mindless machinations or friendly buddies. Servants only serve their master because they have a common goal, to win the Holy Grail. It looks like a typical shounen epic except I never noticed any of the mistakes that comes with cutting corners. With the short ratio of boys to girls, one can mistake some scenes for a harem comedy but this may be a result of F/SN\\'s roots as an ero-type game. Except for a very few instances, nudity or scantily clad attire is practically non-existent and do not adversely affect the plot. I enjoyed the music, j-pop/rock, and none the seiyu were out of place in the sub. I couldn\\'t give this a perfect on character design because there were times when the actions of a character felt unjustified in the way it was portrayed but it may have been because they were fitting a much larger story into a small 24 episode series. So the character design in the anime leaves you with questions but they\\'re easily answered thanks to the background of the series. As mentioned before I was enthralled by this series and enjoyed it so much I blew through it. I\\'ll end up buying it when I have the time to watch it again and I recommend this title to those who like action, romance and a little meaning. Also take it down a notch if you dislike blood and pig-headed heroes.",

            "content": "In an earlier review, Bluesnow talked about how despite being a good anime, F/SN has a tradition of being overrated. I pretty much agree with this sentiment. This is a good anime, but it definitely has plenty of areas that could be improved. \r\nThe plot of this series, is to be honest, pretty horrible. It's extremely linear, it's pretty boring, and there isn't really very much in terms of plot twists or suspense. And what little they had, which was more towards the end of the series, was executed rather badly with bad pacing and ass pulls galore. In mitigation, this was likely caused bythe developers buckling under the twin strains of running out of budget and having to merge the three different scenarios from the visual novel together. However, it's still bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of the series lies, frankly, outside. The backstory, the concepts dealt with, the underlying metaplot, the thoughts provoked - fantastic is an understatement. Sadly, in order to be able to enjoy this, reading the Visual Novel is a must. The anime simply did not have enough time to cram in all of the information, resulting in a jumbled mess.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this series lay in the characters. Every single character positively exudes personality - from just hearing one line, you can basically pinpoint which character it is from. However, this is coming after I've read the Visual Novel, and also all the associated mythologies of the characters. If just watching the anime itself with no prior knowledge, the Servants can be a bit... one-sided. The thing you have to remember is that you're *supposed* to know the characters beforehand, and that the development present is an expansion on preexisting perceptions of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's one exception to the strong characterization - the main character. Given that this was an adaptation from an eroge (hardly a medium known for strong main characters), you wouldn't really expect much of Shirou. However, Shirou does not possess the usual blank self-insert personality typical of eroge protagonists. Quite the opposite, in fact. He has an extremely strong personality, and it's grating to the extreme. There are plenty of times where you wish you could just slap the damn child out of him, and unfortunately, the scenario where that *does* happen was not animated. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality was extremely well done, with a clean art style that's extremely refreshing, and well animated fight sequences. Sadly, this tended to suffer near the end of the series as the animators ran out of budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound is a non-sequitter. Nothing really stands out, nothing's really bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Fate/Stay Night has a marvelous backstory, beautiful characters, and a mediocre plot. In trying to shake things up from the Visual Novel, the director appears to have set too high a bar for himself to attain, running beyond the limits of himself and the budget. While the animated medium makes for a much better flow of story than the Visual Novel, which had shaking pacing at best, in the end it fell prey to the pitfall of no money.",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is a fabulous Romantic, Action, Adventure that will leave you amazed by the beautiful visuals and interesting fights. Just don't let the main character annoy you too much, as he did with me. ^_^\r\nAfter watching just the first 3 episode you basically learned the main plot of this anime, which was the Holy Grail War and also learned how similar this anime was with others; having the same little annoyances. I personally was annoyed with the whole &ldquo;my parents are dead&rdquo; and I just wanted this show to be different with the parents&rsquo; still alive at least. But most of all I wasannoyed by how weak and pathetic yet lucky Shirou was, which just seemed unoriginal. What made it worse was how arrogant Shirou was and how he always wanted to fight his own battles, even though his Servant could do a much better job at it. Nevertheless I didn&rsquo;t allow these annoyances to get in the way of this great show and if you do the same you may enjoy it too.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is an Action/Adventure with elements of both Romance and Comedy, however unlike most of this genre the romance is played down that even I found it difficult to tell who Shirou would end up with. This was one of the things that helped save the show from a bad score and another was the great character developments that occurred in the story. As the story went on, even though it seemed hard to believe from the beginning but Shirou greatly improved as a Master and became lass annoying to watch. He even had some pretty interesting fights although the bulk of the fights were fought by Saber. The fights were great to watch adding a decent amount of action to the show. On the other hand some fights had a lacklustre feel it them, so if your used to being glued to the screen from a spectacular battle don&rsquo;t count on that happening here often, however there&rsquo;s at least some interesting fights.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I like in my anime is something that was missing in this show, a decent plot twist, but this is just my opinion. If you don&rsquo;t mind it sticking to one storyline all the way through to the end, then there&rsquo;s no chance in you being disappointed with the story you&rsquo;ve got.\\n\\n\r\nApart from Shirou the rest of the characters were OK with decent personalities but most of them weren&rsquo;t developed well enough. Usually all you&rsquo;re given is a few hazy moments and flashbacks of a characters past and forced to work out what&rsquo;s going on by yourself. Well at least the characters were well-drawn though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality for Fate/Stay Night was lavish with some of the best used light and shadow effects I&rsquo;ve seen in a while. Even though that may sound pointless, in this anime it was significantly noticeable. The music was decent but it could have been a lot better if it used some other track from the Fate/Stay Night soundtrack. Yet the music wasn&rsquo;t much of a big deal in this anime and it was only near the end that the music really made a difference.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, this anime did a great job of mixing romance and action without making either one of them overbearing, although it could of done without the comedy. Even though the comedy was used to lighten the mood at times in this show, I didn&rsquo;t feel it was needed. The fights were interesting but it could have done with the charged up yelling and screaming, mostly from Saber. I was very pleased with the ending, because it wasn&rsquo;t too sad and it wasn&rsquo;t cheesy, but it did leave me a little confused yet I was sure it had ended. Even up until the end there was still something I didn&rsquo;t like about the character Shirou and it had to do with the Japanese voice actor that I and most &ldquo;Naruto&rdquo; fansub watchers will notice pretty quickly as well. So try not to let this spoil the show for you because this was an remarkable anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

Another perk is that you get to enjoy watching the stories of legends like King Arthur, Gilgamesh and Musashi get completely raped.  The writers spit on these time honored taleswithout any respect at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe subpar and utterly predictable action really disappointed as well since the pitiful romance subplots felt like a wet blanket over the whole series.  At times there would be two fights simultaneously following the exact same path so that you got to be right about guessing what happens twice in a row.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this &quot;PG under 13&quot; because I really believe anyone with any semblance of maturity will throw up at the simplicity and utter frustrating predictability of this anime.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night is definitely a great anime, but it lack some \"chemistry\" that makes it a masterpiece level of work. That is not to say the anime is bad in any way, in fact it is a total success in my opinion. But nonetheless, I will be making comparisons with other similar themed anime as the review proceeds. \r\nI will not go through repeating what has been said in the other reviews already. However, I want to make 2 points clear as to why I find it not as great as many claim it to be (ultimately it is these 2 points that made megive the story an 8/10).\\n\\n\r\n1. The lack of information about most servants' past. That includes Saber as well. I am basing this on just the anime alone (so if the visual novel or manga has a more detailed coverage about these, I don't care). I find the story a little rushed trying to cover the main plot and somewhat \"hint\" to us regarding certain characters past. As a result, a lot of information I want to know were not presented in the anime (but rather in the game).\\n\\n\r\n2. I consider myself to be a rather \"emo\" person (I cried for the 2nd half of Mai HiME for example). But there weren't much \"moving\" scenes in this anime that make me either laugh too hard or cry too hard. There may be surprises occasionally, but that was it. Though at the same time the plot was interesting enough for me to keep watching episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key issue about the anime are the characters. Though there are decent character developments throughout the story, the lack of information presented at the end regarding the primary characters' future kind of left it like a dangling string. Some people might like it that way, but I don't. Certainly not how they decided to end Saber's past at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find it quite enjoyable (kept me glued to the computer long enough for me to finish the anime in 2.5 days), but it just lack some \"hard-to-forget\" scenes.",

            "content": "This anime is considered by many fans as the best anime of 2006; while it is a good anime its popularity is often over hyped and most ignored the major flaws of the series that kept it from being a masterpiece. \r\nThe basic plot is about Shirou; a high School boy with a very righteous kind heart but has a weak character and knows little magic. By fate he falls into an epic battle over the holy grail taking on the powerful Hero Summon \"Saber\" as his servant. The Servants do battle with one another till only one is left then taking the Holy grailto make a wish, but this battle devastates Shirou's life and opens up the secrets to traumatic events that happened in his past. The plot primarily is action/shounen/Drama... They attempt some Romance as well~ but its a little awkward.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is one of the main flaws of this series; it becomes clear very early that this anime is based off of a &quot;Visual Novel&quot; due to its linear plot~ the goal is known right away and the development is predictable. There are some shocking moments towards the end, but that doesn't make up for the rest. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most stifling thing about the story is it hints about Saber's and other's pasts... but in never divulged any information. While sometimes its excusable to keep a mysterious story, in the case of this anime it felt vital to the plot, and rather than add to the mood of urgency it felt more like they were trying to rush parts of the series far too much... much of the events make no sense unless you play the visual novels or look up the background info online.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the good side the plot is fast enough to enjoy after the first few episodes, Has alot of interesting battles and antagonists, and has an interesting back story if you watch untill the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is ok; the characters are well done, especially most of the servants. Overall I have no bones to pick with the animation; it just wasn't that original and the main protagonist had not impressive characteristics to make him stand out. The battle art was very good though; especially their final attacks. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound, like the art was acceptable. The opening and ending themes were very good and the OST was great. There was no real &quot;Epic Battle&quot; music that lived up to some of the great battles, but it was still good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This was the big downfall for the series... Most of the characters are very superficial, unoriginal, and predictable. The biggest let down in Saber and several other servants; because the story focuses on the character development of the masters for the most part most of the servants pasts are never explained in any detail... so it makes it very hard to understand their development or motivation. Saber's is insinuated at the very end, but the story rushes so much it makes it impossible to truly understand the depth of her character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This in another &quot;Good&quot; anime~ \\n\r\nIts worth watching despite its unoriginality~ But don't expect a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night was, for lack of better words, \"pretty good.\" It was not GREAT, nor horrendous, but it was riding the fine line of mediocrity at times. I understand that it is quite difficult to be original in a day and age where it seems like everything new and innovative has already been used. But I digress. \r\nMuch of the mediocrity found in this series is in the story itself. There were very few twists and the ones that were there have already been done many times over. A fairly useless kid is our protagonist, by the name of Emiya Shirou, who turns out tonot be quite so useless. Go figure. Emiya, with the aid of his Servant, Saber, who turns out to be quite powerful (yet again, go figure) must now battle the other sorcerers in a tournament to obtain a Grail that will grant a single wish.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I kind of feel like we've heard this story before. Weak kid, strong guardian figure, an object of limitless power that they must possess after countless trials and tribulations. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I really have nothing more to add other than the story got a 5 because of the total lack of originality. Granted, the Servants at times were pretty cool, but it isn't anything we haven't all seen before.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some refreshing comedy moments that helped throughout the staleness of the story, in my opinion. It wasn't made to be like Shakugan no Shana, it was very serious throughout most of the series, which, when looking at it from that perspective, it kept the anime fresh simply because it wasn't another fighting anime filled to the brim with comedy. \\n\\n\r\nI will hand it to the animators, they made the fight scenes in this series quite well. The art was great, continuity throughout the scenes were excellent, and the animation itself was top notch and quite beautiful. I enjoyed the color schemes, notably during the scenes in the school when Rin is battling with Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, I reiterate the battle animations: They look GOOD. It is what kept me watching all the way to the end, hoping for another battle. The characters moved like liquid at times and when they fought, you could almost feel the intensity. Which does a lot for the overall score of this anime because nothing is worse when you watch a series about fighting and the fighting itself is boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were nothing special, pretty much what you would expect from an anime such as this; sword clashing, the sounds of flesh being destroyed by weapons, incantations, the occasional battle soundtrack, etc. The voice-overs were done well. Shirou had the typical high school voice you come to expect and his screams were well recorded. Saber's total lack of emotion in her voice throughout most of the series was pleasing, considering that her character and personality reflected the lack of emotional response unless regarding her aims for the Grail. \\n\\n\r\nI was disappointed with the characterization though, in a few ways. Shirou starts off pretty spineless and soft-hearted. As the story progresses, he is given a few opportunities where he has to act and a few times, he surprised me. But ultimately, even though he made a few decisions that I did not expect, I felt he still never learned anything and never grew as a character. \\n\\n\r\nSaber, on the other hand, was an amazing character. She initially comes across as a hard-as-nails, straight to business kind of character. In the later episodes, she shows a bit of her softer, more caring side which is a drastic change. And when the end credits finally roll, you realize that she is a character, despite the faults she felt she had, despite the turmoil of feelings she had, Saber stuck to her convictions, duty and purpose. You could not ask for more.\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night was enjoyable, its animation and characters being its strong points and its story being its lowest. Overall I gave it a 7 because it could have done better, but it is worthy enough that I would recommend it to other people and would give it a second watch. I cannot say I did not enjoy quite a few parts of this, especially some of the more intense battles that took place near the end. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that has great animation, multiple battles and strong characterization then look no further. Just be prepared to occasionally scoff at the over-used foreshadowing and plot twist techniques and being able to say \"I saw that coming\" more than once.",

            "content": "Edit 8/08/2008\r\nWhen I see the ratings people give to Fate/stay night, I can't help but be amazed at how highly it scores. Overall, I couldn't help but feel F/sn was an overrated, mediocre anime with an unreasonable fanbase.\r\nReasons why:\r\nStory\r\nA mythical and mysterious tournament for the holy grail takes place, and the protagonist is dragged into it. Then epic battles ensue between the masters and their servants, until of course, one emerges as the victor. Let's see... a \"mystical\"... \"tournament\"... where you have to save the world by winning. Oh. Wow. That has to be the basis for at least half the shounen anime out there.If it loses points for ingenuity, it could redeem itself by being dynamic, or at least intriguing. But of course, the Shirou-Saber duo must confront successive enemies, one at a time. I could sum up the whole series by listing the enemies the protagonists face.\\n\r\nThat being said, F/sn was adapted from an eroge game. Doesn't it seem that there are a little too many of those popping up lately? It doesn't help the plot at all that some scenes actually didn't show everything that happens (for obvious reasons). Usually it simply confuses the audience. Heck, it confused the heck out of me... until I read the summary on Wikipedia. And when you have to actually look up the plot to understand what happened... you're in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Sound\\n\r\nI have nothing against the visual and audio effects. The music sounds epic, the opening and closing themes were ok (but not awesome) The artwork was beautifully done, though it might've helped if the characters (namely Shirou) changed clothes once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is where F/s n fails sadly. Character development is sparse, except for perhaps Shirou and Saber. We see Saber's slow change from an unfeeling servant into a person with... well, more emotions than she used to have. Shirou stays the same, to much chagrin, trying to save the universe all the time.\\n\r\nThe horror starts when you try to focus on other characters. Rin and Archer to be exact. We're given absolutely no background information about Archer's past or what kind of character he is.(Same goes for many of the other supporting characters)  All he does is fight. Little to no screen time is devoted to developing him as a character. He's basically a character you wouldn't pay attention to, even though his role as the second female protagonist's servant should warrant some importance.\\n\r\nThen comes Rin. There are some flashbacks that allow the audience to glean some information of her past, but her sudden spontaneous relationships with the other characters are largely unexplained. Of course, as a fighter, she resembles the classic damsel-in-distress character who tries to fight, but has to be saved by Shirou. If she's such a capable magician,  then why does it seem that all she does is constantly fail so almighty Shirou can swoop in and save the day? Plus, let's face it. Those so-called &quot;jewel bombs&quot; are an utter joke.\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that Shirou is also sexist, saying that Saber should stay home when she could easily kill him without a thought. All talk with no brains to back it up. I wouldn't particularly mind if there was some thought about developing him, but alas, he doesn't change at all.. almost as if the producers are telling us he's a perfect character. I could go on.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nFate/stay night is sensational, with devoted sound and artwork. However when you try to delve into the actual plot, there are many points that leave much to be desired. There are many positive aspects, many of which I did not touch upon, and others may feel that my criticism is too harsh. As the viewer, ... or whoever's reading this... it's up to you to make the decision to watch. (You're probably sick of hearing this)",

            "content": "This anime feels like a plain retelling of the original story, and those who have played the visual novel game won't find great content in watching it. On the other hand, those who haven't are unlikely to find it any better either - chances are they would find the story and the characters completely uninspiring.\r\nFate/stay night does not have any horrendous flaws in it, enough to make your watching experience miserable. That said, it will fail to instill many emotions in the viewer and putting the hype aside, I cannot fathom how those new to the Fate/stay night universe might find it anything other thannot-too-bad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Mediocre (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven the story in the game isn't that spectacular. Perhaps its greatest value is the carefully constructed world with intriguing characters and not many plot holes. Therefore, it was easy to get immersed in the game and get to like a certain cool servant or a master for its beliefs, actions, personality, looks or history. Albeit rather fantastic and idealistic ones, the motives behind the characters were thoroughly explained and thus brought to life.\\n\\n\r\nAs the result of mixing of the three routes that exist in the game in order to (try to) depict every servant/master and thus get more fans, not one character feels complete. Many of the game's monologues and dialogs are of course left out so once the ball starts rolling with the Holy Grail war one event tramples over another until the very end, making the story seem pretty unsubstantial and childish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to explain the art here is to say it's like a well-drawn picture book with some cool photoshop effects sprinkled here and there. My biggest objection here would be the unexplainable inconsistency in the art style; somewhere around the middle of the show it almost feels like a slide show for a couple of episodes, even some characters were drawn sloppily (this is not the case throughout the show, but when and if you get to those few episodes, you'll know). While you will certainly enjoy the colors and art style which are both very fitting, you won't be thrilled by the lack of real animation.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: Good (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDisillusion, the first OP is an improved version of the game OP and is simply superb. ED is okay, the second OP is below average. Background music fits the mood well but you're likely to get sick of it. Voice acting is not extraordinary nor particularly bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mediocre (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I said for the story applies here. Characters don't have their personalities explained well and its hard to get attached to pretty much anyone, even if you've played the game.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Decent (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf you've played the visual novel you'll find this anime fun from the perspective of watching an animated set of CGs coupled with voices, though it might get excruciating after a dozen episodes or so. The parts which I have liked the most are those at the beginning when the characters joke, have meals, go to school etc. because it is probably the only part that differs from the game story and feels less like a retelling of it from one lazy teenager to another.\\n\r\nIf you haven't, don't fall for the hype - the game is good, the anime is far less good - if you feel there are inconsistencies in the story and if it feels bland, it's because it is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Mediocre (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nPlay the game instead.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nAfter finishing Fate/Zero, which went on to become one of my all time favorite anime, I couldn't resist checking out the wildly popular prequel know as Fate/Stay Night; an adaptation of what many have called \"the greatest visual novel of all time\". Considering the attachment to Fate/Zero and the hype around the source material, it's only natural that I got my hopes up for this anime. Well... Whoops.\r\nThere are very few anime that I would say have managed to \"shock\" me. I am usually a relatively unflappable person. However, out of all the shows that succeeded in surprising, Fate/Stay Night is the onlyone that did so in a way that is inherently negative. I couldn't fathom how bad it was. Literally the only enjoyment I got out of this anime was due to the fact that I got to see what happens after Fate/Zero, which was an absolute masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThe Fate series is basically another \"death game\" anime. 7 \"masters\" who can use magic summon 7 \"servants\" (who are all epic heros) and fight to the death for possession of the Holy Grail; the chalice that can grant any wish. Sounds entertaining right? How can you go wrong? I'll tell you how; insultingly stupid and underdeveloped characters, a ridiculously static plot with no suspense to be found, and having antagonists that are more likable and interesting then the protagonists (ESPECIALLY if you watched Fate/Zero). That's how. I apologize for referencing Fate/Zero so often, but good god I am still in shock that the two are related to one another.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single fight in Fate/Stay night is the exact same thing: The protagonists stupidly and foolishly rush into battle without a plan, they get seriously injured, and then something miraculous happens that allows them to win. It is all so predicable and so boring. It feels like watching the same episode 24 times; no suspense or plot developments what so ever until the final few episodes, and those are only interesting if you have watched the prequel. Shirou Emiya is one of my least favorite characters of all time, and I demand that he drop \"Emiya\" from his name so as not to disgrace Kiritsugu. He is a bumbling, irritating idiot to say the least; it got to the point where I was really and truly rooting for him to fucking die (painfully). The only characters that I found interesting were the ones in Fate/Zero, and even some of those were ruined by this crappy show. I could rant all day about Shirou's cheesy speeches, painful cliches, and general unwarranted stupidity, but I think you can get a pretty good idea of what this character is like with this single quote:\\n\r\n\"People die when they are killed\"\\n\r\n-Shirou Emiya\\n\\n\r\nTruly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are thinking about watching this series, watch Fate/Zero and then wait for the 2014 Ufotable remake, because next to its prequel, Fate/Stay Night looks like a droopy-eyed, armless monkey. It is not worth watching under any circumstances. What this show did to some of the great characters in Fate/Zero physically hurt me; the only reason I give it a 4/10 is because it is a continuation of a great anime and it is therefore automatically enjoyable to a certain extent.",

            "content": "\"People die if they are killed.\" -Shiro Emiya\r\nTruer words have never been spoken, and yet, despite how obvious this truth should be, ironically so many anime violate it on a regular basis; Fate/Stay Night being no exception to the tradition. Yes, in fact one of the characters requires being killed at least a dozen times before he is truly dead. So don't make fun of Shiro guys; he really isn't stating the obvious. Quite the contrary actually, when anime tropes are concerned.\r\nAt the time of writing the latest revision to this review, there's only been a few hundred instances where a bunch of old richmen gathered together in a room and asked each other, \"How can we make like, a bizillion yen really fast?\" And before the question was even finished, someone immediately interrupted mid-sentence, \"Another Fate/ adaptation.\" Indeed, with Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero, Fate/Prototype, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, and Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, for franchise newcomers there's enough slashes to cut right through your skull and watch your brains spill out. Luckily for you, I'm here to guide you back to Kotomine Church and make sense of it all. To cut straight to the chase, Fate/Stay Night is an anime adapted from a visual novel of the same name. In this VN, there are three branching story routes that depending on which one the reader chooses can wildly alter the course of events throughout the story. This anime is (primarily) an adaptation of the first route, referred to simply as \"Fate\" respectively. At this point in the franchise's development however, things have gotten rather complicated. There are now two anime adaptations of the second route (Unlimited Blade Works), an adaptation of the prequel story (Fate/Zero), and a planned adaptation in the works for the third route (Heaven's Feel). Furthermore, all of these adaptations so far are debatably very different in tone and feel, as well as quality, so where the hell to begin in order to get the best experience out of Fate? Well you can always start with just reading the source material first, as it is the most fleshed out and comprehensive version of the story, but I'm assuming most readers of this review are anime-only watchers, in which case I will do my best to give a recommendation for what I think is the best watch order for those who have no intention of delving into the source material.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've gotten all that prefacing out of the way, it's time for more prefacing. You might be thinking that the best route would be to start with Fate/Zero, as it takes place first chronologically in the story, but you would be wrong. The thing is, Fate/Zero was written to be a prequel, and as such, it is meant to be viewed after experiencing F/SN. Watching Fate/Zero first will spoil many key events of Fate/Stay Night. It could be likened to seeing the prequel trilogy of Star Wars first; ruining the surprise of uncovering Darth Vader's identity in the later episodes. However, it's hardly the end of the world either if you do decide to watch Fate/Zero first, and despite exaggerations by the fanbase, I'd say it's OK to start with it, but I wouldn't personally recommend it for a number of reasons in addition to spoilers. Narratively, Fate/Zero feels very different from the rest of Fate/Stay Night, and its opening episodes are rather slow and exposition-heavy, so not only would it set some unrealistic expectations when you move on to the rest of the franchise, but you may not even get that far because you thought the introductory act was too damn long and drawn out, jumps all over the place between a bunch of characters, and there's way too much technical bullshit to keep track of, so you shuffled it on to your dropped list. I think it would just give a wrong first impression of what Fate is all about. On the other hand, you could start with this anime, but that still comes with its own caveats as well. While this series should technically be the entry point for newcomers, nevertheless being that this was the first adaptation of the franchise with a very limited budget, the production values have not aged well, especially when stacked against the other adaptations, which don't just have vastly superior animation; they have some of the best animation in the industry period. On top of that, the pacing and storytelling isn't quite as polished either. And yet despite all of this, I must insist that viewers at least consider watching this series first, as it does carry some pivotal plot points and standout moments that you will not be able to see in any of the other adaptations. Fate/Stay Night may have its fair share of flaws, but I think it is a series that is still enjoyable and deserving of your time. Another viable option is to watch the more recent Unlimited Blade Works TV adaptation first, as this will most likely provide you with the most polished and best entry level experience to Fate yet, but in doing so you may spoil yourself so much with its god-tier visuals and expert storytelling that I'm afraid this series may become unwatchable for you by comparison, and you won't be able to appreciate what it offers. Hence the need for all this prefacing, because ultimately it really comes down to a toss-up between F/SN and F/SN: UBW as your first viewing, as they both have consequences on how you may view and approach the franchise going forward. Personally, I would recommend at least giving this series a shot first, as it is the first anime adaptation of Fate, and technically the \"correct\" watch order if you intend to follow the same format as the VN. If you can stomach some of its more drab points, I think you'll find that the emotional payoff is worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY, THE EFFING WATCH ORDER:\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night -> Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Season 1) -> Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Movie Version) -> Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel (if you have the patience to wait for its release) -> Fate/Zero -> *BONUS* Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Season 2) -> *EXTRA BONUS* Carnival Phantasm, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, Fate/Prototype, etc. (these are all spinoff series)\\n\\n\r\n(SIDE NOTE: Personally, I found the second season of Unlimited Blade Works to be a disappointment, hence why you might notice the strange-looking order here. Start with season one and then finish with the movie, which was more true to the VN and had generally better direction and fight choreography in its final acts.)\\n\\n\r\nWell holy shit, if you got this far and realized that I still haven't even gotten to the synopsis of this anime yet, you should now have a good idea of what it feels like watching the first episode of Fate/Zero. I promise though, I'm actually going to talk about the anime now.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night follows the story of Shiro Emiya, who is an ordinary high school studen--wait a minute. Siiiiiigh. Isn't this the same as every other nauseating SoL setup? We haven't even gotten past the first sentence and you're already boring me to tears, reviewer. Well it's not my fault that the producers chose to fall back on the same old cliches again because they didn't have enough confidence in their story to try and sell it on its own merits. I didn't write the damn plot, so don't blame me. Wait, why am I arguing with myself? Erhmm, let's continue.\\n\\n\r\nSo Shiro, being your typical slice of life protagonist, goes to high school to do your typical schoolboy things. But hold on a second, there's a twist! Thank Haruhi, because I was half a centimeter away from clicking on my hentai bookmark. As it turns out, Shiro suddenly gets thrust into this super secret and dangerous conflict known as the Holy Grail War, wherein seven magi and their servants each compete for possession of the mythical Holy Grail. The Holy Grail itself apparently has a mind of its own, and it's decided that the best way to choose who is most worthy of its miracles is to have everybody kill each other. Because as we all know, might makes right, and what could possibly go wrong if a murderous sociopath obtains the power to wish for whatever he wants? Not that a person like this would have any sort of advantage in such a scenario I guess. Nope. None whatsoever. But Shiro, being our usual idealistic champion for justice, rejects violence and finds the whole thing despicable. On the other hand though, he just accidentally stumbled upon a sexy blonde chick that calls him \"Master\", and if he refuses to participate in the war then she will disappear. So Shiro naturally does what every horny high school student would do in this situation: vote with his dick. And thus, the fifth Holy Grail War commences.\\n\\n\r\nOK, so it doesn't go exactly like that, but I'm sure you can sort out the fact from fiction in my improved synopsis, which Type Moon should totally pay me for writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the first thing that really stood out to me about Fate/Stay Night was its character designs. In fact, the way I initially discovered this series was through stumbling upon some artwork of Saber online and instantly falling in love with her, which consequently prompted me to research what anime she originated from. Then I discovered Rin Tohsaka, and with me being a sucker for cute tsunderes, it didn't take any amount of time for me to warm up to her. It's really rare that I come across an anime that has not just one female character with an iconic design and a personality that is straight up waifu material, but two. Then the awesome characters just keep piling on, like the pretentious badass that is Archer, who is also the character that coined the term \"gar\" just for being such a manly stud. There is simply no shortage of fantastic characters in this anime. Though many of them may appear to be stock archetypes at first, when more of their backstories are elaborated upon we get to see that they are more complex than meets the eye. Although, for some characters you may need to read the visual novel to really see the full depth of the character, which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nNot all fares well with FSN's characters. Some of the magi participating in the war don't get as much character development or focus as they should, such as Illyasviel von Einzbern who commands the servant Berserker. Furthermore, Shiro's unwavering dedication to his ideals can often lead him to making incomprehensibly stupid decisions. He is overprotective of his servant despite that Saber is perfectly capable of defending herself. In fact, it is the sole purpose of her summoning in the first place that she is supposed to fight for him, yet Shiro continually denies her the chance at every opportunity, as well as foolishly runs into the fray, which usually results in him getting severely injured because he is grossly outmatched against a battle-hardened heroic spirit. This can too often leave the viewer with the impression that Shiro is annoying and ignorant, but at the same time it is this exact trait about Shiro that provides for some of the more interesting conflicts of the series. Ironically both Shiro and Saber are so dedicated to their ideals that even though they share the same beliefs, they often cannot get along with each other. The fact that they are so determined to uphold these ideals to the point of tragedy makes for many intriguing situations throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason that some of the previously mentioned characters don't receive as much attention as they should is due to some prolific narrative problems throughout the anime. Namely, it spends a considerable amount of time just having the characters indulge in silly antics at Shiro's house or sitting around sipping tea while listening to tedious lectures from Tohsaka. I'm sorry Rin. I love you, and imma let you finish, but you aren't the greatest mage of all-time. Oops, did I strike a nerve? Who am I to second-guess your magical prowess I suppose. Just keep condescending to Shiro then; what with your incomplete summon of a heroic spirit that can't even remember his past, while Shiro in his amateur ways managed to summon forth a more powerful servant than you. But I digress. The point is, like my irrelevant tangent that I just finished rambling off, Fate/Stay Night's themes struggle to remain consistent at times, as it can't seem to figure out whether it wants to be a typical comedic slice of life or an epic dark fantasy tale. Couple this with its painfully slow pacing at times, and the story overall takes a huge hit due to these flaws. There really is no excuse for all these pointless and slow moments because there is so much interesting backstory from the source material that they could have otherwise drawn from. Whereas the visual novel elaborates on the summoning of Illyasviel's servant and reveals how she is able to control such a seemingly unruly heroic spirit like Berserker, the anime will in contrast waste an entire episode having Shiro and Rin repetitiously track down and dispel some sigils throughout the school, or hold a silly mock duel between Saber and Shiro's teacher, Taiga. Nearly every other episode feels like it needs to take a break from the grail war and go on vacation at Shiro's house when it should have kept the momentum moving along at a steady pace instead. Many of these types of scenes could have been trimmed in length or removed entirely in order to make way for some more important plot points that got left out.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of these problems, Fate/Stay Night's story never really crosses the line into being unequivocally bad. Even the more juvenile moments at Shiro's house are at least entertaining on a superficial level for their humor, as well as minimally offer up some small amount of character development between the anime's two main protagonists, Shiro and Saber. What really sets FSN's story apart from what could have been a typical shounen series is that even though it starts out in your standard and cliche high school setting, it quickly moves away from that and takes a decidedly darker and more philosophical tone throughout the rest of the series, delving into Saber's tragic past when she was still a mortal human being, as well as exploring Shiro's stubborn determination to uphold his ideals even in the face of impossible odds. The struggles and tragic romance that these two characters go through culminate in a very emotionally fulfilling and bitter-sweet ending that will likely leave a lasting impression on you. The evolution of the main protagonists in this series is very thoroughly developed, and arguably one of the most satisfying aspects about this anime. Furthermore, the extended cast of characters and other magi get a decent amount of screentime too, and watching all the servants slowly reveal their secret abilities and identities during the course of the various battles is entertaining to see unfold. Overall, the narrative has a refreshingly dark and mysterious tone to it throughout, which keeps the viewer intrigued and always eager to uncover more of the Holy Grail War's secrets.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime is based on a rather lengthy 50-hour visual novel with three major branching story arcs, it was inevitable that some cuts and alterations to the story had to be made to fit the anime's 9-hour long runtime. Studio DEEN opted to borrow some plot points from the two secondary routes (Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel respectively) while mostly sticking to the Fate route, which was the main route of the VN. Some of the alterations worked well, others were questionable. Chances are though if you haven't read the visual novel going into this, you're probably not going to notice anything particularly strange anyway, aside from a few minor plot points that don't get fully explained like they should. Nonetheless, this hasn't stopped the fanbase from thoroughly panning the series for taking the liberties that it did, but I think it's important to judge works on their own merits independent of whether they follow their source material, and while I would agree that the anime doesn't live up to the quality of the visual novel, it is still an enjoyable series for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation, Fate/Stay Night is overall slightly above average for its time, though not truly great either. It has its noteworthy moments such as the duel between Saber and Assassin, which showed some pretty slick-looking and fast-paced swordplay. On the other hand, in the very same episode during another fight, we are treated to a high-detail close-up of Saber dashing forward followed by a jarringly low detail animation of her slicing away at some skeletons. There is an occasional inconsistency to the quality of the animation that can be disappointing at times, and then there was the perplexing decision to animate an awkward-looking CGI dragon at one point that would have been best left out. Regardless, it works more often than it doesn't, and the artwork effectively creates the dark atmosphere that the anime aims for. This is further complemented and enhanced by the music composed by Kenji Kawai, who I am a major fan of from listening to his other work in Gundam 00. The opening intro is accompanied by a remixed version of the song \"This Illusion\" from the opening of the visual novel, which sounds really good, and the animation flows very nicely with the music. This goes for the second opening too, which was very well-animated and accompanied with a quality hard rock-themed arrangement. It's just unfortunate that the animation quality for the series as a whole rarely approaches that of its opening segments.\\n\\n\r\nFor the English dub, the voices for the most part fit all of the characters very well, with Sam Riegel as Shiro, Kate Higgins as Saber, and Mela Lee as Rin. Kate Higgins in particular did an excellent job portraying Saber's voice with a sense of authority and stoicism befitting to her character while tempering it effectively with a more feminine and vulnerable side when the scenes called for it. Unfortunately though, all future iterations of the Fate universe never see Kate return as Saber, as the Unlimited Blade Works movie instead cast Michelle Ruff, and yet again she changed voices in Fate/Zero with Kari Wahlgren, which is a shame because Kate really is the definitive voice of Saber as far as the English version is concerned. Mela Lee's voice brings out Rin's haughty attitude quite well, though occasionally she could sound a little stiff. Liam O'Brien plays Archer and likewise delivers an impeccable portrayal of the pompous badass. Other notable performances include Stephanie Sheh as Illyasviel, who strikes a perfect balance between cute and creepy as her character is intended to be, as well as Jamieson Price as Kirei Kotomine, whose deep and somber voice is absolutely perfect for Kirei's cold and gloomy presence. I could go on, as there are plenty more veteran actors that make appearances in this series, but needless to say the English voice cast is all in all one of the better ensembles I've had the pleasure of listening to in anime. Due to a number of odd casting decisions in later installments of the Fate franchise though, some may want to opt for the subtitled version instead if you don't want to deal with continually changing voice actors. Just a fair warning.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Fate/Stay Night gets a lot of things right, but as emotionally satisfying as I felt the anime's conclusion was, I couldn't help having a pervasive feeling that in the hands of the right artists it still could have been so much more. With a story and characters as rich as the Fate universe, this series could have easily reached legendary status as a true masterpiece if it just had the proper budget and capable studio to do it justice. Due to a bevy of pacing and consistency issues with FSN's narrative and animation however, it just doesn't quite reach greatness. However, even a mediocre attempt at adapting superb source material still rounds out to be above average overall, so if you're looking for a good entry point into the Fate universe, Fate/Stay Night is a perfectly acceptable place to start.",

            "content": "This is less of a comprehensive review of the series and more of a reaction to what I saw. The reason here is that I haven't finished Fate/Stay Night. I couldn't finish Fate/Stay Night. My body physically rejected this anime halfway through episode 12, causing fever symptoms. As such, halfway through episode 12 is all I will be able to cover. \r\nThe story might have been interesting, had it been presented pretty much any other way. The Holy Grail War sounds like it could be a good concept, and probably is a good concept in Fate/Zero, which I will attempt to watch as soon asI get over the whole Worm Crest thing. That concept makes my stomach churn. Anyway, there's not much more I can say about the plot. The show moves so slowly that I really didn't get around to much of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound both left no impression on me whatsoever. If I were to hear a track from Fate/Stay Night, I would not be able to recognize which anime it came from. The art was similarly uninteresting. It might have been good if I had been able to muster the willpower to pay attention to it. Still, considering the main character has a total of two outfits, it can't have been all that impressive. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the most appalling part of this anime. I'll start with the main character: \\n\\n\r\nShirou is the worst. He is an idiot, thinking that he is capable of fighting superpowered servants with a lead pipe. He is arrogant for the same reason. He is sexist because he orders his own superpowered servant to sit at home and let him fight just because she's a girl. Lastly, he's a disgrace as a mage. The fact that he is Saber's master means she's incredibly weak and doesn't get the mana she needs to continue existing. Shirou doesn't seem to be willing to make compromises; everything has to be exactly how he wants it, and he just sort of expects the universe to comply. Fortunately for him, his plot armor is so thick that it does. \\n\\n\r\nSaber isn't much better. She is basically a robot, with the only \"character development\" stemming from her own backstory. I have heard that she gets a personality later on, but waiting over 12 episodes for one of the main characters to act like an actual character is insane. She also looks stupid fighting with the invisible sword. I understand that they have to conceal their identities and revealing what her sword looks like would give it away, and I'm aware of the benefits to not allowing your enemy to see your weapon until they have already been cut, but the anime just makes it look so stupid, as if she's playing with an imaginary weapon. \\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka isn't the worst character in an anime, that honor goes to Shirou, but her motivations are questionable. She has no good reason to team up with Shirou. Additionally, she has been a Mary Sue for all of what I've been able to sit through. She knows how magic works, she knows Shirou's magical potential, she has a magical gem that can open his magic circuits, and she doesn't respond negatively to summoning the wrong servant. She just offhandedly mentions that she wanted Saber but she's fine with Archer.\\n\\n\r\nSakura has exactly one dimension to her character. She likes Shirou. That is 100% of her character up until episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nTaiga is at least entertaining. She is also the last of the characters whose names I remember. Taiga is the character that's supposed to breathe a breath of fun into a dark and serious anime, but she never seems to show up. If Taiga had been utilized better, this show might be watchable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 1. Shirou is infuriating, it's like watching a dog get fooled by its owner pretending to throw a ball over and over again. At first it's entertaining, but then you just wonder \"why hasn't he learned yet?\" Additionally, the fight scenes last a few minutes at most, followed by several episodes of people standing around and talking. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my overall score is a 1. If you manage to eke out any enjoyment from this pile of garbage, then I envy you. If you're considering trying it out, then by all means go ahead. Other people seem to like it, so maybe there are redeemable features that I don't understand, but don't feel the need to finish Fate/Stay Night just because Fate/Zero exists. It's not worth it. I was trying to watch Fate/Stay Night because I knew that if I watched Fate/Zero first, I would never be able to get through Stay Night. As it turns out, I can't get through it regardless. If nothing else, maybe you can try it out and see just what it is about this show that caused me to give all three of my roommates a lesson on anime just to fully convey how terrible this show is.",

I promise you will be entertained and informed of this series with no spoilers! Well? What'chu waiting for?\r\nStory-4/10\r\nBefore i start, i just want to say that apparently this series is demographized as a Seinen anime, but the way that this anime was made is barely border-line shounen. If not for the violence, i could give this to little kids to watch...\r\nWhat irks me the most is that this anime is all over the place, yes, the seriesdoes span out in a fairly linear fashion, and yes, there is a fairly noticeable central theme; but none of it actually seems to make any sense. Although the series had an pre-determined ending, the actual content of the series was outright shallow and disappointing. The main character was utterly clue-less and retarded throughout the entire series, but the other character's personality seemed to change every episode (whats up with that?) This had made it terribly difficult for me to even gather any sympathy for the characters. The lack of story-driven plot, and any signs of character development had removed my little spark of interest in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic idea of this anime revolves around the \"Holy Grail.\" This grail materializes itself every few years in order to grant ones wish. Seven world champions are bound with seven humans for a fight to the death, only the last to survive is worthy of making a request for a wish. Survival of the fittest concept is actually appealing for me, which encouraged me to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is mostly devoted to fighting; which ironically made it more boring for me, as it was just the same sword-swing and trash talking over and over again, it seems like the creators just throws in a few fight scenes just to fill up time on each episode. Just like how everybody predicts, introduction of new side characters are just punching bags for the mc Shirou and Saber, there are no plot twists as saber always seem of emerge victorious. Generally, after a few slashes of saber's sword, the new characters disappears faster than they were even introduced.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7.5/10\\n\r\nThe art was not bad at all, considering the time in which the anime was made. The animation was fairly smooth, and Saber's character design was pretty cool, this made watching the 24 episodes much more bearable.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9.9/10\\n\r\nI don't really see any flaws in the sound track and voice acting as i don't care about this section that much. 9.9 because nothing is perfect :p\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, i hated the male protagonist, as his ignorance makes me want to vomit. He cannot seem to realize that he, Shirou, has summoned one of the most powerful hero to fight by his side. Being totally oblivious to the fact that Saber, who wears plate armor and holds a legendary sword, Shirou is going to protect everybody! His stupidity has no bounds, even as a teenager; but anime women dig stupidity i guess, with a spot of harem here and there.\\n\r\nThe side characters were not all that interesting, as they all fight similarly, to be destroyed by Saber in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6.5/10\\n\r\nThis was a ok anime, due to my love for Saber. A similar comparison can be the HellSing series; where a single bad-ass character made me give the series a higher score than what i should have. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night Review \r\nThere are no spoilers in this review. \r\nFate/Stay Night I had some mixed feelings coming into it. I've heard of it's bad reputation many times, but I was a Fate/Stay Night fan (Via the Visual Novel) before watching it. \r\nI already knew the story and characters so I had hope that it wouldn't disappoint. I am both happy and annoyed at how it turned out. But overall I was happy on how it turned out and I cried at the ending just like I did in the Visual Novel. \r\nStory \r\nThe anime series follows the events of the Fate route of theVisual Novel. Now it's important to note that the Fate route was meant to be the training route of the Visual Novel and it wasn't the main event and it certainly wasn't my favourite of the three. But it was the one that did move me the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe story panned out much as predicted being I already knew it but their were things that annoyed me about how it was executed. First thing allot of the small details where a bit messed up and where not how they were in the Visual Novel. Such as Sakura didn't always cook, and she didn't always cook alone, when she was at Shirou's house. This is a small thing but it was an important detail to me. It just needed to follow the visual novel better. \\n\\n\r\nMy main other annoyances was the fact that important finale scenes from Heavens Feel and other important scenes from Unlimited Blade Works [The other routes in the Visual Novel] where integrated into important points in the story. I think it was a foolish action to do this and it did take away from the real story of Fate a fair bit and if an anime adaptation of Heavens Feel was ever to be made, these scenes would probably ruin it for those who watched this anime before watching the Heavens Feel adaptation or playing the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nBut I do have to say that they followed the path of the Fate route well in all other areas staying pretty true to the story. It most definitely could have been executed allot better and more closely to the visual novel and should have. But I do give props for how the ending and epilogue where handled. Even though I knew how it was going to turn out it managed to make me cry again. This meant that I finished the series on a high note and enjoyed it greatly despite some of the flaws of it. \\n\\n\r\nI think that this anime deserves a reboot to take it to it's full potential as it hasn't reached it yet. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nI think that the biggest flaw in the anime was the tech side. The animation was good for the time it was made, but I've seen better. That being said the action scenes where quite good and it was good to see some battle scenes play out that we didn't in the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest disappointment was the sound effects. They where bad and dated. I've seen much older anime with a better sound effect set and I think if they used the ones from the Visual Novel it would have sounded better. \\n\\n\r\nThey seemed fond of using the sound of a blaster deflecting off a lightsaber as the sound for jumping and deflection. The OST was average but suited the scenes well. But both of these points I think are effected mainly by the time period in which they where made, more so than negligence by the makers to be fair. I didn't like that they changed songs for the intros someway through the series. The second one was just unfitting and bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was a bit worse than expected. I honestly think the art quality from the Visual Novels animated intro was better. But again this is a point due to the time it was made. I think this anime suffered so much by being made when it was made. I think this is another important factor why this anime needs a remake. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe characters in this where handled pretty well. They stayed true to the visual novel very well. Of course I loved all the historical characters as I do have an interest in such things. One thing is they did lack the in-depth look that the visual novel format offered of them so people who haven't read it do lack out a bit on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI did decide to watch the anime in the English dub after much thought. As I had already heard the Japanese voices allot I was used to them and they sounded better. But in the end I decided to go with the English Dub anyway. I have to say you should probably go with the Japanese voices with English subs if you watch it. They suit the characters personalities better and English Gilgamesh was a joke. Kotomine's English voice actor was good though. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nThere are allot of positives and negatives about this anime. The anime failed to match up to the standards set by the Visual Novel. It's mixing of the different story lines, the execution of the details and the tech side of things where the biggest down points of the show and did take away from the feel of the story how it should be. \\n\\n\r\nBut this format did have advantages of the visual novel and the action was allot better and more involved than the visual novel. My thoughts are that you should read the Fate route of the visual novel before watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou will enjoy it allot more than people new to the Fate/ franchise do. Enjoying the story in the Visual Novel format will allow you to enjoy the story more in the Anime format and playing or watching either is critical to do before watching Fate/Zero the recent prequel anime to the events of Fate/Stay Night. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Fate/Stay Night was a positive experience for me. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 7/10",

            "content": "I quite enjoyed this series. For anyone that knows me, I am usually very brutal in Reviewing anime and very specific when I praise an anime. This one rightfully deserves praise.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story somewhat reminds me of .hack//SIGN because it can get confusing if you don't pay close attention and if you don't do your research. The plot in the beginning is very basic... that goes through the first couple of episodes... then you arrive to a rival: Rider. From then on, the plot gets more and more interesting, and it makes it so that you want to keep on watching. I know I washitting myself near the last couple of certain people... I will not go on much more about that because then it would ruin the ending... speaking of which... the ending reminded me of Chrno Crusade to a point. The ending that is sort of foreshadowed does come to pass. I'm not sure if I liked or disliked the ending at this point in time. What I do recommend is re-watch the anime from beginning to end after you've gone on Wikipedia to learn more about the characters. It makes a lot of things much clearer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI liked the art and the character design very much. Some of the fighting scenes, however, did not apease me very much (Archer vs. Beserker for example). Besides some of the fighting scenes, it was pretty enjoyable... and I wish the artists would have stayed with one eye style per character...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound quality was very good. It also pleased me that the English (Dubbed) version did not change any of the background music. I enjoyed the Opennings very much, especially the second one. I did not like the first or last endings. However, I did enjoy the end song of the episode Archer vs. Beserker.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perfect 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the Character Development and the characters overall. They acted like real people, and they had those human quirks that you see in real people. Even though some characters are overexaggerated, Taiga for example, they make the anime more interesting. I especially enjoyed how some of the characters actually grew... if anyone knows what I mean. I see no overshowing flaws in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Perfect 10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime. It was suspenceful with a lot of action while at times is was light and comical. I am in the process of re-watching the later episodes so I understand everything clearly, but I have no problem in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere are few flaws that I saw, and I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who is willing to watch it.",

The main character irrates me so much. He acts like he's so strong and he can protect everyone but he's really weak and doesn't use his brain a lot and he's really ugly(In my opinon) He get's a little stronger but not much. Most of the characters seem to only have 1 move they use over and over in a fight. It can get pretty annoying after someone uses this 1 move like 10 times in a fight. The art isnice. I have to say that the plot was nice but how it was led out ruined it. There wasn't a nice development in the story.",

            "content": "Just finished this show a couple of moments ago, the hype I got before watching this was IMENSE, but after sitting trough it all I can definitely see where it comes from... for the better and the worse.\r\nI will refrain myself from commenting on the show before I give my view on specific issues. I will try my best to refrain myself from spoilers, but rest assured, some will exist SO if you didn`t watch it yet you are better jumping straight to my conclusion.\r\n---------------------\r\nAnimation\r\n---------------------\r\nIn simple words it\u2019s GORGEOUS. If you take into account it\u2019s from 2006 it gets even better, surely nothing that yearcan get remotely close to it, and even for today standard\u2019s it is top notch, specially on the color pallet department.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds, the CGI, the still animations, the fight sequences... everything clicks beautifully, but what really shines are the character designs and the color employed on the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely worth HD (I got the THORA release) and I wouldn`t settle for anything lower then 720p, it really deserves it.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nI`ve tried my best to find issues with the sound, but to put it simple it\u2019s not bad at all!\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are catchy in their own merits and somewhat memorable. They do come off occasionally on the wrong scenes but for the most of the time they are spot on.\\n\\n\r\nAside the soundtrack, the sound effects are also ok and fit the scenes they take part into.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also pretty well done, and I would like to add a special note that the English and German segments are amongst the best I have ever seen in an anime (as cheesy as they might be).\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nThis show reeks ambition so much it ended up being smacked down by the usual budget / time frame reality, and this is the part where we feel it the worse.\\n\\n\r\nMore than once I felt like I needed a manual to watch the show and it wasn`t included. Terms they use all the time never get explained and this gets in the way of understanding stuff every now and then, it\u2019s quite annoying and you have to put up some effort to understand stuff based solo on the sentence context.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc`s are well staged, but again the lack of proper treating and over ambitious director leave us with some problems. It is aggravating that some important stuff that happens later on have to rely on quick flashbacks to pack any meaning and even then the results are quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nThis gets the most aggravating when we deal with relationships between characters, but I will write about that on the latter topic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is nice and has a tremendous amount of care to it, sadly the director didn`t have time to fulfill all he had in mind and it suffers a lot from it. If I had to pinpoint what areas suffered more I would have to say the romance. The action can carry itself pretty well due to the beautiful visuals and the drama focus on the \u201csacrifice\u201d aspect most shounens drag from so no biggie, but the romantic relationships between Shirou and Saber are awkward to say the least, and his relation with Rin and Sakura are simply \u201cdeleted\u201d from the plot halfway through for no apparent reason!\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nAll the characters are well made. They all have distinct traits, they all have particular looks, they all have background, objective and dept, but the problem is most of the time this is all crammed up so much it end up not living to the expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on in this subject for hours, but instead of pointing out how obviously Saber lack proper introduction about her past, or how Shirou desperately needed some more development and diversity or even how some characters like Sakura disappear from the plot after a few episodes (and we actually miss the continuation) I will just use my favorite character as an example, Rin.\\n\\n\r\nRin is an astonishing character that actually carry the show trough its worse moments all by herself, but the lack of episodes this show is plagued with (it deserved at least another season) makes some of her most interesting aspects lack and most of her relationships with other characters underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does she care so much about Sakura? Is the preach a fatherly figure to her? Does she love Shirou? I really wish all these aspects where developed, but instead they throw a few flashbacks and rush everything out to the point they don`t make the slightest sense and hurt the otherwise REALLY cool character she is.\\n\\n\r\nEven her relationship with archer is crammed up to the point he barely shows his face and 5 episodes latter they kill him and we are supposed to care?! And that is another major issue, the servants have NO development AT ALL so all the cool traits they own are wasted since we don`t know who they are, why they fight for or even their origin... we don`t even get introductions to them it\u2019s just sad.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment & Conclusion\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nFrom the moment the show start to the end its quite clear the director set the standard on the stratosphere but sadly got smacked down by reality mid way through it. Either lack of budget, lack of time or both the fact is, most of the show builds such a tremendous hype around itself and sadly don\u2019t live up to it leaving many shortcomings by the end.\\n\\n\r\nI do however congratulate the director for taking the hard route and abiding itself for making a complete show instead of a \u201cfirst part\u201d that would never seen an end. Still, it hurts to see so much potential being left untouched.\\n\\n\r\nI would say this show is really worth for people that like the genre, this IS a shounen after all, and even though it have many qualities that deviate from the standard and make it different, the typical affair is all here\u2026 like people never EVER getting killed, the main weak protagonist with untapped potential and the usual good = good | bad = bad ordeal where every good guy is a saint and every bad guy have snake eyes, do rough voices and have a satanic smile\u2026 so it does tick all the boxes for the standard show.\\n\\n\r\nNow for other people that are not all that into shounen, I would still highly recommend this but with a warning, you WILL get disappointed. This anime was destined to be a masterpiece but it faced shortcomings that hindered expectations in every possible way. This would\u2019ve been bad on a regular show, but the amount of greatness this anime reeks is unparalleled and this just make it all the bitter.",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is a bit of a sore spot for me. It's the first time I ever sat down, giddy to watch a certain series and came away scratching my head thinking \"this is what all the commotion was about?\" But in all fairness, Fate/Stay Night is not a terrible anime, just a very overrated one.\r\nThe story takes place in modern-day Japan, revolving around a boy named Shirou Emiya and has reluctant participation in a city-wide battle royale known as the Holy Grail War. While this sounds like a shounen set-up, Fate is rather talkative. Scratch that, Fate is way too talkative for its owngood. Boring and pointless conversations about ideals and the ethics of battle get put up front in the first half and the action the premise attempts to indicate is shoved to the background. Fortunately for those of you who turned in for the super-powered free-for-alls, you won't be disappointed too much. There are a handful of extravagant fights, but only a handful.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half does its best to reward patient viewers with impressive revelations, some good twists, and an amped-up focus on the war rather than on whether its okay to fight in the war. Unfortunately in its quest to make up for all it wasted early on, Fate ultimately burns out and fizzles through the last few episodes, which unfortunately are constructed to make us think this is some kind of grand climax.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast runs the gamut from expendable to enjoyable. Those who watch will surely take not of complacent victim-turned-mage Shirou who does nothing but whine and whine and whine some more for 12 episodes. This is not a biased complaint. He really does complain about his situation that much. He does grow past this, but not enough to prove he's entirely past that part of himself. His servant, Saber, is hardly any better. The silent type for the majority of the series, she does not provide much for conflict or relationships. She's there and she occasionally fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe real stars though have to be Rin and Archer. Rin originally serves as an antagonist to Shirou and her blatantly in-your-face personality and no-nonsense attitude gives this series a much needed and appreciated shot of energy. More so, she's one of the more interesting characters, especially when her past is later called into question. Her servant, Archer, is mostly famous for one particular episode, but the episode demonstrates enough of his ability and a revelation about his identity which enables the series to be seen from a second parallel perspective. If it weren't for them, I'd probably have dropped this a few eps in.\\n\\n\r\nArt is often heavy-handed, especially with uses of light and shadow. Both are incredibly exaggerated at all times, often for dramatic purposes, but it only serves to annoy and makes the series look cheaper than it should. The series often cuts corners with long scenery pans, especially in the first part of the series. Fight scenes that aren't interrupted often show where the animation budget went for the series. They're extravagant and jaw-dropping, but only a minute or two each and then the energy drops off once more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs stay true to the game, inventive and hinting at future revelations. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into them and it shows in spades.\\n\\n\r\nSound had a few bright points, but it was often unmemorable. Voice work was standard, and the theme music was just below great.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, Fate/Stay Night left me wondering what all the commotion was about. It's a very uneven series that shows rays of hope often, but never capitalizes on any of their finer moments. Even more irritating, it never expands on revelations and expects you to go play the game if you want the full story. It's a 24 episode series with an animation budget for 12 episodes and a story that could have been 39 episodes long. You do the math.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Fate/Stay Night a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "This has to be one of the best animes I have seen a while. This review may come out a bit biased as I just finished the series and remain blown away by it. Fate/Stay Night (F/SN) is a seinen about a magical war between 7 magi and their powerful servants who were great heroes and demigods from across time. The Heroes are all mythological figures which give background to their motivation although only the main character\\'s servant is ever fully explored. The story lacks in that regard but can be easily supplemented through wikipedia. The message of the story was clear by the endand even though the ending is a bit tragic, it leaves you feeling content. (Although at the time of this review I\\'m feeling a bit of depression at its ending. I was so enthralled by F/SN that I watched it in a relatively short period of time.) The animation fits the premise. The premise resembles that of a shounen. Magicians summoning warriors of different classes reminds oneself of pokemon, digimon, shaman king but unlike those child friendly examples death occurs in the series, servants albeit not a true corporeal form shed blood and are injured similiar to the master\\'s themselves. Nudity is shown although not explicitly so (subject to opinion.) The servant themselves are not the typical mindless machinations or friendly buddies. Servants only serve their master because they have a common goal, to win the Holy Grail. It looks like a typical shounen epic except I never noticed any of the mistakes that comes with cutting corners. With the short ratio of boys to girls, one can mistake some scenes for a harem comedy but this may be a result of F/SN\\'s roots as an ero-type game. Except for a very few instances, nudity or scantily clad attire is practically non-existent and do not adversely affect the plot. I enjoyed the music, j-pop/rock, and none the seiyu were out of place in the sub. I couldn\\'t give this a perfect on character design because there were times when the actions of a character felt unjustified in the way it was portrayed but it may have been because they were fitting a much larger story into a small 24 episode series. So the character design in the anime leaves you with questions but they\\'re easily answered thanks to the background of the series. As mentioned before I was enthralled by this series and enjoyed it so much I blew through it. I\\'ll end up buying it when I have the time to watch it again and I recommend this title to those who like action, romance and a little meaning. Also take it down a notch if you dislike blood and pig-headed heroes.",

            "content": "In an earlier review, Bluesnow talked about how despite being a good anime, F/SN has a tradition of being overrated. I pretty much agree with this sentiment. This is a good anime, but it definitely has plenty of areas that could be improved. \r\nThe plot of this series, is to be honest, pretty horrible. It's extremely linear, it's pretty boring, and there isn't really very much in terms of plot twists or suspense. And what little they had, which was more towards the end of the series, was executed rather badly with bad pacing and ass pulls galore. In mitigation, this was likely caused bythe developers buckling under the twin strains of running out of budget and having to merge the three different scenarios from the visual novel together. However, it's still bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of the series lies, frankly, outside. The backstory, the concepts dealt with, the underlying metaplot, the thoughts provoked - fantastic is an understatement. Sadly, in order to be able to enjoy this, reading the Visual Novel is a must. The anime simply did not have enough time to cram in all of the information, resulting in a jumbled mess.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this series lay in the characters. Every single character positively exudes personality - from just hearing one line, you can basically pinpoint which character it is from. However, this is coming after I've read the Visual Novel, and also all the associated mythologies of the characters. If just watching the anime itself with no prior knowledge, the Servants can be a bit... one-sided. The thing you have to remember is that you're *supposed* to know the characters beforehand, and that the development present is an expansion on preexisting perceptions of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's one exception to the strong characterization - the main character. Given that this was an adaptation from an eroge (hardly a medium known for strong main characters), you wouldn't really expect much of Shirou. However, Shirou does not possess the usual blank self-insert personality typical of eroge protagonists. Quite the opposite, in fact. He has an extremely strong personality, and it's grating to the extreme. There are plenty of times where you wish you could just slap the damn child out of him, and unfortunately, the scenario where that *does* happen was not animated. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality was extremely well done, with a clean art style that's extremely refreshing, and well animated fight sequences. Sadly, this tended to suffer near the end of the series as the animators ran out of budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound is a non-sequitter. Nothing really stands out, nothing's really bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Fate/Stay Night has a marvelous backstory, beautiful characters, and a mediocre plot. In trying to shake things up from the Visual Novel, the director appears to have set too high a bar for himself to attain, running beyond the limits of himself and the budget. While the animated medium makes for a much better flow of story than the Visual Novel, which had shaking pacing at best, in the end it fell prey to the pitfall of no money.",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is a fabulous Romantic, Action, Adventure that will leave you amazed by the beautiful visuals and interesting fights. Just don't let the main character annoy you too much, as he did with me. ^_^\r\nAfter watching just the first 3 episode you basically learned the main plot of this anime, which was the Holy Grail War and also learned how similar this anime was with others; having the same little annoyances. I personally was annoyed with the whole &ldquo;my parents are dead&rdquo; and I just wanted this show to be different with the parents&rsquo; still alive at least. But most of all I wasannoyed by how weak and pathetic yet lucky Shirou was, which just seemed unoriginal. What made it worse was how arrogant Shirou was and how he always wanted to fight his own battles, even though his Servant could do a much better job at it. Nevertheless I didn&rsquo;t allow these annoyances to get in the way of this great show and if you do the same you may enjoy it too.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is an Action/Adventure with elements of both Romance and Comedy, however unlike most of this genre the romance is played down that even I found it difficult to tell who Shirou would end up with. This was one of the things that helped save the show from a bad score and another was the great character developments that occurred in the story. As the story went on, even though it seemed hard to believe from the beginning but Shirou greatly improved as a Master and became lass annoying to watch. He even had some pretty interesting fights although the bulk of the fights were fought by Saber. The fights were great to watch adding a decent amount of action to the show. On the other hand some fights had a lacklustre feel it them, so if your used to being glued to the screen from a spectacular battle don&rsquo;t count on that happening here often, however there&rsquo;s at least some interesting fights.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I like in my anime is something that was missing in this show, a decent plot twist, but this is just my opinion. If you don&rsquo;t mind it sticking to one storyline all the way through to the end, then there&rsquo;s no chance in you being disappointed with the story you&rsquo;ve got.\\n\\n\r\nApart from Shirou the rest of the characters were OK with decent personalities but most of them weren&rsquo;t developed well enough. Usually all you&rsquo;re given is a few hazy moments and flashbacks of a characters past and forced to work out what&rsquo;s going on by yourself. Well at least the characters were well-drawn though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality for Fate/Stay Night was lavish with some of the best used light and shadow effects I&rsquo;ve seen in a while. Even though that may sound pointless, in this anime it was significantly noticeable. The music was decent but it could have been a lot better if it used some other track from the Fate/Stay Night soundtrack. Yet the music wasn&rsquo;t much of a big deal in this anime and it was only near the end that the music really made a difference.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, this anime did a great job of mixing romance and action without making either one of them overbearing, although it could of done without the comedy. Even though the comedy was used to lighten the mood at times in this show, I didn&rsquo;t feel it was needed. The fights were interesting but it could have done with the charged up yelling and screaming, mostly from Saber. I was very pleased with the ending, because it wasn&rsquo;t too sad and it wasn&rsquo;t cheesy, but it did leave me a little confused yet I was sure it had ended. Even up until the end there was still something I didn&rsquo;t like about the character Shirou and it had to do with the Japanese voice actor that I and most &ldquo;Naruto&rdquo; fansub watchers will notice pretty quickly as well. So try not to let this spoil the show for you because this was an remarkable anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

I don't understand the rave reviews on this site because honestly, the story was pathetically predictable as were the characters who just made you want to choke yourself.\r\nIf you enjoy boring series in which you can guess the dialog line for line since the characters are COMPLETELY one dimensional by all means pick up this series.  Another perk is that you get to enjoy watching the stories of legends like King Arthur, Gilgamesh and Musashi get completely raped.  The writers spit on these time honored taleswithout any respect at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe subpar and utterly predictable action really disappointed as well since the pitiful romance subplots felt like a wet blanket over the whole series.  At times there would be two fights simultaneously following the exact same path so that you got to be right about guessing what happens twice in a row.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this &quot;PG under 13&quot; because I really believe anyone with any semblance of maturity will throw up at the simplicity and utter frustrating predictability of this anime.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night is definitely a great anime, but it lack some \"chemistry\" that makes it a masterpiece level of work. That is not to say the anime is bad in any way, in fact it is a total success in my opinion. But nonetheless, I will be making comparisons with other similar themed anime as the review proceeds. \r\nI will not go through repeating what has been said in the other reviews already. However, I want to make 2 points clear as to why I find it not as great as many claim it to be (ultimately it is these 2 points that made megive the story an 8/10).\\n\\n\r\n1. The lack of information about most servants' past. That includes Saber as well. I am basing this on just the anime alone (so if the visual novel or manga has a more detailed coverage about these, I don't care). I find the story a little rushed trying to cover the main plot and somewhat \"hint\" to us regarding certain characters past. As a result, a lot of information I want to know were not presented in the anime (but rather in the game).\\n\\n\r\n2. I consider myself to be a rather \"emo\" person (I cried for the 2nd half of Mai HiME for example). But there weren't much \"moving\" scenes in this anime that make me either laugh too hard or cry too hard. There may be surprises occasionally, but that was it. Though at the same time the plot was interesting enough for me to keep watching episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key issue about the anime are the characters. Though there are decent character developments throughout the story, the lack of information presented at the end regarding the primary characters' future kind of left it like a dangling string. Some people might like it that way, but I don't. Certainly not how they decided to end Saber's past at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find it quite enjoyable (kept me glued to the computer long enough for me to finish the anime in 2.5 days), but it just lack some \"hard-to-forget\" scenes.",

            "content": "This anime is considered by many fans as the best anime of 2006; while it is a good anime its popularity is often over hyped and most ignored the major flaws of the series that kept it from being a masterpiece. \r\nThe basic plot is about Shirou; a high School boy with a very righteous kind heart but has a weak character and knows little magic. By fate he falls into an epic battle over the holy grail taking on the powerful Hero Summon \"Saber\" as his servant. The Servants do battle with one another till only one is left then taking the Holy grailto make a wish, but this battle devastates Shirou's life and opens up the secrets to traumatic events that happened in his past. The plot primarily is action/shounen/Drama... They attempt some Romance as well~ but its a little awkward.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is one of the main flaws of this series; it becomes clear very early that this anime is based off of a &quot;Visual Novel&quot; due to its linear plot~ the goal is known right away and the development is predictable. There are some shocking moments towards the end, but that doesn't make up for the rest. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most stifling thing about the story is it hints about Saber's and other's pasts... but in never divulged any information. While sometimes its excusable to keep a mysterious story, in the case of this anime it felt vital to the plot, and rather than add to the mood of urgency it felt more like they were trying to rush parts of the series far too much... much of the events make no sense unless you play the visual novels or look up the background info online.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the good side the plot is fast enough to enjoy after the first few episodes, Has alot of interesting battles and antagonists, and has an interesting back story if you watch untill the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is ok; the characters are well done, especially most of the servants. Overall I have no bones to pick with the animation; it just wasn't that original and the main protagonist had not impressive characteristics to make him stand out. The battle art was very good though; especially their final attacks. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound, like the art was acceptable. The opening and ending themes were very good and the OST was great. There was no real &quot;Epic Battle&quot; music that lived up to some of the great battles, but it was still good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This was the big downfall for the series... Most of the characters are very superficial, unoriginal, and predictable. The biggest let down in Saber and several other servants; because the story focuses on the character development of the masters for the most part most of the servants pasts are never explained in any detail... so it makes it very hard to understand their development or motivation. Saber's is insinuated at the very end, but the story rushes so much it makes it impossible to truly understand the depth of her character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This in another &quot;Good&quot; anime~ \\n\r\nIts worth watching despite its unoriginality~ But don't expect a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night was, for lack of better words, \"pretty good.\" It was not GREAT, nor horrendous, but it was riding the fine line of mediocrity at times. I understand that it is quite difficult to be original in a day and age where it seems like everything new and innovative has already been used. But I digress. \r\nMuch of the mediocrity found in this series is in the story itself. There were very few twists and the ones that were there have already been done many times over. A fairly useless kid is our protagonist, by the name of Emiya Shirou, who turns out tonot be quite so useless. Go figure. Emiya, with the aid of his Servant, Saber, who turns out to be quite powerful (yet again, go figure) must now battle the other sorcerers in a tournament to obtain a Grail that will grant a single wish.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I kind of feel like we've heard this story before. Weak kid, strong guardian figure, an object of limitless power that they must possess after countless trials and tribulations. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I really have nothing more to add other than the story got a 5 because of the total lack of originality. Granted, the Servants at times were pretty cool, but it isn't anything we haven't all seen before.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some refreshing comedy moments that helped throughout the staleness of the story, in my opinion. It wasn't made to be like Shakugan no Shana, it was very serious throughout most of the series, which, when looking at it from that perspective, it kept the anime fresh simply because it wasn't another fighting anime filled to the brim with comedy. \\n\\n\r\nI will hand it to the animators, they made the fight scenes in this series quite well. The art was great, continuity throughout the scenes were excellent, and the animation itself was top notch and quite beautiful. I enjoyed the color schemes, notably during the scenes in the school when Rin is battling with Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, I reiterate the battle animations: They look GOOD. It is what kept me watching all the way to the end, hoping for another battle. The characters moved like liquid at times and when they fought, you could almost feel the intensity. Which does a lot for the overall score of this anime because nothing is worse when you watch a series about fighting and the fighting itself is boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were nothing special, pretty much what you would expect from an anime such as this; sword clashing, the sounds of flesh being destroyed by weapons, incantations, the occasional battle soundtrack, etc. The voice-overs were done well. Shirou had the typical high school voice you come to expect and his screams were well recorded. Saber's total lack of emotion in her voice throughout most of the series was pleasing, considering that her character and personality reflected the lack of emotional response unless regarding her aims for the Grail. \\n\\n\r\nI was disappointed with the characterization though, in a few ways. Shirou starts off pretty spineless and soft-hearted. As the story progresses, he is given a few opportunities where he has to act and a few times, he surprised me. But ultimately, even though he made a few decisions that I did not expect, I felt he still never learned anything and never grew as a character. \\n\\n\r\nSaber, on the other hand, was an amazing character. She initially comes across as a hard-as-nails, straight to business kind of character. In the later episodes, she shows a bit of her softer, more caring side which is a drastic change. And when the end credits finally roll, you realize that she is a character, despite the faults she felt she had, despite the turmoil of feelings she had, Saber stuck to her convictions, duty and purpose. You could not ask for more.\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night was enjoyable, its animation and characters being its strong points and its story being its lowest. Overall I gave it a 7 because it could have done better, but it is worthy enough that I would recommend it to other people and would give it a second watch. I cannot say I did not enjoy quite a few parts of this, especially some of the more intense battles that took place near the end. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that has great animation, multiple battles and strong characterization then look no further. Just be prepared to occasionally scoff at the over-used foreshadowing and plot twist techniques and being able to say \"I saw that coming\" more than once.",

            "content": "Edit 8/08/2008\r\nWhen I see the ratings people give to Fate/stay night, I can't help but be amazed at how highly it scores. Overall, I couldn't help but feel F/sn was an overrated, mediocre anime with an unreasonable fanbase.\r\nReasons why:\r\nStory\r\nA mythical and mysterious tournament for the holy grail takes place, and the protagonist is dragged into it. Then epic battles ensue between the masters and their servants, until of course, one emerges as the victor. Let's see... a \"mystical\"... \"tournament\"... where you have to save the world by winning. Oh. Wow. That has to be the basis for at least half the shounen anime out there.If it loses points for ingenuity, it could redeem itself by being dynamic, or at least intriguing. But of course, the Shirou-Saber duo must confront successive enemies, one at a time. I could sum up the whole series by listing the enemies the protagonists face.\\n\r\nThat being said, F/sn was adapted from an eroge game. Doesn't it seem that there are a little too many of those popping up lately? It doesn't help the plot at all that some scenes actually didn't show everything that happens (for obvious reasons). Usually it simply confuses the audience. Heck, it confused the heck out of me... until I read the summary on Wikipedia. And when you have to actually look up the plot to understand what happened... you're in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Sound\\n\r\nI have nothing against the visual and audio effects. The music sounds epic, the opening and closing themes were ok (but not awesome) The artwork was beautifully done, though it might've helped if the characters (namely Shirou) changed clothes once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is where F/s n fails sadly. Character development is sparse, except for perhaps Shirou and Saber. We see Saber's slow change from an unfeeling servant into a person with... well, more emotions than she used to have. Shirou stays the same, to much chagrin, trying to save the universe all the time.\\n\r\nThe horror starts when you try to focus on other characters. Rin and Archer to be exact. We're given absolutely no background information about Archer's past or what kind of character he is.(Same goes for many of the other supporting characters)  All he does is fight. Little to no screen time is devoted to developing him as a character. He's basically a character you wouldn't pay attention to, even though his role as the second female protagonist's servant should warrant some importance.\\n\r\nThen comes Rin. There are some flashbacks that allow the audience to glean some information of her past, but her sudden spontaneous relationships with the other characters are largely unexplained. Of course, as a fighter, she resembles the classic damsel-in-distress character who tries to fight, but has to be saved by Shirou. If she's such a capable magician,  then why does it seem that all she does is constantly fail so almighty Shirou can swoop in and save the day? Plus, let's face it. Those so-called &quot;jewel bombs&quot; are an utter joke.\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that Shirou is also sexist, saying that Saber should stay home when she could easily kill him without a thought. All talk with no brains to back it up. I wouldn't particularly mind if there was some thought about developing him, but alas, he doesn't change at all.. almost as if the producers are telling us he's a perfect character. I could go on.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nFate/stay night is sensational, with devoted sound and artwork. However when you try to delve into the actual plot, there are many points that leave much to be desired. There are many positive aspects, many of which I did not touch upon, and others may feel that my criticism is too harsh. As the viewer, ... or whoever's reading this... it's up to you to make the decision to watch. (You're probably sick of hearing this)",

            "content": "This anime feels like a plain retelling of the original story, and those who have played the visual novel game won't find great content in watching it. On the other hand, those who haven't are unlikely to find it any better either - chances are they would find the story and the characters completely uninspiring.\r\nFate/stay night does not have any horrendous flaws in it, enough to make your watching experience miserable. That said, it will fail to instill many emotions in the viewer and putting the hype aside, I cannot fathom how those new to the Fate/stay night universe might find it anything other thannot-too-bad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Mediocre (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven the story in the game isn't that spectacular. Perhaps its greatest value is the carefully constructed world with intriguing characters and not many plot holes. Therefore, it was easy to get immersed in the game and get to like a certain cool servant or a master for its beliefs, actions, personality, looks or history. Albeit rather fantastic and idealistic ones, the motives behind the characters were thoroughly explained and thus brought to life.\\n\\n\r\nAs the result of mixing of the three routes that exist in the game in order to (try to) depict every servant/master and thus get more fans, not one character feels complete. Many of the game's monologues and dialogs are of course left out so once the ball starts rolling with the Holy Grail war one event tramples over another until the very end, making the story seem pretty unsubstantial and childish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to explain the art here is to say it's like a well-drawn picture book with some cool photoshop effects sprinkled here and there. My biggest objection here would be the unexplainable inconsistency in the art style; somewhere around the middle of the show it almost feels like a slide show for a couple of episodes, even some characters were drawn sloppily (this is not the case throughout the show, but when and if you get to those few episodes, you'll know). While you will certainly enjoy the colors and art style which are both very fitting, you won't be thrilled by the lack of real animation.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: Good (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDisillusion, the first OP is an improved version of the game OP and is simply superb. ED is okay, the second OP is below average. Background music fits the mood well but you're likely to get sick of it. Voice acting is not extraordinary nor particularly bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mediocre (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I said for the story applies here. Characters don't have their personalities explained well and its hard to get attached to pretty much anyone, even if you've played the game.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Decent (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf you've played the visual novel you'll find this anime fun from the perspective of watching an animated set of CGs coupled with voices, though it might get excruciating after a dozen episodes or so. The parts which I have liked the most are those at the beginning when the characters joke, have meals, go to school etc. because it is probably the only part that differs from the game story and feels less like a retelling of it from one lazy teenager to another.\\n\r\nIf you haven't, don't fall for the hype - the game is good, the anime is far less good - if you feel there are inconsistencies in the story and if it feels bland, it's because it is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Mediocre (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nPlay the game instead.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nAfter finishing Fate/Zero, which went on to become one of my all time favorite anime, I couldn't resist checking out the wildly popular prequel know as Fate/Stay Night; an adaptation of what many have called \"the greatest visual novel of all time\". Considering the attachment to Fate/Zero and the hype around the source material, it's only natural that I got my hopes up for this anime. Well... Whoops.\r\nThere are very few anime that I would say have managed to \"shock\" me. I am usually a relatively unflappable person. However, out of all the shows that succeeded in surprising, Fate/Stay Night is the onlyone that did so in a way that is inherently negative. I couldn't fathom how bad it was. Literally the only enjoyment I got out of this anime was due to the fact that I got to see what happens after Fate/Zero, which was an absolute masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThe Fate series is basically another \"death game\" anime. 7 \"masters\" who can use magic summon 7 \"servants\" (who are all epic heros) and fight to the death for possession of the Holy Grail; the chalice that can grant any wish. Sounds entertaining right? How can you go wrong? I'll tell you how; insultingly stupid and underdeveloped characters, a ridiculously static plot with no suspense to be found, and having antagonists that are more likable and interesting then the protagonists (ESPECIALLY if you watched Fate/Zero). That's how. I apologize for referencing Fate/Zero so often, but good god I am still in shock that the two are related to one another.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single fight in Fate/Stay night is the exact same thing: The protagonists stupidly and foolishly rush into battle without a plan, they get seriously injured, and then something miraculous happens that allows them to win. It is all so predicable and so boring. It feels like watching the same episode 24 times; no suspense or plot developments what so ever until the final few episodes, and those are only interesting if you have watched the prequel. Shirou Emiya is one of my least favorite characters of all time, and I demand that he drop \"Emiya\" from his name so as not to disgrace Kiritsugu. He is a bumbling, irritating idiot to say the least; it got to the point where I was really and truly rooting for him to fucking die (painfully). The only characters that I found interesting were the ones in Fate/Zero, and even some of those were ruined by this crappy show. I could rant all day about Shirou's cheesy speeches, painful cliches, and general unwarranted stupidity, but I think you can get a pretty good idea of what this character is like with this single quote:\\n\r\n\"People die when they are killed\"\\n\r\n-Shirou Emiya\\n\\n\r\nTruly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are thinking about watching this series, watch Fate/Zero and then wait for the 2014 Ufotable remake, because next to its prequel, Fate/Stay Night looks like a droopy-eyed, armless monkey. It is not worth watching under any circumstances. What this show did to some of the great characters in Fate/Zero physically hurt me; the only reason I give it a 4/10 is because it is a continuation of a great anime and it is therefore automatically enjoyable to a certain extent.",

            "content": "\"People die if they are killed.\" -Shiro Emiya\r\nTruer words have never been spoken, and yet, despite how obvious this truth should be, ironically so many anime violate it on a regular basis; Fate/Stay Night being no exception to the tradition. Yes, in fact one of the characters requires being killed at least a dozen times before he is truly dead. So don't make fun of Shiro guys; he really isn't stating the obvious. Quite the contrary actually, when anime tropes are concerned.\r\nAt the time of writing the latest revision to this review, there's only been a few hundred instances where a bunch of old richmen gathered together in a room and asked each other, \"How can we make like, a bizillion yen really fast?\" And before the question was even finished, someone immediately interrupted mid-sentence, \"Another Fate/ adaptation.\" Indeed, with Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero, Fate/Prototype, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, and Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, for franchise newcomers there's enough slashes to cut right through your skull and watch your brains spill out. Luckily for you, I'm here to guide you back to Kotomine Church and make sense of it all. To cut straight to the chase, Fate/Stay Night is an anime adapted from a visual novel of the same name. In this VN, there are three branching story routes that depending on which one the reader chooses can wildly alter the course of events throughout the story. This anime is (primarily) an adaptation of the first route, referred to simply as \"Fate\" respectively. At this point in the franchise's development however, things have gotten rather complicated. There are now two anime adaptations of the second route (Unlimited Blade Works), an adaptation of the prequel story (Fate/Zero), and a planned adaptation in the works for the third route (Heaven's Feel). Furthermore, all of these adaptations so far are debatably very different in tone and feel, as well as quality, so where the hell to begin in order to get the best experience out of Fate? Well you can always start with just reading the source material first, as it is the most fleshed out and comprehensive version of the story, but I'm assuming most readers of this review are anime-only watchers, in which case I will do my best to give a recommendation for what I think is the best watch order for those who have no intention of delving into the source material.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've gotten all that prefacing out of the way, it's time for more prefacing. You might be thinking that the best route would be to start with Fate/Zero, as it takes place first chronologically in the story, but you would be wrong. The thing is, Fate/Zero was written to be a prequel, and as such, it is meant to be viewed after experiencing F/SN. Watching Fate/Zero first will spoil many key events of Fate/Stay Night. It could be likened to seeing the prequel trilogy of Star Wars first; ruining the surprise of uncovering Darth Vader's identity in the later episodes. However, it's hardly the end of the world either if you do decide to watch Fate/Zero first, and despite exaggerations by the fanbase, I'd say it's OK to start with it, but I wouldn't personally recommend it for a number of reasons in addition to spoilers. Narratively, Fate/Zero feels very different from the rest of Fate/Stay Night, and its opening episodes are rather slow and exposition-heavy, so not only would it set some unrealistic expectations when you move on to the rest of the franchise, but you may not even get that far because you thought the introductory act was too damn long and drawn out, jumps all over the place between a bunch of characters, and there's way too much technical bullshit to keep track of, so you shuffled it on to your dropped list. I think it would just give a wrong first impression of what Fate is all about. On the other hand, you could start with this anime, but that still comes with its own caveats as well. While this series should technically be the entry point for newcomers, nevertheless being that this was the first adaptation of the franchise with a very limited budget, the production values have not aged well, especially when stacked against the other adaptations, which don't just have vastly superior animation; they have some of the best animation in the industry period. On top of that, the pacing and storytelling isn't quite as polished either. And yet despite all of this, I must insist that viewers at least consider watching this series first, as it does carry some pivotal plot points and standout moments that you will not be able to see in any of the other adaptations. Fate/Stay Night may have its fair share of flaws, but I think it is a series that is still enjoyable and deserving of your time. Another viable option is to watch the more recent Unlimited Blade Works TV adaptation first, as this will most likely provide you with the most polished and best entry level experience to Fate yet, but in doing so you may spoil yourself so much with its god-tier visuals and expert storytelling that I'm afraid this series may become unwatchable for you by comparison, and you won't be able to appreciate what it offers. Hence the need for all this prefacing, because ultimately it really comes down to a toss-up between F/SN and F/SN: UBW as your first viewing, as they both have consequences on how you may view and approach the franchise going forward. Personally, I would recommend at least giving this series a shot first, as it is the first anime adaptation of Fate, and technically the \"correct\" watch order if you intend to follow the same format as the VN. If you can stomach some of its more drab points, I think you'll find that the emotional payoff is worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY, THE EFFING WATCH ORDER:\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night -> Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Season 1) -> Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Movie Version) -> Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel (if you have the patience to wait for its release) -> Fate/Zero -> *BONUS* Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Season 2) -> *EXTRA BONUS* Carnival Phantasm, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, Fate/Prototype, etc. (these are all spinoff series)\\n\\n\r\n(SIDE NOTE: Personally, I found the second season of Unlimited Blade Works to be a disappointment, hence why you might notice the strange-looking order here. Start with season one and then finish with the movie, which was more true to the VN and had generally better direction and fight choreography in its final acts.)\\n\\n\r\nWell holy shit, if you got this far and realized that I still haven't even gotten to the synopsis of this anime yet, you should now have a good idea of what it feels like watching the first episode of Fate/Zero. I promise though, I'm actually going to talk about the anime now.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night follows the story of Shiro Emiya, who is an ordinary high school studen--wait a minute. Siiiiiigh. Isn't this the same as every other nauseating SoL setup? We haven't even gotten past the first sentence and you're already boring me to tears, reviewer. Well it's not my fault that the producers chose to fall back on the same old cliches again because they didn't have enough confidence in their story to try and sell it on its own merits. I didn't write the damn plot, so don't blame me. Wait, why am I arguing with myself? Erhmm, let's continue.\\n\\n\r\nSo Shiro, being your typical slice of life protagonist, goes to high school to do your typical schoolboy things. But hold on a second, there's a twist! Thank Haruhi, because I was half a centimeter away from clicking on my hentai bookmark. As it turns out, Shiro suddenly gets thrust into this super secret and dangerous conflict known as the Holy Grail War, wherein seven magi and their servants each compete for possession of the mythical Holy Grail. The Holy Grail itself apparently has a mind of its own, and it's decided that the best way to choose who is most worthy of its miracles is to have everybody kill each other. Because as we all know, might makes right, and what could possibly go wrong if a murderous sociopath obtains the power to wish for whatever he wants? Not that a person like this would have any sort of advantage in such a scenario I guess. Nope. None whatsoever. But Shiro, being our usual idealistic champion for justice, rejects violence and finds the whole thing despicable. On the other hand though, he just accidentally stumbled upon a sexy blonde chick that calls him \"Master\", and if he refuses to participate in the war then she will disappear. So Shiro naturally does what every horny high school student would do in this situation: vote with his dick. And thus, the fifth Holy Grail War commences.\\n\\n\r\nOK, so it doesn't go exactly like that, but I'm sure you can sort out the fact from fiction in my improved synopsis, which Type Moon should totally pay me for writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the first thing that really stood out to me about Fate/Stay Night was its character designs. In fact, the way I initially discovered this series was through stumbling upon some artwork of Saber online and instantly falling in love with her, which consequently prompted me to research what anime she originated from. Then I discovered Rin Tohsaka, and with me being a sucker for cute tsunderes, it didn't take any amount of time for me to warm up to her. It's really rare that I come across an anime that has not just one female character with an iconic design and a personality that is straight up waifu material, but two. Then the awesome characters just keep piling on, like the pretentious badass that is Archer, who is also the character that coined the term \"gar\" just for being such a manly stud. There is simply no shortage of fantastic characters in this anime. Though many of them may appear to be stock archetypes at first, when more of their backstories are elaborated upon we get to see that they are more complex than meets the eye. Although, for some characters you may need to read the visual novel to really see the full depth of the character, which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nNot all fares well with FSN's characters. Some of the magi participating in the war don't get as much character development or focus as they should, such as Illyasviel von Einzbern who commands the servant Berserker. Furthermore, Shiro's unwavering dedication to his ideals can often lead him to making incomprehensibly stupid decisions. He is overprotective of his servant despite that Saber is perfectly capable of defending herself. In fact, it is the sole purpose of her summoning in the first place that she is supposed to fight for him, yet Shiro continually denies her the chance at every opportunity, as well as foolishly runs into the fray, which usually results in him getting severely injured because he is grossly outmatched against a battle-hardened heroic spirit. This can too often leave the viewer with the impression that Shiro is annoying and ignorant, but at the same time it is this exact trait about Shiro that provides for some of the more interesting conflicts of the series. Ironically both Shiro and Saber are so dedicated to their ideals that even though they share the same beliefs, they often cannot get along with each other. The fact that they are so determined to uphold these ideals to the point of tragedy makes for many intriguing situations throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason that some of the previously mentioned characters don't receive as much attention as they should is due to some prolific narrative problems throughout the anime. Namely, it spends a considerable amount of time just having the characters indulge in silly antics at Shiro's house or sitting around sipping tea while listening to tedious lectures from Tohsaka. I'm sorry Rin. I love you, and imma let you finish, but you aren't the greatest mage of all-time. Oops, did I strike a nerve? Who am I to second-guess your magical prowess I suppose. Just keep condescending to Shiro then; what with your incomplete summon of a heroic spirit that can't even remember his past, while Shiro in his amateur ways managed to summon forth a more powerful servant than you. But I digress. The point is, like my irrelevant tangent that I just finished rambling off, Fate/Stay Night's themes struggle to remain consistent at times, as it can't seem to figure out whether it wants to be a typical comedic slice of life or an epic dark fantasy tale. Couple this with its painfully slow pacing at times, and the story overall takes a huge hit due to these flaws. There really is no excuse for all these pointless and slow moments because there is so much interesting backstory from the source material that they could have otherwise drawn from. Whereas the visual novel elaborates on the summoning of Illyasviel's servant and reveals how she is able to control such a seemingly unruly heroic spirit like Berserker, the anime will in contrast waste an entire episode having Shiro and Rin repetitiously track down and dispel some sigils throughout the school, or hold a silly mock duel between Saber and Shiro's teacher, Taiga. Nearly every other episode feels like it needs to take a break from the grail war and go on vacation at Shiro's house when it should have kept the momentum moving along at a steady pace instead. Many of these types of scenes could have been trimmed in length or removed entirely in order to make way for some more important plot points that got left out.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of these problems, Fate/Stay Night's story never really crosses the line into being unequivocally bad. Even the more juvenile moments at Shiro's house are at least entertaining on a superficial level for their humor, as well as minimally offer up some small amount of character development between the anime's two main protagonists, Shiro and Saber. What really sets FSN's story apart from what could have been a typical shounen series is that even though it starts out in your standard and cliche high school setting, it quickly moves away from that and takes a decidedly darker and more philosophical tone throughout the rest of the series, delving into Saber's tragic past when she was still a mortal human being, as well as exploring Shiro's stubborn determination to uphold his ideals even in the face of impossible odds. The struggles and tragic romance that these two characters go through culminate in a very emotionally fulfilling and bitter-sweet ending that will likely leave a lasting impression on you. The evolution of the main protagonists in this series is very thoroughly developed, and arguably one of the most satisfying aspects about this anime. Furthermore, the extended cast of characters and other magi get a decent amount of screentime too, and watching all the servants slowly reveal their secret abilities and identities during the course of the various battles is entertaining to see unfold. Overall, the narrative has a refreshingly dark and mysterious tone to it throughout, which keeps the viewer intrigued and always eager to uncover more of the Holy Grail War's secrets.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime is based on a rather lengthy 50-hour visual novel with three major branching story arcs, it was inevitable that some cuts and alterations to the story had to be made to fit the anime's 9-hour long runtime. Studio DEEN opted to borrow some plot points from the two secondary routes (Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel respectively) while mostly sticking to the Fate route, which was the main route of the VN. Some of the alterations worked well, others were questionable. Chances are though if you haven't read the visual novel going into this, you're probably not going to notice anything particularly strange anyway, aside from a few minor plot points that don't get fully explained like they should. Nonetheless, this hasn't stopped the fanbase from thoroughly panning the series for taking the liberties that it did, but I think it's important to judge works on their own merits independent of whether they follow their source material, and while I would agree that the anime doesn't live up to the quality of the visual novel, it is still an enjoyable series for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation, Fate/Stay Night is overall slightly above average for its time, though not truly great either. It has its noteworthy moments such as the duel between Saber and Assassin, which showed some pretty slick-looking and fast-paced swordplay. On the other hand, in the very same episode during another fight, we are treated to a high-detail close-up of Saber dashing forward followed by a jarringly low detail animation of her slicing away at some skeletons. There is an occasional inconsistency to the quality of the animation that can be disappointing at times, and then there was the perplexing decision to animate an awkward-looking CGI dragon at one point that would have been best left out. Regardless, it works more often than it doesn't, and the artwork effectively creates the dark atmosphere that the anime aims for. This is further complemented and enhanced by the music composed by Kenji Kawai, who I am a major fan of from listening to his other work in Gundam 00. The opening intro is accompanied by a remixed version of the song \"This Illusion\" from the opening of the visual novel, which sounds really good, and the animation flows very nicely with the music. This goes for the second opening too, which was very well-animated and accompanied with a quality hard rock-themed arrangement. It's just unfortunate that the animation quality for the series as a whole rarely approaches that of its opening segments.\\n\\n\r\nFor the English dub, the voices for the most part fit all of the characters very well, with Sam Riegel as Shiro, Kate Higgins as Saber, and Mela Lee as Rin. Kate Higgins in particular did an excellent job portraying Saber's voice with a sense of authority and stoicism befitting to her character while tempering it effectively with a more feminine and vulnerable side when the scenes called for it. Unfortunately though, all future iterations of the Fate universe never see Kate return as Saber, as the Unlimited Blade Works movie instead cast Michelle Ruff, and yet again she changed voices in Fate/Zero with Kari Wahlgren, which is a shame because Kate really is the definitive voice of Saber as far as the English version is concerned. Mela Lee's voice brings out Rin's haughty attitude quite well, though occasionally she could sound a little stiff. Liam O'Brien plays Archer and likewise delivers an impeccable portrayal of the pompous badass. Other notable performances include Stephanie Sheh as Illyasviel, who strikes a perfect balance between cute and creepy as her character is intended to be, as well as Jamieson Price as Kirei Kotomine, whose deep and somber voice is absolutely perfect for Kirei's cold and gloomy presence. I could go on, as there are plenty more veteran actors that make appearances in this series, but needless to say the English voice cast is all in all one of the better ensembles I've had the pleasure of listening to in anime. Due to a number of odd casting decisions in later installments of the Fate franchise though, some may want to opt for the subtitled version instead if you don't want to deal with continually changing voice actors. Just a fair warning.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Fate/Stay Night gets a lot of things right, but as emotionally satisfying as I felt the anime's conclusion was, I couldn't help having a pervasive feeling that in the hands of the right artists it still could have been so much more. With a story and characters as rich as the Fate universe, this series could have easily reached legendary status as a true masterpiece if it just had the proper budget and capable studio to do it justice. Due to a bevy of pacing and consistency issues with FSN's narrative and animation however, it just doesn't quite reach greatness. However, even a mediocre attempt at adapting superb source material still rounds out to be above average overall, so if you're looking for a good entry point into the Fate universe, Fate/Stay Night is a perfectly acceptable place to start.",

            "content": "This is less of a comprehensive review of the series and more of a reaction to what I saw. The reason here is that I haven't finished Fate/Stay Night. I couldn't finish Fate/Stay Night. My body physically rejected this anime halfway through episode 12, causing fever symptoms. As such, halfway through episode 12 is all I will be able to cover. \r\nThe story might have been interesting, had it been presented pretty much any other way. The Holy Grail War sounds like it could be a good concept, and probably is a good concept in Fate/Zero, which I will attempt to watch as soon asI get over the whole Worm Crest thing. That concept makes my stomach churn. Anyway, there's not much more I can say about the plot. The show moves so slowly that I really didn't get around to much of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound both left no impression on me whatsoever. If I were to hear a track from Fate/Stay Night, I would not be able to recognize which anime it came from. The art was similarly uninteresting. It might have been good if I had been able to muster the willpower to pay attention to it. Still, considering the main character has a total of two outfits, it can't have been all that impressive. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the most appalling part of this anime. I'll start with the main character: \\n\\n\r\nShirou is the worst. He is an idiot, thinking that he is capable of fighting superpowered servants with a lead pipe. He is arrogant for the same reason. He is sexist because he orders his own superpowered servant to sit at home and let him fight just because she's a girl. Lastly, he's a disgrace as a mage. The fact that he is Saber's master means she's incredibly weak and doesn't get the mana she needs to continue existing. Shirou doesn't seem to be willing to make compromises; everything has to be exactly how he wants it, and he just sort of expects the universe to comply. Fortunately for him, his plot armor is so thick that it does. \\n\\n\r\nSaber isn't much better. She is basically a robot, with the only \"character development\" stemming from her own backstory. I have heard that she gets a personality later on, but waiting over 12 episodes for one of the main characters to act like an actual character is insane. She also looks stupid fighting with the invisible sword. I understand that they have to conceal their identities and revealing what her sword looks like would give it away, and I'm aware of the benefits to not allowing your enemy to see your weapon until they have already been cut, but the anime just makes it look so stupid, as if she's playing with an imaginary weapon. \\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka isn't the worst character in an anime, that honor goes to Shirou, but her motivations are questionable. She has no good reason to team up with Shirou. Additionally, she has been a Mary Sue for all of what I've been able to sit through. She knows how magic works, she knows Shirou's magical potential, she has a magical gem that can open his magic circuits, and she doesn't respond negatively to summoning the wrong servant. She just offhandedly mentions that she wanted Saber but she's fine with Archer.\\n\\n\r\nSakura has exactly one dimension to her character. She likes Shirou. That is 100% of her character up until episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nTaiga is at least entertaining. She is also the last of the characters whose names I remember. Taiga is the character that's supposed to breathe a breath of fun into a dark and serious anime, but she never seems to show up. If Taiga had been utilized better, this show might be watchable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 1. Shirou is infuriating, it's like watching a dog get fooled by its owner pretending to throw a ball over and over again. At first it's entertaining, but then you just wonder \"why hasn't he learned yet?\" Additionally, the fight scenes last a few minutes at most, followed by several episodes of people standing around and talking. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my overall score is a 1. If you manage to eke out any enjoyment from this pile of garbage, then I envy you. If you're considering trying it out, then by all means go ahead. Other people seem to like it, so maybe there are redeemable features that I don't understand, but don't feel the need to finish Fate/Stay Night just because Fate/Zero exists. It's not worth it. I was trying to watch Fate/Stay Night because I knew that if I watched Fate/Zero first, I would never be able to get through Stay Night. As it turns out, I can't get through it regardless. If nothing else, maybe you can try it out and see just what it is about this show that caused me to give all three of my roommates a lesson on anime just to fully convey how terrible this show is.",

I promise you will be entertained and informed of this series with no spoilers! Well? What'chu waiting for?\r\nStory-4/10\r\nBefore i start, i just want to say that apparently this series is demographized as a Seinen anime, but the way that this anime was made is barely border-line shounen. If not for the violence, i could give this to little kids to watch...\r\nWhat irks me the most is that this anime is all over the place, yes, the seriesdoes span out in a fairly linear fashion, and yes, there is a fairly noticeable central theme; but none of it actually seems to make any sense. Although the series had an pre-determined ending, the actual content of the series was outright shallow and disappointing. The main character was utterly clue-less and retarded throughout the entire series, but the other character's personality seemed to change every episode (whats up with that?) This had made it terribly difficult for me to even gather any sympathy for the characters. The lack of story-driven plot, and any signs of character development had removed my little spark of interest in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic idea of this anime revolves around the \"Holy Grail.\" This grail materializes itself every few years in order to grant ones wish. Seven world champions are bound with seven humans for a fight to the death, only the last to survive is worthy of making a request for a wish. Survival of the fittest concept is actually appealing for me, which encouraged me to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is mostly devoted to fighting; which ironically made it more boring for me, as it was just the same sword-swing and trash talking over and over again, it seems like the creators just throws in a few fight scenes just to fill up time on each episode. Just like how everybody predicts, introduction of new side characters are just punching bags for the mc Shirou and Saber, there are no plot twists as saber always seem of emerge victorious. Generally, after a few slashes of saber's sword, the new characters disappears faster than they were even introduced.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7.5/10\\n\r\nThe art was not bad at all, considering the time in which the anime was made. The animation was fairly smooth, and Saber's character design was pretty cool, this made watching the 24 episodes much more bearable.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9.9/10\\n\r\nI don't really see any flaws in the sound track and voice acting as i don't care about this section that much. 9.9 because nothing is perfect :p\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, i hated the male protagonist, as his ignorance makes me want to vomit. He cannot seem to realize that he, Shirou, has summoned one of the most powerful hero to fight by his side. Being totally oblivious to the fact that Saber, who wears plate armor and holds a legendary sword, Shirou is going to protect everybody! His stupidity has no bounds, even as a teenager; but anime women dig stupidity i guess, with a spot of harem here and there.\\n\r\nThe side characters were not all that interesting, as they all fight similarly, to be destroyed by Saber in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6.5/10\\n\r\nThis was a ok anime, due to my love for Saber. A similar comparison can be the HellSing series; where a single bad-ass character made me give the series a higher score than what i should have. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night Review \r\nThere are no spoilers in this review. \r\nFate/Stay Night I had some mixed feelings coming into it. I've heard of it's bad reputation many times, but I was a Fate/Stay Night fan (Via the Visual Novel) before watching it. \r\nI already knew the story and characters so I had hope that it wouldn't disappoint. I am both happy and annoyed at how it turned out. But overall I was happy on how it turned out and I cried at the ending just like I did in the Visual Novel. \r\nStory \r\nThe anime series follows the events of the Fate route of theVisual Novel. Now it's important to note that the Fate route was meant to be the training route of the Visual Novel and it wasn't the main event and it certainly wasn't my favourite of the three. But it was the one that did move me the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe story panned out much as predicted being I already knew it but their were things that annoyed me about how it was executed. First thing allot of the small details where a bit messed up and where not how they were in the Visual Novel. Such as Sakura didn't always cook, and she didn't always cook alone, when she was at Shirou's house. This is a small thing but it was an important detail to me. It just needed to follow the visual novel better. \\n\\n\r\nMy main other annoyances was the fact that important finale scenes from Heavens Feel and other important scenes from Unlimited Blade Works [The other routes in the Visual Novel] where integrated into important points in the story. I think it was a foolish action to do this and it did take away from the real story of Fate a fair bit and if an anime adaptation of Heavens Feel was ever to be made, these scenes would probably ruin it for those who watched this anime before watching the Heavens Feel adaptation or playing the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nBut I do have to say that they followed the path of the Fate route well in all other areas staying pretty true to the story. It most definitely could have been executed allot better and more closely to the visual novel and should have. But I do give props for how the ending and epilogue where handled. Even though I knew how it was going to turn out it managed to make me cry again. This meant that I finished the series on a high note and enjoyed it greatly despite some of the flaws of it. \\n\\n\r\nI think that this anime deserves a reboot to take it to it's full potential as it hasn't reached it yet. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nI think that the biggest flaw in the anime was the tech side. The animation was good for the time it was made, but I've seen better. That being said the action scenes where quite good and it was good to see some battle scenes play out that we didn't in the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest disappointment was the sound effects. They where bad and dated. I've seen much older anime with a better sound effect set and I think if they used the ones from the Visual Novel it would have sounded better. \\n\\n\r\nThey seemed fond of using the sound of a blaster deflecting off a lightsaber as the sound for jumping and deflection. The OST was average but suited the scenes well. But both of these points I think are effected mainly by the time period in which they where made, more so than negligence by the makers to be fair. I didn't like that they changed songs for the intros someway through the series. The second one was just unfitting and bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was a bit worse than expected. I honestly think the art quality from the Visual Novels animated intro was better. But again this is a point due to the time it was made. I think this anime suffered so much by being made when it was made. I think this is another important factor why this anime needs a remake. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe characters in this where handled pretty well. They stayed true to the visual novel very well. Of course I loved all the historical characters as I do have an interest in such things. One thing is they did lack the in-depth look that the visual novel format offered of them so people who haven't read it do lack out a bit on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI did decide to watch the anime in the English dub after much thought. As I had already heard the Japanese voices allot I was used to them and they sounded better. But in the end I decided to go with the English Dub anyway. I have to say you should probably go with the Japanese voices with English subs if you watch it. They suit the characters personalities better and English Gilgamesh was a joke. Kotomine's English voice actor was good though. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nThere are allot of positives and negatives about this anime. The anime failed to match up to the standards set by the Visual Novel. It's mixing of the different story lines, the execution of the details and the tech side of things where the biggest down points of the show and did take away from the feel of the story how it should be. \\n\\n\r\nBut this format did have advantages of the visual novel and the action was allot better and more involved than the visual novel. My thoughts are that you should read the Fate route of the visual novel before watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou will enjoy it allot more than people new to the Fate/ franchise do. Enjoying the story in the Visual Novel format will allow you to enjoy the story more in the Anime format and playing or watching either is critical to do before watching Fate/Zero the recent prequel anime to the events of Fate/Stay Night. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Fate/Stay Night was a positive experience for me. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 7/10",

            "content": "I quite enjoyed this series. For anyone that knows me, I am usually very brutal in Reviewing anime and very specific when I praise an anime. This one rightfully deserves praise.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story somewhat reminds me of .hack//SIGN because it can get confusing if you don't pay close attention and if you don't do your research. The plot in the beginning is very basic... that goes through the first couple of episodes... then you arrive to a rival: Rider. From then on, the plot gets more and more interesting, and it makes it so that you want to keep on watching. I know I washitting myself near the last couple of certain people... I will not go on much more about that because then it would ruin the ending... speaking of which... the ending reminded me of Chrno Crusade to a point. The ending that is sort of foreshadowed does come to pass. I'm not sure if I liked or disliked the ending at this point in time. What I do recommend is re-watch the anime from beginning to end after you've gone on Wikipedia to learn more about the characters. It makes a lot of things much clearer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI liked the art and the character design very much. Some of the fighting scenes, however, did not apease me very much (Archer vs. Beserker for example). Besides some of the fighting scenes, it was pretty enjoyable... and I wish the artists would have stayed with one eye style per character...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound quality was very good. It also pleased me that the English (Dubbed) version did not change any of the background music. I enjoyed the Opennings very much, especially the second one. I did not like the first or last endings. However, I did enjoy the end song of the episode Archer vs. Beserker.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perfect 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the Character Development and the characters overall. They acted like real people, and they had those human quirks that you see in real people. Even though some characters are overexaggerated, Taiga for example, they make the anime more interesting. I especially enjoyed how some of the characters actually grew... if anyone knows what I mean. I see no overshowing flaws in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Perfect 10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime. It was suspenceful with a lot of action while at times is was light and comical. I am in the process of re-watching the later episodes so I understand everything clearly, but I have no problem in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere are few flaws that I saw, and I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who is willing to watch it.",

The main character irrates me so much. He acts like he's so strong and he can protect everyone but he's really weak and doesn't use his brain a lot and he's really ugly(In my opinon) He get's a little stronger but not much. Most of the characters seem to only have 1 move they use over and over in a fight. It can get pretty annoying after someone uses this 1 move like 10 times in a fight. The art isnice. I have to say that the plot was nice but how it was led out ruined it. There wasn't a nice development in the story.",

The music matched well with the plot, especially the opening/ending songs. \r\nOkay, the characters almost had me trying to murder someone, especially Shirou. I'm sure everyone understands why. The guy with the most obessesive hero-complex I've ever watched was one of the most weakest guys I've ever seen. He gets slightlystronger toward the end but still. Okay, if Shirou was strong that'd be a different issue but if all he does is place a burden on everyone, that is really annoying. I guess the producers were stressing that part of his personality too much. And does Shirou seem to think that girls can't fight? Cuz Saber can just kill him one stroke. Shirou aside, there were some characters that had good personalities and made nice contributions toward the story.  I also couldn't find much background info about each character. I only know the minimum about Archer and a lot others. Archer seemed like a cool guy but I know like nothing about him, just a stoic guy who has a connection with Shirou.\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime is seriously overrated. There are a lot better anime to watch.",

            "content": "Well first off, let me give alittle bit of background of this series. This anime series is based-off a popular visual novel in Japan (and perhaps to fans around the world) created by the company Type-Moon. The game's popularity later manages to create a sequel, as well as a light novel prequel, manga, video games and of course an anime. \r\nWell the basic plot is about a war between masters and servants in order to attain the Holy Grail thus called the Holy Grail War. Their is a total of seven Masters each with one servant and their task is to eradicate the other servants,either by defeating them or killing their master. When there is only one master and servant left, he or she is granted the Holy Grail, and any wish they desire will come true.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this story is about a boy named Shirou Emiya, whom after attacked and killed by a servant, is revived and later becomes a Master in this Holy Grail War. While in the meantime he manages to summon his own servant, a girl named Saber. And this is where the story begins...\\n\\n\r\nWell anyway onto the review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nThe story in this series is pretty linear and can be understandable in the first few episodes of the series. Its not quite difficult to understand and it has abit of a romantic theme mixed in their, but other than that most of the time the story is quite predictable.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nNow in my opinion, the characters animations and lighting effects were done very well in this series, although the character designs  and background seem quite simple and not awe inspiring but still good enough to catch your attention. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nNow the bgm in the series was very good and adpated very well to the majority of the scenes in the anime. You could tell when a certain bgm mixed in well with the current mood of a scene. Not to mention both openings, sung by  Sachi Tainaka and the three ending songs by Sachi Tainaka and Jyukaiof the anime are excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nNow the wide variety of character types through the servants and masters in which they all have their own personality traits and abilites is portrayed well in the series. The only thing that suffers about character in this series is that the full background story of all the characters won't be shown and their is practically little character development at all, so don't expect the main character to let go of his ideals.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nWhat is truly great about this series is probably the action scenes themselves and how the servants are battling each other using their abilities or Noble Phantasms which is what is really called. You also have the occasional romance, but I'll let you decide if you like it or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nOverall the Fate/Stay night has a good variety of characters, excellent bgm and songs, awesome battle scenes and a fairly intriguing story with some well-rounded characters. It does have its flaws and it couldve been alot better. You'll definitely find yourself annoyed with(or hating) the main character or perhaps liking him, depending on your preferences. Fans of general mystery/fantasy/action related shows will find a lot to like about Fate/stay night.\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely recommended to watch even for an average anime viewer since this series has been considered by fans the best anime of 2006. And yes Type-moon fans should watch at least. XD\\n\\n\r\nBut if you want to get the full experience or details of Fate Stay Night its highly recommended to play the actual visual novels or wiki if you wish. You'll be quite surprised at some of the things you'll find about Fate Stay Night if you dig deeper into its roots.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night, abeit a based of a game is not that bad for a 2006 effort, sadly though, it seems adaptation decay has bitten into its legs and started gnawing away with relish.\r\nFirst of all the story, whilst unremarkable, was nice and simple.  Acquire a MacGuffin of power through a deathmatch.  A good idea and it stays as a focal point for most of the story.  There are twists of course, but it follows the straight action thoroughfare.  The weak and dumb are first to go.  I applaud that but it has a kind of been there, done that feelto it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art overall looks a bit dated, but then again, is more than made up for it by the sheer awesomeness of the fight scenes.  I'm not talking about the one-sided fights though.  It's about the goodness to honest clashing of steel.  They were well animated, as expected and it makes sense, this is a war they are fighting.  What mars this however is the reuse of animations.  It may not seem glaringly obvious but sometimes its too noticeable.  Oh and bonus points because Saber has an ahoge.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds do their best to support the fights, no complaints.  The background music could have been better handled though.  It sometimes fades to almost nothing and requires a good sound system to get everything, which sometimes may ruin the mood if a good song was supposed to be playing at certain key scenes.  Otherwise, the composition is fitting and seems to be restrained by the overall theme it tries to adhere to.  The OPs and EDs are fine, I don't think anyone would complain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is the only category where Fate/stay night was given the short stick.  Sure we are well aware of Shiro and his commitment to sticking to his guns(a little respect is given to him by for that alone).  Even Saber gets has her humanity restored somewhat.  I would however, like to know more about the other Masters and supporting characters, especially Matou, he comes off as a bit off and with no clear goal of his own.  It almost seems like he was there to just to step up and get served.  Though you'll have to admire the Seventh master, he was doing it for kicks, but that's about it, nothing special.  Simply shallow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is above average.  I probably enjoy seeing people beat the tobacco juice out of each other more than the next guy and that's what kept me viewing.  If you're looking for something deep, well, let's just say that Shiro is a persistent little SOB and the only real thing you should be looking forward to is the next fight scene.  Now say it out loud with me.  I AM GAR FOR ARCHER!",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nAfter hearing alot of good things about this anime, mainly how breath taking some of the scenes were as well as how it had a good plot and basically was a good anime to watch, i finally decided to see how good it was.. although fate/stay night does have some well orchestrated fighting scenes, the downfall is easily in how big the storyline is and how the anime could not possible cover it all.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is somewhat generic where we have our usual main protaganist who starts off pretty useless but then gains a power which helps him to aid the \"good\" side. The plotis generally simple and not too complex in that there are 7 masters who each have a servant, using these servants, the masters must kill each other to obtain what they are fighting for: The Holy Grail. The one problem with the story is despite its simplicity it is explained in a complex way due to the complexity of the characters, from watching this it is clear that the character's personalities is what is the main contribution to the storyline, due to the time constraints of the anime however, there are many characters who just get hardly any development which leaves many gaps in the plot since this is an adaptation of the visual novel, they could not possibly fit in everything at once. The result is, an enjoyable but poorly executed storyline in which there is no true closure.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was very well done, from an anime made in 2006, it has held up quite well, the animation during the fight scenes is crisp and dynamic and are very difficult to complain about, the anime looks great and hardly ever has a quality drop which is a very positive thing for a shounen anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was average at best, i thought the character's voice actors did a terrific job, but the actual music did not feel like it fit the show at some points. Usually with fighting scenes you have high pace music but fate/stay night does things differently by using melodic music with an orchestra feel to it, im sure some people would enjoy the music but i was not one of them, thought i did not mind the music that much, it was repetitive though since a few songs play constantly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the category that breaks Fate/stay night. Since there are so many characters in the anime, (7 servants / 7 masters) and each actually have quite interesting personalities, were never really given an insight into any of their pasts or what their true desire is in fighting in this war. Often it seems like the characters just have nothing better to do then to fight, The main protaganist is also extremely useless for the first half of the show which is painful to watch, some characters background's are not explained at all which provides alot of confusion to the storyline. Without spoiling too much, the characters although full of life and definitely interesting, are never fully developed enough, Rin who is a master in this game is actually developed quite nicely, however a similar character to her Sakura is hardly given any back story yet has an entire sequence based on her in which we have no idea what her significance to Rin is exactly.. this continues on and really never stops since even Saber's back story is not explained enough.. i could go on and on about the potential alot of these characters have, but i cant blame the producers because as a 24 episode series, explaining everyone would have needed probably double the amount of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the series, but this felt like more of an introduction for me then an actual anime, the pacing in this slow is not that great, in which there are some episodes where hardly any fighting is done and the anime tries to attempt some characters development. Although it works in Rin's case and even Saber's. It really annoyed me how some characters dissapear or contribute nothing to the anime for maybe 12 episodes, and they will randomly show up again, this creates an inconsistency because the show tries to be emotional and tries to show the relationship between saber and shioru, but in my opinion falls short, that being said, i felt the second half of the show (12-24) was far better then the first half.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7/10, which is pretty generous. I just feel like after watching 24 episodes of this, nothing was really resolved. The anime does have an ending yes, but it just feels forced.. without spoiling anything, i realize the producers could not get every character developed and thus explore each branching storyline so ill accept that there.. but the one thing i cant deny is fate/stay night has some extremely good fight scenes, its just bogged down by a pretty boring plot, characters that are not developed enough and no real conclusion to anything.. Im actually going to play the VN since im extremely interested in the other characters.. so if the anime's goal was to get one interested in the characters.. it would be a 10 for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSince this review is purely opinionated, feel free to agree or disagree with it. I understand many people enjoyed this anime a considerable amount, i was just not one of them.\\n\\n",

From start to finish it proved to be a fantastic anime.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe plot was sophisticated but not extremely complicated. It started off with a pretty basic idea; seven masters and servants fighting to obtain the holy grail, but the further into it I got the more the story started to twist and the plot got more complicated. The conclusion was very clever as every twist began to line up and the final battle ended with a bang! Overall, I tought it was a well thought out story and that's why I thimkit deservers a 9.\\n\\n\r\n Animation: 9/10 Looks good.\\n\r\nEverything is well drawn and there are some real kick-ass fighting scenes. There wasn't much off the usual things you see like chibi or their heads get gigantic when they're yelling at someone. Fight scenes are great. The only problem was there were one or two occassions when some drawings didn't match the anime but aside from that it pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe sound really matched the mood of the scene in was on. Especially in action scenes where it built up a lot of adrenaline.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 Outstanding\\n\r\nThe characters were really brilliant. Each complimented each other and served meaning for the anime. It really was the characters that made me love this anime. My favourite character would have to be Archer. Another recommendation I have to give is most action/adventure animes have tons of characters but this one only used about 15 important characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Always a simle on my face!\\n\r\nOne thing I can say about this anime is that I never got board watching it. I was kind of disapointed with the small amount a comedy(there are several times I found myself laughing) but it was made up for with tons of drama stuffed into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nIt wasn't an absolutely perfect anime but it was exceptionally great with a very interesting plot. This anime is, of course, one of my favourites and if you haven't watched it yet you don't know what your missing.",

The story at first might seem a little dragging as it was till the 3rd episode i think where the main plot was revlealed...\r\nStorywise, it might be comparable to other anime, so it's not really an original concept. but you'll enjoy the story nonetheless...\r\nthe artwork is beautiful. the characters are well made. Personally I like the artwork and the character designs. Though if you're familiar with type-moon shows, you can see similarities with their other series. I mean in looks as well as personalities, but at the same time they can alsostand on their own so it's not really a bad thing. The animation is superb as well. The action is well made. I really enjoy the fights in this series. There is also some comedy scenes to lighten the mood but the seriousness and drama of the series kinda takes the comedy away. But it does make us see a lighter side in the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I like the dub (Japanese) I really like Saber's voice. it really matches  with her cold yet compassionate attitude. the OP and ED are addicting for me. The background music really matches the medieval theme of the series. Despite the setting being in the moder time, the characters come from legends and history, usually during the medieval times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters, as I said have close resemblance to other of type-moon's works or even from others series for that matter. But they stand on their own as well. And there is a good character development in the show as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series all in all is good. it has it's downsides in story and other aspects but it's one good show that you must not miss...\\n\\n",

            "content": "Many people say that this anime is very lackluster and otherwise absolute shit. I can assure you that this anime does have some interesting components and is a nice short series to watch.\r\nFate/Stay Night is a 24-episode series which is an adaptation of the Visual Novel Fate/Stay Night made by Type-Moon. The series presents us the  Fate Route, the primary story line of the Visual Novel (Unlimited Blade Works and Heavens Feel being the other two stories). UBW and HF are simply alternate universes of the Fate Route - has the same characters, simply a different turn of events\r\nThese are pretty much the mainoutlines of my review, incase you don't want to read the whole thing, read the outline :).\\n\\n\r\nStory: Cool setting and concept of Holy Grail War, however it is a repeated Battle Royale Setting though\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Pretty bland except for standout characters Rin Tohsaka and Archer\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Amazing 10/10 Soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Honestly it's fine other than that 1 CGI Dragon Scene but who the fuck cares.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now i will go into detail about each criteria\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of Fate revolves around a battle royale between 7 Mages called the Holy Grail War. This setting and concept is quite overused and I think it isn't really original, considering many other stories are Battle Royales. That being said, what sets this apart from the others is that the 7 Mages summon Heroes and Villains from mythology, folklore, and history to fight in the Battle Royale. This makes it very interesting as you get to see many heroes and villains of all times fight it out in one war; it's like seeing who would win in a battle situation and it brings a lot to the action in the plot. Finally, the plot itself is very simple to follow, and is quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in the show are not the best. You have the classic \"I want to be a hero\" protagonist (Shirou Emiya) and other really cheesy people like the super shy girl (Sakura Matou). All other chracters can prettty much be summed up with the following list of words: douchebag, twisted, psychotic, retarded. hat being said, the real standout characters are Rin Tohsaka, a girl that gets helps Shirou in the Holy Grail War, and Archer, the heroic spirit summoned by Rin to fight in the Holy Grail War. These two really have good character development and really bring out the story to its fullest as they interact with the protagonist, Shirou, the most and really brings nice perspective to the story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: Amazing Soundtrack, probably one of the best, if not the best part of the show! Personal favourites include the opening theme Disillusion (listening to it right now!), Kishi Ou No Hikori, Gunyuu Shisou, Kodaku no Junrei, and so much more. Overall the soundtrack was outstanding and really brought a lot of enjoyment to the anime. Gotta love that soundtrack! \\n\\n\r\nOther: Fate/Stay Night wanted to go a step further and they tried adding parts of the story from the other story lines Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel.  For some, this might be butvhering the plot, for me, I think it went pretty well as the outcome resulted in an enjoyable storyline, and I didn't find it inconsistent. However, a downside to fate is the explanantionj of its concepts. In Fate, the main thing the story revolves around are the Mages using Magic. Magic is explained in a very unclear way making the explanations very half-ass and confusing. But it shouldn't be too much of a problem. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show has great content, it's just that the content might not be presented in the best way (Explanation of magic, story progression, characters, etc.). However if you do find interest in it, you will find yourself a nice short series to enjoy. I recommend watching Fate/Stay Night to anyone wanting a nice short series\\n\\n\r\nExtra: The Fate Series has many adaptation such as Fate/Zero, Fate Kalied, etc. If you do enjoy Fate/Stay Night, I suggest you watch Fate/Zero right after this, as it is a prequal to Stay Night which takes place 10 years before Fate/Stay Night. Fate/Zero explains the events that led up to many of the events in Stay Night, though i suggest you watch it after Fate/Stay Night. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're really into the Fate Series, I recommend reading the Visual Novel to get the joy of the Other two Story line routes (Unlimited, and Heaven's Feel). You can also watch the Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works Anime that is currently airing right now as of April 18th, 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's a little hard to talk about this anime. I was waiting I are done playing the visual novel to make this review.\r\nThe anime starts a little slow, in fact, the first cour is slow. This is because this route is the introduction of visual novel. But the second flows faster. The anime has mostly as focus the protagonist's relationship with the character named Saber, who is the heroine of the anime.\r\nWell, the anime idea itself is very good! the story of the Holy Grail ritual and invocation of servants are very interesting. Moreover, the world of anime is so well done. HOWEVER, some thingswere very poorly executed. Principally in a matter of the romance, which was too forced in the anime. The character \"Saber\" changed their behavior very fast, something that was not so sudden in VN. The protagonist does not help much. He's like a walking suicidal, a stubborn child. Another thing was also the presence of a hole during episode 15, which goes unnoticed by those who know not much of the original material.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty mediocre, with extremely constant presence of static frames. Inconsistent designers with a few bugs. It is the famous animation called \" PowerPaint Animation\".\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was able to explain the basic mechanics of the Holy Grail War, but did not elaborate too much. Something that disappointed me in the anime, was the lack of the depth in the dialogues, flashbacks, actions, reactions and thoughts of the characters. Something that the visual novel is well philosophical and deep.\\n\\n\r\nThe final fight was quite confusing for the spectators of anime. Nor I had understood when I saw the first time. The anime is not very faithful to VN, mixing a little of the 3 routes. \"Mixing\" in quotes, because it was more to collage. They did not care much for logic and simply put certain scenes there. Like the kidnapping of a certain character that does not even appear in the middle of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simple but striking. Especially OSTs of the characters who are very good. The only problem is that sometimes the ost's are not so well embedded.\\n\\n\r\nSame with all these defects I can still enjoy this anime ... The protagonist has many faults, but he is brave, altuist (too much) and does not regret of what it does, but it is childish. Because this, I like him. He has his faults, but also has its qualities. It was he who managed to save the heroine of a tragic fate, which incidentally was not explained in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I found very beautiful was the heroine acceptance to realize that his wish was not right. She gave the best of himself and did not need to use the grail for that. What it led to one of the most beautiful end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Talking about the story, the general idea is very good. But the execution, not so much. About anime in general, he was very ill-suited! removing much of the essence of the original work, leaving behind several important explanations for the understanding of the characters and the plot. \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation? the visual novel. When I read, I saw an absurd difference, both in the narrative and depth of the story.",

            "content": "\"In order for virtue to prevail, there must first be an evil defeated.\" - Kirei Kotomine\r\nPreface:\r\nLike Shiro Emiya to Kiritsugu, Fate/Stay Night is the red headed step child of the Fate series, without a doubt. Back in 2006, before the acclaimed VN had achieved a monumental amount of success, complete with multiple TV series, movies, and spinoffs; there was one that came before. It was a time when the studio Deen, an industry veteran, was experiencing a huge run of success with a trio of titles: Higurashi, Hell Girl, and our very own Fate/Stay Night. \r\nIn today's world, FSN has been ragged on for itsshonen-ness, immaturity, poor animation, and overall inferiority in both tone and execution to more recent efforts in the Fate universe by ufotable. Is it because it's a truly inferior product, or that it has not withstood the test of public opinion over time like its stablemate Higurashi? Let's find out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nFSN was visually striking from the beginning- the magic runes and swirls of power are well animated, and the various reds, purples, and golds that make up the flow of energy lend an arcane and weighty feel to the action. The action sequences are very flashy, and typically are very fleshed out, though some animations are repeated- it never feels tiring. \\n\\n\r\nThe idle animations can be kind of boring, and I can see where some people find the chibi style thrown in (think FMAB) with the humorous elements off-putting in a fairly serious show, but within the framework of the show itself, it works. Beware of the ASS dragon though... the 3D CGI appears once, and you might need an acid eyewash, because you'll think the ass dragon took a steaming lava dump in your eyeballs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character animations are what are hit and miss here. Obviously some corners were cut for budget saving measures- When there's no action and the characters are seen from far away, they're typically very low detail, particularly the eyes. A lot of pans and sweeps of a stillframe are also used, in both action and non action sequences. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nFSN's musical composition was handled by one Kenji Kawai. He might have done work for another little known anime you might have heard of... I don't know... GHOST IN THE SHELL 1995 and Innocence? That's right. Before Yoko Kanno provided her talents, this guy was on the stage. He also did the composition for Higurashi. \\n\r\nThe insert/next episode preview song \"Unmei no Yoru\" is absolutely phenomenal. It's a very fitting song for a medieval inspired fantasy series, complete with a high synth, chimes, strings, bells, a heavenly chorus, and synth drums that give it a very listenable New Age sound, but retaining the epic feel that befits such a series. The 2nd opening song, \"Kirameku Namida wa Hoshi ni\" by Sachi Tainaka is also very catchy and mood setting for the show.\\n\\n\r\n\"You might not have noticed it, but your brain did.\"\\n\\n\r\nOn the voice acting front, the English cast is another great one put together by Geneon (May they rest in peace). Kate Higgins (C2, Code Geass) heads up the cast as Arthuria, the Saber, and does a fantastic job as a commanding, yet heartfelt warrior king. Sam Riegel (Viral, Gurren Lagann) voices Shiro in a good performance, and finally, Mela Lee does an outstanding job as Rin Tohsaka. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\\n\r\nMy experience with the Fate series has been anything but usual. Given that I started with Fate Zero, and am watching it chronologically by in-universe date and not by airdate, it gave me some interesting insight into this story, having some outside knowledge of what would otherwise be the normal viewer's first foray into the Grail War. \\n\\n\r\nBriefly, the Holy Grail War is a proxy war waged between seven masters and their summoned \"servants\"- or the spirit of a fallen legendary hero from ages past- over the Holy Grail, an omnipotent wish granting device. The last master/servant duo standing is the winner, as declared by the Holy Church. The pair is then granted a wish: that which they desire most. \\n\\n\r\nAs Shiro Emiya fits into this: he is chosen to fight in this war due to the intervention of one Rin Tohsaka, a girl in his class at school. After Shiro is injured as a result of the shadow war, he accidentally summons his own servant, Saber, who then, along with Rin, discuss with him the purpose of the war, along with their own reasons for why they fight including the eventual goal of obtaining the grail: the greatest achievement for any Magus. \\n\r\nAll is not as it seems though, and through Shiro's determination to fight solely for the sake of others at the possible expense of his own life, he discovers that the Grail War is much more than he anticipated, and may very well be more than he can handle while staying true to himself. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I have the hardest time grading Fate/Stay Night. It began much like many other shonen shows do- a self sacrificing, headstrong protagonist with a tragic flaw who goes on the Hero's Journey in a quest to discover both themselves and the hearts of others. What it transitioned to was something in between that and a fairly enjoyable character drama with a tacked on, but somehow acceptable love story. \\n\\n\r\nSaber, the same strong willed, unflinchingly loyal to her knight's code of honor character that she was in Fate/Zero returns, as resolute as ever. Unyielding and extremely stubborn, Arthuria takes up more of a role of protector in Stay Night. Her radical, extremist ideals of \"honor\" and \"integrity\" before personal gain and victory- the denial of self for the sake of others mirrors that of Shiro's persona. In that aspect, she's eternally flawed. She desperately clings to her ideals when her own constitution and abilities fail her, which ultimately becomes the turning point in the story. She is too weak to be able to be anything else but the embodiment of her principles, which is ironically why she appears \"strong\". \\n\\n\r\nHowever, unlike in Zero before, where she refuses to cast aside her ideals and start anew, she finally sees the fatal flaw in her ways, and is able to overcome her arrogance and hubris in order to perform the greater good. This is the kind of character development I watched 46 episodes of Fate to see. I truly enjoyed her growth as a character, which would not have been apparent to me if I had seen FSN before F/Z. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Shiro himself overcomes his inner turmoil in order to grow exponentially in his reasoning and thought processes to be a competent, if self sacrificing hero. The motives and perspective changes from that of an idealistic martyr to an altruistic realist- who finally sees the value in himself as much and as hard as he fought for others.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka takes up a supporting, but very important role in the story as Shiro's instructor in the art of magic, helping him to hone his entirely undeveloped skills and untapped potential into something that resembles a magus. Though she's also a master, she's an interesting look into the mind of a \"pure\" magus: a person who puts their research above all else, including their life. This helps serve as a foil to Shiro, who puts the well being of others above his own life. She also experiences her own arc about what it is that's valuable to her, that is- her perspective on her goals, and the means of achieving them change in a sort of \"do the ends justify the means\" type of philosophy transformation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThis show aired from January of 06 to July of the same year. This means it was in production around the same time as shows as Code Geass and Death Note. While neither of the aforementioned titles are paradigms of absolute perfect execution in animation, they're both very quality productions for the time. Fate Stay Night is no different. (I looked at the charts for Winter 2006 anime, and besides a Gundam OVA, there are no titles that I've ever seen mentioned again). \\n\\n\r\nAs this relates to my opening question- Fate Stay Night has been remembered, and not lost to the sands of time. While it gained newfound popularity with the advent of Fate/Zero in 2011, it certainly had its own popularity among fans and new entrants to the series alike- else it wouldn't have warranted another movie and an entire prequel series, which spawned another TV series and yet ANOTHER movie. It all started somewhere, and that somewhere was in 2006, with Deen. \\n\\n\r\nThe tonal consistency is sometimes a bit off, it changes from a pretty heavy conflict driven ideological narrative to sometimes silly, sometimes just annoying comedic relief (think FMAB, again), typically involving Taiga, the schoolteacher and surrogate mother for Shiro. It focuses much more heavily on the characters who matter in the second half, like Fate/Zero before it, and is much better for it.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the growth of a character that I formerly hated, and some new ones that I wasn't too sure about. The resolution of Kirei Kotomine was also very satisfying and deliciously ironic (again, due to having seen Fate/Zero first, I truly understood why it was so.) While there were two plot points carried over from Zero that were never discussed (perhaps they will be in the Unlimited Blade Works series), as a whole, it's a very likable entry in the Fate Series which doesn't necessitate the hate it receives just because it wasn't made by ufotable. The handling of the series may be different, but I contend that this one is just fine for what it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nYes, both as a good shonen series, and as an entry in the so-far-excellent Fate series.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Good character development (Rin Tohsaka, Arthuria in particular.)\\n\r\n+ Good action and animation (for the time)\\n\\n\r\n+/- Romance sub plot may be off-putting to some\\n\r\n+/- Main characters can be incredibly annoying (Don't worry, Shiro gets used as a punching bag A LOT.)\\n\\n\r\n- Interesting supporting characters don't get enough screentime\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Was all their suffering for nothing? Embracing the pain and moving on... Isn't that the only way to truly honor those you've lost?\" - Shiro Emiya",

Intense fight scenes, awesome characters, great story, and pure satisfaction from beginning to end! It was definitely my #1 favorite anime show.\r\nFate Stay Night revolves around the life of Emiya Shirou and the enigmatic battle between 7 magi and their powerful servants. These servants called eirei, are legendary heroes who are called forth to aid their magician masters in the Holy Grail War every 10 years. This is just a brief overview of the story, but it wasjust an amazing piece of work and effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was interesting, the artwork was neat, character development was well-done and the overall enjoyment of this series is not to be underestimated. Fate Stay Night is truly a masterpiece for anime lovers. If you haven't watched it I strongy recommend that you do!",

            "content": "This anime gets a lot of stick for no good reason at all. REMEMBER its from 2006, its a bit old, but maybe its the sentimental side coming out of me. Its very endearing, in a weird way.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nthis one is for all the lore wh*res out there. There are frequent lore dumps and theres a lot to take in. You will most likely need to make notes like you're in class. And you will probably end up having to have a wiki page open on the side to make sense of some parts. Theres also some cute Slice of Life moments, which I wishthere was more of, it really slows down the pace and gives your brain time to recover !\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nYES its art might be a bit wonky (but considering its from 2006 the artwork is actually relatively beautiful, lets just ignore THAT one scene w the dragon).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nbeautiful and fitting at all times .... the emotions drawn out at crucial points during the story. The first OP ? RELOADDDDD ITTTTTTT.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nShirou is annoying at times ... you'll just have to get used to that. But theres a large amount of strong willed independent female leads that more than make up for that. Rin Tosaka is probably the Ultimate Tsundere, I dont know anyone better. It gets a bit confusing with King Arthur/Saber and all the pronouns used for her. As shes referred to as a father often, even though SHE is definitely a SHE. But all characters are given room to grow and develop and we understand their motivations, no loose ends here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show is GOOD if you let it stand alone. Compare it to the shiny new F/SN UBW or F/Z and of course it seems a little rough around the edges. But thats why its charming and endearing.",

            "content": "After having watch many boring or annoying animes that forced to stop half-way through, this anime was a real treat. It blends nicely action/romance/drama\r\nStory:\r\nPro: It doesnt try to be extremely deep, complicated or philosophically oriented, which can really annoying in some stories; its just really fun to watch and keeps u wanting to know what happens next. It has many shounen aspects in its fight scenes that make it exciting. It has the right amount of drama that skips most of the boring intermissions that i see in a lot drama/romance anime and goes straight to the more juicy parts. Its content of romance isenough to make u care about the relationship of the two main characters and to make u think its sweet, but it isnt overplayed to the point where it gets boring and they have to think of all sorts of twist to try to make it fun again. It is also makes the ending very bittersweet.\\n\r\nCon: Since the story doesnt cover all of the VN, it is only as complex or deep as many other popular animes so dont expect it to be otherwise. As such, it also leaves many questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPro: Its art is top notch. The characters are beautifully drawn, among the best.\\n\r\nCon: Can&rsquo;t really think of any.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nPro: Most of the characters have lovable personality, none is overly annoying. They did very well with the two main characters to make u care about their relationship.\\n\r\nCon: The characters aren&rsquo;t exactly original and are derived from popular anime stereotypes but that&rsquo;s expected. However, these stereotypes are famous for a reason and the anime vary the characters enough and intergrate them well enough into story that they remain lovable without getting old. The biggest flaw I find with the characters is that many of them have little development and background. The anime follows the route of the main heroine in the VN, Sabar, so naturally she is gonna have the most development. The VN solves this problem completely and superbly with its multiple routes but the VN is another matter. However, these flaws do not hinder the enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really shines and makes it a top notch anime. Enjoyment is the biggest factors that I consider; this anime was just fun as heck to watch and keeps u wanting to watch more. Sure the story and characters aren't exactly original and the story is pretty straightforward. Many of the characters are left with little development as well. But really, who cares. None of these flaws make this anime any less exciting to watch or any harder to get attach to. I'm not saying that i dont care about those elements in a story, its just that they arent necessary in every story and they do little to harm this anime, so little that i hardly consider them flaws. In fact, there are many animes that i've watched that try to create original, complex, or realistic characters or story that just comes off as annoying or a bore.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOverall this anime is one of the most enjoyable I&rsquo;ve seen. It isn&rsquo;t perfect though, things can always be improved. Though its flaws did not prevent it from being a very enjoyable show, fixing those flaws would have made it better. This; however, is very difficult to do since it is based on a VN with multiple routes and can lower its enjoyment by having to shorten the route that it is depicting. Some fans of the VN may also have problems with the incompleteness of the anime. If u like action/adventure animes that have doses of drama/romance and doesnt drag on and on than this anime might be worth a watch.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night is the first of several anime adaptations of the Visual Novel of the same name. The Visual Novel is divided into three routes: the Fate route, the Unlimited Blade Works route and the Heaven's Feel route. This adaptation by Studio Deen covers the Fate route of the VN. However, some people claim it is more of a loose anime which is freely based on the Fate route rather than a faithful adaptation. While this might be the case, this review will focus on the anime as a stand alone product and not look at how faithfully it has been adapted. In some instances,some references to ufotable's adaptation of the Unlimited Blade Works route will be made but there will be no spoilers or any digressing commentary concerning any work other than this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's protagonist is Shirou, who unwillingly has to participate in a survival game in which seven Masters, including him, each summon one so-called Servant \u2013 in his case, a young woman who calls herself Saber. Servants are heroic figures from different time lines or mythologies who fight for their Masters so that they then can obtain the Holy Grail, a magical artefact which grants one wish. At first glance, this sounds like a simple concept but as the fight goes on, numerous ways the game can be exploited by are used so that it does not become boring while still being relatively easy to understand.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the synopsis, it is logical that the anime mostly consists of battles between the Masters. While there is a lot of action, you can also enjoy some entertaining slice of life moments which lead to a nice change of pace once in a while. The fights are adequately implemented into the story even though the outcome is often very clear from the beginning. Moreover, sometimes they end rather abruptly and surprisingly which from time to time leads to pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime touches some considerably interesting themes such as whether something fake can have the same worth as the original or how important it is to trust your friends. However, the first point is only hinted at and dealt with much better in other anime, including ufotable's adaptation of the Unlimited Blade Works route or Shaft's Nisemonogatari. The second point, while being conveyed rather nicely, is something you can find in most shounen nowadays and Fate/stay night does not make any effort to utilize this concept in a unique way. Another theme the anime wants to convey is that you must not ignore your own needs while trying to help others and even though this could have been executed better, it gets the message across.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have distinguishable personalities but they suffer from either not enough exploration or illogical character development. There are a lot of supporting characters whose purpose and backstory is being hinted at but just when you want to know more about them, the story's focus shifts onto something else. The main characters unfortunately tend to make incomprehensible decisions which often feel forced and exist just for the plot's sake. In particular, Shirou's relationship to Saber is not believable and should have been handled differently entirely.\\n\r\nIn general, Shirou's personality is often criticised, especially in this version of Fate/stay night. While it is true that it is a bad character trait to act like you want to help others even though in the end, it is for your own good, this trait does not necessarily make you a bad character in a work of fiction. It might be very annoying but it can also be nice to have a protagonist in an anime such as this who does not always act like you want him to. However, it is regrettable that most of his personality is built upon his relationship with Saber, which is, as stated above, not realistic. Still, the biggest character related issue with this anime is not the protagonist but the fact that some of them choose to act in ways that do not make sense if you consider their ambitions from the other adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nOne of many issues many anime viewers have with Studio Deen is that its productions lack in quality, especially in the animation and art department. This is true for some of their other anime such as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni/Higurashi \u2013 When They Cry or Pupa but Fate/stay night is an exception, at least in the first half. The animation quality may not be on par with ufotable's adaptations but it certainly is not as bad as people make it out to be. This is especially true if you consider that this anime was made in 2006; other popular anime that aired at the same time, such as J.C.Staff's Shakugan no Shana, did not have memorably good animation either. That being said, animation quality drops noticeably in the anime's second half. There is one especially bad scene in which you can see a horribly CGI-animated dragon but luckily this scene only lasts several seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThe background soundtrack, albeit being a bit repetitive, fits the anime for the most part, as well as the opening and ending themes. Voice acting could not have been much better \u2013 in fact, it might be the anime's strongest component. There is no outstanding performance but overall, it is very solid.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its shortcoming, Fate/stay night is still enjoyable to say the least. The world building is handled well and the character interactions are generally interesting. It is a fun action anime with some intriguing symbolism that knows how to appeal to its audience. However, if given the choice, one should rather watch ufotable's adaptation of the Unlimited Blade Works route first. It is the superior anime and conveys its themes much better. If you watch this anime first, major events will be spoiled and consequently do not have as huge of an impact as they are supposed to have. Still, Fate/stay night is definitely an enjoyable anime you might want to watch after UBW. Not only is it entertaining on its own but it also explains the setting and some characters' ambitions differently than UBW, which helps the viewer understand the world Fate/stay night is set in as a whole.",

            "content": "First let me tell you that this is my first review and that I'll be writing one solely based on my point of view with some SPOILERS!!! even tho' i try my best to avoid them, there are some minor ones, and i will write a warning whenever I plan to go to the SPOILER CITY.\r\nI don't like rating anything on a scale, I don't feel that you can capture your opinion on a scale of 1-10, but in the spirit of this site I'll try my best, also explaining my reasoning behind those grades.\r\nSTORY 3/10\r\nI started watching Fate/stay night with some great expectations, Iwatched Zero first, so i had some ideas about the story. But unlike the prequel stay night focuses on, for the first half of the series mini harem anime, and then on some cheese romance. I know that Fate/zero got aired six years later, but i didn't expect this much contrast.\\n\r\nIn my opinion character building is a crucial part of the story, so there will be in depth review of the characters down below.\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt ( in my opinion the least important aspect of the anime ) is the best aspect of the show, the only thing they failed to do on this part is that fights were to much flashy energy beams then actual fights. For example last fight between Gilgamesh and Artoria is nothing but beam on beam action, you see some clashes and kicks here and there but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was ok, sometimes catchy, but nothing special\\n\r\nNothing specific about sound, just that there was some weird moments, like Pegasus sounding like a hawk and that sort of minor things.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 2/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where the hate train realy starts building some speed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are poorly built, servants other than archer and saber don't have any soul, lots of side characters disappeared without explanation for a few episodes, villains aren't built at all, they just pop-up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't restrain myself from spoilers in this section, if you didn't watch the series you are warned, if you don't want spoilers I can only say that i harbor great hate towards our main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya - let's start with our main protagonist, adopted son of Kiritsugu Emiya, the boy that he saved from the tragic fire and raised him as half trained magus (half is maybe an exaggeration).\\n\r\nShirou somehow gets himself involved in a fight between archer and lancer, somehow gets to escape with his life against an epic hero long enough to get into a shed that Irisviel used as a lab, and with no incantation summons saber, a woman that he instantly falls in love with but doesn't bother to ask her name, ever, and i mean ever, he even says that he will remember being in love with a girl named saber...realy now, girl named saber...\\n\r\nHe than dies a few times, gets train by saber for a few days when he realises that he is useless, gets to do to magic that enables him to summon whatever waepon he visualize, and instantly gets adept with that wepon, and his skill doesnt have anything to do with magic, he just has it, wielding swords, daggers and staves like its nothing. And at the end he defeats Kirei in about five minutes, a skilled inquisitor that in last series was able to deflect bullets, move like Flash and at one point chopped a tree with his hands tied around it.\\n\\n\r\nArtoria Pendragon/saber - The thing that buged me was that she didn't tell anything about the last war 'till the point when it was pointless. Here we have new masters, most of them have strong connection to masters in the last war, but Artoria is like nothing to say here...\\n\\n\r\nRin Toosaka -  From the start we see that Rin is well trained mage, but she seems to have some weird ass all mighty gems, ok. Another thing, I knew why she is attached to Sakura, but that is from watching zero first, they didn't explain anything in stay night  and their encounters are uneventful until she has to save her. And she gets out of her way to help our useless protagonist.\\n\\n\r\narcher - we don't know who this guy is, but he is a badass\\n\\n\r\nHercules / berserker - lets just make Hercules roar and shit untill the end.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Matou - I find some things annoying 'cause i watched Fate/Zero first and i know the backstory, but that only confused me more to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a weak 4 from me, mostly because i watched Fate/Zero first and i was expecting something along those lines.",

            "content": "With respect to the current FSN, I delved myself in an all-nighter to pay another watch to the old version. Well, the thing is, I may have rated 7 before and I'm really appalled at myself for doing so because, cliche, childish or whatever the majority pointed out the original 2006 version, it was overall a good watch, no, a great watch. Spoilers are unavoidable and I apologized for this fact.\r\nWhat people don't appreciate about the old FSN is with regards to it's toned adaptation. Casting Emiya Shirou, a boy who dreams of saving all the innocent lives is another factor. With his ideals asfuel to his entire being, a war with a pacifist as a hero is bound to have contradictions and FSN struggled to smooth things around the idea.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, Shirou, as we all know, had been saved from the previous war. And as a result, with him growing beside a reborn Emiya Kiritsugu, inherits the virtue and the dream Kiritsugu failed to realize. However, the main problem is, Shirou himself, is a weakling. This is a pitiable fact. That's why, Unlimited Bladeworks was adapted in order to cleaned off the criticisms about Emiya Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, a romance-tag. Right, this is why I included \"toned adaptation\" clause. Had DEEN managed to avoid the love approach or polished a better storyline, people would not blindly accused FSN as a cliche, childish and all the misplaced hates might have been reduce drastically. However, despite this very fact, I couldn't bring myself to agree with most of the hate. That's because, Saber's blushing is cute enough to rebuffed all the negatives of the series, but well that's obvious it's just my preference.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the pacing. It's a game-adapted-to-anime series. I have played FSN before but not to the degree that I saw all endings. In the end, the series paced itself too rushed on some parts and too slow on the others and that's what made it look like a joke to the majority. Well, it certainly feels annoying when a certain episode look promising only to see the next episode un-fulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nFourth, the art. This is another obvious element. While it's true that way back in 2006, this is already contains high-level action, but look we don't want to fool ourselves, right? Should DEEN adapted FSN in 2010-onwards when the art took a significant upgrade, I won't see many whinings about the fights being boring, bland and etc. The fact that justifies this claim was the 2010 UBW adaptation that emphatically left an overall good impression because, of course, the fights are truly magnificent and superbly executed.\\n\\n\r\nFifth and last, the character development. DEEN formulated a shounen approach. Well, why not? Back then, having a sword-clash-filled anime title certainly looks entertaining and appetizing. Especially, to the likes of ages between 10-18. With the mindset of orienting the show for young boys, the formula which includes a house, with a sole boy surrounded by a flock of girls is also an established pattern. Good grief to this, but for me, this is just a minor thing. \\n\\n\r\nWell, as the episode turns its wheel and fact after fact is revealed. I grew less interested since the characters were vast although only a few have been given good screenings. Aside from the protagonists, the antagonist side surely looks pale in comparison to the vivid heroes making it very easy to foreshadow. In the end, a forced showing of a bad villain ends the series in a lackluster fashion.\\n\\n\r\nYou might find my review a bit unconvincing and confusing since my intention is to raise it's reputation, however I am not finished yet though.\\n\\n\r\nWe all know that FSN is a sequel to the much-acclaimed F/Z. Comparisons were inevitable. But the point is, FSN should be thanked instead of being disapproved. Without it, F/Z wouldn't been able to managed a good storyline. I am not pertaining to FSN's shortcomings, it's because of FSN was made that F/Z was also portrayed . However, due to the fact that FSN was left midway, it certainly lost its appeal due to the taking of good twists for the prequel. Oops, this is just my speculation, all right but well, I doubt it's wrong anyways.\\n\\n\r\nFinalizing this long rant, I know it's a hard and undeniable fact that FSN didn't manage to convince the majority. However, don't judge by comparisons. Don't be swayed by the negative points everybody's telling you. Look at the adaptation content. Giving it a second or third watch, understanding every single lines will definitely changed your initial point of view. In the end, what appeals to me the most is still more of the romance part, the lovers who were torn by the sad fate is still remains extermely beautiful in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, this is my final effort to at least reduced a little bit of the hate. This 2006 version is still a very good watch, filled with a decent storyline, intelligent dialogues, a bittersweet romance and packed with good fights. See it for yourself and I can assure you'll not waste your time.",

            "content": "Most important thing first. Don't watch Fate/Zero before this show or before anything Fate/Stay Night related if you don't want to spoil yourself almost entire story.\r\nHowever it's worth mentioning that the story isn't that terribly important, because it's actually quite idiotic and only an excuse to have battle royale with an extremely hot chick as a main participant. What distinguishes this anime is the fact that she is fully clothed - it may be a small thing, but nice nevertheless.\r\nFate/Stay Night is based on the popular visual novel. I'm writing this review in 2015, and as of now the 2006 anime adaptation tends to getmore bashing than praise. But is it really a bad show? No, it isn't, but on the condition you don't expect it to be anything more than adolescent fight series. As I noted it has a ridiculous story, it can come at times dangerously close to harem series and its shounen protagonist is stereotypical to the extreme. And it takes place, all anime fans wouldn't believe, in Japanese high school. \\n\\n\r\nHowever when you are ready to accept all of it then it does reasonably good work at putting its clich\u00e9s together. Animation is quite good, although definitely not on par with newer series. I was impressed by the soundtrack of the show. It is very memorable and conveys emotions very well, particularly when the show wants to be epic. Characters are moderately interesting. On the whole F/SN could be even described as charming. I almost enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are things which ruined my enjoyment of the series entirely. Firstly, it's inherent to the series highly questionable view on gender roles. Words \"sexism\" and \"chauvinism\" come to mind when one is confronted with numerous ingenious remarks of main protagonist on what women should or shouldn't do. Many anime series may be received as chauvinistic and as promoting gender inequality but F/SN has really taken it to the next level. Truth be told, it's not surprising, because the original visual novel is so absurdly sexist, it would really blew anyone sensitive away. It's really not by accident that the franchise is called sometimes Fate/Stay in the Kitchen.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's suppose someone is not sensitive and has strong aversion to feminism. Then there is still second problem, somehow connected with the above. Namely, F/SN is not only sexist but also morally archaic. Every discussion on the fundamental issue \"girl and boy living in the same house? Abominable!\", every time protagonist blushes when he sees naked female body, every time he risks his life by refusing to sleep in the same room with his freaking 1500 years old all-powerful guardian only because she's essentially a girl make you bark at the moon. It sounds like I'm exaggerating (and frankly, indeed I am), but really, the amount of cringe-worthy moments of this type is remarkable and on really rare levels comparing to other shows I saw. Given the choice I would prefer even blatant fanservice (which I genuinely abhor) over this exasperating para-Victorian morality. \\n\\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances I would give this entertaining mindless show 7 out of 10 but due to strong values' dissonance I'm compelled to rate it a bit lower. So 6/10. But if you don't mind such dissonances or you can honestly describe yourself as \"(very) conventionally moral\" than you should ignore most of my objections.",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is as uninnovative, unoriginal, and stale as its name would suggest (I needed a thesaurus for this one, I did not have the words to describe how bad it was). When people talk about Fate/Stay Night, they mostly talk about the visual novel being good or how Fate/Zero is so good or what not. Being associated to so many allegedly good pieces of work, one would normally expect something like this to be good. However, this was not the case. \r\nI'll spill out a couple of words on the execution and then talk about how this should've been named \"Stale - The Animation.\"The execution was amateurish at best. The art quality sucked, which is not something I say often as I usually don't watch indie stuff. The music was pretty good, and the voice acting was pretty good, but they only stand out because of how bad everything else is. The directing was horrendous, but that might be due to how bad the writing was. It's impossible to arrange a pile of turd into an art piece unless you're into that abstract art stuff. The only redeeming scenes are a very few select fight scenes, like 2-3 of them were actually kind of cool. \\n\\n\r\nSo about it being as stale as moldy bread that even starving mice won't eat. Every cliche line that a hero main character could say is said. Every cliche line that a villain could say is said. It's so bad. It features fights where the characters have enough time in between blows to spill out a monologue on righteousness, but barely have enough time to have deus ex machina last second escapes. It features fight scenes where instead of having an overpowered bad guy kill the main characters simply because they suck, they're stupid, and weak, the bad guy ends up running away, sometimes for no reason at all. Like, they don't even say anything, they're just winning, winning, winning, about to kill good guys... poof, gone. If you're going to insult me like that, at least give me an excuse, any kind of excuse. And on top of all this crap, you give me a bipolar plot with bipolar characters? One second they need to win the holy grail wars, one second they don't. One second the bad guy needs them alive for some stupid reason, one second he needs them dead. One second a character is the most evil, heartless character ever imagined, one second they're trying to show us how nice and human they are. There is a lack of direction here that is almost unprecedented. \\n\\n\r\nAnd none of that is even my biggest beef with this anime. What I truly hate about it is that they have a really cool character which I'm hoping I get to see more of in later series, and they completely butcher her as a character. She has this massive conviction and very strong principles through literally the entire anime up to the last 10 minutes where she gives up all of that. \\n\\n\r\nLet me squeeze in a minor spoiler warning here. It's not a big spoiler, and you really shouldn't be watching this anime in the first place. \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER)\\n\\n\r\nSo the last time Saber was in the holy grail wars, her master commanded her to destroy the holy grail. In her words, \"I have never cursed the existence of command seals, nor anyone who had betrayed me, as much as I did that day.\" Absorb that for a second before I tell you that in this holy grail wars she voluntarily ends up destroying the holy grail. Literally the exact same scenario, except this time because she has the hots for the main character for no reason, she gets talked into destroying it. I don't think it's possible to degrade a character more than that. \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER WARNING END)\\n\\n\r\nSo given how much I borderline hate this anime, why did I give it a 2 instead of a 1? I believe Fate/Stay Night has a strong foundation somewhere deep within the cesspool that is this plot. I watched it solely for the reason of being caught up to watch Fate/Zero because I've heard that Fate/Zero is really good. I'm hoping the true potential of this hidden foundation gets realized there. Aside from that, like I mentioned earlier, the voice acting is okay and there's some decent scenes in this. I didn't give it a 1 in any category, and that's primarily why. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of how I feel about this anime, I've been told it is kind of mandatory to watch to fully understand and enjoy Fate/Zero. Once I watch that, I will edit this review to say whether or not watching this atrocity is worth the admission ticket to Fate/Zero. For now, I will say to only watch this if you're main goal is to get caught up to Fate/Zero. Otherwise, stay clear. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: Yes, you should probably watch this for Fate/Zero's sake, it is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "There's often days when I have nothing to do - and that's especially true during summer holidays, when actual work is scarce and the boredom factor rises exponentially. Thankfully, since I have a toaster capable of video playback, I tend to watch some anime. I decided to go out of my comfort zone and watch Fate/stay night, which I also heard has a good visual novel from around 2004.\r\nI didn't regret picking this up.\r\n(My typical fashion of reviewing - discussing various categories in order and then a summary, with also very light spoilers - there's one part I just cannot omit from this one.)\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWhiledefinitely an interesting story, the biggest flaws of the story aren't any kinds of plot holes. No. The biggest flaw of the story is attempting to shove it into a 24 episode format. Even though it's done really well, there's still the occasional lack of information, unlike the VN version, which just spouts details at you since day one. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI will admit that the artwork has gotten me by surprise. For a time when HD just started being a norm, the visuals are great and the overall art style is also great. One thing I really expected was more blood/gore, but for the kind of an anime it is, there's a surprising lack of that.\\n\r\nNot that I'm complaining.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAnother good point of the anime. While I don't recall much in the music department of the series, I can assure you that the audio is very well done, and even the openings have decent music. Not much to talk about here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nProbably the biggest flaw of the whole series are the characters. Shirou Emiya has a typical case of trying to protect everyone. It gets surprisingly annoying after a while, but he tends to stop it for a while, and then he pulls the quote that sparked a meme of a lifetime: \"People die if they are killed..\"\\n\r\nOther than that, some of the characters are there to just be there. Some of them have actual motivations or motives to commit something, yet there is a character that does none of the above.\\n\r\nAll in all, characters are a good hit or a bad miss.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDespite these problems I've listed, Stay night is surprisingly enjoyable, to the point where I've binged the rest of the episodes, ruining my 2-episodes-per-day rule. Although there isn't much action in the beginning, it starts to ramp up near the end, while still keeping the same quality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile Fate/stay night is a good anime, it definitely has its flaws, and it definitely is overrated. I even considered watching Carnival Phantasm, and then I realized I watch gritty anime that tends to be edgier than bismuth.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Good story\\n\r\n-Great sound and art\\n\r\n-Very enjoyable overall\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n-The story needs to be more fleshed out, including world building\\n\r\n-The characters tend to be hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\n(Well, that's about it. I completely forgot about Stay night, and so most of the review goes from my memory, which is thankfully very long, and the visual novel I haven't finished yet. Even though I think I wrote this review well enough to be understandable, I would want to see some feedback on my profile about it. Thanks, Hab.)",

How is anyone able to stand them? Each and every character with the exception of a few heroes is ridiculously annoying and stereotypical. Shirou is absolutely predictable and one dimensional. His back story is lame and his personality is annoying. Then of course he hasa harem. What purpose is there for a harem? Of course every girl is just as annoying and predictable as Shirou is.

            "content": "Well .. it is really bad when you have a sequel being worst than it's prequel .. this is one of those cases.. \r\nFate/stay night .. well this show drives me crazy.. knowing it's prequel and then having this .. i don\u00b4t know who is the autor of both shows .. but it must not be the same. \r\nDid you ever heard this sentence : \"PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED\" .. Emiya Shirou said this in the anime .. what a genius.. \r\nPlot: 7/10. The idea is still there .. the holy graal and the war for it.. but well you know .. whyhalf of the participants are students? Like .. they don\u00b4t even know fuck about life how can they have any particular wish.. i mean .. srsly ? \\n\\n\r\nPlus .. it's hard you know .. talking about this almost make me cry.. WHERE THE HELL IS THE MOTIVATION FOR THE WAR? \\n\\n\r\nWhile in Fate zero we can see the motivation for it, everyone with strong reasons and all that shit .. here ? Some didn\u00b4t even wanted to join the war .. while others we can\u00b4t even know their motivations .. Literally in the middle of this show looks like kids playing around with their servants .. \"ah let's end this fight, i don\u00b4t wanna fight anymore i'm tired ..\" said by one master during a fight. \\n\\n\r\nLike .. please ... remake this anime. It's all i have to say. It's looks way more childish than fate zero, and with such plot .. i can\u00b4t allow such thing. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all of that, we still have some nice twists towards the end, the pace is nice and and they stick with a plot line, so there are no plot holes or missing parts. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. The anime is pretty old and the company by then wasn\u00b4t ufotable.. so unlike the rest of fate series, this show has a baddy art .. unless you are one of those who likes to see flash lights in technically everything, the art won\u00b4t really bother you. Is not good, but at least the characters are well drawn, they look nice. The background is shitty sometimes but still is good enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is kinda fluid during the action .. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. The sound is OK. The openings are not that great but the OST used are pretty well to make a nice a mood, and that's all that matters right? :) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Well .. if it wasn\u00b4t for Saber / Kotomine / Gilgamesh this anime would have been a LOT worst. This characters kept the same feelings from Fate zero as well as the same motivations .. so if they are good there .. they will be good here. Meanwhile .. \\n\\n\r\nFucking annoying shonen typical guy taking the place as the main character.. \\n\\n\r\nTsundere girl taking the place as the main supporting character .. \\n\\n\r\nThe others .. ah forget there isn\u00b4t any character left .. because they have no development at all .. thank god they didn\u00b4t, probably more of those inteligent sentences would came up. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. I've watched this show first than fate zero .. if i had watch fate zero first .. this rate would be a lot worst.. But .. the end saved this anime. I found it really emotive and beautiful. Such a nice ending deserves to be remembered. It really touched my heart. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. This show fails when compared with fate zero .. but .. well you know is still better than a lot of the action shows out there.. if i reccomend it? Well yes i do. I think it's fundamental for you to watch it if you are going to watch Fate zero ..",

Seriously the mc has to be the most stereotypical and hypocritical dude ever. I honestly dont mind the corny i want to save everyone ideal but they just did such a bad job with the mc. And really the female characters were similar to that as a rock. They were all so bland and boring. But ihad to finish it and i did. I might consider watching the prequel to this but im going to give it a lot of thought. If you guys want a good anime from the '06 period i recommend watching Code Geass. But really guys only watch this if you are very bored but honestly there are so many good animes and mangas out there that you should not waste your time with this.",

            "content": "\"Wait, I'm already inside her.\" - Protagonist. \r\nFate/stay night sure is a peculiar show. If I had to describe it in one paragraph, I'd say it's a fantasy & shounen based anime with mythological & religious undertones and what looks like a... good lawd, the tamest romantic component ever to be seen. It also contains numerous eye-brow raising one liners, cringeworthy German and badass fighting scenes. And somehow all this combines to make a decent show. \r\nLet's get to the meat and potatoes. (NOTE: this review is based only on the anime)\r\nFate/stay night follows the daily life of Emiya Shirou, a 17 year old boywho through hard work and determination exudes a powerful aura of testosterone that attracts his purple headed classmate (Sakura Matou) to make him breakfast and accompany him every single morning. Joining them is Taiga, his naggy and clingy guardian. His days pass blissfully in the company of fine women until the universe decides it has had enough of Emiya's shit and decides to fuck his life up by proclaiming a free for all death match called 'The Holy Grail War' and allowing a bunch of nerds to summon 7  warriors that will serve them and fight for the possession of the Holy Grail, an item said to grant its holder any wish. The heroes summoned are composed of a female knight that shouts every time she swings a sword (Sabre, who will also be Emiya's servant), an archer that doesn't carry a bow (Archer), a pink headed stripper (\"Rider\"), Schwarzenegger's arc-nemesis (Berserker), LeBlanc (Caster), a mellow long haired swordsman (Assassin)... and some guy called Lancer. A most wondrous of casts, wouldn't you agree?\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night largely stays on point when it comes to story and character progression. I can only recall a single fillerish episode but even that one turned out to be plot significant in a way. That's one of the things that I really liked about this show and it's a quality that's not easy to find in Shounen anime. You can also see clear character progression and how that progression affects the links between the members of the cast. An example of this would be Emiya strapping on a major pair of balls and actively supporting his armour-clad sista from another mista instead of squirming away from fights and making her pissed off all the time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso it's important to note that this show loves to flex its martial biceps and display only the best of fights for its audience. That's right. No bullshit, no orifices barred, all in Michael Bay style fighting scenes. It's stay/fate night's strong point. The show however tends to get a little too melodramatic and carried away. Be prepared for constant flashbacks and larger-than-life philosophical narratives even during the tiniest of scuffles. It does get a little tedious at times and you wish they'd shut the fuck up and just fight instead of discussing their secret tactics for god knows how long (lol Bleach anyone?). But all in all, the plot will still draw you in, the fights are good and the protagonist is cheesier than an obese skater performing 360s in nothing but aqua coloured latex pants. All as it should be. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and quality is very good even when compared to more recent releases. The animation is fluid all throughout and fights aesthetically pleasing. The voice acting is likewise good, especially all the growls and battle cries. The OST and opening isn't bad but not that special either. I just considered it meh for the entire duration of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the enjoyment section is a very strong point of Fate/stay night. The story is intriguing and interesting, especially that mythological aspect though I can't say exactly what it is to avoid spoiling things. The only lacklustre aspect here is that the romance (which I haven't touched upon at all and for good reason) is extremely tame and slow and I shit you not, it'll take practically the length of the entire series before you'll see any semblance of a classical romance. But then again, it's like expecting romance in DBZ. \\n\\n\r\n8 points overall and I'd generally recommend this to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and let me leave you to ponder the meaning of this philosophical statement :\\n\\n\r\n\"People die when they are killed.\"",

Let me explain all the parts now then =)\r\n*My apologies, might contain spoilers*\r\nStory 10/10 =\r\nThe story of this anime is truly amazing when you look at it from the eyes of main protagonist. You survive a horrible tragedy by a man you never knew, you get killed and revived by a girl that should be your rival, you summon a knight full of pride and learn just what the hell is going on. You're assumed byall others to be naive, your ideology about the main event is completly different to others. Even through all this, the main hero struggles till he loses his consciousness, even falls for his own servant. The ending of story touched me greatly, I just wish there was a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 = The design in anime is of a great quality, fighting effects and all surroundings aren't cheaply drawn. For those who like animes with nice quality, this anime is a good chocie.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 = I find the music used really suitable for the anime's story and events in it. I do not know about others, but there were moments when my emotions just spread even more with music playing to a specific moment, be it romantic or of bravery in fight.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 = You really see all the characters, that the story goes with, to grow with each episode. Believes change, they realise a lot and all to the better. \\n\r\nAll characters there have their unique past and we learn a bit of it as the episode goes, always quite amazing the point of view about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 = If you've got enough free time to watch an anime of 24 episodes, I really recommend to watch this. Though, I'd like to point out that this anime won't be really suitable for people who prefer the \"flawless\" happy endings. In my case, I felt like crying , filled with emotions, at the end of the anime. Otherwise, this anime has many comedic situations and light atmosphere, but it also has these dramatic moments and high tension. Just like it goes in real life, one part of the day is light and all's right, then suddenly the day becomes \"hell\" or very dramatic/romantic, depending on what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you're going to watch the anime, have nice time watching it =)\\n\r\nI still hope there to be a sequel one day.",

            "content": "The DEEN version of Fate/Stay Night is a funny case : when it came out in 2006, it was considered one of the best anime ever, but today, it gets a lot of hate.\r\nSo is it good? Is it bad?\r\nSTORY :\r\nFate/Stay Night is the first part of the Fate universe, one of the biggest phenomenon in Japan and certainly the most popular Visual Novel even today.\r\nThe story is about a battle between Mages, called the Holy Grail war. The reward : the all mighty Holy Grail, which is said to grant the wishes of the winner.\r\nBut Fate/Stay Night is also a basic Slice of Life: it's about the life of Emiya Shirou, a not-so-normal high-school boy as he was adopted and raised by a Mage after a tragedy that killed his parents and many other people.\\n\r\nShirou gets dragged in the Holy Grail War when he witnesses a battle and unwillingly invokes a Servant (a \"familiar\" that must serve the Mage who invoke them during the war).\\n\r\nBasically, the show focus on the Holy Grail War and on the everyday life of the characters.\\n\r\nThe story of the Holy Grail is absolutely awesome. Not only it makes for great fights, it also has a LOT of background, which is the barebone of a universe. The characters all have an interesting background... except they aren't all developed in this anime.\\n\r\nWhy's that? Because the Fate universe has several \"routes\" (different scenario, that is), and this anime only focuses on the first one (simply called \"Fate\").\\n\r\nEach route focus on some characters, and forgets a bit of the others. Thus, by knowing only one route, you won't realize how deep some characters are.\\n\r\nAside from that, the story has a lot of twists and revelations, which make it very interesting to follow, even though they talk a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there is the Slice of Life part. THAT is definitely the weak part of Fate/Stay Night, especially in this first route.\\n\r\nThis is simply not interesting. They focus on basic school life and get too much into comedy, often forgetting this is about a deadly battle between Mages.\\n\r\nAnd there is this love story between the main characters (I'll come back on it later).\\n\\n\r\nLong story short : the universe is awesome, the story of the Holy Grail is great, but it is indeed spoiled by a lot of Slice of Life. That said, this is mostly true for the first half of the show.\\n\r\nThen, in the second half, it gets really serious. Like, awesomely serious. You may here that a lot : the first half of this anime is boring, but the second half clearly make up for it with great battles, great revelations and twists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART :\\n\r\nSomeone has to say it : DEEN studio has a really weird style. The light effects aren't realistic at all. The eyes are big and empty. If you enjoy the style, you may like it. Otherwise, you will be annoyed. Personnally, I really liked it.\\n\r\nThen, there is animation. Animation itself is... meh. But strangely, they do manage to make great fights. Archer vs Berserker is still one of the best anime fights ever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND :\\n\r\nKawai Kenji is the compositor. A great name in the japanimation (he made music for Ghost in the Shell, Gundam 00, and many others).\\n\r\nI wouldn't say this is one of the best OSTs ever. But it does contain memorable themes, namely Emiya (which is a theme from the original VN, but with Kawai Kenji's style), Unmei no Yoru, Tenchi Hou Take.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nTHIS is the strong hold of the Fate universe. THIS is why it is considered one of the best things ever.\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters have an interesting background, some kind of involvement in the story, a mysterious side and/or a badass style.\\n\r\nSaber is one of the most badass anime women ever. Rin has a great temper. Emiya Kiritsugu, despite being dead before the series even begin, is awesome. Illya is the most evil little girl ever.\\n\\n\r\nThat said... in this anime, many characters actually aren't that great.\\n\r\n- Matou Sakura has a very tragic background, but it is not developed at all in this route (it is kept for another route).\\n\r\n- Emiya Shir\u00f4 is an idealistic overpowered brat. He does have an interesting story, but his other versions in the other routes are way better.\\n\r\n- Kotomine Kirei seems quite clich\u00e9 as a main villain. He is actually much more complex than that, but it is indeed better shown in Fate/Zero than in Fate/Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there is this stupid love story between Shir\u00f4 and Saber. It simply does not work, as Saber is not in Shir\u00f4's league... and it is pointless to the main scenario.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you want to enjoy the characters, you must understand that one route is not enough to know all of them. You have to watch all the routes and Fate/Zero, and only then, you'll have a hold on the complexity of each character.\\n\r\nBut when it comes to this anime only, many characters are failed. Well, ther's still Saber, Rin, Archer, Gilgamesh. But the rest seems quite average, when they're actually great in other routes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT :\\n\r\nSo, it seems there's a lot of problems in this anime. How come this be popular? Because most people know this is only ONE PART of an entire universe. It must not be taken alone.\\n\r\nDEEN's version of Fate/Stay Night is definitely the least good part of this universe. But it is also the first one. The Slice Of Life part is put away in the other routes (there's still some, but much, much less).\\n\r\nI really recommend watching this. Even if you don't like it in the end, it is the first stone of an entire universe, which you are sure to fairly enjoy.\\n\r\nThat said, if you really don't want to watch all of the Fate anime adaptations, you can skip this and watch Fate/Stay Night (2014), then Fate/Zero, then Heaven's Feel (this route is made in 3 movies, that are currently being released in Japan).",

            "content": "Another computer game based anime. But it's very well done. The plot is thick, confusingly so at times. It can be quite complicated in parts and hard to follow but it is well worth the effort. I like that fact that the servants have a mythological basis even if it did become hard to remember who was who. I did watch it over a space of several months though so that could be a contributing factor to me finding it confusing and hard to follow. The animation was well done though, the character designs were great (especially thier backgrounds) and it was overall very prettyto watch. Good music too.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a good amount of action and fight scenes in  this anime. Not so much that it got boring yet enough that it kept you thinking 'oooooo'. There were bits of humour and fanservice, which is something I really value in shows that have a lot of action. It becomes a nice break and distraction, especially in anime that has a fairly serious tone. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the action and the humour I did find that this had sags in it's story line. Some times there would be lots going on and other times there would be hardly anything. That would be my main quibble about it, I wasn't at the edge of my seat the whole way through and thats something that I have come to expect and enjoy with good animes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I very much enjoyed watching this. I found the Saber/Emiya 'ship to be cute and fun, the background to be interesting and the fight scenes to be cool. Everything that you need in a decent show. Thus I will happily reccomend it to anyone who likes a bit of action and fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nNanashi Moriko *not a Fate/Stay Night fan girl but yet a fan*\\n\r\n21/01/08\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At the time of writing this review, I have watched around 50 anime series and movies, and not once have I encountered one as appalling as Fate/Stay Night. Poor character development, atrocious characters, nonsense dialogue and predictable action sequences - this anime's got them all. The music and art were fine I suppose, but hardly anything remarkable - definitely something forgettable. The story was generic and predictable, therefore there isn't much to cover on that front.\r\nFirst off, the character development. Well, it's nonexistent, so there's not much to talk about on this front either. All of the characters stay more or less the same asthe moment you meet them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Good God. The protagonist is a classic Mary Sue with plot armor thick as fog, with neither smart, nor brawn, but a lot of naivete. He's completely unlikable and forgettable. Oh, and he also happens to be pretty damn sexist - he forbids his servant(whose sole existence revolves around fighting for his sake) from taking up the sword because...she's a woman. The other characters are slightly less annoying, but just as one-dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nNonsense dialogue. If you know the quote \"People die when they're killed\" - that's where its from. Yup. It's from Fate/Stay Night, and while since that phrase's glory days are long over and the translation has improved...there's still no meaning beneath the shallow dialogues, which goes from stating the obvious multiple times to constantly saying each other's names(seriously, I've heard the name \"Saber\" called out about 10 times in every single episode for no real reason). \\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess there was SOME amount of merit to be found in the action sequences. They were okay, if it was not for the fact that you knew precisely where things will pick up next as the scene unfolded before you. There were no surprises on that front. Something I found hilarious was the usage of random german words(as spells) and one of the characters suddenly monologuing in english for no real reason mid-fight(I suppose I didn't see that coming).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Do not watch this. This is EXACTLY what people who say \"Anime is trash\" have in mind.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night (2006) is a prime example of the \"great potential, poor execution\" case where a manga, novel, game or, in this case, visual novel is adapted into an anime by a studio that was simply not up for the task.\r\nBut don't let this scare you. If you are able to ignore animation that best is pretty decent and at worst is pretty mediocre you will be able to enjoy a genuinely good anime that honestly gets too much hate from it's fanbase and the anime community in general. I also think it is the best place to start the Fate/Series\r\nStory: Good (7.0/10)\r\nThe narrative istold through the perspective of Shirou Emiya and Saber as they fight in a 7-way battle royale style war for an object know as the Holy Grail while at the time both of them must face the dilemma of either fighting to fix the mistakes of the past and for the sake of others or live in the present and fight for yourself. I think the anime approached this question in a pretty interesting way even if it wasn't in the best way possible. The story is told in a slow pace but by being fairly engaging and interesting it is able to keep you decently invested throughout it's 24 episode run. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals: Average (5.0/10)\\n\r\nwithout a doubt this anime's biggest failing and the major reason why it is so heavily criticized and looked down upon by it's own fanbase.\\n\r\nStudio DEEN was able to successfully replicate the art style of the original visual novel in it's character designs and backgrounds but in terms of animation the show leaves much to be desired with clunky and stiff movements, (sometimes) badly drawn facial expressions and underwhelming visuals effects (which include an ugly CG Dragon) that most of the time lead to unintentional moments of laughter.\\n\r\nBut one thing that surprised me was that in the last episode the visuals received a ridiculous upgrade in every aspect, with all the problems I mentioned above being corrected. But in my case it just made me question why they didn't do the whole show like that. If they had done the whole thing with as much quality as in the last episode I believe this show would have been a lot more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAudio: Great (9.0/10)\\n\r\nthe music created by composer Kenji Kawai is in, my opinion, one of the best and most distinct soundtracks in anime joining my personal favourite OSTs alongside Evangelion, FLCL, Devilman: Crybaby, GitS and Kill la Kill\\n\r\nEvery track has this feel of wonder and mystery attached to them, elevating every moment in which they are used in.\\n\r\nAnd Disillusion is one of the best OPs period.\\n\r\nThe voice actors and actresses did a good job at portraying their characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7.0/10)\\n\r\nthe cast is quite large, consisting of the 14 participants of the holy grail war and a few other characters that aren't participants in the battle itself but are still relevant to the big picture.\\n\r\nEveryone is pretty distinct, well written and memorable with most of the relevant characters getting some good development.\\n\r\nAll the villains, who are also participants in the war, are pretty well done with well defined and believable motivations and reasons for wanting the grail as well as the main cast which was likeable and well written.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good (7.0/10)\\n\r\nFate/stay night is a pretty enjoyable anime that I would recommend to anyone who isn't fazed by below average animation and can enjoy it's other qualities.\\n\r\nIt also has great rewatch value after you finish the main fate series\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWritten on the 13th of February, 2019",

            "content": "I still remain to be a relative rookie in the world of anime, but I'm sure there are some things that have amazed others who are more familiar with anime just as much as they have amazed me.\r\nAnd Fate/stay night was was one of those things.  This anime seems to have just about everything you could ever want in one well-wrapped package.  It's got a great story, action scenes that I believe rival or even surpass Dragonball, romance and a certain captivating effect on the viewer.\r\nFirst off, I'd like to say the art is just magnificent.  The character designs in this animeare proof of that, and I must especially say that I loved Saber the most.  As a character, she seems enthralling and interesting at the same time, and you can help but be drawn in when you're watching her in all the fantastically executed swordfighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I might have to say that this anime lacks, it would probably be the music.  Some of the songs were good, but most of them felt a little too slow for me, or they didn't exactly fit the scene.  This could all be personal taste, but I found myself just fast fowarding the beginning and ending sequences half the time.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, I'd like to say that the story could have been done a little better. I understand that as an anime, there are many limitations to what they can do in only so many episodes.  I'm sure that there are many more things about the characters that they couldn't explore, simply because of the restricted time frame.  In the visual novel, which I have just begun, I expect that there is much more that is explored regarding the overall storyline\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I believe this anime deserves a 9/10, because although it does approach perfection, it still has some things which bring it down just a little bit.  Nevertheless, it is beyond fantastic either way, and I highly reccomend it to just about anyone.  It does meet expectations, I think.\\n\\n\r\nHejin",

            "content": "I've heard a lot about this anime, so I assumed it should be good. I was wrong.\r\nThe anime is very talkative, and spends a lot of moments with characters talking about what they want to do, and a lot of talking during the fights itself. They don't really reveal a lot of what the character's motives are, but makes you think they are thinking real hard about very philosophical questions.\r\nFights ultimately boil down to a rather dull clash of swords that have little variety in pose and camera placement, and skill ultimates that are continually spammed again and again until they miraculously work. It isa bit like Ichigo of Bleach spamming his Getsuga again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe show actually started on a better note, with a proper mystery and characters with a lot of personality. Somehow that got lost along the way, especially when a random loli appeared out of nowhere. Although I have no knowledge of the anime's source material, I think the show should have stuck to either doing it as a medieval fantasy fight, or a school-based supernatural mystery. At times, you have the feeling that it might be a slow-pacing supernatural mystery slice-of-life show, or a harem in disguise (especially when every girl ends up in the protagonist's house). It ended up as a mix between magic swordsmanship, sorcery, and school mystery.\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show. Not for its plot, nor its action or animation. If you do watch the show though, look out for Archer. I think he's a pretty interesting character that pretty much carried the show for me.",

            "content": "When talking about Deen's anime adaption of Fate Stay Night it can be a bit tricky. When compared to its source material it doesn't do the Visual Novel justice as it attempts to splice in parts of the other two routes(Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel) into it in attempt to tell a single story.\r\nFor the most part the anime follows the Fate route which focuses mainly on its heroine Saber but at the same doesn't really have a sense of direction till much later and is bogged down by a lot of original material.\r\nThe animation quality is certainly a mixed bag but certain momentsshow some splendor but other times feel dated but I felt that the music was rather nice with a few pieces that truly stick out.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters they are not fully explored and feel that they are missing important pieces of them that define who they are to the audience. One character that suffers from poor characterization the most is its protagonist Shirou Emiya whose \"Stay in the kitchen\" tendencies are flanderized to almost comical levels that it painted a poor picture of his character from the visual novel that's not to stay he was amazing in the first route but certainly better than what was given to us here.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that its strongest moments were during its climatic finale and its portrayal of what I consider to be the visual novel's most powerful ending.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad anime its mostly average although there are those who are pretty attached to it which I can understand. In the end though I don't think its the best place to start if you are planning to jump into Fate Stay Night's world. However at the same time if you ever decide for yourself to watch it then do so as soon as you can because if you watch Fate Zero or the on going Unlimited Blade Works TV series the chances are you might have the urge to drop it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end despite its short comings its a decent little anime but I recommend you find the Visual Novel believe me its a great experience.",

While the story was pretty captivating it just couldn't hold my attention too much because i guess you can say it was pretty typical anime characteristics of the main character being CRAZY weak and through really convenient circumstances and RANDOM bursts of strength win. I thought that was pretty lame honestly, So predictable. While there are a few plot twists everything just works out too well for the main character like \"Wow, thisguy really beating me down but out of nowhere i remember what someone else says. NOW I CAN WIN&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The series is very nice too look at. Everything is put together well and looks nice. The super moves are pretty vibrant, go big budgets go but nothing new here really.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing really stuck out here other than being pretty crisp nothing sounded out of place so it was ok. Can't really say anything about it other than that BUT this series did have good voice acting I thought. The voices suited the characters pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They were ok but it was kinda annoying how the main character was weak like none other always telling people that were stronger than him not to fight. The magicians in this series weren't memorable at all. The main character was kinda lame until the end of the series which isn't acceptable in my opinion. The servants in this story were ok other than Saber and Archer. These two stuck out the most because of character development. Saber was a very enjoyable character due to how she reacts to certain situations and how she responds. Archer was well.....amazing. The coolest servant in my opinion. Cool, calm, collected. I just wished he had a bigger role because he was very cool. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was ok but nothing I would recommend or show my friends. It didn't really excel at anything. The story was too convenient for the main characters so it kinda felt lame. The fighting was ok but didn't leave a lasting impression. Ya, there were a few enjoyable moments but the whole feeling of everything just magically falling into place kinda nagged at me the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: TOO CONVENIENT!!! If your a person that likes everything working out MAGICALLY then I  definitely recommend this anime for you but for people that like suspense then well, this anime sucks in that department. I personally like plot twists that keep you hooked but when everything just happens with &quot;random luck&quot; ALL the time in favor for the main characters gets old really fast.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night is the 2006 sequel to Fate/Zero. As the UFOtable remake is airing within the next month, I figured I'd review this version to segway into the newer version.\r\nStory: Blah blah blah Holy Grail War blah blah blah *insert generic plot twist here* blah blah blah. There's your explanation of the story. Satire aside, the premise is very intriguing and the execution could have been worse. There are a few rather expected plot twists here and there, but for the most part, the Fate route of the novel (being the one this adaptation was based on) feels like a shounen with a few moremature bits. The first 10 episodes or so are very filler-ridden and really detract from the overall story. The ending, while being predictable, was very well done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is... well... bad. Even for 2006, it was bad. It was bad then, it always has been bad, it always will be bad. The character models themselves are very good, albeit rather low quality and scratchy. The fight scenes seem to be where DEEN's budget went, as they look a level above the rest of the show. They are actually very impressive for 2006, and when compared to the rest of the show, they are miles ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: The composition for this one is rather forgettable, and the voice acting for the dub is rather average. Not much to say here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are as follows: Shirou Emiya, the main character. He is a typical \"I want to save everyone\" type of character and his ideals never really change through the show. He is also a huge idiot, throwing himself at danger at the drop of a hat. Rin Tohsaka is a classmate of Shirou's who explains the Holy Grail war to him and guides him through the war. In this route, at least, I thought that her reasoning for helping Shirou was rather weak. At first, I figured she was the love interest, but nothing really ever happened with that. (Most likely because this is a visual novel and she has her own route anyways.) The last character is Saber. Saber is Shirou's servant, being a very noble and proud medieval knight. She is very stubborn in her ideals, and ends up being the series' love interest. I thought this was the weakest way to go route-wise, as Saber really belongs as her own character, not just a love interest for Shirou.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: With all its faults, I still enjoyed the series. If you have watched Fate/Zero, can't wait for UBW 2014, or don't want to play the VN, I would recommend this one to you. Although it isn't extremely well executed, it is definitely worth watching to get the idea of Fate/stay night.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is a stark contrast to Fate/Zero. It has a much lighter tone, that most likely due to the fact that 1). It is based on a harem VN and 2). It was written long before Fate/Zero, and Type-Moon's writers have much improved since then. I would recommend it to anyone who, as previously stated, has watched Fate/Zero and can't wait for Fate/stay night 2014, or if you want an easier way into the Fate series than Fate/Zero or even the VN.",

            "content": "This one's an infamous one. Fate/Stay Night was a Visual Novel written by Typ-Moon. It was really damn good. Then there was an anime adaptation and let's just say fans of the VN don't like it that much. But is it really as bad as everyone says? Let's find out.\r\nStory: \r\nThe Anime adapts the first route of the game, the Fate route, which is probably my second favorite route overall. Everything seems fine so far, but there's a problem. For whatever reason, DEEN decided to add a bunch of stuff from the other routes: Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel. So for instance, you getsome of Sakura's backstory from HF, and you also get stuff like the Caster subplot from UBW (All of it heavily abridged, mind you)\\n\r\nThe problem is that this makes the pacing slow down to a crawl, and considering the already slow pacing of the Fate route due to all of the exposition dumps, this is a massive problem. Also, it basically goes against the whole point of the Fate route and it being an otherwise straightforward story.\\n\r\nBut ultimately... it's still the Fate route, I can't stay mad at it for too long. And honestly, for everything this anime does wrong, it does something right. The emotional moments are all excellently adapted, to the point I straight up cried in the finale (I did cry in the VN, but only after seeing the Last Episode, which is basically an epilogue to the Fate route) And all of the comedic moments are mostly well done. And when it simply tires to be an adaptation of the Fate Route and nothing else, it's great. They even made a slight improvement by actually showing Archer's last stand against Berserker.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let's get the obvious out of the way: Shirou is severely simplified from his VN counterpart, who was a deconstruction of Vanilla Protgonists, which are mostly male Light Novel protagonist las nowadays. You still get some of that here, but not until the last couple of episodes, which really showcases how he's ultimately just an empty shell who despises the people around him dying instead of him. He's not terrible, but damn does the lack of his internal monologue hurt his character.\\n\r\nThe rest thankfully get a better treatment. Since the Fate route is occasionally referred to as the Saber route, it stands to reason that Saber gets a lot of development, and she does. It's amazing seeing her go from such a cold and seemingly selfless person into a warm and caring woman with seemingly selfless motives, but are ultimately selfish in nature. Her relationship with Shirou was really well done. Seeing the two go through the many trials and tribulations to acknowledge their feelings for each other (Especially Saber as she's pretty much constantly in denial about her own feelings for almost the entirety of the show) and by the end I just wanted to give them a hug.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all great too. From the hot tempered and sarcastic Rin, the callous and pragmatic Archer, the gloriously arrogant Gilgamesh, to, of course, the hound of Ireland himself, Lancer. The only character I didn't care for is Sakura, but even then, she's enough of a minor character for me to ignore it. And trust me, she is far, FAR worse once we get to Heaven's Feel because... I have issues with that route.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I complained about the lackluster animation in Berserk 1997? Well, this show's basically the same, except somehow even worse! At least Berserk was mostly on-model. Here, things go off-model very often, especially early on. It does get better towards the end, but not much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nBy contrast the soundtrack is amazing. It's basically the VN's soundtrack, but with a few glorious remixes thrown in. Yeah, its not much, but hey, the VN's soundtrack was already perfect. The openings and endings are pretty good, with \"Disillusion\" being probably my favorite of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting:\\n\\n\r\nAll of the Seiyuus from the game return and do a pretty good job. Major props to Ayako Kawasumi as Saber and Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou, as without them, Shirou and Saber's relationship wouldn't had been as good as it is. The rest do a good job too, of particular mention is Kana Ueda as Rin, for as this was her first major role and she does a great job too. Same goes for everyone else, from Hiroshi Kamiya, Tomokazu Seki, Atsuko Tanaka, Nobutoshi Canna, to even the voice of Alucard himself, Joji Nakata.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo, is Fate/Stay Night deserving of all the hate? No, not even close. However, it is ultimately a lackluster adaptation of an excellent Visual Novel. If you want to check it out, do so if you want, but really, you should just read the VN if you get the chance.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Fate/stay night\r\nPrior to watching this anime, I watched and made a review about Fate/Zero. As I finished Fate/Zero, my expectations for this anime were extremely high. I seriously thought that this would be and uber awesome anime, but boy was I wrong. It might have been a mistake in my part to watch Fate/Zero first but still, I am very disappointed. I will try not to spoil anything so please bear with me if I don\u2019t put too many details.Now before you click the not helpful button, let\u2019s get on to the review.\r\nWhile I was reading a few comments about Fate/Stay Night, some of themwere praising about how awesome it was but the way I see it, Fate/Stay Night is a highly overrated anime. To start off, the story itself seemed off. The pacing was horrible, the story was unclear, and the way it suddenly change genre in the middle of the story was just absolutely terrible. The story started off incredibly slow that I had to force myself just to get through it, hoping that it would get better somewhere in the middle. Then it did speed up in the middle, but it sped up way too much that there wasn\u2019t enough time to explain some concepts regarding the main objects of the story like the Holy Grail, noble phantasms and even the magic they use. After that it took a turn for the worse. A story focused on action suddenly takes a sharp turn and desperately tries to emulate a love story, which was just terrible. Not that I\u2019m saying that a little romance is bad but a little too much that it affects the story is not good. And just when the story was reaching its climax, the antagonist just dies and there, end of the story. It was so disappointing because just when I thought that it was getting good it suddenly ends, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a problem when it comes to the characters. The main Protagonist, Emiya was too weak. He was a pathetic excuse for a righteous hero. All he did was serve as a meat shield and a love interest for the main heroine, Saber and BAM, shit happens. Aside from that, he is also so damn stupid that it\u2019s unbearable(I mean seriously, \u201cpeople die when they are killed\u201d wtf, no shit Sherlock?). Saber in my opinion, was a good character from the start. Serious, stoic, and just badass but then Emiya makes a sacrifice for her a couple of times and from a badass character, she turns into a tsundere that blushed EVERY FUCKING TIME that she\u2019s alone with Emiya(obvious sarcasm here people). The rest of the characters are Rin, Sakura, Ilya and that other annoying woman. I only mentioned them because they weren\u2019t really given enough time to develop into proper characters. Heck, even the main antagonist, Gilgamesh and his master(won\u2019t mention the name, major spoiler) were given so little time that I never even felt like they were there. I mean like seriously, Gilgamesh, being the main antagonist was only shown in like only like six out of twenty-four episodes, SIX! And during those six episodes, he had like only 60 minutes of screen time, certainly not enough for viewers to build strong feelings for him. So when he died, it felt like nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, the graphics were terrible and so is the music although it can easily be overlooked considering that the anime was made in 2005. it can\u2019t really be judged with today\u2019s standards so i just decided to overlook it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that it really is a big disappointment in my part. As I watched Fate/Zero, my expectation was very high, only to be crushed by a mediocre anime. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, it really is an overrated anime that was a little ambitious and failed to deliver what it tried to bring. That is why I only give it a 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is my opinion and if you have anything to say, please put a comment on my page. I won\u2019t flame you if you don\u2019t agree with my review, but be prepared to defend your stand :))\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes I wonder why I shouldn't just want animes whose review were really high. That way, the chances of them being good would be much better and I don't have to sit through those animes that weren't all that great. Fate/Stay Night is one of those animes that I wished I had seen sooner because it was definitely one of the better animes out there. With high reviews from my other reviewers, it certainly not only met but exceeded my expectations.\r\nReview\r\nStory\r\n   I think after watching animes all these years, animes that combines action, magic, a little of romance and comedyare the types that I much prefer to watch. This anime fits all of those needs. With an action pacted story sequence and a slow by developing love connection, it certainly made me happy to see it contains all the elements I prefer.\\n\\n\r\n   The overall scenario of the plot isn't something new, a big fight every so years to determine the fate of the world, but it certainly has enough of its own uniqueness to prevent it from being dull. The story goes like this. A battle for the Holy Grail occurs every now and then to determine who is worthy enough to receive the Holy Grail. Upon receive the Holy Grail, the \"Master\" and the \"Servant\" are granted one wish. However, something usual happened in the last Holy Grail War that ultimately continued onto the next. What it is, I won't say to prevent any further spoiling of the plot. But imagine this, how would you react if King Authur was a female? How would you react if instead of being the King Arthur everyone looked up to, this King Authur was looked downed upon because she couldn't lead?\\n\\n\r\n   Without going into any further details (and if you haven't noticed already, most of my reviews now are very incomplete when it comes to the story), this plot of this anime is certainly worth watching. And I am not just saying that because this happens to be of the genres of animes that I liked. I am saying it because it was actually good. The plot moves on with a nice flow to it and each little thing that occurs only adds to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n   Following in the covention of most animes of this type, this anime has all the characters you would expect: a brave and noble warrior, a person whose brains are beyond normal, a character with a sad past, and a hero who is useless at the start but becomes cruicial by the end. While I end up liking most of the characters, I must say that I was not totally impressed with the development of some of them. At times, the development just seemed too slow and there are still quite a few amount of questions I have regarding these characters. Unfortunately, I will probably never get the answers to them because there doesn't seem to be a sequel of any sorts.\\n\\n\r\n   One of the things I look for in animes is how the characters interact with each other and how they got that way. Does it seem reasonable for one character to fall in love with another? What is it about that other character that would allowed this love connection. Every action has a consequence and every consequence is the product of an action. So, I really don't like animes that has one character being totally devoted to another character without some kind of reason. With that long rant aside, for the most part, I felt that this anime was able to do just that. Provide enough information that if this was real (I know, this isn't real but when it comes to human interactions, it should be), these individuals would behave the same way.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\n   Near flawless. I am actually watching other animes that were being produced at the same time as this anime and I can see a clear difference it quality between them. The characters look good and so do the surrounding. The fight scenes are well done and that makes it quite exciting. The only complaints I have is that some of the scenes were a little too dark (though it was during the night so I am just asking for too much).\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\n   The truth is, I actually heard the first opening theme of this anime a long time before I even watched it. That song was one of the best I have heard at the time and still does to this day. Really nice vocals though the lyrics doesn't really match up with the beat. The ending theme I am not too excited about but it is really bad either. The rest of the background music is good as well though I might need to get back to you on that once I get a chance to finish listening to the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n   I didn't had any complaints about the voice of the characters either. There isn't something where like other animes where some of the characters voice sounds like they are constantly whining.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\n  A very good anime by all means. Personally, I thought it could go a lot longer and from the looks of it, there does not seem to be a sequel happening in the future. Too bad because I really liked this anime. My suggestion to you who are reading this review is to watch this anime if you haven't. It will certainly be worth your time.",

            "content": "I'm not a virtual novel follower, therefore I had watched Fate/Stay Night without any basis of the show besides my own viewing of ufotable's Fate/Zero adaptation. In fact, I was unaware of anything much about this anime adaptation, and it was a rather blind pick. I'm quite glad I chose it. Being that I recently viewed this anime, I hadn't been around for the hype train that supposedly existed, therefore having no expectations. \r\nHere's my breakdown:\r\nStory: 8\r\nFollows the same Holy Grail War setting and takes place in the Nasuverse. The biggest difference I found between this and F/Z is that the setting and story ismore immature, which isn't a bad thing per se. It simply takes on a different tone. Follows a predictable yet alluring narrative which leads to an excellent climactic finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nConsidering it's a 2006 anime, the art is excellent, budget considered. Fights and characters are flashy, nothing super out of the ordinary like our recent counterpart, but solid, aesthetic animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nMusic seems to capture the essence of every scene flawlessly. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nMost people seemed to have nitpicked this the most. To be frank, I enjoyed the cliches and honestly didn't mind the lack of development in certain characters after understanding that there are different heroines in each route. Shiro, in all his cliche, \"I don't know what I'm doing but let's save the world\" character, serves as a solid staple for the basis of Rin, Saber, and Sakura. Saber is a lovely protagonist who receives much desired development from F/Z. While certain development issues do take away the 10 here, I found the characters to be memorable and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this anime. While sometimes the pacing was off, everything else was spot on for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nBy no means perfect, F/SN is a fun, immature predecessor to F/Z. If you're looking for a casual, easy, fun watching experience, F/SN is a tremendous choice.",

            "content": "Where to start... First of all I will say that I jumped into this anime with fairly high expectations even if it was adapted on a 12 year old VN 9 years ago.\r\n**Animation** there were no problems with the animations. At times I even felt chills run through my neck just cause how good the fighting was done. Overall very good especially seeing as it was from 2006.\r\n**Sound** the soundtrack is really good, and the voice acting is also really good especially if you factor in that it was originally an Visual Novel which often means worse voice actors.\r\n**Story** The story was overall well done,but at times felt like it jumped certain parts but all in all a good adaptation of a VN, something that can be hard to say nowadays.\\n\\n\r\n**Characters** For the characters, well I kind of liked them kind of didn't, i guess, I liked Rin and Saber, but the \"side\" characters that was Sakura and Taiga Fujimura felt most of the time unnecesary and simply in the way.\\n\r\nAs for the main character himself, Emiya Shirou. I simply did not like him, at all many of the times. He felt really sexist and on at the sam time he was kind of like the annoying typical shonen hero type who'd not kill anyone and do everything by himself. He felt childish and annoying.\\n\\n\r\n**Enjoyment** During the first few arcs I really had a hard time actually watching the anime, it felt mostly like a drag and it was boring to watch. But as the anime went on i grew to like it and by no means is it a bad anime, it's was just really not what I thought it would be. Something that was said very good was \" It's a 24 episode series with an animation budget for 12 episodes and a story that could have been 39 episodes long. You do the math.\" and that really is the story of the anime, Aditionally to me it also felt somewhat sexist which I personally disliked and I usually does not notice these stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all it's worth watching, if not for just this anime but for the coming sequels and cause of all the talk going on around the anime. But you should probably watch it when you have time and when you feel that there is no other anime that would take your time. \\n\r\nIn the end I give it a 7.5/10",

Although he was full of admiration for his adopted father and yearns to become an ally of justice, Shirou has limited powers and was unable to become a strong sorceror like his father. That is until one fateful day, he was drawn into the Holy Grail War and had to summon a female \"Servant\" known as Saber in order to protect himself. It turns out that theHoly Grail War involves a series of battles among powerful sorcerors to fight for the possession of a relic that will grant one's wishes, the Holy Grail. There are altogether seven &quot;Masters&quot; who can summon their respective &quot;Servants&quot; from different classes known as Saber, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Lancer, Caster and Assasin. These &quot;Servants&quot; have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies. The story revolves around Shirou and his entanglement in the Holy Grail War.\\n\r\n(From Anime News Network)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nI actually tried to watch this anime a month ago... but the first episode was not enough to keep me interested.   I had a feeling that i had dropped it too easily so i recently picked it up again. The 2nd episode was enough to get me interested.\\n\r\nOkay, so if you want a good story, pretty good characters, and some nice fights... this is the anime for you.  I mean I tried to look for something wrong w/ this anime... and I can't find one... Yet... it didn't grab me like some other stuff i've watched.  Interesting, yes... just not my kind of anime\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Zero no Tsukaima\\n\r\nRelationship btw magician master, and sword-wielding servent\\n\\n\r\n-Shaman King\\n\r\nA tournament btw supernatural players",

            "content": "Fate/stay night's anime adaptation is somewhat of a wild card in the Fate series. Some people praise it, while others bash on this adaptation. However, although not as strong as an entry as say, Zero, I still found this adaptation to be enjoyable. The main argument that comes across when talking about this series is how the visual novel is much better than the adaptation here. I myself have not played the visual novel, so this may be the result of my differing experience.\r\nStory: Fate stay/night delivers a story that is rich in detail, and deep at certain points. It has a fairly good balancebetween fights and character development, but there's one gaping thing holding it back: time. This adaptation suffers from not having enough episodes to fit certain and concise endings to the events that they want. Also, I felt that some battles ended with some sort of \"deus-ex machina\" sort of thing, where one thing ends the battle very quickly. However, if you look past this, the story itself is very well handled and executed, albeit with flaws.\\n\\n\r\nArt: From a modern perspective, the art obviously shows some age. But in a perspective from 2006, the art is amazing. The animation is slightly choppy at times, but it's probably the best that I've seen from that year. There's not much else I can say here, so I'll move onto Sound.\\n\\n\r\nSound: What can I say? Voice acting is high quality. The music is also what you'd expect from a Fate series title, and captures the moment. I also like the first opening, a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: With character, the show seems to fall behind a little.The main characters are developed as always, but what seems to lack is in the supporting cast. Whereas the later entries into the series show promise in all characters, once a character has filled their role in hindering the plot, this show just tosses them aside. Illya went from an actual threat to a random kid that Shirou had to deal with until the war ended, which could have been part of the VN, but I felt that she could have been used for more. I also felt the Kotomine wasn't really used effectively here. Although realised in Zero, here, he's more or less a final boss trope that doesn't have any real story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There were some hindrances that did impede on my experience, but overall this show was engaging and very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're a fan of the Fate series, I do recommend you watch this show, although with an open mind. However, I would not say that this is a good first entry. But, if you're in a mood to watch anything, consider giving this a try.",

            "content": "To 'Fate/Stay Night',\r\nYou were the first anime I ever watched and I used to absolutely love you, and your soundtrack stands as one of the most atmospheric in anime for me to this day! However, you haven't aged well at all. Your animation's very clunky and the details are lacking much of the time. I was willing to forgive you, but you're just so barren of events. You try to deliver a slow character-intensive thrilling experience, but you just absolutely fail to deliver. Rin stands as an exposition dump this time around for basically the entire series. The characters basically just voice their worries, howgood the food is, and how clueless the MC is in every conversation. I also didn't remember your romance being as ham-fisted as it was. As I have a lot of nostalgia for you, I did find a bit of charm in it, but I knew every second that I was dealing with some cheesy and hilarious stuff. How Saber is portrayed is part of the problem, she's like an emotionless robot. And why did they all have to be eating whenever there was a long conversation, and why was Sakura even there? You're just too oldie otaku-pandering for me nowadays with all your plot skin-ship fanservice and the way in-which Saber says \"master\" to the MC like a maid.\\n\\n\r\nThere needs to be more action, more focus on drama beyond Shirou's clearly-flawed ideals. You're just an anime for a younger me I suppose. But I have to say, if anyone else read this, that if they typed in \"Unmei no Yoru\" on YouTube and listened to it, that there is no anime in existence that will come to my mind but you. Some of your soundtracks are just so perfect for the setting, and I should mention the start was actually pretty well-done (around the first 3-4 episodes). There is also a few cool and interesting moments, but you're just too flawed of an experience for me to lend you more than a 4/10...\\n\\n\r\nA review with love,\\n\r\nPiegoose\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Watch the first 3 episodes, than the Unlimited Blade Works movie for a 7/10 experience",

            "content": "The story of Fate/Stay Night is deceptively simple, but it's the many events that make the show a little bit more complex than it might seem like. Naturally, the meat-and-gravy parts are generally related to the battles the players will have to engage in during the war. But Fate/Stay Night also seems to relish keeping -- and eventually revealing -- secrets. Expect a lot of \"the truth isn't quite like it seems at first\" scenes to pop in every now and then, especially as the show draws to a close. Allignment shifts are almost a given during the many face-offs, some of which might comeacross as more ridiculous than the others.\\n\\n\r\nIn another note, the battles are generally nice to look at. Most of them are actual physical combat, and since we are talking about characters that generally adhere to their given summoning names -- Saber, Archer, Lancer, Assassin -- battles do take on different flairs from time to time. There are a few cases of \"my schwarz is bigger than yours\" kamehameha\u2122 fights near the end, but thankfully, those are few and generally quickly over with. The anime also ends conclusively, which is another thing to be thankful about, although titles that generally overstay their welcome mostly center around harem or big shounen fight titles, wherein Fate/Stay Night might fit into both in some way, but only barely so.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I enjoyed this show. Even if I had to resort to reading Wiki articles and the likes about the characters to get the full picture, I see no reason why I should consider Fate/Stay Night any less than good, if not great, entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nFights, secrets, plots -- it's enough of either in here to make most people happy, I should think.\\n\\n\r\nShirou is a self-styled Champion of Justice. Not of the mask-wearing, cape-sporting variety, but of the quietly helpful, self-sacrificing, unyieldingly principled variety. The only survivor of a tragedy that cut a swath of destruction through his town ten years earlier, he witnesses an altercation between two supernaturally skilled warriors, and is soon drawn into a battle between seven magi and their seven Servants, resurrected legendary warriors from around the world. Paired with a powerful female Servant known only as Saber, Shirou must take his place as the seventh, and last, of the magi.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended Audience: Naturally, there'll be violence, even a little bit bloody one. The redstuffs doesn't splatter all over the place, though, but viewer caution is recommended. There's also some darker imagery regarding a shield of some sort meant to drain students of mana, which has.... bad consequences for a local school. In other words, nothing too excessive.\\n\\n\\n",

I mean it looks terrible. The studio could have done much better but some characters just look plain awful. And the CG dragon was just looked retarded.\r\nAnd then the story. Mixing the Fate Route, Unlimited Blade Works Route, and Heaven's Fell Route just doesn't work. It would have been much better had itbeen three seasons, each season dedicated to a different route.

Everything was perfect. Especially Archer's voice during the fight with Berserker.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good, although the development is lacking. This may be due to the fact it is not as descriptive as a book, but it could also be that some characters, especially Sakura, don't get enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it though. A lot of moments were really cool and the fights were the most well done parts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this, then go buy the Visual Novel, it is SOO much better and you will love it.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I base my overall ratings on emotional impact, therefore the final score of this review will be highly subjective. However, with individual ratings I try to be more objective.\r\nThis is also coming from someone who has not read the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, or seen/read any other Fate/ related media.\r\nArt \u2013 9\r\nThis probably deserves a 10, but I just couldn\u2019t get past the fact that some of the wider scenes just looked so odd because the character quality diminished. Obviously this is because you can only draw so much detail on an A4(?) piece of paper and the fact that the rest of theart is incredibly high caliber makes it\u2019s shortcomings forgiveable.\\n\\n\r\nI really appreciated the close up shots of the servants, especially saber. So much has gone into her character design and the metallic look of her armour is just superb. The character designs are original and really nice to look at too, without conforming to any particular style.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a couple of 3D scenes which look awful but I can\u2019t rate this any less than a 9 because it looked so fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 10\\n\r\nI\u2019ll just leave this here\u2026 (minor spoilers as to a servant saber fights, but just watch that from 36 seconds for a bit, it\u2019s insane)\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVJKo4nMaTo#t=00m36s\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nThere should be an extra tier just for Fate/Stay Night\u2019s music; it\u2019s absolutely incredible.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night\u2019s soundtrack consists mostly of stunningly beautiful vocals and clarinets, which really sells the medieval fantasy feel surrounding Saber. La Sola, the vocal piece that plays during the (intricately constructed) final scene is just beautiful. This is - in my opinion - the best vocal piece of music I have ever heard and in terms of anime is more beautiful than Elfen Lied's opening, Lilium. Also of note is Mozart\u2019s Lacrimosa, sung by a single vocalist which is absolutely mesmerising. Considering the entire soundtrack manages to be on par with a Mozart piece, I'm just shocked.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nNow this is a very controversial topic but in all honesty I can't pick any glaring faults in Fate/Stay Night's story. I thought Fate/Stay Night had a really solid story up until about episode 16. The lore is a great strong suit of this show. Having all the servants rooted in history makes this so much more relatable and makes who Saber actually is, that much cooler.\\n\\n\r\nNow I won\u2019t lie, I don\u2019t watch this show primarily for the action, I watch Fate/Stay Night because of the romance. I particularly appreciate the use of subtext, which is not often used in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t give away who the couple is, but this is one of the few anime where you cannot immediately pick the couple. You might, but it\u2019s not blatantly suggested and it takes the entire length of the show for the romance to build which is perfect. Too often in anime romance just happens way too quickly but in Fate/Stay Night it is paced perfectly, building and building in an exponential way before the beautiful, beautiful payoff at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed (also that many anime fail at) is that Fate/Stay Night uses violence to great effect. It only uses the exact right amount for the amount of emotion it wants to elicit. There is one particular scene towards the end \u2013 now I won\u2019t go into detail, but needless to say, it\u2019s one of the most violent scenes in the show which heightens the emotion of the scene, creating one of the most powerful scenes in the whole show. It has some very, very memorable scenes and I'm honestly not sure why people don't appreciate its merits for what they are.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure what people are on about when they say the pacing was off, I\u2019m thinking those people were just impatient that there wasn\u2019t an epic action scene each episode. This series has one of the best uses of foreshadowing I\u2019ve ever seen. Things are revealed, but out of context and as such, nothing is spoiled but makes it that much more amazing when the foreshadowing is paid off. I very much like the almost slice-of-life feel towards the start of the show and the transition into a more action-oriented style towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nI thought this series was paced really well and really tightly written for a 24 episode series. Generally anime over 12 or 13 episodes tend to have little bits of filler here and there, but everything included in Fate/Stay Night advanced the story and/or the characters; nothing was out of place.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll finish this section with the comment that the ending was kind of clich\u00e9, which really saddened me because I loved every other element of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nShirou. Everyone seems to hate him and that may be because at first, he seems clich\u00e9. But one thing Studio DEEN did to help this was have people mock him and have the world disagree with his hero complex. Furthermore, at least his motivation was clear as to why he wanted to be a clich\u00e9 \u2018champion of justice\u2019. Also, having watched the dub (which was really quite good; Kate Higgins was born to play Saber), I didn't get any of the 'people die when they are killed' nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThe same was with the main bad guy (I won\u2019t name names), though I really didn\u2019t like him. He had his motivation, but I just couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was really clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nSaber was really interestingly written. I love the way she seems stoic and emotionless, yet she\u2019s actually a very complex character with inner and outer conflict.\\n\\n\r\nRin was just great. And I think I\u2019ll end it there, whew\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEmotional impact/Enjoyment \u2013 10\\n\r\nWhile this review may be more subjective because Fate/Stay Night was one of the first anime I watched, I still enjoy it immensely. I'm absolutely befuddled as to why people think it's so average. Just watch the final scene, with La Sola playing and TRY not to cry.",

The ending wasn't really all that cliche as most typical stories of the same genre, it had a sort of brilliance and epic foresight with in the final moments. Fate Stay Night is one of those story where it pull you know and gets you involved in the story. When it's over you just seem to want more and more cause of the attachment you make over the episodes. Fate StayNight is a gem of anime and an anime lover would be a fool to not watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is exceptionally original in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound literally blew me away on how well it matched into the scenes\\n\\n\r\nThe Character development was excellent.

            "content": "So I decided to review this 'cause it's really overrated and wanted people to know it's overrated.  Anyways...\r\n___CHARACTERS___\r\nAny story needs good characters to carry a good story, however no matter how good the story is, if the characters suck so will the story. This is the case with Fate/Stay Night. Most of the characters are flat with little to no character development. Let me breakdown some of the main characters so you have an understanding as to why they suck.\r\nShirou: Weirdly both the best and worst character in the anime. Let me explain what I mean. He gets the most character development, he findshis reasons to fight and why he wants the grail so he isn't bad in that respect. However I find it really hard to sympathize  and root for this guy because he totally unrealistic and annoying (This is subjective so guess this is why people might like this anime.). He will help help anyone out at all costs and doesn't even remotely care about his life. It's taken to the extreme when (Spoilers)  he pushes Saber out the way of a fatal blow and sacrifices himself. The thing is though he has known her for less than a day (End). I really could go on and on about his MANY flaws and self-contradictions but I think I will move on.\\n\\n\r\nRin: Honestly she wasn't bad but she practically zero character development. Did she love Shirou? Why did she want the grail? Why does she even help him? I guess I will never know.\\n\\n\r\nArcher: LOL. This guy is considered a main character. All his screen time consists of are a few fights and those where he tells Shiro he is a little bitch with silly ideals.\\n\\n\r\nSaber: She is probably the best character. Wants to get shit done and  somewhat decent character development. Not much else to say really.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else: Awful, just awful. No character development and really generic. Hell one bad guys reason for fighting for the grail is \"I want the grail 'cause I can and I don't mind murdering thousands of people for it\".Truth be told he didn't actually say that but he might as well of.\\n\\n\r\n___STORY___\\n\\n\r\nThis was really poor. For a seven way battle it is rather convenient that all the bad guys line themselves up for Shirou and Saber to beat one by one. It's frustrating to watch as I know they can't lose so it takes away all the tension and build-up.\\n\\n\r\n Example (Spoilers): Saber is fighting that big guys with all those lives (his name has alluded me sorry :P) and is losing badly. Doesn't mean shit 'cause it ends up Shirou is so op that he can make anything with his mind that can beat anyone instantly. *Facepalms*\\n\\n\r\nIt's a Harem.\\n\\n\r\n___ART//SOUND___\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say because they weren't bad at all, actually decent. I guess the most notable thing is that the op was good, not amazing but still somewhat memorable.\\n\\n\r\n___CONCLUSION___\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this? Maybe if you don't think Shirou annoying douchebag. I want to say that I LOVE Fate/Zero and i think that it is truly brilliant and it's a shame that it has any connection to Fate/Stay Night. Glad I could finally get this off my chest :P\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so feedback would great. Thanks for reading.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching Fate/Stay Night I have this urge to write a review just to put my thoughts in order. \r\nThe reason I rate it 6 (if not lower) is because I fell in the hype-trap. EVERYONE kept telling me watch the Fate series, thus my expectations for it went through the roof. That explains its downfall in my rating score. If I didn't consider it to be a must-watch anime, then my score prooobably would have been higher. But hey, the higher you get the harder you fall. \r\nStory: 8\r\nFor me the story was the best element in the anime. We've seen before in otheranime the formula of gathering several warriors/people to fight for a prize (Mirai Nikki, Btooom etc) but this time it's being done with the help of ancient heroes. As a Greek I must say, including Greek mythology in an anime was quite exciting and I really liked the small twists they made to those myths, otherwise it would have been proper plagarism and not really exciting to watch. Anyways, every ten years or so, 7 heroes appear to the world in order to acquire the Holy Grail- a chalice that will grand any wish you want. To get it, they have to kill each other until only one hero stands. However, every hero makes a pact with a Master (someone who can use magic) and together they try to win the Holy Grail War. And here comes our Main Character Emiya Shirou, who by pure luck (later we'll find out its his super thick plot armor) summons Saber, a swordswoman who was a hero of the past. \\n\\n\r\nThat pretty much it for the plot. Tried to avoid any spoilers so I hope it doesn't seem too boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about Shirou, the Naruto of Fate/stay night. Like Naruto yelling SASUKE all the time, Shirou screams \"SABER\" every single episode. And ironically enough, the voice actor of Shirou is the same aaaas.....Sasuke! \\n\\n\r\nThe short version is that Shirou has a DEATHWISH!! Can't explain it any other way. He has a super powerful hero to assist him and all he does is WALK AROUND THE CITY WITHOUT HER PROTECTING HIM. Like hell man, he knows the other masters want to kill him and he decides to wander unprotected. Btw he is useless too the max, can't use magic, fails all the time and drags others along with his stupidity. And the annoying part is the show tries to portay him as a justice protector who will fight evil whenever he sees it. Well sh*t, his actions show the complete opposite. Super impulsive, NEVER EVER asks for help and in the end EVERYTIME he needs help and ignores other peoples' warnings. And no, it's not like he goes alone fights the bad guy, inflicts serious damage and then he needs help. If it was a game he goes from Full HP to 1 (several times 0 ) in a matter of seconds and the opponent doesn't even get a scar.\\n\\n\r\nAll this of course get overshadowed by his UNBELIEVINGLY UNPENETRATABLE SUPER THICK PLOT ARMOR. You know he is the MC when he dies and revives dies and revives. As for his character, not really much to say, he is your average Shonen hero with little or no character development. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the female protagonist, Saber's character is muuuuch better than Shirou's. Although her character development happens through flashbacks, they get justified with her decisions. I'm afraid I will spoil too much so I better stop here. Just so you know she is Overpowered ;)\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters in the series (duh) but they get little backstory to explain their actions so you just have to go with the flow and accept their decisions and behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nI will only say this... Have you seen a CG dragon before. If not be psychologically and mentally prepared. If yes please try to remember it, because this one will make you question even more human decision... Other than than, the art was neither good nor bad. It was what it was :p \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7\\n\\n\r\nFor sure if you have ever heard an anime OST compilation you would have heard the Fate soundtrack. It is so good and powerful that makes boring scenes interesting and stupid Shirou moments exciting. It doesn't get a 10 because it feels it's being recycled again and again in the anime. You will hear the same fight music in pretty much every fight but damn it's good music :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it for its unique plot, awesome soundtrack and in my opinion Saber saved the whole series. If not for her I would wish Shirou was the main villain so he gets killed in the most epic way. But of course this idiot will not die because of his ENORMOUS PLOT ARMOR. Yes the anime has many plot holes and unexplained stuff but I guess it's ok?! I would suggest to avoid the hype at least for Fate/Stay Night and go with a clear mind. Otherwise you will fall sooo hard you will probably hate the whole Fate series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as the amazing Shirou says \"People die if they are killed\"",

It told a story of a game of life and death. The players were divers. Coming from all over the globe, they ranged from Assassins, and naive teenagers, to child murders and people trying to save their family. They were paired with some of the greatest heroes/villains from history and were forced to fight. The game was brutal. Even if you lost the game, and try to walk away, you're still not safe.\r\nWhen I heard there was a sequel, I was superexcited. I shouldn't have been. The ultimate battle to the death turned into a stupid children squabble. Literally! Just about all the contestants were prepubescent children with unstable emotions. It was more a shitty high school love story than an actual fight. And for some stupid reason, they just happen to be from the same area in Japan. What is up with that.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion. If you haven't watched Fate/Zero, I would recommend you go watch that first. And if you have, I would recommend you not watch this pitiful excuse for a sequel.",

            "content": "Finished this anime a few days ago and I must say I was utterly disappointed by the series.I really liked the Fate/Zero and Fate/SN:UBW series so I though of giving this anime a shot too but I deeply regret that.\r\nArt and Animation: 4/10\r\nThe art and animation is pretty decent but its really horrible compared to the any other fate series which right of the bat added a negative point to this anime for me. Many of you may not agree with me but to me the animation just felt like an eyesore to me.\r\nSound: 2/10\r\nI didn't like the op and ed tracks but the soundtrackswhich played during the fight were so pathetic to listen to and I don't think there was a single ost from the anime which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are so damn annoying from this anime especially our protagonist Shirou.Maybe I wouldn't have hated them so much if I haven't watched Fate/Zero and Fate/SN:UBW cause this series literally shitted over their characters especially on Saber character. \\n\r\nSo lets first start with the mc\\n\r\nShirou Emiya - He is a person who puts other before himself and wants to  be a hero of justice. He will help anyone who asks him no matter even if they are only using him like rider's master once did (forgot that dumbass's name already) which is kind of annoying but leaving that aside the bigger problem is that he jumps in to help other even when he himself knows he won't be of any use. \\n\r\nHe never seems to understand his limits and jumps in to protect other even when he knows that he won't be of any help and would end up dying in vain like when he jumps in the fight between Saber and Beserker and almost ends up dying while being of zero help. If Illya wouldn't have stopped after Shirou jumped in the battle b/w Besrker and Saber, Saber would have surely died and thus his death would have been in vain. \\n\\n\r\nSaber - She was a mature woman in the other series but for the sake of the dumb romance b/w her and Shirou she is changed into a dumb dead pan airhead which is seriously annoying. (I know that this is a different anime and all but still can't ignore this shit)\\n\\n\r\n***Some of my complains with the story***\\n\r\n1. Why does Rin keep on helping Shirou even after Archer dies ? Their alliance is broken now and its not like they love each other neither is clear whether she loves him or not. There is practically no reason for her to keep on helping him and put her life in dqanger as they were not even friends to begin with.\\n\\n\r\n2. Saber takes magical circuits from Shirou but that seems to have no effect on him. His magical abilities didn't seem to be affected one bit but rather his projection magic keeps on getting better and better for no fucking reason.\\n\\n\r\n3. Why does Illya starts living with Shirou and exactly why is she in love with him? Just why? Can you please give me one fucking reason.\\n\\n\r\n4. Whenever Gilgamesh attacks with his noble phantasms how does all the swords and spears change to fucking light beams ;-;\\n\\n\r\n5. In episode 21 Saber is knocked out almost dead by Gilgamesh and is just as good as dead but after hearing some bullshit spouted by our mc gets up after about 4 minutes as if nothing happened to her -_-\\n\\n\r\n6. Literally wtf was that in ep 21 during 12:06 , how does the strike from Ea got reflected back. I still can't wtf was the golden shining shit Shirou projected but no matter what it was there is no way that replica made by him and the excalibur together could match up to Gilgamesh's ANTI-UNIVERSE NOBLE PHANTASM EA -_-\\n\\n\r\n7. How the fuck did Shirou defeat Kirei? T_T Kirei was been stronger than him in every aspect then how was he able to do so ?\\n\\n\r\n8. In the last episode Gilgamesh dies with just one blow from Saber sword while she was able to survive strikes from the fucking Ea -_-\\n\\n",

It had a good amount of action with some romance in the side, and had some laughs, though knew when to quit and get serious, maybe even sorrowful.\r\nArt: I think the art was outstanding. Everything was in full detail, from the serious battles to the small cute immature conversations. It really caught my eye, hope it catches yours.\r\nCharacter: At some points in the story, the characters behaviors made no sense and sometimes just plain annoyed me, but over all, I think they had good personalities. There were different people, who almost all of which (even themost serious ones), made me laugh alittle, but they could be serious.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly loved this anime, though I wouldn't rank it my favorite. It had action, good quality, romance, and some incredibly depressing momments. It has almost all the things I'd find in a good anime, but it wasn't exactly so great that I'd name it my top, TOP favorite. But it was still spectacular, so I would suggest you watch it.",

But even the ending was great though heartwrenchingb/c I really liked Saber and I was hoping it was gonna work out w/ her and Shiro.\\n\\n\r\nBut, then again, a good anime should have an ending.

            "content": "This maybe will be a little big review,because i have a lot to say about this anime.\r\n**SOME SPOILERS ALERT**\r\nFirst of all,in my opinion this anime is amazing,it's my favourite one.\r\nSo let's start about the story,it's very dramatic and fun at the same time,the Fate Zero is more serious anime than Fate/Stay Night,but it don't mean that it isn't good,even rather it's better than the F/Z,because the main story of the love between shirou and saber is just awesome,it's first time that this happens,a love between a master and a servant,and they 2 are just great together.The story in general is awesome,when they show true friendshipto fight other servants,and protect each other(like they protected Illyasviel),and it's just crazy how they first hates each other(because their main objective is the Holy Grail),but when they become friends and discover each other,they just don't want that Grail for nothing,they only want to destroy him,because they only want peace,and be good friends.\\n\r\nThe should have explained more of the life of each character (like Illya).\\n\r\nAbout the other main characters,the Rin is a great help for Shirou for all the anime,but sometimes i just had the felling that they felt in love to each other,she helps him almost all the time,and almost dies ;(\\n\r\nIn F/SN we don't discover almost anything about Archer,because he is a mistery,we don't even know his name,the only thing that we know about him is that he is very powerfull and have many hougus(If you want to discover his idenity,and know more about the life of Rin,Shirou and Archer,you should watch the Fate Unlimited Blade Works,which explains all this stuff),and archer appears only a few times for a small period of time,which gives us the ideia that he isn't usefull(not important at all),but when he saves the Rin,Shirou and Saber from Berserker,he prooves us that he is very important in this story,even that we don't discover a lot about his identify,he still saves them from death.\\n\r\nSo if i'm talking about the main characters let's talk a little bit more about Saber,in the beginning of the anime she is a little bit strage,because she only wants the Holy Grail,because then she can correct her mistakes from the past(like chose a better king for her kingdom,because she thinks that she doesn't deserve to be a king,and that she don't have any feelings to the people of her kingdom.But at the middle of the anime she starts thinking about that maybe she is wrong,and she don't need the Grail to go o the past to correct her mistakes and she need to live now her life,because what was done that was done,and she can't correct that(Shirou is always saying that to Saber).At almost the end of the anime she change her mind because shirou tells her that he loves her (and she loves him too),and she discovers the truth abouth the Grail,and she \"discovers\"(she always knew that but she was like hidding that)that she don't want to fight,because then more people will die.\\n\r\nLet's talk about the graphics,the graohics of the anime are like old, compared to Fate Zero,but maybe it's just because from the site that i dowloaded the anime (which came in a \"bad resolution\",704x396),but now i'm downloading the Licensed Blu Ray version of F/SN and it should be much better (it's 1920x1080 xD).\\n\r\nNow i will talk about the most stupid part of the all anime....THE ENDING...\\n\r\nThe ending is very bad because Saber tells to Shirou that he will chose what she will do,or she destroy the Graal and disappear or she drinks from it and stay forever with him,this is the stuppid part,because Shirou says \"If i love her i will let her go\",so he says her to destroy the Graal.One curiosity is that when the Saber tells him that he will decide she just turn around and smiles.So that means that she desired to stay with him,but on the other side she desires to to go and change the past.But he makes the fu** choice,and his choice is to destroy the Grail..... ;(\\n\r\nIn the \"past\" of the Saber in the end of her battle when she dies,she tells to Bedivere that she had a dream,and before he dies he also says to Bedivere \"I think that my dream now will be a little longer\",so i think that she liked the dream and she would like to continue it(i mean that she wanted to stay with Shirou),but shirou is just stupid );\\n\r\nI hope there will be a \"To Be Continued\" about the life of saber,and she would come back to shirou,and they would be togetther and fight new servants and new masters(or something different,but they need to be together) ;)",

            "content": "The Video Review is up, but here is the written Review\r\nI\u2019ve never played any of these games before, so please, I\u2019m sorry if I make terrible judgement, but I plan on playing them if I can find it.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nFate/Stay night setting is based in a fictional city in Japan, known as Fuyuki. There is are war going on between 7 masters and their servant for the ultimate wish granting chalice known as the Holy Grail. Shirou Emiya, a normal student, with little magical knowledge gets himself forcibly dragged into the war after witnessing 2 heroic spirits clash in duel, and being chased down byone of them, nearly gets himself killed, until he accidentally summoned, his own servant, Saber. \\n\\n\r\nNow here is my simple explanation of what the Holy Grail is, because it\u2019s vaguely described in the anime. Masters summoned powerful heroic spirits, known as servants. Now servants are ranges of different characters from history. So you have heroes from different times clash against one another for the Holy Grail, an ultimate wish granting device that lets you wish for anything. The grail is given to the final Master and Servant that is left standing, now obtaining something that\u2019s gives you any wish is worth dying for.\\n\\n\r\nAfter learning all this, Shirou enters the war in order stop innocent people from getting involved in the collateral damage due to the servants fighting. He also fights because he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to get hurt, especially his own servant Saber. The story follows Shirou and Saber\u2019s relationship, where Shirou constant views differs from Saber.  \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Fate/Stay Night story, is that it doesn\u2019t explain itself very well. The Holy Grail war itself is not explained very well, and that could get confusing to some people. Because there is magic in the world, they keep, adding something to magic, because magic. The whole lore and setting on Fate/Stay Night is vaguely explained and can get really confusing at points. Also there are a lot of points in the story, where they keep adding something and never explaining it, that is somewhat fixed after the prequel was made, but keep in mind this was made before the prequel existed, However despite that confusing point, it\u2019s an interesting concept, because it has the ability to take different heroes from different eras and have them fighting one another, to see who\u2019ll win. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character and biggest idiot of the show, is Shirou Emiya. Shirou is an idiot, even though he is a good guy at heart, willing to go to lengths to protect and help people, it\u2019s frustrating to the point when you can see he doesn\u2019t have to do it. For too long in series, he doesn\u2019t seem to take the Holy Grail War seriously, he doesn\u2019t seem to understand it\u2019s a death game, literally people are trying to kill you. And yet he doesn\u2019t let Saber fight and he gets in way of fights, because he is an inexperience mage. He does in the end, change a bit and learns what\u2019s it really like to help others, however that path takes a while.\\n\\n\r\nSaber the other main character and Shirou\u2019s servant, is considered the more powerful class of servants. She is fighting in the Holy Grail war to fulfill her wishes, which is similar to Shirou. She can hold her own very well, except for the fact she is limited by Shirou\u2019s ability as a Master, because he cannot give her as much as a fully fledged mage could, so she ends up resting for a long time. Saber is a very serious character, she wants to get the job done, but Shirou won\u2019t really let her, because she is a girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that gets attention is Rin Tohsaka. The master of Archer class servant. Rin plays the role as a mentor for Shirou, for he is a novice in magic, she teaches him the basics of magic and the ups and downs of the Holy Grail War. I find the problem with her character is that, she is never really given any proper explanation for working with Shirou in the first place, she is perfectly capable herself to win the grail, as she is considered an outstanding mage at that. I don\u2019t feel like her character was given much motivation in the Holy Grail war or why was she really in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is follows are path that really focuses on the relationship between Shirou and Saber. Because of Shirou\u2019s naivety of the Holy Grail war and his method of fighting in the war conflicts with Saber, you see them really build bond overtime, where they both respect each other, takes a while before anything really happens though. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters in the Holy Grail war have their own motivations for being in the war. And I\u2019m glad that they don\u2019t have a generic attitude of wanting the Holy Grail for greed or anything, you see their past lives and explanation on wanting the Holy Grail, however, I don\u2019t think they were given enough screen time to make them all that interesting. The show focused so much on Shirou, all the other characters felt like they were lining up to fall to the hands of Saber in a way. However come later towards later in the season, comes a villain, I adore so much. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 6/10, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched ufotable\u2019s rendition of the Fate series, you\u2019ll know how much different and worst this adaptation is to that. Granted it was made back in 2006, but you can see the animation being very average. It looks alright when they are still images, because it felt really like a visual novel, but when the characters start moving, it doesn\u2019t feel completely right and natural. However there is the exception of some action scenes looking pretty good, although not the most amazing thing I\u2019ve seen in that era. And is it me, but do all the characters seem to have a chubby feel to them. And I know Saber\u2019s sword is supposed to be invisible, but when you see her fighting with it, it genuinely looks bad because it just looks the like the animators were lazy to add a sword there, it just looks stupid at times. Plus who thought it was a good idea to put a horribly 3D rendered dragon in, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say too much about the sound, because I don\u2019t think they were that good to listen to. The music suits the setting that they\u2019re in, but it\u2019s not as recognizable, and feels kind of generic. Except some fighting scenes soundtrack sound like a step towards achieving something. Plus I find the opening of themes and ending theme of Fate/Stay Night, kind of boring. It doesn\u2019t really setup for an epic fantasy action series, the 2nd op to an extent, but not much.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I would say, you\u2019re probably not going to like Fate/Stay Night if you\u2019ve seen ufotable\u2019s adaptation of Fate/Zero. I really enjoyed this show because we get see fantasy heroic characters come to life and battle it out with one another. I also enjoy seeing how these characters from different Eras interact with people of the present, giving them some personality to them. And plus since I did watch Fate/Zero first, I did get a some satisfaction, on watching some of the characters I knew from Fate/Zero make an appearance, even though some of it is not that relating, cause it\u2019s a different company. It\u2019s a really cool concept, I enjoyed watching.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6.5\\n\\n\r\nAs for my final verdict. I give the story of Fate/Stay Night a 6, because there were too many times where the story really drags and doesn\u2019t explain much on the lore itself, making it rather confusing. However I do like the concept of it, you just need to explain that concept clearer next time.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I give it a 7, because Shirou is an idiot and takes a while to develop. However the relationship between Shirou and Saber gets interesting, because the more they interact with each other more they learn from each other, and Saber being a mysterious character an all. The supporting cast got their small time to shine, but it was short lived. \\n\\n\r\nFor animation and sound, I give them a 6 each. Because the animation at times looks alright, but then it can look rather average, and uninteresting. The action scenes look fine, when they get it right, however some sequences look stupid, like Saber\u2019s invisible sword fights, plus that 3D rendered dragon. The sound is kind of generic, they do their job, and opening themes do get into your head over time, however, I find it really hard to love it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7. Because I really like the concept and enjoy watching these characters interact and fight each other. I enjoyed the story, it did take a while, but I did enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nFor my final score, I give Fate/Stay Night a 6.5/10. It\u2019s an above average anime, but it doesn\u2019t compare to its other anime adaptation. Once you get your head wrapped around the lore, the story and characters get interesting. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you watch this show, if you are planning to watch all the Fate series anyway, however it\u2019s okay to start with this one, then watch Ufotable\u2019s work. However you don\u2019t necessarily need to watch this one to get into the Fate series as well, it\u2019s skip able.  I can also recommend this to fans of action fantasy anime, as I believe the concept itself will sell, because it\u2019s watching your fantasy heroes clash against one another.\\n",

            "content": "I have to say fate/stay night didn't quite make my expectation. With its rating on MAL as 8, I had expected an anime that speaks 'Wow' to me. Instead, I found an anime that said 'watch me because I'm just popular'.\r\nStory: The plot starts off quite interesting. Introducing the Holy Gail War where seven servants and masters are to fight each other. There are many elements in this anime which become utter confusion for me. It might have been just my incapability to understand such complicated situations. \r\nArt: In fate/stay night, the art didn't really cut to me. When I look into the characters' eyes,I always feel an emptiness radiating from them. Although I have to say the animation during the fights has been one of the only things that impressed me. Ah, the fights, well I didn't think they have been put at the right time in the story. Often, they have come quite unexpectedly in an anti-climatic way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending themes are quite fitting. The sountracks used are also quite appropriate. But none of the sounds really stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I didn't really like any of the characters apart from Ilya who is just totally adorable. In general, I find the characters in fate/stay night to be quite flat. Although, most of the main characters appear to be strong physically, which is demonstrated through the numerous fights, I feel that they are kind of weak in the heart. Fate/stay makes a lot of references to well-known historical and legendary figures.This aspect of the anime makes it interesting but the let down is that not much of each character has been thoroughly explored.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't feel that there was much enjoyment in this anime. I absolutely agree to those who have called this anime overrated. I guess that might have been due to the fact that it has been dubbed and aired in many different countries. On the other hand, I find the prequel to fate/stay night, called fate/zero, to be a lot more interesting. If you really enjoy watching the fantasy genre then you might consider watching fate/stay night.",

            "content": "So it\u2019s been nearly a decade since the release of Fate/stay night and its reputation has greatly fallen since then. If you\u2019re reading this review, you\u2019ve most likely heard how atrocious this is compared to ufotable\u2019s Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV)\u2026 Well, as an average anime viewer without extremely high expectations, I can say that this adaptation isn\u2019t the best, but isn\u2019t exactly all that bad\u2026\r\n----------------\r\nStory (6): The story takes place in Fuyuki City and depicts the events of the 5th Holy Grail War, following the characters Emiya Shirou and Saber. To simplify things, the Holy Grail War is a deadly battleroyale where seven people (usually mages) and their summoned Servants duel each other for the Holy Grail, a device that can grant wishes. (Or you could you read the synopsis\u2026) \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the low score isn\u2019t really contributed by the simple premise of the series, but it\u2019s really predictable with a few twists here and there. Essentially, this \u201cbattle royale\u201d isn\u2019t really much of an actual battle royale\u2026 The main cast of Shirou and Saber (Arturia Pendragon) just defeat one foe after another through miraculous and confusing feats. In addition, a great chunk of the show is contributed to explaining how the Holy Grail War works and the way their world works. Yet, in the end, the anime still leaves the viewer confused on the relationships between many of the characters, the way magic works, and other matters concerning the story.\\n\\n\r\nI could continue to rant on minor mistakes within the plot, but it couldn\u2019t change the fact that the story is structured quite well and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The episodes really tied nicely into each other, and the ending was particularly tear-jerking and filled with emotion. The series was filled with satisfying fight sequences, and did a great job in implementing the variety of emotions within it, like humor or grief.\\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nCharacters (5): To me, this field is where the anime is lacking. Granted, the characters all do have their unique personality, wishes, backgrounds, and designs (e.g. Shirou and his wish to become a hero of justice, Saber and her wish to find a better individual to become King of Britain), but most of the characters aren\u2019t really featured much and don\u2019t really have much character development. It is further broken down into 3 more categories.\\n\\n\r\nMain Cast (7): \\n\r\nSaber \u2013 Saber is, without a doubt, my favorite female character in all of anime. She is nothing close to being the stereotypical female character, as a legendary warrior of high moral code. She is a rough, straightforward person, but she isn\u2019t your average stoic warrior, as she embodies a softer side that is shown as well. Saber is really the only character who changes across the course of the show, and in my opinion, is the main driving force behind the show.\\n\\n\r\nEmiya Shirou \u2013 \u201cPeople die if they are killed.\u201d Shirou isn\u2019t really the sharpest knife in the drawer, and really lacks common sense throughout the anime. He is characterized by his crazy amount of selflessness, and always seems to get himself into easily avoidable trouble. Even so, he does manage to grow to some degree. Now, I\u2019m not hating on this character, in fact I loved him in ufotable\u2019s adaptation. However his idiocy was really taken to its limits in this particular series.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting Cast (3): In general, the supporting characters are one-dimensional, and just seem to be there to aid in the plot. I mean, they each have their goals and motivations, but it really isn\u2019t there long enough for the viewers to truly experience these characters. A prime example would be Archer, seeing how he only briefly appeared within the series.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships (5): As for the relationships/connections between characters, most were confusing and weren\u2019t really explained. These include the connection between Sakura and Rin or Shirou\u2019s relationship with Archer. Moreover, why would Rin team up with someone like Shirou? I feel like Deen could have done a better job in delving more into these relationships between these particular characters. The one and only relationship that was delved upon and that I enjoyed was between Shirou and Saber. I don\u2019t really know why, but I liked seeing how their relationship blossomed over time.\\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nArt & Animation (7):\\n\r\nArt (8): The artwork within this particular series is quite good, seeing how it was released in 2006. Although, it really isn\u2019t comparable to anime released nowadays. If you were to be extremely picky about the art of an anime, this most likely isn\u2019t for you. Look at the cover of the anime, if you aren\u2019t sure, as the art is roughly the same as that of cover for duration of the series. Personally, the character designs and background look to be decent with a bit of a darker tone. The only real problem is it lacks detail in both the characters and the setting.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (6): This series has its ups and downs, concerning animation. Sadly, much of the series\u2019 animation is more of being down in that it gets somewhat choppy and doesn\u2019t have the vibe of running so smoothly. One particular scene was with the not-that-good 3D rendered dragon. Although, depending on the exact scene (mostly fight scenes), the quality of animation would spike, but not as much or as long as one would hope for. \\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nSound (7): I couldn\u2019t really find any major problems with the sound, as it was actually pretty good. The voice acting was on point, syncing up well with the animation. The sound effects were cued nicely as well, and blended well with the scenes most of the times. As for the openings and endings, they were actually quite catchy and pleasing to my ears, although they weren\u2019t really memorable compared to others. Yet another plus would be the unique and cool way they had implemented German within the series.\\n\\n\r\nSub v. Dub: Personally, I prefer sub over dub, but it really depends more on you and your own tastes. The main reason I choose sub over dub is that the Japanese voices really compliment and fit the characters, especially Saber with her high code of honor and chivalry.\\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): Seeing as how I came to this anime hearing how horrible it is, it\u2019s not surprising that I came out thinking to myself that this anime wasn\u2019t all that bad. I actually enjoyed it to some degree, seeing as how I have already been attached to some of the characters (**cough cough** Saber **cough cough**) through the visual novel. Sadly, the series left much of its potential to rot and waste, lowering my enjoyment of it. But that\u2019s just my own opinion\u2026 \\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nRecommendations: This particular series is more suited towards those without high expectations of a show, seeing as how it\u2019s an average anime that doesn\u2019t really excel in any particular field. It\u2019d most likely bore you if you were that sort of person.  \\n\\n\r\nFans of Type-Moon, the Fate series, and Saber will most likely enjoy it. Although, if you are a fan, but already experienced Fate/Zero and/or Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV), this series will probably be an eyesore for you, as it doesn\u2019t even compare to ufotable\u2019s works. Although, if you really want to see some more Saber, I\u2019d recommend that watch the first few episode and see if you like it or not.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd for those of you who don\u2019t really know how to get about watching the Fate series, I\u2019d recommend this particular order:\\n\r\n1.\tThis Series\\n\r\n2.\tFate/Zero\\n\r\n3.\tFate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV)\\n\r\n4.\tFate/stay night: Heaven\u2019s Feel (when it comes out in 2016)\\n\\n\r\nThose who take a liking to shonen or any of the other genres this anime falls under should attempt it. Not only is it check off all the requirements for a standard shonen anime, but this series includes numerous of unique elements other anime may not have.\\n\\n\r\nIndividuals who take a liking to anime exhibiting elements of romance and comedy may also like this series, seeing as how Shirou and Saber\u2019s romantic relationship plays a large role within the anime. \\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nOverall, I would give Fate/stay night at 7 out of 10 stars.\\n",

            "content": "Many animes based on visual novels seem to the general audience who have played them, to be inferior. Fate/stay night is no exception to this bias, and although I have not played the VN, many comments suggest that it is considerably better than the anime. I assume that the a good part of the lower ratings Fate/Stay night has received is due to those who have played the VN and given reviews based on both experiences. Others may call Stay Night \"overrated,\" and in all honestly, I believe it is to a degree, but it does not detract from the fact that it is agreat, must-watch anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - For an anime made in 2006, the animation is top of the line. The fighting and even the ordinary life scenes are visually stunning and vibrant. The only problem I have with it is some animation seems to be reused, and the fighting is not as varied as I would like it to be. \\n\\n\r\nSound - This is where, imo, where the anime shines the most. The soundtrack is varied and video game like. At times, ithere is a medieval or religious feel to it. Many of the soundtracks sent shivers down my spine due to the epicness. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The anime did a great job developing the two main characters. However, the main problem is the lack of background info on the characters, and that slows down that development. In addition, there seems to be little basis for the actions of some characters, making much of the cast seem superficial. \\n\\n\r\nStory - After watching a good amount of shounen, the plot is in a sense, a bit cliche. However, the anime excels at getting rid of the overused feel to it, and I did not, in the least sense, feel that it degraded the storyline. There was tons of surprises and twists in the storyline, keeping the watcher interested. The biggest problem I had with this whole anime was that, at times, it was predictable and there was an enormous lack of information that would have made it more enjoyable. Without defining terms such as \"mogist\" or \"noble phantasm\" made me feel like I was missing out on the big picture and did not feel as connected to the fullest extent.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was slow on the uptake, but gradually got better and more addicting. Its one of those shows where the main character must establish his true motives before the story becomes interesting. I loved the ending, and without spoiling it, the ending was, in one word, bittersweet, but perhaps this is the nature of fairy tales.",

            "content": "So as I pray...  Unlimited Blade Works!\r\nSo after completely watching fate/zero in excitement, I decided to watch fate/stay night. But meh, this show is ain't nothing but raw adaptation from the visual novel. It's bland, uncreative and give me sick.\r\nIt start out with good or I can say, I pretty enjoy it at first. It's funny, the plot is good and doesn't make me confuse and I'm like hmm. this show is good, it's not really bad as it says (I have seen the reviews before I decided to watch it) but then the nightmare comes... story that pretty good, imaginative at first changedinto some kind of children lullaby, makes me sleepy as when I watched suzumiya's endless eight. But I keep my feet stand, keep my eyes open and decided to watch more and more episodes. I think the story will develop in the middle but I was wrong, the story just become worsen. The only excitement I got is just when berserker fight against archer. And then I watched episode 20 and I found something that I really hate to be in an action anime. Romance! Yes, I'm really fucked up when a master can falling in love with his servant. And it just really? Master love servant? I think I better watch some yuri than romance like this. I never think that this \"fate\" can turned into romance thing. But personally I don't hate romance, maybe that is just trauma after I watched sao.\\n\\n\r\nThen the art. What can you expect from 2006 art? Yes I admit it, it's old anime so I don't hope ufotable art to be in here. But I really disappointed with it battle scenes. I hope I can see some pretty cool fighting scenes but no, or just some which can I say pretty cool. So if you want to watch this because its action, I rather say no and go watch something else. The action is horrible. The animation is also not really good. So I don't think you can get much excitement when watching the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAn OP in action animes should be powerful, adrenaline pumping, gives you excitement even you haven't watch the series yet. But I don't find it in the OP of the first half. It's boring, it just like you put ABBA or Wham! to work on an OP. But I think this is perfect because the anime itself it's boring. And yep, the second OP is good. I like it. The ED? Forget it. I always skipped ED and I think you do as well.\\n\\n\r\nOkay now the characters. It's BAD. I don't see much development in it. Shirou is just a guy that think that he is the man of justice, but the fact is shirou himself is weak and he reminds me with Yukki in Mirai Nikki (I feel sad Kiritsugu decided to adopt him) Thanks to Saber so he can live longer. He is some kind of useless character, unlike his father which is cool and energetic. Saber is a female king, resurrected accidentally by Shirou. Sad for her to have master like that, I think she should have master like Rin and Shirou will have servant that look like him. Since the story just follows Shirou, Saber and Rin, the other characters just don't have a chance to get character development so I feel disappointed with that, and when they can get a chance of development Deen decided to put some fillers. I think if they can focus the story on all master, the story can be more interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the end, I give fate/stay night seven because it doesn't have a good story, the character development is bad and there is romance that I never expected to be in here. And for those who want to watch this but haven't watched fate/zero yet I really recommend you to watch fate/zero first because the story, characters, art, animation etc. is far better from this.",

Gilgamesh let me live to write this review\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe show is set in Fyuuki City where the 5th Holy Grail War happened. 7 masters are randomly picked and they summon a \"servants\". Servants are heroic spirits summoned to serve the master. 7 masters and 7 servants fight together to claim the ownership of the Holy Grail which can grant any wish you want.\r\nFate/stay night is based on a visual novel game where the player must decide how thestory will go. Fate has 3 paths. The 1st path is Fate, the 2nd path is Unlimited Blade Works and the 3rd path is Heaven's feel. This show is primarily focused on the first path. These 3 paths are 3 different realities. How can I explain this? It's like 3 alternate universe.\\n\r\nThe story starts slow showing Shiro on a pit of fire being rescued by Kiritsugu Emiya. From there on, the story advances slowly to introduce some main characters and later picks up. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, the story was pretty decent. It was great at the first half and early 2nd half but started to lose its focus later on. The story pacing is slow in this show so you can actually understand what's going on. There was also some plot twists in the show but I wasn't shocked when I saw the plot twists because I made a grave mistake of watching Fate/Zero first. The ending of the show was meh. Some people say it's confusing at what happened to \"that\" servant but I didn't find it confusing. Btw, I'm not going to spoil the ending. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (5/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre. It was like some smart-ass 5th grader doodled on the environment and the characters. There was no shadows, no details and the environment looked bland. The character design was decent but could have been better. Wait? What am I talking about? The show was made in 2005, of course the animation is going to look crap. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't really that great. There was 1 or 2 battle themes that gave me a light goosebumps but overall, it's just utter crap. Now, the opening soundtrack. The OP 1 was complete trash and should not be even listened to. After 3 episodes, I started skipping the opening because I couldn't bare listening to it again. On the other hand, OP 2 is a huge improvement from OP 1 but it's still not a great OP soundtrack. Now, the ending soundtrack. Only 1 ending song was used for the whole season and it wasn't that great either. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\r\nSince the show has slow-story pacing, they took time to introduce the characters and give them some character development. Some of the characters in the show were likable and some of them, I don't like. For example, the main protagonist of the show is Shiroe Emiya. I honestly don't like him because he's a stubborn teenager that makes me want to punch him because of how frustrating he is. Another main character of the show is Rin Toosaka. She is a Magus and a Master of Archer of the 5th Holy Grail War. Now this character doesn't piss me off because she's a smart character and doesn't do things that will annoy the crap out of you. There are also servants in the show. I'm only going to introduce one. Saber is the servant of Shiroe and was King Arthur in the past life. She has an invincible sword which is pretty effective at combat. In Fate/Zero, Saber was one of my favourite characters but in Fate/stay night, she wasn't. She somehow turned into a romantic tool for Shiroe but that's not the only reason why I don't like her in Fate/stay night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\nThe reason why my Enjoyment rating is not below 5 is because of the story. The score would have been a lot higher but the terrible action scenes, mediocre soundtrack and the lack of funny moments is what prevented my Enjoyment rating to be higher.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nOverall, the anime has a decent story but suffers from terrible action scenes and the other negative stuff I mentioned above. You can give this anime a try but if you prefer actions scenes with good soundtrack then this is not a show for you. However, if you don't care about actions scenes or epic soundtracks and want to watch an anime with a decent story and slow story pacing then this is the show for you. Prepare to be confused at the story and expect some plot twists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Decent story\\n\r\n-Slow-story pacing which means it takes time to explain what's happening\\n\r\n-Good Characters\\n\r\n-Decent Character Development\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre animation\\n\r\n-Mediocre soundtrack\\n\r\n-Terrible action scenes\\n\r\n-Ending is not that great\\n\r\n-Main Protagonist can sometimes piss you off\\n",

            "content": "This anime is such trash it took me years to finally complete it.  I'd watch a few episodes, then stop, then come back 6 months later, watch a few, stop.  The only reason why I endured this was because I watched Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA and enjoyed it.  But, I watched it out of order and heard I needed to watch Fate/Stay Night and then I had to see Unlimited Blade Works, because that's the bomb apparently.  I tried to get to it years ago, but this anime is so dull, drab and meh, it just couldn't hold my attention for long,with so many other far better animes coming out.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with it is the protagonist Shiroh.  Who is about as self-righteous and unlikeable an MC as I've ever seen.  By contrast, he made me root for the villains to kill him.  Because in all honesty, the one good thing this anime had was villains.  They were much more interesting than the heroes.  The heroes were completely mediocre and boring.  Their personalities were cliched, their jokes were unfunny, the motivations were paper thin.  They were all weak, including Saber, who was stoic to the point of boring.  She's totally overrated as a heroine.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, where is the logic?  (Spoiler: She worked so hard to get back and continue her fight in her realm, only to immediately die at a tree?  Well, I guess I'd rather be dead than be stuck with Shiro for life, too...)  I mean, dang this guy's whole character was about being a burden to her, from getting in her way during fights, to try and stop her from fulfilling her duty (to apparently die on a tree)...  I hate that guy.  \\n\\n\r\nI won't knock it too much for the animation, because this is old now and was decent for its day.  I know from Iilya, that the animation style gets MUCH better than this and I've seen that UBW is a well animated work.   But, everything about THIS anime was garbage.  I even hated the soundtrack.   That's rare.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is trash and I'm hoping sitting through this in intervals will be worth it.  I hope UBW isn't overhyped.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 1\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 1",

            "content": "Fate/stay night by Studio DEEN is not a show that has aged well. I got into the Type-Moon universe through ufotable's Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night [UBW], so after playing the VN for which Fate/stay night (FSN for short) was adapted from, I decided to watch this adaptation, and for all its flaws, I recommend this for any prospective Fate fans to begin in that doesn't involve the enormous time sink that is the visual novel.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis anime is an adaptation of Fate/stay night's Fate route, with some elements of its other two routes, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel, thrown in to help it standbetter on its own. The premise is that Shirou Emiya is thrown into a \"Holy Grail War\" with his servant Saber, and the way the story proceeds from here is interesting. The story is both a character study and a dark battle shounen, and is paced well- the beginning is slow and slice of life-esque, but the last portion of the story is enthralling. The story is interesting and a great introduction to the world of Fate, but there are a few plot holes that drag it down. A romance is also a central point to the story, which is overall executed well and contributes to the thrilling plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nWhile art itself is not that bad, the show is littered with obvious budget-saving animation tricks and weird looking still frames that it becomes a noticeable drag to the experience. The final episode is animated very well for a series from 2006, but the show as a whole has not aged well at all in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound effects are pretty generic and kind of annoying, but the soundtracks is fine with a few standouts, Kizuna and Unmei no Yoru being particularly good. The voice actors mostly do a good job with the exception of Berserker's mooing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe main character is an interesting take on many common shounen main character cliches and is extremely controversial. Besides him, the other characters with major focus really shine well. In particular, Saber deserves praise in this adaptation for adapting her story from the VN flawlessly into the anime. However, this show does a poor job of developing its secondary cast and some servants and masters despite the changes made to the Fate route to give them some time to shine. \\n\r\nBear in mind that for some character's full arcs, you will have to watch ufotable's Unlimited Blade Work anime and Heaven's Feel movies to understand them fully.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe incredible premise ultimately carries the show for me. The plot and characters are written well but aren't as good as they could be, given the show's source material. Seeing many of the scenes from the visual novel exclusive to the Fate route however is satisfying, and the source material notwithstanding, the show itself has many iconic moments and interesting ideas it explores.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nFate/stay night is a good show. It is not really great, but its strengths (interesting premise, well-written main characters, great pacing) outweigh its negatives (shoddy animation, occasional adaptation induced plot holes), and it is a great way to get into the Fate franchise and honestly, my recommended one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "---------------------------------\r\n| Fate/stay night : Review |\r\n---------------------------------\r\nAh the infamous Fate series ! This is something that I wanted to get into for a long time , But my mind went numb when looking at all the different series , the alternative stories and sequels in the franchise and I had no idea where to start.\r\nSo with a suggestion from a friend , I jumped straight to the firstly aired series of the franchise. I don't have any experiences with the Fate Visual Novel and I don't intend to read it either. So let's discuss the series shall we ?\r\n-----------\r\nStory - 5\r\n-----------\r\nStay night takes place in modernday japan introduces us to a world of Magic , Fantasy and Mythology. and does a solid job at it too. The world and all it's concepts are explained properly and the story was very straightforward (take that as you will) and it was very easy to follow. \\n\r\nStory follows the story of Shirou Emiya as he's forced to take part in a Holy Grail war. Although despite being called a war , this feels really small in scale.\\n\r\nStory focuses on Shirou's morals as he refuse to kill and he can't back out from the war either but this falls flat on it's face because of all the cringe-worthy dialogue and the flaws of the character himself but we will get into that later. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show feels like a really average slice of life anime with some action scenes and story picks up pace in the second half with it taking a turn towards romance/harem genre and action scenes increasing. Yes it does have some twists but most of them are blatantly predictable. It felt like they were going for a grand climax in the last few episodes but I couldn't help but feel it's half-baked and cliched.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nCharacters- 3\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Studio Deen royally screwed up. The premise of stay night does have potential to be really good if it's characters can back it up. Disappointingly , that's not the case here. \\n\r\nNo beating around the bush , let's jump straight to the point.\\n\r\nThe main character of the series.., \"The most frustrating , idiotic and sexist dumbfuck I've ever seen\" , and nope I'm not over exaggerating.\\n\r\nSadly his character doesn't get any development as the series goes on and he's still the same dumbfuck when the series ends too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters , Saber stands out. There's not many faults with her and she's a genuinely existing character to watch.\\n\r\nMost common flaw for all the characters is that the series doesn't even give characters a motivation for their actions. Even the main characters tragic backstory is not fully explored.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nArt and Sound- 6\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to keep this section very brief. Animation for the series is beautiful considering this is made in 2009 , even tho the art doesn't impress me too much.\\n\r\nCharacter designs of Saber and Archer stands out but others characters are pretty generic looking.\\n\r\nAs for the sound department , All is well here. Soundtrack fits the atmosphere perfectly. It's no surprise because this soundtrack is composed by the same person who composed the soundtrack of Ghost in the Shell.\\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\n-------------\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this ? Depends on whether you're trying to get into the Fate series or not. If you're looking at it as a standalone series , it's pretty bad and you should probably pass. But If you're looking to get into the fate series , I'm assuming this is where to start.\\n",

            "content": "I watched this anime in 2018, not really knowing anything about it. And although the art has aged a little (to be expected of a 2006 show), This show was beautiful. I fell in love with this anime.\r\nI'll be the first to admit, I am a sucker for some good romance stories. And this anime did not disappoint, and offered abounds more on top of that.\r\nAs I stated earlier, the art is a bit dated, along with the sound, but that is to be expected for a 2006 anime. It still isn't anywhere near awful, 12 years later. The biggest problem with the art andsound was actually finding a stream that was HD. This show was oddly very hard to access.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it was definitely a unique twist on an overused plot. hapless guy finds himself in a scenario he doesn't belong in, and ends up summoning/finding a beautiful woman who is extremely powerful. Although it kind of falls into this cliche, the show does a good job of differentiating itself and making the overall feel completely different and special.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character development is slightly spotty. The two main characters get a lot of attention and development, but their past is still relatively vague. you get a good grasp on the personalities of the three main characters (the third doesn't get nearly as much backstory as the other 2), but as for them, and everyone else, the show leaves you a little wanting. There always feels like there is something there just waiting to be revealed, and it never is.\\n\\n\r\n------------ Kinda Spoilers from here to next break --------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall the execution of this show seems rushed. You grow attached to the characters and yearn for more, just to be left empty at the end. Honestly the ending is this anime's biggest flaw. it was so disappointing and more importantly, unsatisfying. it's not that it doesn't make sense, but it could have been so better. It just left me with a pit in my stomach. The romance junkie in  me almost cried because I was sad at it. The ending was really just difficult to watch, because of how much more satisfying it could have been. Prepare yourself to be let down at the end of what is truly an amazing story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n------------  End of kinda spoilers--------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 10/10 anime. It isn't without it's flaws, but it certainly fits the \"masterpiece\" label to me.",

            "content": "The Fate/stay night story has had a couple of incarnations up to this point\u2015Studio Deen\u2019s Fate/stay night and Ufotable\u2019s Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. Both each have their issues, but this version of events is a lot more cringe-worthy than Ufotable\u2019s presentation. Both have marketability because of Type Moon\u2019s pension for making memorable character designs.\r\n\u2022\tThe aesthetic to the cell drawings in Studio Deen\u2019s version appealed to my taste; it had a tessellated, pixel art feel to it\u2015it was like they were created from a Dreamcast. The animation, on the other hand, was a disaster. I clearly remember the scene which made me go, \u201cGood God,this is crap animation,\u201d when Rin and Archer were flying off of the balcony and there was no detail with the animating process. They just swiveled the bodies diagonally and slide them across the screen like a Power Point presentation! Truly awful. And there\u2019s a bad CG scene with a dragon that is so bad that it sits among the likes of the infamous Golgo 13 helicopter scene from that OVA, which is just full of camp! It\u2019s jarring and difficult to look at with how awful the computer graphics are! As the series goes on, the pointillistic artfulness was replaced with cheap, seemingly rushed through scenes and a plethora of completely static scenes that poured out of miles of exposition. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe story needs no introduction; the massive Fate/stay night visual novel legacy has practically become The Odyssey of anime tales. There were notable differences in the characterization of Illya in both adaptations; Studio Deen\u2019s version kept her the primarily creepy murderous loli that she is in all of the arcs (save for Heaven\u2019s Feel), while Unlimited Blade Works goes into her backstory and makes her more sympathetic while being a psychopath. Other than that, the only things that I can really complain about that deviate from this overly narrative is the hellacious exposition and a confusing and rushed ending that left me scratching my head. The scenes that are obviously supposed to be the ero-scenes from the original game are set up and then drop off awkwardly\u30fcI honestly think that the vampirism effect that the first Heaven\u2019s Feel film used was more effective than the implications and set-ups that were just a nudge to those who had played the source material.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tAll in all, I think that the classic Studio Deen Fate/stay night TV series is worth watching\u2015ONLY if you\u2019re a really big fan of the Fate series or Type Moon\u2019s creations (which I couldn\u2019t really see why unless you\u2019re into the designs, Melty Blood is among one of the worst things that I have EVER read). Otherwise, don\u2019t do it! I give this Fate adaptation a 4/10.",

Honestly, looking at it the other way around, Fate/Zero felt more like the author was saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry that sucked, let me do it better this time.\u201d\\n\r\nThe plot as a whole is very linear, and leaves much to be desired. Fights are underwhelming, we learn so little about the servants and masters, outside of the main pair Shiro and Saber, which is lame. The ending episodes were the only point where any sort of plot twist happened, and honestly, if you\u2019re paying attention throughout the show, it\u2019s really not that surprising. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nMy issue lies with only one character. And as such, is the only one i will focus on. \\n\r\nAll other characters I felt were fine in terms of what we were even shown about them, because it is impossible to actually connect to any of them. You learn next to nothing about them, and see very little outside of interaction with the main characters.\\n\r\nSpeaking of main characters.\\n\r\nShiro is awful. Just a completely unlikeable person. And whether anyone wants to admit it, his views towards women? They\u2019re sexist. His \u201cbleeding heart\u201d attitude towards protecting the women in the show is annoying and unappealing. I couldn\u2019t even see it as admirable. Despite his full knowledge of just how powerful Saber is, he repeatedly almost dies simply preventing her from fighting, or protecting her WHEN SHE DOESNT NEED HIS HELP. And the worst part of it is that the author justifies his stupid views towards this, by simply making him strong like her, and therefore actually able to protect her, and eventually, she comes to accept his way of thinking. \\n\r\nMaybe you like that kind of guy in a story, But I can only see him as a poorly written, unappealing main character. And I hate everything about him.\\n\r\nSaber starts out being the calm cool serious honor bound king of knights you know her to be, but unfortunately falls victim to shoujoization and it just made me feel let down.\\n\r\nSide note: Rin is great. You\u2019ll easily love her as a character, no doubt.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion:\\n\r\nIf you are watching this because you want to see how it lives up to the visual novels? you may love it I guess. I don\u2019t know nor could I say for sure.\\n\r\nHowever\\n\\n\r\nIf you are watching it because you heard it was a romance? You\u2019ll also be disappointed, because it\u2019s a poorly written pile of melodrama laced with sexist ideals, and men must protect them no matter what. And I\u2019m sure that ain\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for \\n\r\nIf you started this series because you wanted to see a war for the Holy Grail, between masters and their Heroic Servants as a continued story from Fate/Zero? Im sorry to say you will be very disappointed. It\u2019s a mere shadow in comparison to Fate/Zero, and honestly should only be watched for continuity sake before moving on to Fate/ SN UBW(as I did).\\n\\n",

I think the art suits the anime and it's a pretty \"old\" anime too.(ourtechnology for animating and special effects is evolving so fast).\\n\\n\r\nthe soundtrack is nice but not very vairant. if you take attack on titan they have soundtrack for like every different scene but that's too much. But f/sn didn't have so much different OST's.\\n\\n\r\ni really enjoyed the anime, but it starts pretty slow, the first 10 episodes were not so interesting in my opinion. but the action scenes are pretty awesome, the laugh moments are in it and of course some feels.\\n\\n",

At that time i did not enjoy FSN because of it not having as much action/fighting as in shows like naruto. After a few years of not watchg anime i came across an old dvd entitiled Fate Stay Night and i sat down and thought to myself \"what was this show about? was itgood?\" so i decided to download and watch the series once again. After watching 2/3 episodes i was in love with it, i could not wait to watch the next episode it was amazing. I was able to understand the show and appreciate what it had to offer. The story was very exiting, enjoyable and unique for me. As each episode went by it got more and more exiting and enjoyable until the last episode. The last episode was by far the best episode, although i hated the ending it was the perfect ending. This show started off excellent and ended amazingly perfect. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 11/10\\n\\n\r\nKawai Kenji - FSN OST\\n\r\nSachi Tanika - FSN OP 1&2 & FSN last Episode Ending Song\\n\r\nThe two artist mentioned above are excellent in their work of music. The OST and songs in FSN is beautiful. I loved the sondtracks and songs so much i downloaded them and listen to them everyday, it is absolutely enjoyable and it is what makes FSN a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTRERS - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from main to supporting are well done, although the main protagonist (Shirou) could have been stronger in my opinion. Saber is definately the best heroine i have ever seen in any anime or manga, her personality is lovable and she is very strong. I loved how Shirou and Saber relationship developed but once again the last episode tore my heart to peices, so sad. The other characters were interesting and likeable, and some i didnot like.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite good, nothing to talk about much.\\n\\n\r\nENJOMENT/OVERALL - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI belive i have already established how much i enjoyed and loved this series.\\n\r\nAfter reading this review i hope it was helpfull to you and it should make you interested to watch it and enjoy it as much as i did. \\n\\n\r\nCan people comment on my review please, i would like to know how you find it was thanks",

            "content": "Fate/stay night is about a magical death match between 7 masters and their respective servants killing each other in order to get a wish from the holy grail. That sounds really awesome, but is the anime itself all as it seems? \r\nCHARACTERS\r\nCharacters. The most important thing to a story. They\u2019re what makes you care about the story and want to see more. In any media that has ever existed, the most important character is the main one, he\u2019s the one who learns the important lessons and the audience relates to him. But what if the main character is an absolute moron who only does stupidthings and single-handedly ruins the show? Well that\u2019s not good. Shiro Emiya is this show\u2019s \u201chero,\u201d even though instead of courageously fighting his enemies, standing up to his problems or learning from his mistakes, he stands around and yells at other people for doing what they\u2019re supposed to do within this war. He has this illogical, impossible ideal that \u201ceveryone needs to be saved, and if anyone is in harm\u2019s way they need to be taken out (especially if they\u2019re a woman).\u201d It\u2019s because of this character\u2019s ideal that absolutely ruins this show. His servant will be doing badass things and actually getting stuff done, but because she\u2019s a woman, she can\u2019t fight and needs to stay home and cook, right? Even though there are literal demons who are fucking killing people, Shiro wants to have a peaceful conversation with them and maybe they\u2019ll become good, right? It\u2019s not just that, but Shiro is an overall asshole and an idiot. For the sake of saying others, he steps into obviously dangerous and impossibly stupid situations even though he has literally no experience with fighting. The worst part about this, is that he never learns otherwise. He doesn\u2019t grow as a character, other than him learning spells. There\u2019s hardly an arc! Yes, that is the only character I\u2019m going to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to understand what quarrels I have with the story after knowing what\u2019s wrong with the characters, because it\u2019s mostly the same thing. Basically, because of Shiro\u2019s personality, he stops any and all plot progression. Forbidding his servant to do much, refusing to kill his opponents only making matters worse for him and his allies are all common staples of the story, and because of this lack of an arc with him, it becomes really boring and really repetitive fast. That\u2019s the biggest problem, but there\u2019s also the fact that the climax kind of happens 3 quarters of the way through the show and almost everything after that just feels like filler. Shiro and his servant have a really forced romance that was painful to watch. There\u2019s a multitude of convoluted plot twists that don\u2019t make any sense if you haven\u2019t seen fate/zero (which you totally should). The plot is far from the worst thing about the show, it\u2019s not even that horrible, but it is all Shiro\u2019s fault. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nNow to talk about something good in this show. There\u2019s 2 parts to art: animation and sound. The animation isn\u2019t extraordinary, nor is it horrible (expect for a scene involving a CGI dragon), the animation overall is acceptable. It\u2019s the sound that\u2019s really good. I loved both the openings, sometimes that was the only motivation to watch the next episode. The voice acting is also really good. The English voice of Rin Toosaka is a standout, I thought her character and her voice actress were the some of the best parts of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOTHER THINGS\\n\r\nYet another problems I have with this show is the obvious, cringey and mildly autistic fan service in this show. Let me clarify. Most instances of fan service would be a panty shot, or characters revealing their big breasts. This isn\u2019t the case, the fan service in this show is a little different. Every female character treats the main character (Shiro) as the most handsome, glorious, talented and handsome man who has ever existed. As the show progresses, Shiro becomes a harem-lord for no good reason! Any female character, wether or not they\u2019re evil, eventually lives with Shiro and wants to ride on his dick. Even though this is a fantasy show about fighting for the holy grail, we still have a loli, a tsundere, vanilla, quasi-incest and a few others. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nI have many, many, many problems with this show. More problems than i have compliments. Yes, i enjoyed the voice acting and music, but i don\u2019t need to tell you that thats not enough to get you into watching a show. Mostly everything in this show pissed me off somehow, and now i feel like the only purpose of this show is to make unlimited blade works look a million times better! I\u2019d recommend you not watch this show.\\n",

All the reccomendations I've had were to avoid it and go to the Ufotable's anime, Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works, so I've did it and felt in love with Fate franchise. So I was really on the hype of the franchise and was not satisfied with only two shows. My only option was the 2006 version, so, i've watched it, and I can say: it's a surprisiling good show. \r\nIt have the same feel of Nostalgia from the classic battle Shounen from the 80s and the 90s, and while I was watching it I've though multipletimes that if this anime was launched at this time it would be a massive hit and considered, till today, a timeless classic. I think the great Brazilian dub have helped to increase the nostalgia, but it's indubitable that it have more in common with classic anime than the contemporary ones. The  plot is more storyline driven and have an excellent pacing. Ok, unlike UFOtable, Studio Deen was not concerned with character development, they are plain and sometimes annoying (particularly Shiro), but they are very charismatic and more humour driven. The series is also less darker and more comedy driven, a classic shounen brand (UFOtable is more foccused in seinen audience, what explains the heavy character development and the philosophical debates in the plot) Also, the OST is better than Uffotable's (except the openings and endings that are ok, but not great). \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem here is the animation. In the begging this is worse than some 80s anime, the quality is really very poor, the action scenes are slow and have none emotion. The use of CGI is simply ridiculous, man, it's a 2006, they had already the technology to do something better. At least the animation improves by the end of the series and gets more fluid and ok. No more no less than ok. \\n\\n\r\nSo, I hugely recomend this show both for UFOtable fans and newcomers. It have it's flaws and is oldfashioned in style and screenwriting, but is really enjoyable and funny  and worthwatching. If you are keen on classic battle shounen, you will just love it; if not, I think the UFOtable shows will please you more.",

However odd that might seem it manages to work itself out in the end and is a solid anime series.  \r\nThe plot of the series is semi-complicated but the manner in which the story unfolds makes it incredibly predictable for the most part with a small assortment of odd twists.  Character development follows roughly the same path as the plot yet complements it when necessary providing the proper amount of background knowledge and character growth for the viewer tobe able to easily follow and understand the story.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound effects are used at the proper times throughout fate/stay night.  Animation is solid as well as the overall art style of the show.  The voice acting for the subbed version is of good quality.  \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty there is very little to say about Fate/Stay Night.  It is a solid series as a whole nothing is really so exceptional that it sticks out.  At the same time nothing is done poorly making nothing gather negative attention either.  Fate/Stay Night is a solid series providing for enjoyable viewer experience. \\n",

            "content": "Note: I have created this Review a long time ago. And posted it on my blog called:\r\nhttp://shanatanuruchai.blogspot.com/ \r\nfate/stay Night... has left me a good impression towards anime.\r\nIt's the very first anime I've watched, that made me satisfied with the ending. I disregard every fact of the game, thus the game and the anime could NEVER be connected in any way. Way to go Geneon! All hail Geneon! Geneon is the producer of the numerous awesome titles; Ah! My Goddess, Elemental Gelade, Ergo Proxy, Ultra Maniac, Zero no Tsukaima, Shakugan no Shana, R.O.D. The TV, Gatekeepers 21, CardCaptor Sakura, Dragon Ball Z, Fushigi Yuugi, Sailor Moonseries, and a lot more!\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, my Fate/Stay Night Review will start: WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nArtwork: 10/10\\n\r\nStoryline: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 6/10\\n\r\nUniqueness: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I'm a semi-professional writer. I have not written for anything or whatnot. But I've been writing stories, a few reviews and some articles for 8 years now. So somehow, I assume my review to be whatnot respected.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\n-- The anime's animation is indeed very good. It's not very sketchy, nor does it lack lines. The first few parts of the story kind of focused on the battles, but the battles are great. Not too much shabby effects here, nor there. Just right. All hail Animators of Geneon.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 10/10\\n\r\n-- Fate/Stay Night is based from an eroge visual novel game produced by Type-moon. Expecting something from a visual novel game, I expected the artwork to have resembled someone Goshuuso-sama Ninomiya-kun or Clannad in this case. I thought the artwork would be that sketchy, as to most of eroge games are sketchy when it comes to artwork. I really loved the artwork, and the expressions and feelings of the characters are well drawn. Very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline: 8/10\\n\r\n-- In watching it at first, the story seemed very boring, and etchy. So, it would bore you at first. As the episodes progresses, every thing becomes confusing and still confusing upon the end is approached. Aside from that Saber's true life also is a bit fishy. How come King Arthur is lady so is her right hand man Knight Bedivere is a female as well. The original story of Le Morte D'Arthur - Thomas Malory, Sir Bedivere had disobeyed King Arthur's orders, and that is the reason King Arthur died. But Sir Bedivere did not disobey Saber, thus she should still live. This is the part where I saw a hole, for a continuation of the story. So a possible Season 2 or continuation for a 6th Holy Grail war is possible. (Don't steal this idea! XD It's MINE!). And yes, I know the story of King Arthur. ^^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 6/10\\n\r\n-- The lack of Character development for Tohsaka Rin, Archer, Saber and Emiya Shirou made the anime suck in terms of Storyline. There are not enough episodes of talk for everyone. Around 8 episodes only? But the end almost told everything about Saber and Shirou's relationship, thus to they loved each other. At the end, there are no HINTS AT ALL for feelings between Rin and Shirou. For me at least. A lot of people thinks that Shirou x Rin is well deserved. But for me Shirou x Saber FTW!! XD\\n\\n\r\nUniqueness: 10/10\\n\r\n-- \u3059\u3070\u3089\u3057\uff01\u3059\u3066\u304d\uff01\u3059\u3054\u3044\u3057\uff01\\n\\n\r\nHave fun! I suggest you watching this ~ de arimasu\\n\\n\r\nShana-nee",

I guess the story went quite slow at times and the tension killed me at times but overall it was a good series. The story had a few twists but nothin too unpredictable. The storyline went well until it hit the ending scene. It was unsatisfying as it didnt come to a valid conclusion, i was hoping somethings would come to more of a resolve. \r\n I liked the art, it was very detailed yet simple at the same time. The servants were very well done as each hadits own unique feature which suited their masters. \\n\\n\r\nI found the opening and ending songs very good, they were very catchy and easy to listen to. It had your typical dramatic music when there were fight scenes so it wasn't anything amazing. \\n\\n\r\nEach character was done very well. Each servant was very interesting as each had their own unknown identity and cool weapon. The masters suited their servants so were able to develop a bond.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy this anime except for the endings...all the waiting for something average. I would suggest this for people who have patience and are able to withstand the slow romantic scene. It is a great anime when looking at the fight scenes and characters so I would suggest to look at it and see wat u think.",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night \r\nThis is a much long overdue post which I have been putting off due to the sheer weight of responsibility I hold to even utter the name of this anime in an attempt to write a review on it. There is a reason that on MAL the rating system jumps from great all the way to masterpiece and that is because of the select few animes like Fate/Stay Night which shoot out from the masses and reach the infinities of the sky and continue onward into greatness. For me Fate/Stay Night is one such anime and I hope to the best of myability to tell you why and in the process using FSN as a template will also reveal to you what anime is to me.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and story of course play an intricate roll in any story and anime is no different without an interesting set of events and purpose to tie in all the characters the anime will lose it\u2019s drive. In FSN this drive is a competition in which the winner calls upon heroes to fight for and along side of them so that they may gain an item which can grant them any one desire. Now a driving factor is merely one part but emotional involvement is another and FSN delivers again providing not only romantic feelings but also of sorrow and past pains which are brought to light throughout the competition as each character fights for what they believe is their truth.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful in it\u2019s simplistic elegance as the scenery quickly changes from dreary and dark to bright and whimsical in the smoothest of transitions. The physics of the wind playing on the characters clothing as beams of light radiate through the clouds in the sky is gorgeous to behold even on streaming web browser. Perhaps though most importantly in an anime are the eyes which without even hearing words spoken between characters at time you can read their thoughts through them making you question reality and think for a moment that this 2d character really perhaps possesses a soul. The ability to draw in and audience without words is the most important item to give to insure emotional attachment is triggered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter developement is a key feature which unfortunately is sometimes missed in lesser anime. If characters do not develop mentally, physically, or emotionally then the plot has failed and the character has under went many ordeals throughout their path all for not. FSN focuses on many key characters and each of them develop in their own ways. Wether it be building solid friendships, realizing feelings of love, or weakness becoming courage. It is keenly portrayed and the constant change in everyone involved leads to a feeling of fulfillment in the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nEmotional attachment is simply the ability to draw in an audience and cause them to become attached to the story and the characters and the characters story. This is accomplished by the accumulation of all parts aforementioned in this posting. A true masterpiece will leave the viewer dealing after every scene longing for more and will even cause tears to well up inside as tough decisions are made. In FSN this is met very well and is hard to describe without spoilers so I will merely state that you will feel every emotion strongly as you watch this series.  You will rise with the characters, and fall with them, as their ordeals and views push them forward and you along with them towards their goals.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see by this post FSN is my favorite anime which I have watched many times, however to me it is also a template for anime.  It is such a masterpiece that I hold all others up against the guidelines which I first saw in this series.  The reason I watch anime is because of FSN, it was my first glimpse into the greatness of anime, breaking away from my earlier preconcieved notions which were derived souly on the mainstream anime easily available in the states such as: Dragonball.  FSN broke the mold for me and showed me that not only is anime a bunch of large eyed, funny haired, fighting characters but also that it can be an emotional journey which forged through coupling a fantastic story with great animation.  Perhaps this is the real reason I see FSN as such a great masterpiece, either way I love this series, its story, its art, its characters, and its comforting ability to whisk my mind to a different setting.  Rating 10/10 masterpiece and highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\n@GameJok3r\\n\r\nhttp://animejok3r.tumblr.com",

            "content": "Hello again Lion Tamers.\r\nWe try again, with \"Fate/Stay Night\"\r\nI wanted to like this anime, I really did. It has everything going for it.\r\nFor its' time, the original series was drawn quite well. The general art is acceptable, and of course the characters are quite good; some are drawn quite fetchingly. This is especially true of characters like Saber, and not as well but quite good, Rin Tohsaka.\r\nI realize there are other versions of this anime, but we're just dealing with the original anime.\r\nThe music is mostly well done, and the incidental musical score is appropriate for most of the series.\r\nAnd the story, is predictable, butwell written. Boy meets girl. Can't have her, both must survive against overwhelming odds. Boy loves girl. Girl cares for boy. Girl has serious business that forces her to ultimately leave. Love is never requited. Other characters dress the sets, occasionally they are useful.\\n\\n\r\nI especially like the historical tie-ins and romantic ending of the life of Arthuria Pendragon (Saber). This is especially poignant for those of us who have seen the movie 'Excalibre', as the ending of Miss Pendragon, is almost exactly the same as the King in that movie.\\n\r\n     She orders her servant to return the sword 'Excalibre' to the Lady of the Lake, and promptly dies. The male King Arthur Pendragon is a clear failure, after a valiant effort; just as Arthuria Pendragon realizes, too late, she has also failed to make a permanently better World.\\n\\n\r\nNow that is romantic writing at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have one criticism. Just one, and it's fairly serious. Fate/Stay Night has a \"Holy Grail\". This Holy Grail is not a prize at all. It is an unreasoning monster that always rewards the winner of the contest with despair, death and destruction. If the players knew (but they don't) at the beginning of the contest, what the prize was, most of the 'Heros' would just stay home.\\n\r\n    This same concept was used in another movie called \"The Fifth Element\". Great dark sphere appears on the Universal Horizon, with one purpose. To destroy all Life as all of us recognize it. Some people actually like the idea of dealing with an omniscient seeming godlike being, only to discover too late; that they have invited Hell into their midst.\\n\r\n    In other words, as romantically engaging the rest of the story is; the prize at the end is just a total negative, a turn-off, a great big dead-spot; that I found very disheartening. The viewer wants to see something of some kind of victory after so much pain and turmoil; dealing with not only the Holy Grail, but also the Wizard that wants to make big messes that only the Holy Grail can provide. There is no possible positive victory, only a bittersweet acceptance by Saber, the destruction of the Holy Grail and then her imminent death.\\n\\n\r\nSo for all of you who like beautiful romantic stories that have as much to say about people in love as any other Anime; but can also stand a tragically bittersweet ending, Fate/Stay Night might be your anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut for me, I would have taken a pass, if I knew Fate/Stay Night as I do now. I give this tragic Story a very strong 8.\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is based off a popular visual novel that centers around The Holy Grail War between masters and servants. This adaptation remains fairly true to the original source material, for better or for worse. \r\nThe premise of the story is fairly interesting. Every 7 years, the Holy Grail War pits selected individuals, typically talented magicians or sorcerers, in hopes to gain the favor of the Holy Grail itself. This, in turn, grants them any wish, for either the master or the servant. What if one of the participants is a clueless high school student? \r\nEnter, Emiya Shirou, a clueless high school student, in moreways than one. He can be quoted by saying \"so people die if they are killed.\" Being the main character of the visual novel, there isn't much substance to his character. His purpose is to fulfill self-insertation for the viewer. Furthermore, the series is rather faithful to the visual novel by including several flirtatious interactions between Shirou and a number of female characters including Saber, Rin, Sakura and Ilya.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Fate/Stay Night is good, however, the inclusion of computer graphics in some scenes is distinctly out of place. The soundtrack aside from all other aspects is particularly exceptional. Kenji Kawai composes the songs for Fate/Stay Night as well as other more well known Japanese blockbuster movies. The soundtrack is, for the most part, reminiscent a classical requiem. Only some seem prominent during the actual series. However, the soundtrack has considerable redeeming qualities for the animated series. Track 31, titled \"La Sola,\" is a personal favorite. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that this particular adaptation of Fate/Stay Night remains faithful to the visual novel. However, by doing so, it does not engage the viewer as much as it tries to appease fans of the original source material. This limits the total audience and reduces its overall appeal to general fans of animation. Though some elements are done well, it still feels very much disjointed and disconnected at times. It tries too hard to fuse together different genres of comedy, romance, action, and harem. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its misgivings, Fate/Stay Night is fairly unique and fans of the visual novel would appreciate this adaption casually. Stricter viewers may not entirely agree. I thought that the show was enjoyable, however, it does not have too much potential to watch through again.",

            "content": "Story\r\nAt first when I heard about Fate/stay night, I thought it might of had been a type of psychological anime but I was wrong as I suddenly decided to watch through a number of recommendations. Basically I heard it had fighting involved so I thought it was a violent anime which just focuses on a character killing another but I was wrong once again, this anime met my expectations and in the end. It gets better towards the end as characters started to develop feelings for one another and trusts each other in the Holy Grail War, like how Rin and Shirou formed an alliancewhile Shirou and Saber started to accept each other. The story was touching in my opinion as the drama included in this anime was extremely well played by all the characters. Basically, the ending wasn't really good but I was still satisfied with how it all turned out, a very good anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art and design in this anime is spectacular, everything in HD mode was nice, effects during fights and characters' expressions were just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nSound effects, voice acting and the music were perfect. I like the feeling you get from the voice actors when they're having different emotions. The opening and ending songs were nice too, very enjoyable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI just do not know how to explain my love for the characters in this anime, they were played out well and each and every one of them had a specialty which I like. Especially the 4 main characters, Rin, Archer, Saber and Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of the parts through the entire anime which allowed me to finish within a few days which was counted fast for me as I usually like to watch animes slowly but this was exceptional, it was too nice till I had to finish it. Although there were some scenes which I find mildly disturbing, they are usually the ones which add to the intense of the anime which is what I actually really like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime and I'm not sure what others might think about it, but this is one of the best in my opinion. A must-watch for those who are lovers of the supernatural and romance genres.",

            "content": "// People don\u2019t die when they are spoiled. However, the spoilers are kept to a minimum here. //\r\nFate/Stay night is the first of several adaptations of a VN with the same name. It is also regarded by many as one of the worst because of non-canon mix of routes. In my opinion, however, its positive features greatly outweigh its flaws as it is an awesome standalone story.\r\nStory:\r\nWe follow our protagonist, Emiya Shirou, as he fights in a battle royal with six other contenders for an omnipotent device that grants wishes to the victor. They each get their own servant, a spirit guardian with unique abilitiesand personality. It is a simple plot, with some twists along the road, but mostly with a linear structure. The show has several battles and a consistent romance story between them. There is little strategy involved in planning those battles, so the show is probably less appealing for those who prefer an intellectual approach to fighting, but they all follow the character\u2019s motivations and personalities. It is very hard to refrain from comparing this adaptation to a 2014 F/SN: UBW title, where, despite an overwhelmingly better quality of animation, the plot got a huge downgrade with a lot of strange turns and twists for the sake of turns and twists. It almost seems like the story gets better the farther it moves from the source and the more it gets reimagined and explored.\\n\r\nThe magic system in the series is mostly explained, and rules regarding the specifics of controlling your own spirit or some extra details to their strengths are shown and noted on the go \u2013 a golden mean between narration and not telling anything at all. That being said, anime does experience some problems in consistency of magic brought from VN. This mainly happens because each servant is overpowered in their own way. Overall the story has a medium pace, is decently explained and has a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe protagonist of the story, Emiya Shirou, is portrayed as heroic, selfless and mostly bland. He has his ideals of saving all the people, not letting anyone suffer or get hurt and so on. There is not much going for him and because the plot does not conflict with his ideals too often, his character does not grow throughout the story. This also means, however, that he does not become childish and annoying, which is a positive aspect in my book. Shirou\u2019s most defining feature (aside from his triangle face) is his reliability. You can almost always tell when, during a difficult fight with small chances to win, he will barge in to save the day (and get absolutely crushed afterwards). Is it predictable? Yes, it is. Does it make the anime less enjoyable or coherent? No. There is a bottom line for Shirou, which makes him so much better that in any other adaptation: he is idealistic, not stupid.\\n\r\n\tThe other focus of the story is Saber, Shirou\u2019s servant. There is not much that could be said without at least somewhat spoiling the plot. In this particular anime, Saber serves as a voice of reason for Shirou, which is satisfying to watch, seeing as how their ideals are similar, while their life experiences are not. In the latter part of the anime, the influence factor is rotated, so she also experiences changes in character. Saber, as the name implies, wields a sword and handles the front line of the assault, which could have led to some really enjoyable moments if it wasn\u2019t for the animation quality.\\n\r\n\tThere are other characters, some of which are important for the story, but they are not shown much, and as such lack good characterisation. Most of them only get their traits revealed through interaction with protagonists, which somewhat limits our perception of them. As this particular anime tries to focus on Shirou\u2019s and Saber\u2019s relationship, it mostly neglects other characters in favour of it. This somewhat changes in the second half of the story, where all of the characters get decent screen time. Even considering that, the main heroes are detailed enough so you will probably not miss the others.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is where the show gets really low. Even considering the year of creation (2006) and the attempt to recreate a specific visual novel style of graphics, the result ranges from somewhat tolerable to extremely bad. Some episodes will leave you wondering if the anime was drawn by a drunk or in a hurry because sometimes characters barely resemble humans. If the particular person is not the focus of a scene, and is only present in the background, you will be lucky to see something closely resembling a face. This could be caused by budget restrictions or outsourcing some of the less important scenes. Probably the latter, since the fights in this anime are actually portrayed fine, compared to the overall style.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is not much to say about the sound other than that it is present. The voice actors do a decent jobs portraying the characters, the background music is okay (and slowly moves towards \u2018great\u2019 in the last few episodes), two OP\u2019s are also fine, but forgettable. I\u2019d like to distinguish a most frequently played ED (Anata ga Ita Mori), because the music perfectly fits the tone of the story, even if the visuals are mostly a still image.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tThere are many reasons to watch this show. It is a good gateway to the franchise for those people who mind plot more than the visuals, it has epic battles, decent character interactions, and a solid romance story. If you can handle some mediocre animation and faces of people who look like they have been cut out of a tree, you will most likely enjoy the positive aspects the show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nScore: Story (7*40%) + Characters (8*30%) + Animation (4*15%) + Sound (8*15%) + Enjoyment (+1) = 8\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Achievement: Not Sure If Anime Or VN (tried to click on a video several times to skip a line of dialogue)\\n",

A friend then wanted to watch it with me so I went back to it and we finished it. I am glad I did. \r\nFate/Stay Night does not have a terribly complicated story. It starts off slow, and kind of boring. Shirou is annoying in his idealism, and to put it bluntly, stupidity. However, as the plot progresses (though changes little), we learn more about the Servants. They're just plain cool, and reason to finish the series on their own to find out what mythological character they are. Forthe most part, FSN is full of lots of little \"that's cool!\" tidbits, and that makes it quite fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs for character, as before stated Shirou is annoying. One might just get used to him after a while, and he does mature at a realistic pace, giving him endearing points. It also helps that everyone else acknowledges he's pretty much a moron half the time. Asides from Shirou, everyone developes well. Each character has a vey distinct personality and they work well together. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a rather choppy review, but as for an overall...FSN is not wonderful. It is rather boring here and there, and not exactly deep. However the script has some very nice lines you could use for graphics fodder, the music is beautiful, and (most) of the characters rock. It's not a bad thing to play in the background while doing something else, or even just something to unwind to at the end of the day. If you're looking for something fairly simple to follow, and just fun, I'd suggest Fate/Stay Night.",

The fights in fate/stay night are one of it's most powerful characteristics and these fights with such unique and well drawn characters are what made the experience of watching this show worth it. I enjoyed how most of the characters were more or less regular school kids that you could imagine spend their days normally about school. This made the anime much more realistic and created a scenario of realistic characters thrown into an absurd reality.\r\nI will warn those getting into the series however that fate/stay night is veryslow to start off, with almost a third of the show consisting of the MC learning what the hell is going on and pussyfooting around. It is finally near the final third of the show that the story starts firing on all cylinders and it's action truly comes to the forefront and shines as it should.\\n\\n\r\nI was also surprised to find out that this show had a fair amount of romance as it's sub-plot. The romance definitely added a quality to the show that if you took the romance out, the product would not be the same. I feel that the romance was necessary for this show, however the way the show developed the romance seemed to be very forced along as they needed the romance to develop quicker than realistically believable due to time shortages since most of the show, and rightly so, was taken up by action. I would have liked the writers of the show to have spent more time building empathy between the audience and the MCs as well as given more story time to development of the relationship between the MC and Saber. I felt that there was not enough development of the character's motivations and experiences with each other for me, as the audience, to truly empathize with the characters. Thus I found the ending to be sweet and nice, but not strong or profound as a good anime's ending should be.",

The most reprehensible detail was Shirou himself; which I''ll get into in a second.\r\nFirst, I watched these in a strange order... I started with Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works, then Fate/zero, then Fate/stay night (2006). I admit that it may be entirely possible that I hold biases due to this experience; but I'm going to do my best to represent a true opinion, distilled of bias:\r\nThe art work and animation seems rather archaic. I would've sworn that I was watching an early 90's anime with the blocky runanimations, the awkward shoulder widths, etc. In terms of the audible experience, it utilizes tinny sound effects and a tiresome soundtrack. The characters are OK, save for Shirou who is a typical self-righteous, self-indulgent, white-knighting, chauvinistic shounen piece of crap. I've never wanted to see a character realize a gruesome demise as much as I have with Shirou...\\n\\n\r\nComparing this experience to something like Fate/zero, Kiritsugu was effectively the opposite of Shirou. Where Shirou was a hyper-emotional, ineffective wad of drama, Kiritsugu was pro all the way, made the hard choices, and while he surely had his chaos, it was the kind of chaos that was mesmerizingly beautiful to witness. Shirou was the paragon of amateurs, while Kiritsugu was the paragon of experience.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I've seen too many anime with these weak, pathetic protagonists that my level of tolerance for characters like Shirou is nigh non-existent... If watching a baby that thinks he's a big boy that can experience big boy feelings seems appealing, then go for it. Otherwise, I think Unlimited Blade Works does a much better job of telling this story (and Fate/zero is worth the time even more so).",

Falling so far into shounen cliches that it was painful to watch virtually every scene in the entire anime that he took part in. But was doubly so towards the second half of the season where they start cramming even more cliches into him. Then they resort to the \"good guys\" winning not one, but two fights with magical Mcguffins of instant cheese.\r\nArt: The art is generic foresay, nothing special. Especially when compared to Fate/Zero(prequel) and Unlimited Bladeworks(alternate).\r\nSound: Average, if not subpar. Especially when it comes to Berserker...\r\nEnjoyment? I found more enjoyment in pointing outplotholes and bad character design than watching it. It almost falls into the category of being so bad it's good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 - Only watched so it didn't look \"fewlish\" to have watched Fate/Zero and Unlimited Bladeworks.",

            "content": "There\u2019s something about the Fate franchise that has such a Westernized influence. The show itself (along with its prequel Fate/Zero) is partially derived from a series of visual novel games, made for the PC and then later for the PS2 and PS Vita made by Type-Moon, but like many visual novel games, it didn\u2019t left a mark in the Western part of the world and then in 2006, an anime adaptation was made into the fray as it would come to that eventually.\r\nShirou Emiya lost his parents in a fire when he was young and was later adopted by a sorcerer by the name ofKiritsugu Emiya. Although he was full of admiration for his adopted father and yearns to become an ally of justice, Shirou has limited powers and was unable to become a strong sorcerer like his father. That is until one fateful day, he was drawn into the Holy Grail War and had to summon a female \"Servant\" known as Saber in order to protect himself. It turns out that the Holy Grail War involves a series of battles among powerful sorcerers to fight for the possession of a relic that will grant one's wishes, the Holy Grail. There are altogether seven \"Masters\" who can summon their respective \"Servants\" from different classes known as Saber, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Lancer, Caster and Assassin. These \"Servants\" have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies. The story revolves around Shirou and his entanglement in the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nWell, after watching through the whole series and possibly getting into the movie, Unlimited Blade Works, I got to say that the show feels like most other shounen anime, meaning there are many epic fights, a plotline involving somebody\u2019s life on the line,  and the occasional magic. Albeit it\u2019s been done before, but what type of story hasn\u2019t? The execution of it was mostly on a medium note, as in it was tired, predictable but something you can stomach thru for the time being.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters in here, the range is either minimum to weak as the main character Shirou Emiya is the noble dumbass savant of the series, as if he wants to fight and protect the people he loves, but the one he\u2019s protecting are overall better fighters than him and more invincible since the few times he tried to fight, he ended up dead\u2026.or very seriously injured. The rest of the Masters were hardly noticeable in the show or barely a standout, except for Rin Tohsaka, whose character is handle OK in the plot, despite sometimes being a damsel-in-distress and Illyasviel von Einzbern and she fills in the role for creepy little girl with white girl but in the second half, she rarely often used in the main plot much. As for the Servants, the two standouts are Saber and Archer, whom have more involved character development into the show than the other Servants, even if Berserker can kill you savagely and violently. I will say that some characters like Taiga Fujimura, English teacher and Shirou\u2019s guardian & Sakura, who often is Shirou\u2019s caretaker, didn\u2019t really felt like if they were offscreen, they were to be noticed that they were missing although involving the latter in the main plotline seems way out of left field.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by famed anime production company Studio Deen (Ranma \u00bd, Hetalia, Higurashi: When They Cry) and it looks pretty impressive, considering it was in 2006. The battle scenes are animated excellently and the backgrounds/art are often utilized to their full extent. Plus, character designs are mostly basic, aside from the Servants, and it does have that Victorian classic feel to it. The opening theme (and some extent, even the 2010 version) was actually one of the better opening themes I have heard in a while, although the second opening was a downgrade to how too fast-paced it is, since the first one builds it up to that pace. The ending was remarkably decent but still something you can back up.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub by Geneon/Bang Zoom! Has more weaknesses than strengths, which is unfortunate since I happen to like Bang Zoom\u2019s dubbing work (yes, even more than Funimation). The biggest weakness being Sam Regal and he wasn\u2019t exactly as whiny as I pictured him as Shirou but his voice feels slightly off due to the appearance of him and comes off as a jerk to me. Mostly the biggest deal in this whole franchise as a whole is the English voice of Saber as of now, three voice actresses\u2019 play the part of her while the Japanese counterpart is only played by one. Kate Higgins has the role of Saber for this time and she was rather decent in her performance. Mela Lee, Sherry Lynn & Liam O\u2019Brien was also decent in their roles while Julie Ann Taylor annoyed me in her role as Taiga, considering how screechy her voice in her character is and Jennifer Sekiguchi (aka Stephanie Sheh) is good but is type-casted as the little girl character but more of a creepy vibe from her.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This series is mostly okay for the execution but in the end, ends up clumsy at the final result. I get some of the hatred or \u201cmeh\u201dness of this show and how it leaves some questions hanging about the Servants and Masters but on the other hand, I\u2019m glad I watched this first, so that way when I eventually watched Fate/Zero, I would feel satisfied in some way. For that, I\u2019ll advise you if you ever watch this or F/Z, either watch Stay Night first or just watch Zero and forget about this one.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**\r\nI really don't get why this anime gets so much praise and gets even more praise with the remake made by studio ufotable, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. What I find really surprising is that this a sequel to Fate/Zero which in my opinion is leagues better than this. So now I will explain why I didn't like this.\r\nStory: (3/10)\r\nThe story of Fate/stay night begins with Shirou Emiya who has learned somewhat how to use his magical powers begins to help people around with it, but one day he suddenly gets involved in battle between 2 magus which thencauses him to get further involved in a battle called the Holy Grail War. In this war there is 7 masters that have 7 spirit servants that are supposed to fight to the death until only 1 master with a spirit servant remains in order to get the holy grail which is capable of granting the master's greatest wish. One of my problems with the story is how every fight that Shirou's in he always loses but then at the very last minute he figures out a strategy on how to beat them or something miraculous happens that makes him able to beat them and this happens pretty much every fight in the anime which then makes it start to get very predictable on what is going to happen. Another thing that really bothers me is how the villains don't take the chance of killing Shirou when he and his allies are almost dead, they either leave or give him more time for no apparent reason. Another thing worth mentioning about the story is that the pacing is pretty bad which is mostly shown during fights.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: (5/10) \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this I found out to be alright at best, some of the backgrounds were nice looking, the character designs of the spirit servants were good, and the magic attacks looked okay. I thought that the animation during battles moved much to slow to be exciting and looked choppy at some moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this was pretty forgettable, the first OP was good and the ED was okay but the second OP I thought was below average. The soundtrack didn't really help making the action scenes any better. The voice acting was fine with nobody really standing out and the sound effects were average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Fate/stay night is definitely the worst thing about the anime. All of them have barely any development. Shirou Emiya is a really bad character because of how stupid he is with his decision making whenever he is in a battle, he usually goes into every battle saying that he will save everyone with Saber fighting the villain and him having no backup plan if it goes wrong which is pretty much every time but since he is the main character it always goes his way no matter how dire the situation may look for him. Another character in the anime is Rin Toosaka who is severely underdeveloped because of how little screen time she has and she is occasionally put into the story because the anime doesn't want us to forget that she is still a character. There is also a character that dies in the middle of the anime which I will not say because that would be going into spoiler territory but they make this death seem like it is really effective but when they show the characters reacting to this death it seems that they were hardly fazed by it. The only thing I liked about the characters is that I got to see the old characters from Fate/Zero again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I got out of Fate/stay night is how there were many references to Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think that Fate/stay night shouldn't have been a continuation of Fate/Zero and I would not recommend this anime.            \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night\r\nArt: For 2006, this is the most beautiful and finely crafted art that I have seen. Fate/Stay Night was literally YEARS ahead of its time in this aspect. I loved how each character was significantly different and getting to know each of them was amazing. Being able to look at the vibrant colors and the fluid animation was just an absolute joy. One thing that I loved was the frame rate that this show seemed to have. I have seen some shows where frame rate is minuscule at best. There was clear emotion and clear effort put into this show and I really appreciatedthis. The one thing that I wasn\u2019t quite a fan of was the colored hair of some of the characters. I\u2019m happy that it wasn\u2019t super drastic and that\u2019s fine and well, but there was a scene where they notice the hair of another character and use it as reasoning to classify him as a foreigner. If you are going to use one person\u2019s hair color to determine information at least keep it consistent. The beginning and ending animations were also amazing and fluid and just overall pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: This soundtrack though! This series has yet to produce music that is not on par with an orchestral cinematic experience. The music in the opening and ending was powerful and moving, but also fit really well with the story. There were times that I could feel the emotion just bleeding out of the music and it made those powerful moments that much more important. There is no question here on the amazing soundtrack, and even moving past that; the sounds in general made this show so much more immersive. I\u2019ve noticed strings of shows that just assume the story is engaging enough and Fate/Stay Night takes that and takes it one step further, and I fully support that. \\n\\n\r\nStory: I was worried that this was going to be just a rehash (even though it came out 5 years before) of Fate/Zero and I was SO wrong. While there were a few characters that are the same from the prequel, there were several major differences, primarily the fact that this had a main character? I felt in the prequel, everyone had their own story, but this primarily focused on Shirou and Rin and how they interacted with their servants. While there was some conflict with Caster, I felt that a lot of the servants that had large roles in Fate/Zero were non-existent in this. Now this could be because this was made first and that was something they fixed, but still, it made it hard to get into at first.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: after watching Fate/Zero I really didn\u2019t want to watch Fate/Stay Night, mostly because I felt like I had seen all that I wanted to see from this storyline. But I was very wrong, in fact this is a whole new story all its own. Even though it took two episodes (one being \u201cepisode 0\u201d) both at 47 minutes to introduce us to the main two characters, I felt like after those the show sped up and things got more interesting. However, I have to state that those first two episodes nearly turned me off to the whole series. I was so worried that it was going to drag and lag, but it picked up and things got really exciting. While I like the fact that there are definite main characters, I found that the removal of some other characters really didn\u2019t make sense or they were relegated to a minor role in sometimes a single episode. While the music was outstanding and the art was incredible, I felt that this shift that put some characters in the limelight and others in the shadows really took it down a notch for me. A great show, but I liked the prequel more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8/10\\n",

Anyway I'll start going over each of the following Animation, Sound, Story, Characters and the show as an Overall.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nNow due to my belief that the animation should be minuscule in deciding to watch something or not, I will not go into any real details and simply say the animation was very good. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nAs far as the sound goes, it was good quality and did not make my ears bleed. As for the openings and endings for this show they are good but they did not grab my attention as others have but that is more due to my own personal taste.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nThe story now this is where people will disagree with me. Due to my lack of knowledge on the original Fate/Stay Night Visual Novel I believe that the story was awesome, whilst others would say \"It doesn't flow well because it's not a pure adaptation of the Fate route\", people like that are just \"perfectionists\".\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nI love all of the characters in this series they all show their personalities clearly and the relationships between the characters are all pretty obvious with the exception of one where all we see is a small flash back, but even from that it is easy to guess the relationship from that.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment & Conclusion\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nFor my conclusion I can simply say it was brilliant to watch and would recommend watching it.",

            "content": "So among the filth that is Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works (TV Version), I found this gem in the Fate series. \r\nStory: 10-A thrilling ride from start to finish. It's pacing is on point, the action scenes don't drag on and you really feel the rush while they are occurring. Every now and again the story slows down for some Slice of Life moments to help build the characters and their depth, so you know...we actually care (something that this series prequel Fate/Zero failed horribly at). But after the slow scenes are over it picks up the pace again with smooth transitioning. Filled to thebrim with interesting plot twists that were foreshadowed with excellent skill.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10-Art is just AMAZING. Both character design wise and animation wise. The character designs are all pretty and actually make them look like real people, unlike certain other studios *cough*ufotable*cough*. And the animation is crisp and fluid especially for 2006, it really adds to the epicness of the fights along with the music and already engaging story and characters. And some people say ufotable is better than DEEN...HAHAHA. DEEN is far superior to them in every way possible. And their great animation quality that isn't filled to the brim with crappy CGI proves it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10-Man oh man...how do I put this into words...put simply the music is epic. Not only does the legend Kenji Kawai improve all of the tracks from the VN (which were still decent enough even before being modified) but he adds some of his own songs to the OST as well, such as Unmei no Yoru, Tenchi Tou Hake, and La Sola. All of which are the greatest pieces of music in any FSN OST ever. The music is always played at exactly the right moment and fits the atmosphere of FSN very well. At times it can be intense, suspenseful, and eerie, other times it can be soothing calm and peaceful. And there are even times when it can be completely epic or heartbreakingly tragic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10-All around great characters, main and supporting casts both. Shirou as an MC and his development was handled with amazing care but I'll just let this quote of his speak for him \"The weakness of wanting to die became the strength of wanting to live.\" He's also a supporting MC meaning he doesn't fight much and is more back up than anything, something you don't see often, especially not in anime of this nature. Then there's also other characters who don't come off as you expect them to or as they would first seem. Illya, Saber, Rin, Sakura, Kotomine, etc. Even Kirei gets to show off how great his character can be, something that Fate/Zero unfortunately was not capable of doing. All of these characters have an amazing amount of depth behind them which you will get to see as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10-Definitely enjoyed this one. It was a very interesting show which I don't regret watching at all. In fact, I would probably never get sick of rewatching it either, it just has that charm about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10-A masterpiece of anime by Studio DEEN which deserves to be checked out. Great story supported by tons and tons of interesting well rounded characters, who each end up getting their own development in a different arc. Animated beautifully alongside and rocking OST, engaging and natural character reactions, and smooth plot twists at every turn, and what's not to love? Definitely a huge improvement upon the Visual Novel it was based on which suffered from only developing a very small closed in group of characters in different routes and completely ignoring all the others, leaving them out in the cold, Shirou's irritating and whiny monologues, and many other flaws which I won't get in to as this an anime review. Anyway, if you haven't gotten into the Fate series yet and are looking to start, this is the way to go. NEVER watch Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works, and just go to the good one instead. I promise you, it's well worth it and that you won't regret it. It's nice knowing that underneath all that garbage, there was this masterpiece lying around just waiting for someone to experience it's glory. After this, I am most certainly willing to call the Studio DEEN, the best anime studio there is. Because if they can make something this incredible, then it's definitely true. So don't miss out on this masterpiece of an anime by this to-tier studio, go watch it ASAP.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have never written a review before but something about this Anime just really made me feel like I had to share my opinion... \r\nThere have been a lot of people saying that this show is overrated and there is some that say it\u2019s a masterpiece I can defiantly see both sides of this coin. My opinion fits somewhere among the two\u2026\r\nLet\u2019s start first with the basic story surrounding Fate/ stay night, it\u2019s about a man named Emiya, Shirou who gets caught up in an event known as the \u201choly grail war\u201d in which seven magicians and their servants fight one another, sometimes to thedeath to obtain the Holy grail, which will grant the wining master and his servant there one desire. \\n\\n\\n\r\n= ANIMATION=\\n\\n\r\nThe character art was a bit old school it felt like looking at an Anime created in the 90\u2019s but is this problem? Maybe to some yes but to me it made the whole thing feels very nostalgic in a way... \\n\\n\r\n Ok so this is where it takes a step from 90\u2019s character Art to HD action the fight scenes and visuals are amazing it gets you locked in before every event in the story saying \u201cyes this is going to be epic\u201d I could not take my eyes of it truly a work of art, But this art starts to fade slowly towards the end of the series most likely because of budget and deadlines the artist had to meet.\\n\\n\r\nIt also really lost points when it comes to the filler scenes right from the start of the series most of those parts feel like they have been rushed thru and disregarded and all the affects focused on the fights among the characters...\\n\\n\\n\r\n=CHARACTER=\\n\\n\r\nI can talk all day about how great these characters are and how much dept they have But in this lays a lot of the problems the characters are so good that you feel like you need more time with them a lot of their past is unexplained which makes it feel like there is to many gaps in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this show was the servants design each of them grabbed my attention because each servant is based on a hero of legend ether good or evil there is some obvious one\u2019s king Arthur, Hercules etc... I loved how they got ideals from all over the globe to create these characters from Japanese culture, Greek mythology and British folklore...\\n\\n\r\nEmiya, Shirou is Much like any Main he starts of being weak and insecure at times almost annoying but towards the end grows into a hero that will put his life on the line not just for his friends or the one he loves but for anyone.\\n\r\nSaber is Shirou\u2019s servant and the character I liked the most I believe she is the heart that carries this Anime because of her nature as a true hero to fight not only in life but even as a spirit to save her people and for fill her duty as a king. The thing about this is they do not show enough of her past like with most characters so you\u2019re left wanting more but yet again getting less...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n =SOUND=\\n\\n\r\nI have only one word to describe it \u201cbeautiful\u201d every fight scene is mirrored perfectly together  it feels like you are listened to an opera the music itself brings out the determination and soul of each fighter, it truly just wraps you up and make\u2019s you apart of the action. Some of the best works of music I\u2019ve heard in an anime add the graphics and it\u2019s a fantastic experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n= STORY/ CONCLUSSION=\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a greatness written all over and to some it's done perfect but to me it fails in bringing out the true potential that it had which is sad because I loved a lot of things about this story the arcs where set out good and everything thing fell into place (sometimes too well)..\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was good even though it was not entirley original but what Anime is in this day and age they all use recycled ideas, it was very entertaining to take a back seat and watch how this tail unfolded...\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I really enjoyed this series, it had a mix of different genres Fantasy, romance, action and shounen just to name a few which were great, the characters are memorable to the point that you  wished you knew more about them But the real thing that made this anime great was the graphics mix in with the sound the end is beautiful and something I will always remember\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to any Anime lover just to give it a try if you have not already who knows you might even add it to one of your all time favorites... \\n\\n\\n\r\nRating:   8 Treemonkeys  d-_- b\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! Please be kind ive never done this before..\\n",

            "content": "MY FIRST REVIEW!!!! \r\nAlright, so I just finished watching this and I have to say that it was good but very over-hyped. Let's go step by step now: \r\nStory: \r\nThe story was serviceable for me. There were no surprises and twists that would blow your mind. The finale is fairly  predictable but solid. There are some plotholes however that leave you stumped and the anime loses the realism at times because of it. There are also a bunch of conveniences thrown in so the story can move along. Overall though, the writers had the right idea with the story but they weren't completely successful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animations were fine, especially for the fact that this was released back in 2006. The fights looked great and the individual character models were fine. The surrounding areas such as trees, buildings, etc... could have been touched up more but didn't really bother me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is cheesy but I liked it. It has the right vibe to how the story is being told. The voice acting for the original Japanese version was good, though one character in particular's voice pissed me the hell off. The fights, sword play, walking, etc... sounded great, no problems for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the biggest problem lies. The main character is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING!! He is reckless and just does not think with his head. The characters in this show overall are not fully-fleshed out and most of the characters were irrelevant. Some characters were introduced early on, and they added absolutely nothing to the overall story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it but after a certain amount of episodes, it just started becoming a chore. That is never a good sign and this anime meandered way longer than necessary. But again, there is enjoyment to be had. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a solid anime and I can see why people obsessed over it. Fate/Stay Night definitely had their moments but in the end, it was sort of a chore to finish up. There were too many inconsistencies that made the feeling of realism dissipate. Not to mention all the plot conveniences and lack of memorable characters, you have yourself a fairly forgettable anime. With that said,  there is enjoyment to be had while watching this and I'll give Fate/Stay night a 6.",

            "content": "I watched the Fate/Zero series several years before watching Fate/Stay Night so the attempts at foreshadowing were wasted for me since I knew a lot of things that happened. I knew the history of Emiya and Kotomine, what happened to Rin's father. With that said, I really enjoyed the series nonetheless because the series didn't hinge on these events... they were more for a surprise factor.\r\nFor its time (2006), Fate/Stay Night has great animation quality. Watching it in 2016 I surprisingly didn't compare it to the animation quality of more modern anime series because there weren't any specific scenes that caught my attention as poorlydone. When scenes are poorly done, it takes you away from the story by focusing on production rather than the event thats going on, but that didn't happen for this series. There is potential for improvements in animation that were put in the unlimited blade works remake but I feel they reached too far, and with the excessive explosions, it made me focus on the production rather than the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series is unforgettable. I personally enjoy character development and music the most from anime so I will discuss both in this paragraph. Emiya the selfless one, Saber the regretful one, Rin the naive one, Sakura the helpless one etc... If you had one word to define each character, it wouldn't be difficult. This is common with stories that have multiple characters to easily identify between them, but what makes the character relatable and real is the 'other stuff'.\\n\\n\r\nEmiya's character is something most would look up to because his goal is for the happiness of others. As humans, it is genetically engrained in us to please others to a degree and Emiya takes that as far as it can be taken, and then some. It's unrealistic how he acts and, the undisguised heroic acts breaks the trust between what we think he thinks and what he actually thinks. I personally saw Emiya as someone that no one is. He is consistent throughout the anime so this trust is regained over time but the value lost at the beginning is something that will lose a lot of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Saber's character development was genuine. I love pathos and she does great at making you feel for her even though she doesn't want it. In her real life, as a holy knight, pride was an important behaviour to have to present yourself. Since I watched Fate/Zero I knew what she wanted the grail for, but I still felt it was right to hope she gets it for her wish. Her fighting style is awesome, and I wish her fight with Koujiro had more talking about their view of the sword rather than their culture they lived in as I think that would have been super interesting. The creators didn't turn her into a tsundere or a slut, which is rare to see, but they made her a little clueless about emotions which I didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is a great anime to watch. I normally can't stand old animed shows because quality is important to me, but the other aspects (especially the audio) make up for it. Everyone talks about what order people should watch the Fate series in, so here is my opinion on the best way: Old Fate/stay, Fate/zero, MAYBE Unlimited blade works; I just google who archer is and that was better than watching the series for me.",

            "content": "PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED\r\nSeriously, why the hell did I watch this anime? It's a complete, utter piece of fried shit. Hell, the only reason why I even considered this anime is because I wanted to see what happened after Fate/Zero (and so I could pleasure myself when watching unlimited plot armor works).  However, I wasn't dissapointed when watching this.  I actually enjoyed watching it. A lot.\r\nHEAR THAT, COLLEGE STUDENTS?!? I ENJOY WATCHING SHIT!!!\r\nSo the story follows Mr. Feminazi (or just call him Shirou Emiya like the anime wants you to), the adopted son of Black Badass Kiritsugu Emiya, and his romanticcomedy with King Arthur the Lesbian (or Saber, as all of hi- her fans). They are thrown into a holy grail war between him and 6 other dipshits with Bakugo cards. Obviously, King Genderbender is extremely powerful, but Mr. Feminazi doesn't want her to fight to protect his feminist ideals. Oh, and apparently Kiritsugu died of old age in his mid 30s, so Feminazi's english teacher is now taking care of him at his mansion, alongside Sakura Matou, who is so cutee but doesn't get the attention she deserves. (And if you think that you'll get more Sakura in UBW, Hah!). The concept of the story is pretty flippin fantastical but the execution is anything but.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, lets mention how much of a DUMBASS that Feminazi is. Seriously, chill your activism. Saber is pretty weak too. She only fights like 2 times the whole series because Feminazi has the power of plot armor to destroy any enemy. The only decent characters are Rin and Archer, and even then, they are MILES better in Unlimited Fag Works. (And yes, I watched this anime before UBW). The servants are all weak as shit, the battle fought is on such a small scale that even a grain of sand beats it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good actually, when you don't compare it to that of Zero and UBW. Considering it was made in early 2006, it's pretty good, but nothing to bow down to. The soundtrack is actually pretty good too. The tracks in the anime are actually pretty memorable, I can still remember them to this day, and it's been a little over 2 weeks since I finished the anime. The openings are both good, and the ending embraces my tears. Not really but its a pretty piece of moosic.\\n\\n\r\nAlright so this anime is obviously a complete piece of shit. But I had a lot of fun watching it. And when you overlook it's problems, you will probably enjoy it at the very least. \\n\\n\r\n7/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: This review contains spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions: When I first heard about this series I had very mixed feelings about it. For starters, it\u2019s based on an erotic visual novel, at the same time though it's also a free-for-all battle series, complete with mages and historical figures fighting each other to the death over a magical all purpose macguffin. \u201cSounded right up my alley\u201d I thought and this series became my gateway to Type-Moon, which has provided me with tons of entertainment and has become one of my favourite franchises, in part due to me being an amateur history buff. Plus, I think the whole ideaof the Fate franchise is a very novel idea, which as of yet, I don\u2019t seem to have grown the least bit bored of.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nIn the normal Japanese city of Fuyuki, an age-old ritual takes place, the holy grail war, a battle royale over the Holy Grail, a magical item which is said to grant any wish its possessor desires. Seven chosen masters are assigned their seven destined servant heroic spirits and must battle each other to the death, until only one pair remains. Main character Shirou Emiya, who lost everything in a fire and was saved and adopted by a self-proclaimed sorcerer named Kiritsugu Emiya is to be one of said masters. In admiration of his stepfather\u2019s kindness, he decided to train to become a just magical hero, but after his stepfather passed away during the last holy grail war ten years prior, his training has been less than fruitful and in present day, he's an amateur sorcerer without much skill or knowledge. One day, against his will, he becomes a master for the 5th holy grail war, after accidentally summoning a heroic spirit named Saber, and so his battle for survival begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is an adaptation of the Fate route from the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, which is probably my least favourite route for various reasons which I\u2019ll get into later. As far as battle shounen titles go, I\u2019d say this one is in general a pretty decent one. Not only does it deliver on cool fights, but it also provides a slightly interesting, albeit shallow commentary on morality for the uninitiated. It explores the different ethical viewpoints of its characters while they're going through the holy grail war. The major problem though is that this series tries to have its cake and eat it too by juggling a serious death battle with slice of life and pseudo-harem elements, making it that much more jarring when any serious plot elements come into play. Case and point, despite the fact that Emiya is kidnapped, or even nearly killed multiple times while either at school or doing mundane things around town, as if the fact that there are people out there trying to kill him is completely a non-issue, serving to both make the show look tonally inconsistent and him look very very stupid. Even worse, quite a few of the masters who lost their servants during the war end up taking residence in his house. Including ones that tried to kill him before, who are still a potential threat. This is completely hand-waved in favour of playing out various slice of life romantic scenarios. As a result of this tonal whiplash, I stopped taking anything in the series seriously and decided to enjoy the ride for what it\u2019s worth. Unfortunately, to me, that\u2019s not much, as the route the anime covers is pretty vanilla when compared to the visual novel\u2019s other routes. The anime just gives you the bare basics of what you need to know about the series, while leaving a lot of things so deprived of detail that the provided world and characters end up, as a whole feeling very sterile. Plus in all honesty, the plot twists in this series are iffy at best, not to mention predictable if you\u2019ve any experience with any kind of stories that feature magic or objects that grant wishes, like the plot twist concerning the true nature of the holy grail isn't really that shocking when you consider that so far no one has won the holy grail and made a wish with it. The only reason the Fate route is even remotely worthwhile is due to the interest it builds for the franchise as a whole. That, and the route\u2019s character of focus, Saber and her fascinating internal conflict in deciding whether to make her wish and redo the past or accept the past and live a normal life with Shiro. Although I feel the romance that happens between them is somewhat forced in some regards, I still find it cute and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nMain character Shirou Emiya is probably this series\u2019s weakest point. At first glance he seems to be a one-note character, who\u2019s selfless nature compels him to become a just hero, to the point that he\u2019s willing to risk his life to protect people with no concern for his own safety, and no amount of additional glances will change that perception. Minor cynicism aside though, his major problem is bare bones characterisation, a problem that could be supplemented with some internal monologue, except he doesn\u2019t have any of that. This is quite the missed opportunity too, as in the visual novel he\u2019s significantly more layered than what one would initially think, specifically because he has that one factor going for him. Additionally, he\u2019s held back character-wise by the fact that there aren\u2019t many tests of his character, which if existent, would allow his character to bloom into something a little more reminiscent of a human being. It\u2019s because of this lack of trails to overcome and grow from that his outlook isn\u2019t really validated in any meaningful sense, making him mostly just come across of the same naive, ignorant kid he was in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSaber, the heroine of this route thankfully has at least a little depth to her Character, at least when compared to Shiro. The clash between her stoic warrior side and her feminine side, which comes out increasingly more due to her growing bond with Shiro is quite interesting, Unfortunately, she mostly just comes across as a plank of wood that only deals in extremes, taking away greatly from that aspect of her character. To emphasize my point, early on in the series there\u2019s a scene where Shiro walks in on her in the shower and she doesn't care, as she feels that any particular emotion being inspired over such a thing unreasonable, but later into the series, during a very similar scene, she get extremely self-conscious, mainly due to her awareness of her physical appearance, to the point where she comes across as an entirely different character. What that tells me is that to properly function as a warrior and as a leader she had to sacrifice her femininity, mind, body and soul. A very interesting concept, as it shows both the strength of her resolve and the crippling effects of the momentous weight that\u2019s been placed on her shoulders during her whole life. I will say though, I\u2019m kinda bothered by the fact that she\u2019s King Arthur turned female, as I think that that idea, while interesting, is rather problematic, due to seemingly being done more for fan service more than anything else. Because this is based on a what\u2019s essentially a porn game, there have to be sex scenes, therefore there has to be a female lead, otherwise I think it would\u2019ve ended up alienating most of the main demographic or anyone who would even bother with watching it, unless saber was a Trap.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are a really mixed bag. Most of the ones that aren't Shiro\u2019s school friends are either one-note or multi-layered. This route is, in general, very good at characterising its cast in a very subtle show, don't tell way. Caster for example, who\u2019s at first built up as just an evil witch, is later on showcased as having various different sides to her in a very subdued, natural way. For example, there\u2019s a scene in which she and her master get backed into a corner by Shiro and friends, only for another heroic spirit to enter the battle and try to kill her master. It is then that she chooses to stand in the way of the attack, and die as a result. Its actions like this that some the cast have some semblance of depth, as well as add a very interesting theme, that of morality being in the eye of the observer. Even though quite a few of the cast members are supposedly evil, or commit evil actions, they are proven time and time again to have the capacity act in selfless, and in some cases even honourable ways. Thanks to this, the show manages to create very nuanced take on morally. Unfortunately, there\u2019re still the odd characters that are so inhumanely evil that you can\u2019t bring yourself to care about them beyond the way in which one care about a funny joke, like Shiji. Alternatively, there also characters that are so blandly good people that they\u2019re entirely lacking in flavour, who only exist to either provide some sense of normalcy or information on what the average Joe thinks is going on in the city, like Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5/10\\n\r\nConsidering the time this came out, the art and animation are more or less passable, maybe even above average, excluding the god-awful CGI dragon scene, which to be honest looks like it was rendered using a PS1. Although, when compared to other series like Death Note or Ergo Proxy, which look astronomically better, despite coming out during the same year. Hell, even when compared to a lot of 90\u2019s anime, like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop, Fate/Stay Night doesn\u2019t even come close to competing, something which is very telling of where it\u2019s at on the totem pole. All in all, the production values aren't exactly great and definitely haven't aged well either, which I feel is the reason why quite a few people don't watch this series. This is a major problem, because it also affects how the battles look and play out. The fights often feel stiff as a corpse and to add insult to the injury, most of them are the characters just talking. This means that the entirety of a lot of confrontations is a sleep inducing few minutes of a clunky mess, preceded by an only slightly less sleep inducing dialogue. But hey, on the bright side, who needs Ambien? On a more seriously positive note though, I actually do really like the stylishly anime character designs a lot, especially in regard to how Lancer, Caster and Assassin look and feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite how it\u2019s been doing so far, this series at least somewhat excels in the sound department. The first and second openings are decent enough and help capture the epic feeling that goes hand in hand with the content. Unfortunately, the ending songs aren't really that noticeable or memorable, even if they fit the series well. The OST was done by Kenji Kawai, who\u2019s worked on other series like Higurashi, Barakamon and Ghost in the Shell, among many others, so one would expect nothing less than quality from someone with such works on their profile. Unfortunately though, while on point in most scenes, is way too subdued for its own good and doesn't build on series\u2019s strengths. One could argue that the more subdued nature of the soundtrack helps capture and amplify the emotions and feels of the characters, who in there lives have come to shoulder many burdens and regrets, in particular their heroic spirits. Now in that regard, I\u2019ll give it points for adding some sort of  narrative subtlety. However, I feel a more epic sounding one, like for Unlimited Blade Works or even Heaven\u2019s Feel would fit this series better, given that the material it goes with is essentially about mages and fantasy heroes of old duking it out. The sub and dub are both passable, with both the versions\u2019 voice acting teams doing quite a good job with what they had to work with and more than successfully capturing the personality of the characters they were playing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m an amateur history buff, and therefore quite enjoy learning about history, I found the pseudo-historical element of this series to be very interesting. Additionally, the idea that history isn't exactly as it is written, which especially evident with the characters of Caster, Rider and Saber in particular added quite a lot of extra appeal for me, something which Fate/Stay Night managed to do a really good job of capitalizing on. Although the flip-side of this is that for the history you\u2019re presented with, you have to have an open mind and take everything with a pretty hefty grain of salt. The fights were also quite enjoyable, because of the philosophical perspectives expressed by characters during them, lending them some much needed engagement and impact. This is because these additional aspects serve to make the fights, not just over glorified sword and club fights, but rather broader reaching ideological conflicts. It\u2019s thanks to the aforementioned that Fate/Stay Night was, enjoyment wise at least pretty much love at first site.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nAs far as battle royale series go, Fate/Stay Night is pretty decent overall. Unfortunately, it\u2019s as deep as some would make it out to be, due to the fact that the route this anime covers is the fate route, which I said before is kinda the barebones vanilla route of the set. It only show the bare basics and doesn't really shine on its own, unless you really like the character of saber. As an introduction to the franchise and Type-Moon in general though, this series does a very good job of selling on it, even if the production values leave just a little more than a little to be desired. However, if you\u2019re looking for more depth or generally something more extreme you're better off watching the Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven\u2019s Feel adaptations, which are in all honestly are the peaks of this entire franchise. Specially since they are not only way more interesting in story and characters than Fate/Stay Night, but also feature a god tier OST and animation, not to mention being very pleasing on the eyes. \\n\\n",

            "content": "So, upon the urging of some friends, i watched this anime. Please note that i haven't seen the 2nd or 3rd seasons of it, and i dont plan to... not after that, i won't. So I'm judging this season by itself and not by what happened afterwards. I really don't know why this anime is so popular. I will refrain from bringing up specific things to avoid spoilers (for people who hate that). Fate Stay Night was confusing. Close to the middle i realised none of the characters knew what the hell was going on and blantantly contradicted their own assertions from prior episodes. Thecharacters constant flip-flopping between what they believed to be true made it difficult for me to take anything anyone said seriously. Hence, the confusion, and my annoyance. \\n\\n\r\n  The main protagonist is sexist jerk and a retard. An irritating combination. Infact, there are very few likable characters. Instead of developing the characters:only seemed to regress. Saber started out as a proud, focused hero/(heroine?) and by the end of it was a complete sellout. It would exhaust me to go through how all the characters regressed, but this was basically the trend: all of turn into disappointments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, though. I'll concede. Especially considering when it released. But other than that, there are few praises i can heap on this anime. It's just baffling to me that people have such rave reviews about it, I'm wondering if i watched the same snime everyone is talking about.",

I like the extra time given to Illya and Rider, and the fact Kirei and Caster get to stick around a bit longer. Overall I still prefer UBW and Heaven's Feel routes, but that's not to say this is bad in any way. Your usual, average anime story I'd say.\r\nArt\r\nIt's quite a bit older than UBW and even Zero, and by another studio, so it lacks behind a bit. There's some funny bits and pieces in animation, but the art is usually fine. Just fine, no more, no less.\r\nSound\r\nThe soundtrack hasthis nostalgic feeling about it that complements the series well. It's even semi-memorable, although very different from the other series. It was okay!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nJust like UBW, many characters don't nearly get enough time to get to know them or see them grow. It feels more like a skirmish between some inept static kids with ridiculous ideals sometimes, and the grown-ups barely do anything. That said, I do prefer this Shirou over UBW's version. More realistic, if only by a little!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe horrible dragon animation aside, there are several issues with this show. But I wouldn't call it BAD. As a Fate fan, I had fun watching it, there were some neat references and changes, and it was enjoyable at the end of the day. It's a kinda sweet story. If I weren't a fan, then I don't know.",

            "content": "This review shall encompass Fate/Zero seasons 1 and 2, as well as Fate/Stay Night.\r\nThis show is one of the best out there.\r\nThere isn't much to say, everything is just done so well. It takes a premise and story and brings it to life in a way that very few shows have ever done before.\r\nFirst, the story is one of the best I have ever experienced. The whole setting of the Grail Wars, the mechanics and history of the battle and the level of immersion and ecompassment that this show immediately displays is already at a level unseen before. It not only builds a story, butit builds a world around it and uses that world to weave the threads of a tale so well that I wanted to believe that it was real. The entire premise of the show is something that was done so expertly and fluidly; so well that I have to mention it.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters are, for the most part, phenomenal. Throughout the whole series, nearly all of the characters are ones that you can empathize with. Ones that I didn't like at first became my favorites, and ones that I *did* like continued to earn my affection through the whole experience. There are a few cases of the \"anime antagonist\" where there is not enough evidence to convince you that they aren't there just because they needed someone to fight against, but for the most part, the conflicts and tension between members of the story are all real and understandable. Each one either has a motive that you can empathize with or an attitude that justifies their action in a way you can respect. Plenty of good quotes as well.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the only thing holding this show back is their various small mistakes. The Fate/ series did all the big things right, but let several details cause inconsistency and blips in tone and tension that were numerous enough to stop this show from being a Legend. If these last few details and tone-bumps were smoothed and fleshed out, this show would earn its spot as one of my Legends quite soundly.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to mention is the soundtrack. Let it be said, it's phenomenal. Every second of it nearly perfectly accents the concurrent part of the video, and all of it is amazing and worth listening to on its own. I only wish that they could have made it more orchestral than it did. Most of it, the notable \"songs\" at least, are mostly modern-style bands, with electric guitars drum sets, vocals, etc. In other words, stuff you would expect from a JPOP band. I only wish and wonder what it would have been like if there had been a full orchestra in addition to the modern band at their disposal.\\n\\n\r\nLet none of that deter you, however. The Fate/ series is phenomenal, and there is no other show out there like it. The story and world it tells and builds are of epic proportions, on the same scale as LOTR, and for that alone it earns its spot in my hall of fame. But past that, the actual story, characters, sound, and absolutely *beautiful* art are pieces of the puzzle that make this show truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\n9.2/10, only barely not a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEGGGUUUSSSS KAAAAALIBAAAAAHHH!!!",

I finished this in two days and I'm so happy I had the time to sit down and binge it all because it was amazing.\r\nOf course, as you can see, I didn't give this a 10/10 merely because the story wasn't as fleshed out as I would'veliked it to be. It seemed like there was a lot missing from the history of the Grail Wars and the Servants that would've brought a lot to the story. That being said, I haven't read Fate/stay night nor have I seen the rest of the animated works at this time, so that may be why I was slightly dissatisfied with the lack of story detail in this anime alone.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I absolutely loved the story between Saber and Shirou. Their interactions were so rich, and I always enjoyed watching them together. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, not a perfect anime, but I don't think it deserves the lashing it gets from certain Fate/stay night fans.",

            "content": "After watching Fate/Zero, I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch Fate/stay night or go straight to Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. I chose to check out F/SN first, and I must say, it was quite an enjoyable anime. However, it was far from flawless.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is pretty straightforward. Emiya Shirou is involved in a battle royal with six other people known as \u201cMasters\u201d to get an omnipotent wish-granting device. Each of these Masters has a Servant, who is a spiritual being summoned to fight for them. In this anime, many battles are fought, and there is even a little bit of romance. While theplot is not terribly difficult to understand, the background information might be a bit confusing to those who have not seen other anime in the Fate series. The story is a bit predictable at times, but there are enough twists to make the story interesting. However, unlike Fate/Zero, not all of the Masters and Servants get enough screen time to allow viewers to get to know each Master and Servant well. Some characters get a lot of screen time, while others barely appear at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation is generally serviceable, it is also inconsistent. There are many instances when characters' faces and features are not fully or properly animated. These instances don't just happen in battle scenes. Sometimes, \"regular/normal\" scenes with the characters suffer from a lack of details in the characters' appearances. Sometimes a face might be skewed in one direction, or maybe a person\u2019s body is animated too simplistically. Various animation problems like those that were just mentioned frequently appear in the series. The other issue with the art is some of the characters' eyes. While some characters have \"normal-looking\" eyes, some characters have eyes that can only be described as one color superimposed upon another with very basic black outlining. This causes some characters to look different from other characters for no particular reason. Though it is not that serious, it is certainly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP is great. It\u2019s a remake of the original \u201cThis Illusion\u201d from the Fate/stay night visual novel. I gradually came to accept the second OP, but the first 10-11 seconds of the second OP are very unpleasant compared to the rest of the OP. The music is distorted and it\u2019s almost like you are hearing the music playing from behind a wall. Contrastingly, the vocals, which have no effects, really stand out. Hearing the second OP for the first time is a bit weird because the music and vocals do not seem to fit together in the beginning. However, the rest of the second OP is fine. The ED is easily the best music in the series. It\u2019s a slow, calm track that relaxes the viewer after every episode. Somehow, this ED works with every episode in the series, even if not much happened in the episode. The background music is fine, but it doesn't really stand out. There do not seem to be a lot of tracks for the background music, so the background music becomes extremely repetitive after a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nUntil the latter half of Fate stay/night, the protagonist, Emiya Shirou, is a very unlikeable character. For the first half of F/SN (and sometimes in the second half), Shirou constantly does things that the viewer would consider rash or unwise. Without trying to spoil anything, I will stay that Shirou puts himself in dangerous situations more often than he could have been. He also says many things that could be perceived as sexist, na\u00efve, or simply ignorant; since he is unaware of the nature of the things he says, he is a very irritating character to watch. During episodes 13-24, Shirou is more tolerable, however, he will sometimes revert back to his ways in the first half of the anime. However, the other main characters, particularly Rin, are characters that the viewer can easily like and connect with. The other main characters, as I like to put it, \"keep things real.\" While Shirou has a lot of idealistic beliefs, the other characters frequently expose him to the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of his thinking and try to make him see the error of his ways. Since the majority of the other characters think like adults (even those who are not adults), and Shirou thinks like a child, the other characters are much more tolerable characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for all the characters, though, was excellent. Kana Ueda and Jouji Nakata\u2019s voice acting in particular are amazing. Even the seiyuu for Shirou does the character justice. There was not a single character whose seiyuu was annoying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched Fate/Zero prior to this anime, it was interesting seeing the aftermath of the events that had taken place in Fate/Zero. It was also nice seeing characters that I recognized in Fate/Zero in another time and in (slightly) different settings. However, I believe that if you have not seen Fate/Zero or Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, you will have a bit of a hard time understanding things in the beginning of the anime. Overall, though, Fate/stay night was certainly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night isn\u2019t as bad as people make it out to be. Is it perfect? Certainly not. Be that as it may, if you are looking for an action-fantasy anime to watch, and you don\u2019t have any specific preferences, check out Fate/stay night. For those who have already seen Fate/Zero, even if you\u2019re planning to watch UBW, check this out. After all, the Fate route is different from the UBW route. For those who have already seen Zero and UBW, still check this out. It\u2019s definitely not as good as Zero or UBW, but it will still be an enjoyable watch. (Start of digression) HOWEVER, if you haven\u2019t seen any of the Fate anime and your plan to watch list includes Zero and one or both of the F/SN anime, watch one of the FS/N anime first. The revelations in F/SN will be more surprising and Zero will be more enjoyable (End of digression). Though a lot of people on MAL say to avoid this anime and watch UBW instead, I still believe that FS/N (2006) has enough redeemable qualities to make it an anime worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6.5 (rounds up to a 7)\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night is my first touch with the Fate series and I'm not really disappointed but it wasn't as epic as I expected it to be. \r\nStory: A survival game about the \"Holy Grail War\", a one-wish granting object which is letting seven mages fight each other with each of their servants, the so called \"Heroic Spirits\" from every timeline or age, whether it be just a legend or a fairy tale for example King Arthur. Only if one master or servant is alive, the holy grail will show itself and the remaining master/servant can get his/her wish granted. \r\nAn interesting concept, kinda reminds meof Mirai Nikki and it does intrigue me. The Anime doesn't fear of giving away time to explain certain events or a back story and fits itself to the present event. So, you always get an explanation for everything of what is happening but what surprised me is the fact that Slice of Life, Comedy and Romance elements were also included. I mean romance...it's not like I dislike the genre (It's actually my favourite genre) but I would NEVER expect that kind of development in such a serious story like Fate. (I don't even count the relationship in Mirai Nikki as romance by the way) It was a welcoming surprise which I personally really enjoyed actually. \\n\\n\r\nI've also heard that Fate/Stay Night has severe adaptation problems, for example important scenes or explanations of certain actions from the original visual novel which were left out in the Anime. I can't state my opinion on that matter since I'm a newbie in the series and have no experience with the VN. I guess that's the main reason why the original '06 Anime adaptation is getting so much hate from the fans....\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well....it's mediocre at best but I didn't expect much from the animation since it's from 2006. There's not much to say in this section but just...don't expect clean pictures with smooth animation since it's pretty much the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm absolutely in love with the first opening. The song is quite similar to older 80s 90s music and gives you an old but mysterious feeling. The ending is also worth to mention. As for the rest I'm definitely satisfied and would even recommend a few tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Saber... I think the biggest reason as to why I was always interested in the Fate series is because of this character. Her fighting style, her design..everything of her character attracted me (Not sexually of course lol) and I wanted to learn more about her. I could without a doubt identify myself the best with her and after watching the actual Anime I even got more attached to her. Now, I could write a whole article about this character but since this is a review about the whole Anime I will just continue normally and stop wasting your time. Emiya Shirou as the main chara of Fate/Stay Night is \"funny\" and strange. He's unrealistic, kinda overpowered and doesn't give worth to his own life. That's the type I always disliked the most for a MC. I could get used to his character after some time but this guy annoys me to no end and his voice actor doesn't make it better unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nYou get to see alot of abnormal characters in this series and mentioning every one of them would just make this review way too long so I guess this is enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yes, I enjoyed it. I'm not disappointed but I'm also not satisfied. As an alone standing Anime it's a nice experience and you want to learn more about the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A fine show, with a serious story and some pretty intriguing characters. I liked it.",

I first watched wrongly the prequel that was aired after this and didn't like it that much, cause it is way darker than this one.\r\nI like the whole theme of the anime, how mages summon servants to fight amongst them, that's why I was atracted to it, but I think what bothers me the most only happens because of the time the anime was made. The animation and the rhythm of the scenes are pretty lame (the animation was only improved in the last ep). Andthis for an anime focused on fights, makes me really disappointed. Maybe if I'd watched it in 2006 my opinion would be a lot different.\\n\r\nThe highest point of the anime for me is the soundtrack. The musics are awesome. Thrilling scenes with those chants/classical music on the back are incredibly good. The openings and endings are really good as well.\\n\r\nDespite I liked almost all the characters, I don't think the anime did a good job on them, because I felt no connection with anybody. They're all very superficially explored.\\n\r\nBut it's a good anime in general and is worth watching.",

            "content": "Many have hailed 'Fate/zero' as this amazing anime, and Saber one of the most amazing waifus to ever walk this earth. I decided to hop on the bandwagon with this series, and I started my delightful journey with 'Fate/stay night'. \r\nAnd, man, do I disagree.\r\nThis anime is, simply, mediocre. The art is meh. The characters meh. Nothing really stands out about this show. Yet people seem to like the series (the whole Fate series. Not this show specifically. People actually seem to dislike this one.) \r\nNormally, mediocre shows have at least one interesting thing. This typically ends up being an interesting premise or some coolaction sequence. \\n\r\nBut some things really made me dislike this anime. And I couldn't find any redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nSo here are the four main things that I disliked about 'Fate/stay night'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Otome Game-esque Animation\\n\r\nI put the animation first on this list because it's one of the main factors that goes into my decision to watch an anime or not. An older style of anime (For example, 'Fate/stay night') is not as appealing to me compared to a new, brightly colored style of anime (For example, 'Hyouka'.) I thought that the characters looked like they jumped out of an otome game. (And as you know, or may not know, I kinda hate otome turned anime adaptations. They just don't sit well in my stomach.) \\n\r\nSeriously, they strike poses that mimic otome character poses, and it really made me want to cry.\\n\r\nThis funny (NOT) because the show is based off a light novel, not an otome game. Oh well. 2006 animation, right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSee? Otome game!\\n\r\nLack of Interesting Plot\\n\r\nSure, there's some semblance of a plot. There are fights and story arcs, but they're not well-done. We have the main characters (Emiya and Saber) who fight different people. For example, they fight Rider and her Master. This is one of the main 'arcs'. It's not much, and the fight scene isn't even good. Rider barely even uses her Rider-ness to fight. (One horse scene. ONE.) \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nRider barely uses her horse, and she fights with chains. That's it. (Well...Archer doesn't fight with a bow normally. So.)\\n\r\nThe show basically implies a large Servant v Servant battle (Reminiscent of 'Future Diary'.) But we all we get are smaller arcs which aren't very interesting. The fight scenes were boring, and I just want the story to continue on. The last 'major' battle wasn't anything special, and I kept staring at my screen in complete confusion. Just what was happening?\\n\\n\r\nAs I sit at my desk and write this little list, I still have no clue how to sum up the plot.\\n\r\nAnd that shows you just how awful the plot was. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBoring, 2-D Characters\\n\r\nLet's go down the list of main characters. And analyze them one by one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya\\n\r\nJust look at his derpy face...\\n\r\nEmiya Shirou\\n\r\nHe's this 'powerful' Magus (You know this because Archer helps him out with the visualization thing, and it actually works. Also, Toosaka mentions this 'special snowflake' quality of his a few times.) Honestly, he makes me mad. There was nothing special about him. If you have a character with a strong moral code, you can work with that. But Emiya was just so stubborn. I felt so annoyed listening to him talk. Even the people with the strongest morals would have backed down at times. He's supposed to be the good guy in it all, but I honestly didn't care if he won or lost a battle. I just wanted to get to the next scene, preferably without him. He was ignorant and completely childish at times. There was no character development whatsoever. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSaber\\n\r\nSaber's Emiya's wonderful Servant. Who is of the Saber class. She's this strong heroine...who seems to always need Emiya. She has this really cool Noble Phantasm but passes out after using it and...you guessed it NEEDS EMIYA. The fact that show subtly adds some lovely sexist tones with Saber's character made me want to roll under my desk and hide for a million years. No, you can't say 'But that was 2006! It's 2016 now!' I'm still going to hide. Has our culture changed that much in ten years? Nope. I don't think so, but that is a topic for another time. Back to Saber. \\n\r\nNot only is she a 'strong heroine', she is also as interesting as a piece of wet cardboard. Her character barely gets any interesting lines, and she has no characterization at all. I know she might get better with 'Fate/zero', but, so far, my opinion of her isn't very good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nToosaka Rin\\n\r\nToosaka might be the only interesting character in this show. She is sassy and quick to retort. But the fact of the matter is, she is really just an ally for Emiya. I know that she isn't the main main character, but she could get some characterization too. We have a hint of backstory, but it's never explored enough for me to care. I felt like she was just the more experienced Magus for Emiya to learn from. She could have been a great mentor...if she wasn't basically another girl in the Emiya Harem. (She's the smart...but sexy one. Mysterious and pushes you away. What will happen next?) Plus, in the last few episodes, she's completely ignored for the bull romance. Thanks? And it's not like I'll watch 'Unlimited Blade Works' and see her side of things. So she's forever this empty sort of harem girl in my mind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArcher\\n\r\nI can't even start talking about him without cringing. For one of the main characters, Archer gets no action. He's seen maybe...three times total in the whole show. Really. And he's supposed to be one of the main characters? Uh...no. And he also gives advice to Emiya (whom he hates.) I deny your argument. I can't care about him if he is given no role in this show. So bye-bye. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Bull Romance\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, look. The lovely couple. How cute... -rolls eyes-\\n\\n\r\nThe second Emiya whipped out the 'I care for her' card, I wanted to slam my fist against the wall. (Which I may or may not have done.) Romance can be done right, but, normally, that's not the case. And with 'Fate/stay night', the romance was unnecessary. You can build up a great romance between friends, and that would have been fine. \\n\r\nWhat's even worse is that you can't believe the romance. There's no indication of a crush, and the things we do get can be labeled as 'Virgin Dude Unexposed to Sex Appeal'. (Namely, the scenes where Saber stands naked in front of Emiya.) \\n\r\nThe romance is too forced, and it lacks the spark a normal romance does. So no. Just no.",

Simply because the STORY, THE ART ( OHH MAAA GAAWWDD), THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER were ALL just OUTSTANDING!! \r\nI REALLY LOVED this anime. However, with 'Romance' labelled as one of the genres of this anime consisted, personally i didn't really think it was because with my experience after watching this anime, i thought there were too little moments of 'Romance' andthere were alot (LIKE ALOT) of Actions going around thorought most of the anime; it wasn't too balanced, it was all weighing on actions. What i think the producers could've done a better job is to show some more moments of 'Romance' between the two main characters. Had they had done this, this anime will forever be in my top 5 anime list of all time. Regardless, as in overall, i LOVED this anime as i already mentioned before. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, to really get the story in your head, it is recommended that you watch fate/zero first then fate/stay night. although fate/stay night came out first, where the story actually started was in fate/zero. So its only natural that you may get some questions unanswered after watching fate/stay night first then fate/zero. \\n\\n\r\nWell then, i hope that my review is convincing enough to allow people to watch this AMAZING anime. <3",

            "content": "First and foremost, I haven't played the original visual novel. I have, however, seen Fate/Zero before this (going by the simple logic of it being a prequel), which certainly influenced my experience. Not sure if it was the right thing to do but it happened.\r\nAnd this show is certainly different from its prequel, mainly in terms of the story perspective. It does have a protagonist, Shiro, and the story centers on him and his relationship with his servant. And he is a good lead, if a tad boring at first, as his motivation, although admirable, does make him come out as your typical bold herotype. He changes throughout the series, so he isn't boring to watch even despite his original attitude. Overall, he is a decent character I was able to root for and was clearly supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nThan there's Saber. To be honest, one of the few Servants that is actually interesting; to be fare, she has far more screen time than the others. Her personality seems to be that of a generic noble knight but is actually deeper than it seems and continues to change throughout the series. Her arc is what makes the show: it's well-paced, for example, her name isn't revealed until the middle of the series; her relationship with Shiro is very believable, clearly focused on and, in my opinion, wonderfully resolved. She is hands down the best and most important character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOthers are generally good. Most tend to get at least some character development, practically no one is presented as just a generic villain or hero. Some, though, were clearly not important for the writers and are present only to move the plot forward. Illya has little to no personality and is pretty annoying, the main villain is just The Villain, no redeeming qualities. Most have their purpose and their moments but are ultimately in the background like, say, Rin and Archer, who are by no means main but are still well-developed and relatable. There is only one character I genuinely hate; not surprisingly, she is the comic relief. She's not up there with Jar Jar, partially because she is not that prominent, but she is not funny, not entertaining and entirely pointless to the plot. She is the only one like that, thankfully.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a nice mix of character-oriented and plot-oriented styles, although less so than the prequel, focusing more on the main leads, yet still presenting the audience with a solid story. Despite having every possibility to be a combination of several stories (there are 6 servants to battle, each one gets his arc, everybody's happy), it manages to avoid it, at least the most obvious route. Events fall logically into places, motivations are believable and revelations are well-done. Unfortunately, most plot twists can be easily predicted by someone who has seen the prequel. Say, Saber's name is revealed in the very second episode of Fate/Zero, so it wasn't a surprise to me, as well as the actual villain's identity. It goes both ways, though: I was extremely pleased to see one of my favorite characters of the prequel return by the end of the show but he would probably seem to have come out of nowhere to those who haven't seen Fate/Zero. Also, it was nice to see that the creators were able to make Saber's personality evolution throughout both series seem natural. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, particularly the battle scenes. The animation is consistently good, only being reduced to sketchy style (which I detest) when (what a coincidence!) the comic relief shows up. The fights are well-thought out, never boring and always beautiful. The music is your average good score, nothing special, though I did like the second opening song. Voice acting is great, all the voices match the characters being portrayed. Overall, the anime feels well-produced, effort is obvious and appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, the show has its problems, namely some of the characters are underdeveloped (Lancer, for example, or, again, Illya) and are only there to serve the plot, and the lead is pretty boring, in the beginning at least. Despite that, some are extremely good, the story felt intriguing enough for me and the artwork is awesome, and that's after Fate/Zero, which spoils some of the twists. More than enough to call it a very good one, as far as I am concerned.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night is an above average anime and a tolerable adaptation of the Fate route of the visual novel. Having read both the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works routes of said VN, and having read a summary of the Heaven's Feel route, I am pleased they chose the Fate route for the anime. \r\nSaber is above and beyond my favorite character in the VN and there is a great deal of sadness to her character. I feel the anime does a decent enough job of translating that into a 24 episode series. In truth, each route of the VN could take two or three seasonsto fully explore (to do them justice). Nonetheless, Fate/stay night does entertain and permits those of us who read the VN first to see our favorite characters fully moving and fighting those epic battles we read about with tolerable images and sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the visual novel is convoluted itself--as is common in a Nasu work. The attempt to make it understandable in the anime is an adequate attempt and is reasonably understandable to those who haven't read the visual novel (having given it to a few of my friends). It is still entertaining and the quality of the artwork seems to peak at the most important parts of the series, especially the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching the series and I definitely recommend reading the visual novel. It's easily one of the most enjoyable stories I have ever read and it contains my favorite character in literature (as a female ;)).",

            "content": "Having only gotten into anime recently and having watched only a handful of shows, I may not be a major voice in this community in terms of recommending/reviewing shows, but hopefully this review will be helpful for someone interested in giving this anime a chance.\r\nFate/stay night [F/sn] is an anime based on TYPE-MOON's visual novel of the same name, and first aired in 2006. 7 years after it ended, I picked it up after seeing an AMV for it's sister series, Fate/Zero [F/Z]. I read that F/Z was a prequel to F/sn that was released more recently, but I decided to watch in real-world chronologicalorder rather than in accordance with the fictional universe's timeline (I have yet to watch F/Z as of writing this review). I also decided to watch the English dub of this anime purely based on my personal preferences. This actually had a bit of an affect on my opinion of the anime, which I will detail momentarily\\n\\n\r\nMy first impression was one of confusion and intrigue. For a viewer that was unfamiliar with the visual novel or had not watched F/Z, the opening episodes of F/sn will successfully convey the pure \"What the hell is going on?\" mindset of the main character by guiding you along with him in his process of learning about the plot. You learn as he learns, you feel connected to him in his confusion and insecurity, and you are able to connect with him in this way. For me, connecting to the main character is essential for me to consider a show significantly noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed about the show was, as I watched it 7 years after its release, that it does look a bit dated. However, this may be due to my stream, so I'll partially suspend my disbelief until later in the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices were also awkward at times, a point which I previously mentioned I would discuss later.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without further ado, here is my review of Fate/stay night:\\n\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nStory \u2014\u00a08/10\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nThe initial introduction to the plot of F/sn is done, in my opinion, very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Shiro Emiya, is an untaught magic user, or \"magus\" in the show's vocabulary, who is suddenly thrust into the middle of a magical war for the fabled Holy Grail. Seven magi from various magical families each summon one of seven classes of Servents, spirits of historic figures, and act as their Master while fighting to the death over this powerful magical item. The remaining Magus/Servant pair that obtains the Holy Grail are granted one wish, which can be used in any way the wisher chooses.\\n\\n\r\nShiro, being ignorant of magical lore, knows absolutely nothing about this; but, when he is suddenly attacked and his latent magical energy calls forth a Servant of his own, he is unwillingly dragged into the life-or-death struggle for the legendary Grail. With the help of his popular classmate and fellow Master, Rin Tohsaka, Shiro and his Servant, a beautiful blond girl of the Saber class, learn what it means to live and survive in the midst of a titanic clash for power. \\n\\n\r\nFor those familiar with the visual novel, the plot follows the \"Fate\" path from the game, and focuses on Shiro's relationship with Saber, who is the series' main heroine.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, coming from a place where I had never heard of this series, I was totally on board with Shiro's anger and confusion with his situation. As I watched, I could feel the frustration as Shiro tried to piece together what was going on, which sold me on the series right off the bat. Getting deeper and deeper into the show and understanding more and more of what the Holy Grail Wars are about, you can feel Shiro's confidence grow and the story expands to cover more angles accordingly, which is another positive for a show as short as this.\\n\\n\r\nThis show covers a lot of material and emotional checkpoints in only twenty-four episodes, which for some may be overwhelming. I personally find nothing wrong with this, but for those of you who aren't big fans of info-dumps or flashpoint plots, be wary of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot points all revolve around Rin and Shiro helping each other to discover and defeat the five other magi participating in the Holy Grail War. In terms of originality, I find this series to fall into a grey area. The enemies are more developed to be considered \"monsters of the week,\" but they are still dealt with relatively easily and I am hesitant to call them \"villains,\" as that term connotes a saga of opposition not truly present in the series. There are definite stages of engagement (discovery/research/contact/conference/assault) that can be seen in each enemy's arc, and they seem to be sort of \"wash, rinse, repeat\" in terms of what you can expect from the characters. Saving their individual character traits' roles in these stages for the \"Characters\" section of the review, you begin to predict more or less what will happen next and I found myself saying more than once, \"Well, here we are doing this again,\" which was something I was unhappy with.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point I want to make before I move on is relevant to my last point, the predictability of events; at no point during the series did I feel genuine concern for any of the characters' safety. Save the immediate events of the first episodes, before the plot was fully fleshed out, I never once thought that Shiro, Saber, Rin, or any of the minor characters were in danger of actually dying. I don't feel like I'm spoiling anything by saying that one of the first things that happens is Shiro discovers his magical energy allows him to heal injuries at a exponentially increased rate, meaning he can recover from the brink of death in a matter of hours. Once that fact was revealed, I lost all sense of concern for his safety. Not to say the main characters go untouched, they sustain some extremely heavy damage during their fights, but (to continue from my last point) I found myself saying things like, \"What does it matter that they're hurt? By the end of this episode they'll be fine.\" Not something I was happy with.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER FREE: The end of the series really seals the deal for me. The final set of enemies are slimy and hateable, the fights are spectacularly well done, the emotions run rampant, and I'd be a liar if I said I didn't cry a little. Fantastic end.\\n\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nArt \u2014\u00a07/10\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nFor a show drawn in 2006, the art is respectable. If you are a fan of the original FullMetal Alchemist from the same time period, you will really enjoy the way this show looks. Having just watched a more recent show, I found the art style to be a little lacking, but, again, I intend to suspend my disbelief due to the possibility that my stream was subpar.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, though, lots of the regular animation just felt unnatural and awkward. I understand that the show is based on a visual novel, which has no flowing animation, but in an anime there needs to be more emphasis on making regular character interactions more engaging for the viewer. In a visual novel, there is text that must be read, so having static images is no problem, but in an anime the visuals are just as important as the dialogue, and looking back on the show there were a few instances where I could have opened a new window in my browser and surfed the web and been able to follow the plot without needing to watch the characters awkwardly sit across from each other and chat about plot. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this show's intensity weighs heavily on the combat sequences, and it does not disappoint in that area. There are a couple instances of recycled shots, but by and large the fights are drawn very well and flow smoothly. And, as I said earlier, they do a fantastic job in the finale to really drive this point home.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the way the magic was animated, especially Shiro's magic. The analogy to a circuit board firing along various numbers of lines was an easily accessible way to understand just how powerful Shiro was and what it's like trying to use magic. Rin's magic was cool as well, though a combination of the art and voices made it kind of awkward in the flow of the rest of the show. More on the voices in the \"Sound\" section.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did like the art. One of the first anime I watched was FullMetal Alchemist (2003), so I have a bit of nostalgia for that type of art. I would, however, have enjoyed the series more if the non-combat animation was less awkward.\\n\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nSound \u2014\u00a07/10\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nThe music was fantastic. Despite a limited number of tracks, I really enjoyed the background music throughout the series. Both instrumental and choral numbers add mood and feeling to some of the otherwise stagnant scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes left a little to be desired, but I can't say I disliked them totally. I would usually just browse the web and wait for them to be over, but I wouldn't go so far as to mute them or skip them.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER FREE: The final ending song had me in tears, so there's that to consider.\\n\\n\r\nThe voicing, however, was hit or miss for me. The voices of Kate Higgins (Saber) and Liam O'Brian (Archer), that established themselves Bandai's dub of Code Geass (where Higgins played C.C. and O'Brian played Lloyd Asplund), were solid, and for me made up ground for where voices of Sam Reigel (Shiro Emiya) and Mela Lee (Rin Tohsaka) struggled. It may have been the translation, or maybe the timing of the lip flaps, but lines from Shiro and Rin failed in their delivery.\\n\\n\r\nI did felt bad for Mela Lee, as her character used many incantations in Latin and German. Having studied both of these languages, I was more attuned to mispronunciations and struggles with delivering the lines in Latin or German, and thus they stood out more. Putting aside the fact that Lee was asked to to a lot in speaking foreign languages, I did feel that the German was simply out of place. Coupled with some of the more lackluster magical animation, the German lines were the ones most guilty of making me say \"Oh, God, this is so\u2026blegh.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn sum, the music is great, but if you are a fan of English dubs you can expect a 5/10 performance. I haven't seen the Japanese, but I would be interested to see how this show sounds in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nCharacters \u2014 8/10\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nAs a visual novel, the characters in this show are fantastically written and portrayed. While they have their shortcomings, as does every character, they quickly became personal. I will go into as much detail as I can about the three main characters without spoiling much of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nShiro Emiya: Shiro is a pretty relatable guy, especially after all the time you spend with him learning the plot. He has an honorable cause, a logical view on things, and I found myself connected with him almost immediately. One thing that I disliked about him is his stubbornness, as it contributes to the repetitive predictability of the different arcs. I found myself shouting at him on my screen on more than one occasion, pleading with him to just concede and make a different decision because I was almost physically pained by how unreasonable he was being. If I had to rate him, I would give him a 7/10, due to how many times his negative qualities showed themselves amongst all the times I was rooting for him to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nSaber: The show's main heroine, I actually purchased a collectable figure of her when I finished the show. I really like Saber; she is blunt, rational, and stubborn in her own right, but uses her stoic exterior to hide a tumultuous emotional conflict. As you learn about her, you start to connect with her deeply rooted sense of duty and develop an attachment to her despite her shortcomings. When she and Shiro encounter an obstacle, their mutual stubbornness comes to a head and creates a painful cycle of \"Let me do this because I don't want you doing it\" that is overused and unnecessary throughout the series. I had less of an issue with Saber's stubbornness, however, because she is actually extremely capable from the early stages of the show, and actually has the ability to back up her desire to take the situation by the throat. I would give Saber an 8/10 for her refreshing honesty and reasonable nature.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka: The third major character in the series, who you meet early on in the show. She is a pretty typical tsundere female character, who finds Shiro useless and incompetent. She probably grows the most out of all three main characters; as Shiro learns the plot and develops capabilities, Rin becomes much less critical and far more enjoyable to see on screen. She begins as overconfident, rude, and critical, but softens greatly as the story progresses. I would give Rin a 9/10, the only thing keeping her from a perfect 10 being how annoying I found her at the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could also mention one of the minor characters, I really liked Sakura Matou. She plays a bit role in the series, only really featuring in the early stages and a few episodes in one of the middle arcs, but  in the first few episodes she is the cutest, most adorable girl I've ever seen. She's extremely archetypal (sister of main character's best friend, loves doing household chores, calls the main character \"senpai\"), but I couldn't stop myself from smiling when she was on screen. Oh my God, she's the most adorable thing ever.\\n\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2014\u00a09/10\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series very much. I thought the idea was strong and the execution was sufficient. I felt like I connected to the characters and I walked away wanting to play the visual novel in order to explore the universe further. I'd say that thought means the series did it's job.\\n\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nOverall \u2014\u00a08/10\\n\r\n* * *\\n\r\nIn the end, I would recommend this show to anyone who asked for a good action/supernatural/character-driven anime. I would warn them about awkward animation and dubbing, and I would let them know that the characters were difficult to deal with some times, but overall I would give Fate/stay night an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully you found this review helpful! Happy viewing!",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night's main idea was pretty attractive. Seven magicians summon seven heroes from the past - mainly- as servants, and do battle with each other to obtain the Holy Grail which will fulfill a wish. Action tinted with a little sides of romance and drama and an extra serving of fantasy.\r\nThe plot carries this out very nicely at first, keeping the anime entertaining and, in my case, making me want more. However, F/SN takes a terrible turn in the later episodes, when it decides to put character development over a nicely fleshed-out plot. This would've been a good idea, had the characters been more impressiveor remarkable.\\n\r\nThe protagonist left a real bad taste in my mouth. Overly chivalrous, stubborn, and too lucky for his own good, Shirou is a character that cannot grasp what the other characters tell him and who has a cheesy past that makes his present decisions predictable. Saber is much better, though not excellent in any way. It's some of the supporting characters who manage to save F/SN in this category; though I felt some were almost forced into the anime.\\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters, their histories and personalities are barely delved upon ( aside from Shirou and Saber), which would've added a nice flavor to the series in the cases of the seven servants. The lack in personality frequently makes the viewer wonder why a character made a certain choice. [I heavily recommend Wikipedia to fill the character holes F/SN left.]\\n\r\nI will congratulate the anime in the aspects of Art and Music though. Especially the latter. The settings are nicely done but it's the characters who're exceptionally well animated and modeled. The opening song is nothing short of impressive and manages to capture one's attention. The rest of the music is appropriate for the scenes its played on and gives the anime a little extra something.\\n\r\nIdealization is key in the enjoyment of this series. If the viewer likes the initial idea enough to be captivated in the first couple of excellent episodes, finishing the anime will come easily, even with the negative turns the storyline takes towards the ending. If the viewer does not like the seven magicians-seven servants/heroes Fate/Stay Night won't be thoroughly enjoyed. At the very least, it does deserve an opportunity or two.",

As many of you know this series comes from an adaptation of the visual novel (VN) of Fate/Stay Night. Watching this series you will notice a decent amount of action, dramatic scenes, good comedic aspects and lot's of character development. When it come's to strong points I very much enjoyed the feeling of wondering what the character's will do and often was immersed into wanting more. A major aspect of the series is how after thefirst couple episodes you'll most likely hooked into watching the rest (believe me it is interesting!).\\n\\n\r\nA weakness that many have pointed out was the fact that the anime adaptation was the fact that it is not a true representation of the VN. Going through the visual novel I have learned of answers that I had searched for that we're not present in the anime. For example in the anime adaptation there was no mention of why Sabre could not go into spirit form. The VN goes much more into detail, which is a slight problem but won't hinder the conclusion in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI am somewhat new to watching lots of anime series so take this review with a grain of salt.\\n\r\nFinal Word: I have watched the anime first over the VN and honestly I was hooked! It's basically making me a fan of the whole \"Fate\" series which means that this was a good Anime! I highly recommend watching Fate/Stay Night and maybe you'll also enjoy the series like I am! Going back to the VN to learn everything is fine with me since I really did enjoy it. Good luck, happy watching! :)",

            "content": "Adaptations of visual novels to anime are something of a mixed bag. Sometimes, like with Clannad and Comic Party, the adaptation is a hit. Other times, it doesn't work quite so much. Fate/Stay Night falls into the former case, though there are times where the work stumbles in its execution, primarily on the animation front, though there are some narrative issues.\r\nThe animation for the series is done by Studio DEEN, and this is made during their dark period, after their high points back in the 80s with works like Angel's Egg, and before their modern redemption with Konosuba and Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. This leadsto some weird animation moments - such as clear moments where dialog scenes are taken off camera, to avoid having to animating mouth movements. Some of the action scenes also feel under-animated - including some of the shows more significant fights - like Archer's battle with Berserker. It feels like a deliberate attempt to save money on the animation budget so they can go all out in the series finale, which has an incredibly dramatic animation bump - so dramatic that it almost feels like it was animated by a completely different studio.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the show's music is generally good, with a score composed by Kenji Kawai, who is known for his work on Ghost in the Shell - though the scope of the music feels, once again, limited by budget - as if he envisioned the music to be played by live musicians, only to be informed that all they could afford was a really nice synthesizer, loaded with some really good MIDI voices.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is generally good. The women, particularly Saber, Rin, Taiga, and Ilya are all very interestingly and entertainingly written characters, with some great character moments. In particular, Miki Itou as Taiga livens up every scene she's in with the work, and you can almost feel her energy liven up the rest of the cast in the scenes she shares with them. That said, some of the writing around the character of Shirou stumbles. He's overly patronizing of Saber. In particular, early in the series he's unwilling to acknowledge or recognize her combat skills to a real degree - choosing to fight instead of her even when it's been demonstrated to him that she is far better with a sword than pretty much everyone. Later in the series he shows a better degree of trust, but it is still frustrating early on in the show. Later on in the series the show develops a twist that comes more or less out of nowhere, but it introduces one of the show's better antagonists, so I'll cut them some slack for that.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as whether you should watch the show - Ufotable has spent more time in this universe than Deen has, with prequel Fate/Zero, and the Unlimited Blade Works anime (which adapts another route through the same game). Fate/Zero sets up the rules of the Grail War, much as this does, but Fate/Zero front-loads the exposition with a massive infodump in the first, double-length episode, while this show paces the exposition better - and explains some other concepts that Fate/Zero doesn't get into (like how the magic system works).",

Though there were flaws, they could be easily overlooked and this show could be really relished.\r\nSTORY- 8.5\r\nThe story achieved what it seemed to be striving for with a solid beginning, middle, and ending. Events were put into action in a suitable time frame and provided for a nice ride throughout.\r\nExecution- 8\r\nThe show's story was executed without too many plotholes, much of which were with the lesser characters, and the story was done in a timely manner not spending too much or too little time on one subject. Most of the rough spots dealtmainly with the character's backstories as later written below. These rough spots muddied up parts of the plot in more minor areas but still affect part of the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality- 9\\n\r\nBattle Royale type stuff was probably already created at the time Fate/Stay Night was created in 2006, but having a battle over the Holy Grail is unique. Combined with the idea of servants, the originality scores a 9 for a truly original show.\\n\\n\r\nQUALITY -  7.66\\n\r\nThis show's quality is exceptional for something created 10 years ago and exceeds some present day work.\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nProbably the best feature of Fate/Stay Night, the animation was outstanding for a show created 10 years ago. I couldn't tell it was created in 2006 if I hadn't looked at this show into more detail. The lighting, backgrounds, and overall detail were animated superbly and the art could exceed many shows made in this early decade and maybe even some in the present time.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe soundwork was also at a high level. Voice acting was conducted well enough to capture each character's likeness and personality and the music also suited well with the anime's mood. Although the OST didn't have many pieces, the pieces that were showcased fit the mood of nearly every scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 6\\n\r\nOh, the characters. While what I considered the mains (Shirou, Saber, and Rin) were developed thoroughly, many secondary and tertiary characters lacked backstory and explanation. For example, Sakura, was a key character in the later stages of the anime, but although it was explained why, it was not described with enough detail and lacked development in her character as a whole. The same thing happens with most other secondary and tertiary characters. On a personal level though, I would've liked to seen more of Archer as he is listed as a \"Main\" but it seems like he never got enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime since I saw the first episode. It was an intereting premise from the start and kept drawing my attention. This prompts me to move on to the Unlimited Blade Works and Fate/Zero aswell as Heaven's Fall this upcoming year.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night. Considered (and well should be) a staple in many action-romance genre fans like me, I had been recommended the series time and time again by my friends, so I got pretty hyped up. I think its quite a bit of a review so the TL;DR is basically the Enjoyment/Conclusion paragraph down below. \r\nDISCLAIMER: I have not played the visual novel so this review is purely based on the anime alone.  \r\nStory : 8 - The story is set in modern day Japan (or what could be considered modern in 2003) and our MC, Emiya Shirou, is a typical high school kid. Thisis a shounen after all. Similar to Mirai Nikki, he lives an average life until he gets swept up in events far beyond he would ever imagine. Under attack from an unknown entity that appeared before him, Shirou summons one of his own to defend him, thus catapulting him into huge events that could decide the fate of the entire world. I actually really found this series and Mirai Nikki extremely similar in the regard that there are people playing in a death game and the prize is power on an omnipotent level. If you were the fan of the Hunger Games, this is basically that with higher stakes and more magic. I really enjoyed the story, and the second half had a lot of good plot twists but it got really slow at times for an action anime. I will explain why later. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art is very good for a 2006 anime, and it can probably hold its own to some more recent anime as well. Obviously DEEN also did their best to make the art true to the visual novel.  It also wasn't very flashy. It gets an 8 here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 - I loved the sound. The entire soundtrack fit in perfectly with the atmosphere of the series. The action sequences were also given a well deserved sort of ominous feel thanks to the soundtrack. But I really adored the OPs. Disillusion has become one of my favourite OPs of all time, seeing as to how it fit very well with the first half of the anime. Kirameku Namida wa Hoshi ni, the second OP, also fits in great with the much quicker pace of the show. I think the ED sounded beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 - The best part of the show, imho. I found that all the characters in the show were actually very likeable (except of course for Shinji). Without going on about too much, most of the characters had a certain depth to them. This segment gets a 9 because I really feel like some of the characters (and their relationships with each other) could have been more developed and the romance at the end felt a bit rushed. I am a true stickler for the budding romance elements of the action-romance genre so to see it rushed and the romance development skipped a bit actually hurt me, especially since this pairing is one of my favourites in all anime I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Conclusionl: 7 - I'll start with the negative. Let's face it, this anime is slow. The constant character flashbacks seriously irritated me at some points. Some of the battles were a bit draggy because of this as well. But I find that the characters, art and soundtrack seriously make up for otherwise a draggy series. Even though the romance felt a little underdeveloped for me, I still felt that it was still quite adequate. \\n\\n\r\nReally, Fate/Stay Night is a classic in my eyes. If you are an action-romance fan, I would agree that this is a staple for you. If you like a fantastic cast of characters, a good soundtrack, or maybe just a best girl argument (its Saber) than this anime is also for you. Just do not expect the romance to come too soon, it only really develops near the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me tell you straight out, I cried.\r\nThey may tell you that Fate/stay night (FSN), quality-wise, is pretty bad, and Unlimited Blade Works (UBW) is a much better version of the Holy Grail war. Must be the Organization again. Why do I say this? I am no scientist, but I can say that although UBW in terms of the quality of the plot, is indeed better -- but in terms of my personal enjoyment, and the impact it had on me, Fate/stay night, the original, is awesome nevertheless.\r\nThe characters, for one thing, are more attractive than their counterparts in UBW. Rin's face is a littletoo sharp in UBW, and more filled out in FSN. Too bad that in UBW Rin is the lead female character and Saber is in FSN, but ah well, that's precisely why I loved this so much and started rewatching it a month after the first time.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is very delicately drawn. Reminsicent of the pearly shadows and lighting in Bleach, but even more emotively so. You gotta love how the characters are drawn. Just the right amount of coloring and lines to make them the right way, that perfect amount of lighting and illustration to make it all the more poignantly realistic.\\n\\n\r\nLike Fate/Zero and UBW, this anime is no children's story. When characters are facing immense odds in battle, they are injured, and they shed and spout blood. I mean, if characters are wielding weapons meant to kill, then blood should be spilt. I like that. If the creators of an anime are the purveyors of a certain segment of a group of characters' lives, then it should be realistic, because although that world may have different rules than ours, it's still a world of humans, and the premise is for the most part the same. So when characters fight characters and the worst that happens is bruises and unconsciousness (I'm talking to you, Fairy Tail), it irks me, because it doesn't make sense how swords can not spill blood. The fight scenes are awesome, of course, as they were for Fate/Zero and UBW.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings of FSN are perfect in that they portray the emotional and motivational context of the characters and plot. The main ending, the soothing lullaby with Saber in the grassy field, is perfect. The openings with the Servants and Masters. The final ending, which brought tears to my eyes upon seeing it. The soundtrack, when listening to it in my YouTube playlist (A Scintillating Rain, the one with 900+ videos), is one of the most enjoyable to listen to. It's not particularly awesome or anything, but for each song in the OST I can almost always link it to a certain event in the anime. Very playful and emotive OST.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER. Now this is the real good stuff. Shirou Emiya -- if you want to see an epitome of chivalry, then watch FSN. He helps others always, and values the lives of others over his own. He is weak, but perseveres in the face of strong adversaries. Saber -- I gotta say, of all the female anime characters I've seen, she is one of the hottest. Being straight out honest here. The way her eyes suck you in like frozen pools... I say frozen for a reason, she is a true Servant in that she pursues her goal, her raison d'etre for being alive again in this world. Archer, and his disdain for Shirou's ideals... Why is he so aloof? Lancer, Caster, Assassin, Rider, Berserker. Seven Servants, seven Masters. There is a reason why I loved this so much. A reason so utterly beautiful that I can't bring myself to say it, because you gotta see this for yourself.... Just watch it, okay?\\n\\n\r\n\"If you cannot defeat your enemy with the weapon you do have, then imagine one with which you could.\"\\n\\n\r\none word to describe this anime: heart-wrenching",

            "content": "This anime was one of the few that really kick-started my love for anime in general. Though many see it as a half-arsed adaptation of Type-Moon's Visual Novel 'Fate/Stay Night' following the shows amazing prequel Fate/Zero and 2014-2015 brilliant adaptation Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade/Budget Works which makes me rather upset. \r\nStory: The story is set around the basis is that there is this event called the Holy Grail War where servants or heroes of the past, present and future come together to fight for their masters (usually who are Mages) that summoned them to the current timeline to fight for possession of an object knownas the Holy Grail which is said to grant any wish proposed to it. The servants and masters fight in the style of a battle royale. The grail has appeared for the fifth time, and now the Grail War takes place in Fuyuki City, Japan with our main hero and Heroine being Shirou Emiya and Saber. Whilst the overall premise of the story is good and fresh...it\u2019s not really a battle royal since every few episodes a new servant/master pair appear and challenge our main heroes Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber (Atoria/Arthur Pendragon) through various means that are either confusing or predictable. They are the main characters so of course they should always be the victor, plot armour 101 ladies and gentleman! Magic was also not clearly explained in this story as it spent way too much time explaining what exactly the Holy Grail War is and how it works (exposition in this story gets up to extreme levels of OMG WHOULD YOU GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!). But! This show is actually really well paced and is not afraid to show some dark imagery or tear-jerking moments as the show carries on through its 24 episode run time. The fight scenes were also well connected not random like some other anime and also connected aspects of humour or unexpected sadness. \\n\r\nAnimation: The animation was done by studio deen in 2006, so no it does not live up to the animation of today but for its time the animation was great especially in the fight scenes. However, the one thing that we all can agree on that was complete dog shit animation was that CGI dragon (never do that again).\\n\r\nSound: whilst the music for the show is basically remixes of the visual novels music I found myself quite found of it especially of the main characters titular theme \u2018Emiya\u2019 which has since been redone so many times. But the shows two openings and endings were rather unmemorable and quite skippable after a few times of watching them.\\n\r\nCharacter: When first watching this anime I fell in love with most of these characters instantly, I loved their mannerisms, their appearances, their actions and how they were involved in the story and to some extent I still do. Rin is probably still one of my favorite characters in any anime which extended to the 2014-2015 anime and Archer and Saber are still awesome but my favorite character is Gilgamesh (who is also my fav male anime character of all time). Yeah he is incredibly overpowered and was introduced very late in the story and he acts like such an asshole but I...Love...IT! His cocky attitude makes him the perfect counter to the normal calm Saber which is especially shown in the final battle but honestly to understand why he is so amazing. But like so many others I really disliked Shirou...I found his 'I want to save everyone' attitude stupid and that one stupid FAIL translated dialogue \"People die when they are killed\" made me wish someone would just stab him and say \"Yes Shirou. Yes they do\". However I did like his progression from somewhat of a lackluster mage to semi-competent along with his relationship with Saber and Rin (so their is something positive about that guy). \\n\r\nEnjoyment: You would enjoy this the most if you have not watched Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works 2014-2015 since the animation is nothing compared to what Ufotable has done with it and you don\u2019t have any major spoilers already given to you (especially with Fate/Zero). It is also in my opinion a very well done starting anime for any people just getting into anime as it incorporates many different tropes that are typical in anime. \\n\r\nOverall: Do I think Fate/Stay Night is shit? No. Do I think Fate/Stay Night is amazing? No. I think that for the first adaption of the now infamous Fate Series that it was well done and enjoyable to sit through (despite Shirou\u2019s immense stupidity and that damn CGI dragon). It the best entrance into the series along with a good gateway anime. The animation is still good and the music is great. Whilst some parts are dumb others can make you cry out in despair at the reality that these characters are living in. along with a satisfying conclusion\u2026Fate/Stay Night is one anime that should be viewed and not judged for its successful follow ups. If your looking for an anime to get attached to then this anime was fated to be viewed by you.\\n\r\nP.S. Forgive me that pun was awful",

This focuses a lot on Sabre, who is an epic hero. It focuses on her past and the relationship between her and the main protagonist. One thing I must say about this series is that the soundtrack is horrible. I swear I found it annoying. Of course many would say not to watch this and watched the new alternative story better since the art is excellent and this is crap compared to it. While I won't disagree, ifyou decide to go into the Fate franchise, I recommend watching this before the UNLIMITED BLADEWORKS, and not the other way around. This will give you a nice taste of what it's all about then when you watch UNLIMITED BLADEWORKS, you will get the entire entree. If you feel like you don't like it from the start, then just drop it and watch the alternative.\\n\\n\r\nI personally like the use of Epic Heroes in this anime because it utilizes hero from stories of the past and incorporates their legends. If you're into stuff like King Arthur, Hercules and others, watch this.",

This anime was released before Fate Zero but the story is set after it,  I have to stress that if I had not watched Fate Zero before, I probably wouldn't have finished Stay Night. \r\nThis is basically a Shounen harem version of Zero, where instead of focusing on many characters, the focus here is all on one. The main character gets surrounded by females to a point where it just gets ridiculous and it's hard totake seriously. His relationship with his \"servant\" also is really hard to take seriously, especially if you consider that his servant was originally male. Nevermind why the hell it's a female here, I have no idea why after two shows featuring him/her. \\n\\n\r\nFor a story about a War between epic heroes, they are really underused which is a crying shame. They have a finishing move called a Noble Phantasm but we barely get to see them and half of them don't even use theirs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I kept watching to see what would happen next in the second half of the series which had great pacing, I was extremely let down by the last few episodes and the ending, even getting pissed off. The only reason I kept at it is because of having seen Fate Zero first, so I would recommend staying away from this if you haven't seen or didn't like Fate Zero. That being said, I am checking out the other Fate adaptations soon, just because Zero was so enjoyable.",

Well I wanted them to stay together in the modern world,but sadly no she ended up leaving and honestly.. When that happen I basically just died...Well not literally, but hey I really wanted them to stay together I felt like the 24 episodes I spent watching were all for nothing.Maybe it's just me who wants an ending where it goes all happy n stuff I don't know.

            "content": "First review on MAL!\r\nWell, i had give up Fate/Stay Night a long time ago at episode 12... I re-watched it with TV-Reprodution to remind the plot and the characters. Fate was my very first Type-Moon anime, and I think it really conveys the to \"Type-mooned\" feelings : lot of talking about the characters, about mysteries and, First Time I watched it, I was really, really bored about that. But I think with Fate, you really have to enter in the universe to appreciate it, no words are useless, and you will be get by the anime at one time! Personnaly, I can't deny it: iget a bit bored by the 12 first episodes, but the suit is sure sort of epic and awesome... When I think about this show now, I realize that he was godd from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's concentrate on story.\\n\r\nThe plot is quite ejoyable: 7 master summon each 7 servants who will fight with them into the Grall War. The winning team will own the Holy Grall whitch can fullfil all your wishes Here, the story concentrates on Emiya Shir\u00f4, a normal boy who had weak magic powers. One day, the servant Saber appears in his warehouse. Emiya will face the 6 others servants and masters, dealing with his and Saber's past, and her motivations to get the Holy Grall.\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say about the story, I give the maximum score, because, the story is very well exploited, and is sort of complex, despite the quite simple orignal plot.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, I have nothing to say either. I love the style of Type-Moon graphisms, and it fits so well with Fate/SN. I get a bit bored by some talking scenes when the characters do not move so much, but it's compensed by the beautiful animations of fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nNext step is music. The OST composed by Kenji Kawaii is just awesome. When I watch an anime, the OST is one of the first things I pay a particular attention too. The music convey us the feelings of great medieval battles, and always go well with the animation. To talk quickly about the OPs/EDs, well I am not a big fan of Tanaika Sachi, but \"Disillusion\" still a nice song.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, well, I think I already have talked a bit about it. Every characters has his own personnality, even Emiya hasn't a too cliched character for a hero. The servants are all more awesome than the others, if I have to pick a favorite, it would be Assasin or Lancer... The secondary characters like Tohsaka are also good. Nothing more to say about this category, every one will find his own favorite.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, this anime was very enjoyable. The ending didn't disapoint me at all (maybe beacause I know I would watch Fate/zero just after), I think I'll maybe re-watch in when I will have time. In the end, I think Fate/Stay Night, is one of the anime you must try to watch, I know everyone is not fan of the Type-Moon way of dealing with story.  Accorded to my feelings, I think Fate is not the best Type-Moon anime to begin with. To familiarise with the atmosphere of these animes, I'll advise you too watch Kara No Kyoukai or Tsukihime first. If you are already a T-M fan and if you didn't watch F/SN (whitch would be surprising), just go and watch it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I must admit that when I first started watching this series, its atmosphere came off a little bit on the boring side for me. And in general, there are a few scenes throughout the episodes that gave off the same type of vibe (for example, I thought a handful of the fights were fairly predictable with no real major twists). The characters also seem typical, but are still very good; they're well developed and come off as pretty cool people. Especially Rin Tohsaka.\r\nThe only other problem I had with Fate/Stay Night is the lack of explanation it provided. There are a few relationships between charactersthat are not clearly explained, some of their pasts are never even mentioned or they are just given in very brief flashbacks if at all. I'm not saying an entire episode (or even more) needs to be devoted solely on a flashback of someone's life in order to understand them better, but a little more elaboration certainly would have helped. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the animation, especially the way that the character designs looked. Saber's in particular I thought looked really cool, as well as the way that Eleanor and Berserker stood out beside each other (creepy combo much!) -- Every bit of the art was just brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, and this is taking into account that the anime itself was on a low budget, I thought this was a very good show. There are little things here and there that bothered me about it but as a whole I really did enjoy it and definitely plan to watch its sequel. I score it at an 8/10",

But then, I found the whole thing a bit boring.... Maybe cause I already played the game and the story is going much and much further... Moreover, Shirou's animation is lousy to me. It made me think of aplaymobil. It was the only thing very disapointing.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the sounds are great and I love the remade original theme musics. It's a pleasure to listen to new versions of the songs you enjoyed listening while playing the game. The voices are quite accurate to me, and I'm not disapointed on that !\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I think this is a quite good adaptation, aiming the essentials of the VN, that must be very enjoying for anyone who hasn't played the game first ! :)",

There is quite a lot of repetitive dialog which does get annoying, but its hard to find anything without repetitive dialog. These problems however are very small compared to the impact that the show delivers. Overall it is well worth watching and no doubt re-watching. Unmissable!",

So I want to tell all of you people who are considering watching this... It is not an AMAZING anime... Is it good enough to finish? yes.... Did it sometimes make me wonder what was going to happen next? Yes... HOWEVER: Does it have annoying characters and easily forseen plot twists? YES\nOK... more in depth: \nSTORY- GREAT! Got me hooked in seconds... sounded interesting, pretty unique, and had a lot of ways it could have gone. However, this amazing amount of potential was wastedwith lack of developement of characters and a pretty boring and uninspired take on the storyline.\\n\\n\nART: ok... not horrible, nothing  was beyond amazing, not like some of the prequels and such that have come out for this anime, but still nothing absolutely terrible either. \\n\\n\nSOUND: um... ok again... since I did not notice it it must not have been fantastic or horrible....\\n\\n\nCHARACTERS: UGGGGGGGGGGGGH!!!! SUCH A WASTE! They could have done sooo much more with them... instead they have the main male lead as one of the most annoying characters of all time with some crazy justice obsession. The multiple strong girl characters would have been much more entertaining and likeable if they did not become part of a sort of harem for the pathetic male lead. And the side characters, who were decently entertaining, were not given enough screen time and their stories were not gone into enough.... granted, some stories are well known (i won't give spoilers but some of these people are legends) but still, for the viewer that has not read greek literature or medival literature for a while, it would have been nice if the writer would have done a memory refresher so that we could relate to them more and feel more pain when they died or made a sacrifice.      Many of the more main chracters ran into this problem as well... not enough past developement... (I am not refering to the main two characters...)\\n\\n\nSUMMARY: AT TOP",

I myself read the visual novel before watching the anime. As far as visual novels go, it had it's issues, but I felt it was well done overall, if a bit drawn out at times. But this is a review for the anime. To begin with, it felt as if it was trying to fit in as much as possible in as little time as it could, which is to be expected Isuppose, but as a result, a large portion of characterization was lost. In the visual novel, you get to hear and understand to an extend Shirou's thought process. You don't get that in the anime, so he seems really shallow and a pretty big weenie. And while he is a weenie in the Fate route of the visual novel, he is more of one in the anime. I don't really have much else to say about the anime other than that it wasn't a very good adaptation. If you are considering watching it, I would strongly recommend that you read the Fate/Stay Night visual novel instead. I think you would find it much more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Just so you know I first watched Fate/Zero and then Fate/Stay Night.After watching FZ,FSN seemed a little bit more childish.A lot of the masters were teenagers and just the whole atmosphere is not as tense as in FZ.Another difference is that we see a little bit more feminine side of Saber which I kinda liked.Shirou gets dragged into the war without realising it with Saber as his servant (summoned for the second time since the last war) Tohsaka Rin who is now grown up also is a master (continuing it for her father) Rin is the character that totally stole me this time.My girl crushfor Saber was split into Rin :D She got to show her good personality even sacrificing her servant Archer who also gained my liking after some time.Besides from Rin we also get to see her sister Sakura who is also grown up now (as a part of the Matou family) She has a role of helping Shirou in the kitchen.She has a whole different role in the \"heaven's feel\" route of the game which I haven't played so I cannot say much about that.\\n\r\nI like how there's some relationship going on between Shirou and Saber although I kind of like Shirou x Rin,which is more in the movie version \"Unlimited Blade Works\".Anyway...another important character is Illyasviel (Kiritsugu and Irisviel's daughter) who seems to also be in the war having Berserker as a servant.I'm not gonna give out any spoilers so if you want to know how it all ends go watch it for yourself! FSN is a favorite of mine!",

            "content": "I really like this series. It is a little older so the animation and sound isn't what we're now used to, but the story and characters are fun to watch. There's a bit of mystery surrounding the main character, and he has a great sense of right and wrong. The relationships he builds with Rin and Sakura (a couple of girls that are in fact supposed to be his competition but are his friends) are what set him apart from the rest of his competition, and it's these relationships that help him throughout the series. Even though he's a \"mage\" he's not all powerful andhe doesn't know a lot of magic. He himself is quite heroic, and he stays true to his character throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nI like that his summoned hero trains him to be a part of the battles so he can protect himself. He doesn't want to sit by and watch someone get hurt for him which is quite admirable. It's a completely different feel than it's prequel Fate/Zero. There is a lot of love in this story, and when you're battling for the holy grail, it's good to have a little hope. Pieces of the storys mysteries are unraveled throughout, and it's intelligently done. There's good character development, and they squeeze a lot of emotion into this story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch, but do watch this before the prequel (Fate/Zero), as it will eliminate a few holes in that story.",

I prefer that over the 10 point scale.\r\nAnyway, apparently the Fate series was first a bunch of visual novels that they decided to make into an anime series in 2006 called Fate/Stay Night. A few years later they released another series called Fate/Zero.\r\nFate/Zero in terms of the anime, is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night. A lot of people have said that it's better to watch Stay Night first before watching Zero. I completely disagree with that.\r\nFate/Zero is good starting pointfor any interested in the series. It goes in depth as to what the holy grail wars are all about, and sets up the events and story of Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I agree that Stay Night was not as good as Fate/Zero I still really enjoyed it. A lot of the things that were mentioned or briefly covered in Stay Night occured in Zero. You'll miss out on a lot of things if you decide to take the advice of the Visual Novels fans and choose the wrong one to watch first.",

            "content": "When I first watched this show, it was a somewhat confusing but extremely entertaining piece of work. Now that I have a lot more Ufotable under my belt, it still holds as a must watch for anyone interested in the Fate universe, especially for those who like Saber.\r\nI've heard quite a bit about this show before watching it and I must say, it lived up to my expectations. FSN is a dark thriller-action with elements of magic and a hint of romance. Overall, the show was a blast to watch and maintained a very high bar of quality throughout. Don't be surprised if you findyourself forgetting the time and continuously watching marathon style.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nFirst, I'll point out that the characters are well drawn. Unlike many other shows, the characters actually look relatively (not necessarily behave) mature rather than just cute. Granted, now with hindsight everything here is way childish compared to Fate/Zero. In addition, there are very many battles here in which effects are heavily used in a very effective fashion. Note that there is a considerable amount of blood. And yes there is indeed a character named Rin Tousaka who is just begging to be watched. That said, those who really like Tousaka should check out the newer Unlimited Blade Works retelling.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well done, obviously I'm going to point out Kana Ueda for doing an awesome job as Rin- such a prime combination of cuteness and bite.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in general is superb. The first OP in particular is extremely memorable and fitting, with a hint of mystery. Kenji Kawai also did an absolutely brilliant job on the BGM, giving the show a very unique and atmosphere-rich feel.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI'll start with the negatives since there aren't very many. Don't expect heroes to coincide with what you know the heroes to be. They are only loosely based on historic figures and the anime takes its liberty to modify what it sees necessary (King Arthur = female??). Also, there are many intricacies such as the real identity of Archer that you may not get at first.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual plot sequence, it is superbly done. The viewer is kept waiting to find out who is Shiro's next opponent and then, once the plot plays out, rewards the watcher lavishly. Watching the uphill battle between the odd pair of Shiro and Saber (the weakest, pseudo-magician and the strongest servant) and the other masters was very intense. Throw in another magician (Rin) and her Archer servant and you have one awesome action adventure.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, there is also the question of a romantic development between Shiro and Sakura/Rin/Saber.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nShiro is a dynamic character. From the beginning, he seeks the idyllic dream of being a champion of justice. His only passion is to help and protect others, at whatever cost to himself. Others find this do-goody personality very annoying since he seems completely incorruptible. However, by the end, he is fighting for a completely different reason. Shiro and Saber begin as a master/servant relationship but after a few battles, it is apparent their relationship develops into something further than just that. I found this development to be very well executed; there's quite a bit of foreshadow if you look for it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Rin! She seems to be an amazingly talented magician yet it is obviously clear that she has some feelings for Shiro (and a perfect example of what tsundere should be). Overall, the development of the characters is done extremely well. You'll realize that even the villains will have some good points.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis show is not too long, and is very action-packed and plot-driven. It might start out a little slow but the overall show is very fast paced and will keep you on your toes. I re-watched it right after finishing to pick up on more subtleties. Definitely a classic, and a reference point by which to judge other action shows.",
