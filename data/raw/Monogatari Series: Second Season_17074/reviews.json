            "content": "Stories. \r\nEveryone wants to hear or tell a story people will remember by. It doesn\u2019t matter if the story is fictional, realistic, sarcastic, humorous, imaginative, mysterious, psychological, speculative, or even twisted as it can be. Stories are created by ideas that are formed from the very thoughts we experience in our lives. In order for stories to be told well, they have to evoke feelings, reactions, and attract audience that appreciates its ideas. Monogatari Second Series - the anime that not only attracted me to its franchise - but also presented it in an extravagant way that takes the art of storytelling to a wholenew level. \\n\\n\r\nThat level of storytelling was already clearly evidenced from its predecessor that achieved international success. Yes, I\u2019m talking about Bakemonogatari that debuted back in 2009. Its success has later spawned other series in the forms of Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari: Kuro, and the soon-to-debut Kizumonogatari . Now, it\u2019s back once again as an ongoing story narrative. Monogatari Series: Second Season is an anime adapted from the novel of the same name written by Nisio Isin with artwork by Vofan. If you\u2019re a fan of the previous Monogatari series franchise, then this should be no shadow of a doubt be part of your watch-list as we are told stories at its most definite form.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to what some people might notice in the past, the Monogatari series presents itself in an unique form of storytelling. The term \u2018monogatari\u2019 itself defines as literature. For a series based on storytelling to succeed though usually requires a character base with insightful plot, creative setting, descriptive ideas based on connections, and a strong literal sense of execution. Monogatari series plays on most of these concepts but constructs it like an experiment. Whether you dare to take on the experiment might have different experiences. However, there\u2019s no doubt that this series and its franchise has tested their experiment and succeeded in their message. Indeed, the storytelling of Monogatari mixes itself with visual arts and dialogues. The strength of the series comes from its dialogues that creates humor, sense, and might evoke people\u2019s minds to think its true meaning. Most of the time, the meaning of the dialogues are metaphoric and conveys to many ideas. Its usage of word plays presents its unique art style to attract viewers toward its messages. Through these messages, viewers will find out just how exclusive this shows\u2019 storytelling separates itself from most forms of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nMonogatari Series: Second Season isn\u2019t just about storytelling though. As mentioned before, a strong character cast will attract viewers to almost any form of genre. Luckily, this show has plenty of that starring our Koyomi Araragi, a high school student whose life has changed forever after a certain incident. Obviously, I would assume that you have seen the original Bakemonogatari to understand this but Araragi makes his return in this sequel. He makes his presence well known as other characters in the series speculate him as many things - a lolicon, dangerous, pervert, just to name a few. However, we know that Araragi is a character of loyalty as seen through his relationship with Hitagi Senjougahara. More importantly though, he is also protective towards others including his friends, family, and even strangers. Some of his actions might be interpreted in the wrong way by other characters but the guy definitely has proven many times that he is the type that others can depend on. He seeks to achieve the endings that allows characters live in peace. However, this often puts a burden on himself as Araragi finds that sometimes, he can\u2019t achieve everything alone. This even puts his own lives at risk many times. But hey, he is that type of that guy that takes risks. From a narrative perspective, his actions are often awarded although he doesn\u2019t always takes everything for granted. Instead, he keeps his more of the \u2018it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2019 attitude. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting characters from the novels makes their appearances in the story arcs including Tsubasa Hanekawa, Mayoi Hachikuji, Suruga Kanbaru, Nadeko Sengoku, Shinobu Oshino, and Hitagi Senjougahara. All these characters plays their different roles that fulfills some sort of theme or morality to its title. Each of these titles present a different insight on our characters as we see a sort of journey to embark on. And of course, every journey begins with the first step. There\u2019s already trouble in the beginning as we get a hint of supernatural madness going on. To make matters worse, Tsubasa herself finds trouble with her life as sudden changes occurs. \\n\\n\r\nThe first story arc initially reintroduces its narrative aspect to get viewers to familiarize themselves the format of how Monogatari works. Its supernatural themes takes on a more gruesome turn later on but there\u2019s also hope and prosperity. As for the other arcs, each of them has a different theme and plot. Some of these arcs also explores the back stories of our supporting characters. Along with that, there\u2019s character interactions that are dynamic with development. Additionally, each arc contains a similar style of storytelling through word plays, visual presentations, and dialogues. As the series contains supernatural elements as well, expect legends to unfold and discoveries to be made. These include spirit apparitions, vampires, mythic cats, and even Gods. The power of its dialogues enhances the experience with the power of its words. It\u2019s an experience you won\u2019t forget especially with some plot twists like one with a snake a girl.\\n\\n\r\nJudging on another level of the series is its humor. The style of Monogatari invokes humor in a sense that is quite peculiar. By peculiar though, I mean it as as a brilliant way because the show likes to experiment. Its stylish dialogues often mixes in parodies of other genres and themes for experimentation. These accompanied with the expressions of our characters creates a lavish theater of animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs good as the series sounds, there\u2019s a few aspects I found to be lacking. Namely, there\u2019s perhaps a bit of too much fan service in the beginning that can be distracting. These don\u2019t seem to have any meaning or dynamics and sometimes may distract viewers from the words play and dialogues. Other times, Araragi\u2019s interactions with some of the other characters might even seem a bit creepy or hard to take for granted. This is especially true in one of the later arcs involving Shinobu that takes itself to a rather defiled way with their interactions. More importantly is the fact that the show sometimes likes to get a bit carried away with its conversations. Some of them might even drag on with small talk that can seem to be mundane. Other times, they flash way too fast to be read that can frustrate viewers in attempting to fully understanding its meaning. (if it has one at some occasions) Finally, there are some recap episodes between each story arc that drags the series together. They might help refresh a bit of its previous predecessors but can also be a waste of time for people who wants the series to accelerate itself. \\n\\n\r\nShaft handles the production of this series. You know what that means right? If extraordinary is a word that just popped into your mind, then you\u2019re on the right track. By that term, Shaft is known to pull out a variety of series over the past year that have impacted the world. Names such as EF: A Fairy Tale of the Two, Arakawa Under the Bridge, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica are just a few that comes to mind. The artwork of Monogatari is in a sense that can be both visually attractive and descriptive the same time. When not presented as comedy, they hold a deeper meaning or metaphor behind them. Other times, they are connected to the dialogues spoken by the characters to convey their thoughts and feelings. Speaking of characters, most of them are designed in a similar way as their predecessors. Araragi still has that noticeable hair-like antenna sticking out of his head while his girlfriend still retains her haircut. Other characters like Shinobu, Nadeko, and Tsubasa all possesses artistic traits similar to their supernatural counterparts. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, the series maintains an eerie like atmosphere. During more of the climatic scenes, the series shifts its gears to a more dramatic tone with explosive entrances and executions. Other times, the series likes to keep its more balanced atmosphere along with comedic vibrations. The soundtrack might not be the most powerful device of the show but its various OP & ED songs makes up this department with its various styles. Almost every arc has a different song accompanied by the voice involving the star of that story. Similar to its word plays, they contain a pattern of artistic visuals to brings out the power of its orchestra. With its cast members also lies in the strength of their voices. Almost every characters demonstrates this with their voice mannerisms. These include the cunning Shinobu (Maaya Sakamoto), the kuudere Senjougahara (Chiwa Saito), innocent Nadeko (Kana Hanazawa), the mature Tsubasa (Yui Horie), the playful sisters of Karen and Tsukihi, and Araragi (Hiroshi Kamiya). Because the narrative aspect of the show is so strong with the dialogues, it is important to characterize each of their voices as a focus in order to bring out their best. And yes, I am grateful that these characters all bought forth their best thanks to the talents of their voice actor/actresses.\\n\\n\r\nSo,this anime might not be for everyone. That\u2019s something I\u2019m sure most people have heard about the Monogatari franchise before. But if you pass this up for whatever reason, I still would recommend at least giving the first arc a try. That way, it might refresh a bit of experience of what you get out of the other series. However, I highly recommend watching this series only after you have completed its previous predecessors to gain full experience of its presentation. The Monogatari franchise has already achieved universal success thanks to its unique narrative, powerful dialogues, artistic word plays, and unique characters. Its humor will knock you out with high doses of laughter accompanied by its strange twist of stories. It even has bits of action too so violence is not out of the question there for fans looking for some intensity. (that and maybe its goal of achieving anemia with its fan service.) But all in all, Monogatarai series definitely took on the storytelling concept like never before creating an enjoyable experience. Now that is the ecstasy of success. \\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHonestly, I'm surprised... surprised I was able to make it through to the end of this show.  \r\nI'm afraid the long, unnecessary, drawn out conversations that constitute this entire series are a severe test of my patience. More on this in a bit. Due to this being the sole emphasis, the characters should be crucial right?\r\nWell quite frankly there is only one good character in the show, and this guy ends up being the true hero. He is the only character I like. To avoid spoilers... I'll just say, to my severe disappointment, that it doesn't end well.  \r\nThe restof the main characters are immature, irrational  imbeciles. Sorry, but I hate tsunderes or whatever Senjougahara's personality is. Aragagi is as bad as any typical shounen protagonist who thinks he can save everyone. The only difference is that's he's a pedophile, not that really I care about that detail in particular - that's not even one of the things I hate about him. I hate the fact that every girl falls in love with him, when there's really nothing special about him. Is it that he's such a goody-two-shoes?  You can find white knights everywhere. His existence itself is probably the main reason I hate Senjo - the fact that she loves someone like him, that she's willing to die for this guy who doesn't understand anything. I don't remember much from Bakemonogatari as I saw it like 5 years ago, but to my recollection the only reason she's given is that it's because \"he is who he is\" or some vague bullshit like that. Yeah, whatever. Ignoring the fact that Hanekawa loves him too, she to me is a soulless creature, a vanilla. If you watch, it's well documented in those oh-so-long conversations as to why that is, in my opinion. I'm trying to put this in a nutshell because describing how I really feel about these people would require a long-winded essay each. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know; maybe Nisio Ishin doesn't intend for these people to be likable. For those of you who don't know, apparently the writer likes to intentionally make main characters who are unlikable and unrelatable. I\u2019ve learned this from reading Medaka Box. If so, considering the ending and all the implications... he's pretty good at that. Pretty deep stuff, I'll give him that.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to those conversations - those endless dialogues between characters that I don't particularly even like.\\n\\n\r\nTake the very first episode for example. Hanekawa meets a tiger. Then her house burns down. Then she gets yelled at by Senjo. Three significant things happen. None of them take very long - around a couple minutes each. That's what like 6 - 10 minutes on the meat of the plot? The rest of the 20-minute episode was spent having unnecessary conversations and soliloquies. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I'm well aware that that some of this banter leads to some important plot conclusions later. But too much of it is trivial and could easily be shortened without losing anything other than the weird fan-service or whatever it is that so much effort is spent on. The interaction between Hanekawa and Senjo that centers on taking a shower together at the end of the episode goes on for several minutes and well into the next episode. Then it gets even worse - only one thing truly necessary to the plot that happens is another short sighting of the tiger. I mean the majority of an episode is some long drawn-out, redundant small talk. Overall the first arc, 5 long episodes, could easily be shortened to one or two episodes. Most of the show is like this.\\n\\n\r\nWe're getting to my point on why this is the main problem with this show. It's not like I wasn't paying attention to all this dialogue. Rest assured. I weathered the storm, waiting patiently for some meaning, some payoff, hanging on to nearly every word. Because naturally I'm always curious as to what is the point. What is the conflict? What is the goal? It's hardly ever obvious in this show when it's there at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn a later arc, an episode begins with Araragi and a mysterious creature named Ougi having a conversation about traffic lights. This takes around. four. whole. minutes. Why is this a problem? Well, this conversation is happening for one of three reasons apparent to me:\\n\r\n- It's leading up to something important to the plot.\\n\r\n- It's some kind pretentious symbolism.\\n\r\n- It's part of that weird fan-service or whatever it is that draws people to this show that I don't fully understand.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it doesn't really matter which of these three possible reasons this is conversation is happening, because on the surface it's a pointless conversation. On the surface, I don't know why they are having this conversation. On the surface, it's a long drawn out conversation about nothing, leading to nothing until way later. That is if it leads to anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is that if most of the time I'm listening to long seemingly pointless conversations waiting for an eventual meaning, then watching this show has become a chore. It has become a job filled with boredom and ennui. Because it's not like many of these conversations are particularly fascinating. This is why the \"four whole minutes\" I emphasized about the traffic lights example doesn't seem very long in retrospect, but it felt very, very long. The vague connection with this traffic thing doesn\u2019t show up until a while later. And this kind of thing happens often in this show.\\n\\n\r\nI will say in fairness, the plot was there. And it was mildly interesting. The time travel and the last arc were kind of alright. But it almost felt like the plot just was a backdrop for... conversation porn... because on the surface this is a show about people who stand around talking. I understand why this is. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is based on light novels. And this situation might work well in books, but it doesn't work very well on screen. In an attempt to keep it interesting and dress up the fact that people are just standing around talking all the time, the animators even feel the need to flood the screen with constant camera angle shifts, queer poses, flashy patterns and loops, and surreal art. It gets old and irksome pretty fast.  I\u2019ll admit that some of the dialogue, mainly the dialogue that unsubtly advanced the plot, was interesting. There wasn't enough of this kind.\\n\\n\r\nThe important thing though is that the plot is a backdrop for the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, all described and analyzed in vivid detail by all these conversations and soliloquies. The important thing is that, small talk aside, the significant dialogue places that much greater emphasis on all their awful traits. That is why this show, why these people left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t enjoy this show because it started out badly with *very* slow pacing and ended badly with a frustrating ending in my opinion, ruining what little redemption it could have had.  Yeah, I\u2019m aware this series is probably not over. But I also didn\u2019t enjoy it because I didn't care for most of the protagonists, and there was simply too. much. talking. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cAfter nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world.\u201d \r\n-Phillip Pullman\r\nOn that note, the second season (although technically third or fourth depending if you count Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari) of the Monogatari Series was promised to be a two cour delivering viewers the excellent experience that the first season, Bakemonogatari, did. Rest assured that if you enjoyed Bakemonogatari, you will not be disappointed by the second season. \r\nStory: (10/10): Monogatari S2's story is the driving point of the anime itself, the beating heart at its core. The storytelling in this anime is top notch, as it is an almost completelydialogue driven anime. If you don't like characters sitting down and fleshing things out, exploring the facets of their inner thoughts, strengths and flaws, then you might not enjoy this season. However, assuming that you watched the first season, you probably would have already figured out whether the Monogatari Series was right for you or not. Needless to say if it is for you, you're in for a treat. The story covers additional stories for Hanekawa, Hachikuji, Shinobu, Nadeko and Kaiki. Most of the characters from the original series make an appearance, although there is a bit of absence of Kanbaru. Shaft's unique way of organizing the anime leaves the free flowing story to explore the great characters within the story, as well as progress through the life of our lively MC, Ararararararagi. All the arcs seem to have different flavors to them, some being more action oriented, others being a lot more explorative, and some very emotional. Shaft has done an excellent job of succeeding the original series, as the viewer truly never finds themselves disappointed by the story aspect of Monogatari. The arcs only get better and better, leaving with a truly memorable experience in the final arc (Koimonogatari) which I'll leave you all to discover for yourselves. The fact of the matter, or the conclusion rather is that on the story basis, Monogatari is outstanding, and it makes me sad that I won't be able to experience the great storytelling until a hopefully additional season comes out. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10): The art in Monogatari S2 is very much like its predecessors. The characters are all well defined, and all have unique aspects to them, however if you're someone who is very picky about animation and slick transitions, you might feel a little disappointed. Shaft cycles through animations during dialogue, zooming in and accentuating different nuances to the speaker's body. The famous slow motion head turn and zooming right into their face. It helps to keep the viewer enticed in the dialogue while they are talking, but other than that it does get repetitive. Besides that, the avant garde nature of some of the apparitions and environments (things made completely of Kanji) are always a treat, as the peculiarity only seems to add to the experience. That being said, since Monogatari S2 is such a dialogue based anime, this really isn't a problem. Besides that the transition slides usually have a bit of text, that you can choose to neglect or to pause and read, and people may find that annoying, although I didn't seem to mind it as much. As I mentioned before, if you don't like the way the art and animation is done, you probably would have figured it out in the earlier seasons. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10): The sound in Monogatari S2 is great at doing what it was made to do. Complimenting dialogue with a good soundtrack is very difficult. Fortunately, it's done very well in Monogatari S2, as you will find that what would have been a more stale conversation is brought to life a bit more by the beautiful pieces in the soundtrack. The OPs and EDs are some of the best I've seen, as the music is always great, as it was in the previous seasons. There's a few clips of ambient sounds when transitioning to other scenes, but they only add to the experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10): The characters in Monogatari S2 really help define what the anime is like. Since it is a storytelling anime, the storytellers should be interesting as to keep the viewers interested as well. Luckily the unique set of characters we have are very well defined and interesting to the end. One of the great parts of Monogatari S2 is the way that it highlights the flaws of people fundamentally. This is through the apparitions that they get latched onto, as the apparitions themselves target weakness and the vulnerable. You have a cast of characters who all have their unique flaws, but all find ways to get through it, and that is the beauty and joy that you will experience through the expert storytelling of Shaft. As expected, the character development is very good, as there are plenty of learning experiences of the characters as they tell their stories. You will grow more attached to your favorite characters, and learn to understand the characters that you don't like as much. The beauty is, there's plenty of choices. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10): Frankly speaking, Monogatari S2 was a very enjoyable experience for me. I loved Bakemonogatari, and watching the series finally get back on track with a two cour season was a delight for me. Picking up on the nuances of the dialogue, and watching the characters retell some amazing stories really never gets old for me. Since this is a sequel, I'll word it like this. If you liked Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari or Nekomonogatari, you will find something to appreciate in Monogatari S2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As 2013 winds down, Monogatari Series: Second Season serves as one of the highlights of the year, allowing fans of the series to rejoice once more in Shaft's excellent work in creating an atmosphere and story truly unparalleled. You will feel for the characters, you will laugh with the characters, and you will cry with the characters through their toughest and most jovial experience all told amazingly through clever dialogue and plot. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: A solid 9/10. There are some things that can't be explained in words, and I definitely recommend this season to fans of the previous ones.",

            "content": "Since the release of Bakemonogatari, the first part of Monogatari series, this unique show has been splitting the community in two parts, one side being the Monogatari fans, like myself, who threat it like a rare philosophical gem of the anime universe, and the other side which sees it as just another harem show that tries to cover the fanservice with some 'random' philosophy.\r\nBy writing this review, I want to show you my view on this show, not to force you to have the same opinion on it as I do.\r\nAs you are familiar with the series (I assume, since this is the review onthe SECOND SEASON of Monogatari series), I will skip the intro and get right onto what made me like this anime so bad, and that is definitely the creativity of the story, and the unique way of storytelling. Monogatari Series: Second Season is featuring five new stories (+ and additional Hanamonogatari) showing us, once again, how human mind can be sick and twisted. Nisio Isin is playing with endless possibilities of the universe he has created, as our heroes struggle in this psychological adventure. While the plot in Bakemonogatari was highly repetitive and stereotipical (where Araragi happens to run into a girl in trouble and helps her), Second season is way more creative. Each story is darker, deeper, and more f*cked up than the ones in Bakemonogatari, and through each story you can find a bit more about the characters, their past, relationships, and a mysterious connection with the supernatural entity, while being trapped in a twisted paranormal adventure.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there would be no story without the characters themselves, having in mind that everything happening in the show, is subconsciously created by the characters themselves. Through this philosophical masterpiece, you can see the protagonists of the Monogatari series in totally   different way, discover their backstories, dreams and fears, and even get inside of a parallel what-could-be universe. Also, you can see them changing due to all the paranormal happenings, both psychically and physically. Second Season can probably show the best interaction between the characters in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and the background music remain fantastic as they always were, since they are done by the SHAFT studio. The art is even better, and the animation is more fluid, which makes your personal enjoyment more a nd more superior. As the studio is getting used to the show, each segment is being more perfected. Atmosphere remains flawless, either if it is a horrific mystery scene, or the super-hot ecchi scene. It is so enjoyable, that I have finished the entire Second Season in three days.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that this show is not for all the audience, as it contains lots of mature content like gore and nudity, and it can sometimes be really hard to follow the story line, or to read the subtitle and watch the show at the same time. Also, the SHAFT's way of presenting and animating can be awkward at times, so it can easily cause a headache to ones unfamiliar with it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are fan of the series, and you happen to like it so far, I highly recommend you check this out, as it is by far the best Monogatari yet. If you are somehow reading this review and thinking about watching this series, you should first go check Bakemonogatari, and then find out whether you like it or not. And if you are in a not-so-small group of people that were not satisfied with the first one or two parts of the series, I still recommend you checking this one out, as you might change your opinion.",

            "content": "Even though it\u2019s been over half a year since I saw this anime, on impulse I decided that it was about time I said a few words about it, because I feel like I almost never see anyone ever talking about the \u201cother\u201d side of Monogatari and the quite clear problems the show has.\r\nNow before you instantly downvote this because I\u2019m not giving this the very highest score, I just want to clarify that I do not hate this show, nor do I think it is a bad one however there are a number of things that make it far from perfect in my eyes,and they are not spoken of all too often.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice when it comes to Monogatari (besides the wacky art style) is its choice of storytelling. Like so many other series out there, it is divided into many smaller arcs that together build up a grander overarching story. Roughly it goes something along the lines of:\\n\\n\r\n1) A girl gets possessed by an Oddity or at least has her life messed up by it in one way or another.\\n\r\n2) Araragi investigates the situation, and after some less than flawless work he manages to rescue the damsel in distress.\\n\r\n3) The girl is then blatantly tossed aside in order to return to the status quo so that the story can proceed unhindered to its next arc, starting over from step 1 again.\\n\\n\r\nSee that last part there? This is the source of most of the problems of the whole series, and quite frankly I find it to be quite disrespectful writing on the author\u2019s part. You know how people like to complain about the role Asuna was given in the second half of Sword Art Online? Well this is basically the same thing except it happens to almost every character in the entire show at least somewhere during the course of its progression.\\n\\n\r\nBasically what happens is that since every arc is about resolving the problems of one of its many heroines, as soon as that arc is over she no longer has any role at all for the next arc. Bar a few exceptions, the only relevant characters at any point in time of the story are Araragi himself, Shinobu (because she\u2019s stuck with him) and whichever girl who\u2019s arc it currently is (and perhaps some antagonist-like character as well). The rest of the cast basically gets ignored completely, and this is not a small cast we\u2019re talking about here, nor are the arcs all that short either. As a result, characters that might have appeared to be main characters at one point might completely disappear from the story for up to 20 episodes sometimes over the course of the seasons, (not discounting his supposed girlfriend) and that\u2019s not exactly a small amount of time for this type of anime. Consequently, Araragi and Shinobu are the only characters that are given consistent character development over the course of the show, whereas everyone else has theirs completely halted every so often.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not the kind of person who\u2019d get upset over the death of a main character, actually I think there\u2019s not enough of that in today\u2019s anime, however this is a completely different issue as the heroines are just pushed aside for no obvious reason for huge amounts of time. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re actually gone, they just\u2026 temporarily disappear.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know part of this problem stems from the fact that the arcs of the Monogatari Series aren\u2019t aired in the same order as they were written in the original Light Novels, and I understand that reading them might clear up a thing or two. However to me that is not really an excuse; an anime is its own product after all and should be able to deliver on consistent and easy-to-follow storytelling all on its own. You shouldn\u2019t have to go read the source material just to get the full experience of the anime; they\u2019re separate mediums for a reason after all.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said it of course doesn\u2019t hamper all the good sides of the series. The animation is completely crazy and very much so up to interpretation but I think it looks absolutely beautiful at least. The soundtrack is not particularly memorable but it has its moments and is certainly not bad. And as far as the enjoyment value goes (which is what really matters in the end), I generally find it very inconsistent and spiky. There are some segments and dialogues in it that are simply brilliant, but just as often I find myself tapping my fingers on my desk in impatience for the series to actually get going.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, there is still a little bit more to come from this series and I\u2019m still hopeful that the final part(s) will be able to tie the whole thing together in some way that makes it all feel connected and relevant, because currently I\u2019m sort of missing that part. It just feels like there\u2019s no clear goal regarding where the overarching story will end up and there are a lot of things to patch up and resolve before the eventual conclusion. I still think it can be done though and I hope the author can positively surprise me on this one, but as it currently stands I cannot make myself wholeheartedly approve of the direction this franchise has taken.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough if there is one thing you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s that the series sure as hell is unique, and that alone can take you quite a long way in today\u2019s industry.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s to a brighter future!",

            "content": "To live in a world with apparitions, what danger will Araragi face?\r\nThe Monogatari Series is one outstanding series. The light novel is well written and the animated series is beautiful. One important aspect of Monogatari Series is that there are many tropes and themes where viewers and readers can enjoy. Monogatari Series provide a variety of interest and it will make the audience want more. What is understandable is the fact that the underlying themes in Monogatari Series make the series stand out.\r\n\tOne theme that is shared throughout the series is random act of kindness. This theme is important because it shapes people psychologically. Theserandom acts of kindness can vary from giving directions to a stranger to saving a person\u2019s life. If a person is in need of help, it is best to help that person out. Even though there are more themes and tropes, they are all able to connect beautifully. Monogatari Series also have dark themes. These dark themes are used to portray reality and fantasy. To discover the truth behind the dark themes is to uncover the mystery behind apparitions. The saying goes: if there is light, there is also darkness.\\n\\n\r\n\tMonogatari Season Two is the continuation of Nisemonogatari. Studio SHAFT plans to animate the whole light novel. There will be a total of three seasons. Monogatari Season Two focuses on Nekomonogatari White, Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari, and Koimonogatari. These titles are significant because they relate deeply to the story. For an example, Kizumonogatari, Kizumono means \u2018damaged good\u2019, but also \u2018a woman who has been deflowered\u2019. Monogatari would mean story. Based off the title, it foreshadows the underlying dark theme. \\n\\n\r\n\tSince there is a sequel, the introduction of Monogatari Season Two provides a recap of what happened previously. The sequel started with Nekomonogatari White. Therefore, the story continued from Nisemonogatari time wise and a continuation of plot to Hanekawa in Nekomonogatari Black. Though, Nekomonogatari Black took place before Bakemonogatari. This may be confusing, but the timeline and plot is completely different. Araragi is helping out people with apparitions and it would be boring if the plot was to be linear. As the anime progress, characters have special appearance in certain situations. There are multiple characters and each character has their own arc. In short, each character is important to their respective arc. There are interactions among these characters even though they are not focused in these arcs. Although they are not focused, it gives insight to the character and provides development. What is given for sure is that this technique is smart and well used throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnimations are one reason to seek interest in an anime. If the art work is great and the animations are smooth, most people would tend to watch it because it is appealing to the eye. When it is appealing to the eye, it is easier to enjoy the anime and not complain. One reason that makes the Monogatari series good is because of Studio Shaft. Studio Shaft tends to make unique animations. Unique animations as in great camera view, amazing art work, detailed background and effects. There is also a gag where Studio Shaft likes to put their characters in a difficult head tilt. This is just for comedy purposes, but it is indeed interesting. This can be related to paintings as they have their own form of interpretation. Last but not least, the characters are very detailed, the transitioning is beautiful and the art is crystal clear.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs the story progress through, the characters adapt to changes. The adaption can be either negative or positive. It is truly boring to watch a static character. Seeing a dynamic character can trigger new events. Having a dynamic character allows the plot to be flexible and create suitable settings. This is important because Monogatari focuses on Araragi and apparitions. As Araragi progress throughout the story, he will learn and experience new information. This is also the same for any other characters in Monogatari. Since there are dynamic characters, there is a beautiful resolve. The resolve can be either a good ending or tragic ending. As characters face an obstacle, they would have to overcome the experience. The journey may be short or long, but the experience is all that matters.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe character of Araragi Koyomi is notable throughout the Monogatari series. His goal was to protect those who he cared for. To achieve these goals, he has to fight against apparitions and try to help the victims face reality. There are times where people tend to seclude themselves away from reality. Reality is definitely harsh and not pleasant for those who struggle. What makes human the superior race is that humans overcome their problems and advance forward. Throughout Monogatari Second Season, Araragi has starred in most of the arcs and made a huge impact on the plot. Besides the fact that Araragi is the main character, there are other characters that are significant.\\n\\n\r\nAs each arc starts, the audience views a nature that a character has hidden. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.\u201d \u2013 Greta Garbo.\\n\\n\r\nThis quote pretty much sums up the dark themes from Monogatari Second Season. Each character has their own hardships and it is tough to see them face their own problems. Characters such as Hanekawa Tsubasa and Hitagi Senjougahara have their own problems to deal with, but doesn\u2019t show it until their respective arc shows. To acknowledge these problems, each character is related in a special way. Other characters such Oshino Shinobu, Hachikuji Mayoi, Kanbaru Suruga, and Sengoku Nadeko also has their dark secrets. The audience grasps on these secrets and expands their curiosity. These characters are brought over from season one. These characters undergo more development and thus the audience learns more about the character. There is also an apparition that dwells under the host due to their problems. In order to solve the problem, the character would have to adapt and face reality to overcome their problem.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe voice actors and actress are kept the same. This is generally a must since there is a sequel. It would be quite awkward for a character to have a different voice actor or actress unless it was meant. Nobody in Bakemonogatari had different personalities causing it to have different voice actors or actress. What is known for sure is that the audio is great throughout. The opening is normally made by the arc\u2019s main character. For an example, Nekomonogatari White starred Hanekawa Tsubasa so the voice actress of Hanekawa would sing the opening song. It is unique and it requires money and effort to be made. This is one way to show that Studio Shaft is trying to keep the same format as Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe audio for Monogatari Season Two is great. The opening is kept classy with the main character of the arc starring in the opening. For an example, if Hachikuji was the main character of the arc, Hachikuji will voice the opening and have a unique opening animation. This concept was started in Bakemonogatari and was brought over. I really liked this concept and it was used beautifully in Monogatari Second Season.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, Monogatari Second Season is a good anime to watch. It is a genre that all could enjoy. I am sure that SHAFT poured their hearts out to appeal to their fan base and the general anime audience. The story is worth following up upon and the light novels are a great read. One cannot judge a book by its cover until its contents was seen. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Favorite Monogatari season by far. Deep and complex character interactions(Kaiki-Senjougahara, Nadeko-Kaiki, Hachikuji-Araragi etc),most interesting stories, strong feelings and heartwarming momments.  Nekomonogatari white, second and final part of nekomonogatari completes Hanekawa's arc in the best way. I find Hanekawa's personality kind of annoying and her gimmick doesnt help her so much but in this story she presented another aspect of her essence and i find it pretty interesting and loveable. In other hand her co-competitor, Senjougahara remains a character with a difficult personality who doesnt know how to comunicate and all her act seems fake \r\nif we consider her age but one boy can fixthat easily. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have Hachikuji's story. Araragi and Shinobu try to rescue Hachikuji from her fate with the most enjoyable and loveable time-travel story ever made. Their interaction is amazing  and with momments like when they meet loli class prez, when they ask informations for a lost unknown to them 10yo old girl in the police office and the \"first\" meeting with Hachikuji put the show in a shiny way.\\n\\n\r\nAlso leading role in this season has the snake girl. Its true that i love her design but i didnt except to love her personality too. Absolutely love the fact that she is obsessed with araraki and tried to do anything to take him with her. On the surface she is just a girl who doesnt like to be called \"cute\" cause some self-esteem or maybe more complicated problems. \u0397er problem finally broke with an exaggeration way but in the end an adult advice was enough to solve that. Kaiki conquer Nadeko's heart but not only her, he was the absolutely mvp of the season.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of my review i want to write some words for my favorite part of the season and those 2 momments that i couldnt ever forget. When Shaft chooses to direct the monogatari series with a specific way(with lack of mobility) knew well that the details are those that going to make the show a success. An example was the kissing scene with the blonde vampire, her body moves speak of their own, the cuts were so much intense that didnt need words to discribe the scene. Shinobu and Araragi connection is the strongest one and they prove it every time. One more scene that left me speechless was samurai's story narration. Sakamoto Maaya(Shinobu seiyuu) skills and a well down writing scenario were enough to create one of the best momments in series.\\n\\n\r\nI couldnt possible forgot the purest creature on earth, Mayoi Hachikuji, but i want to keep my thoughts on me cause i dont want to destroy that amazing scene, i cant review that, picture had so much power there that words doesnt matter at all. To close, Kaiki-Senjougahara relationship was so powerfull too, when Senjou breaks her character is a lovable creature and Kaiki help her so much with that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sequels to any body of work have a reputation to uphold; a certain quality it must meet to please its viewers that are eager for the return of their favorite characters and stories. This is especially the case with this little nugget of a series here.\r\nThe Monogatari Series Second Season had quite a bit to live up to. The original Bakemonogatari provided a very unique take on the ecchi/harem genre, coupling sexy fanservice with unusual animation, lengthy dialogue, and individual arcs focusing on Araragi\u2019s interaction with different characters and their supernatural problems. However, its sequel, Nisemonogatari, while still good, was a step down from Bakemonogatari.Its arcs were missing the pizzaz and interesting character development of Bakemonogatari\u2019s arcs. To make things worse, for whatever reason, they tried to remedy this by piling on more fanservice. Nekomogatari as well, overdid the fanservice and somewhat felt like a recycled version of the previous Tsubasa arc from Bakemonogatari. Well\u2026that and an excuse to show Black Tsubasa in her underwear.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this in mind, it\u2019s understandable that one might be wary of the Second Season. Well, rest assured, it delivers everything that was great about the original series and THEN SOME. Brand new arcs are given for many of the characters who appeared in the original, revealing all new sides to each of them. Its execution is excellent and the animation, dialogue, music, and voice acting are better than ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc focuses on Tsubasa, and once again deals with the cursed cat that inhabits her body. It in some ways mirrors her initial arc from Bakemonogatari and Nekomongatari, so this definitely isn\u2019t the strongest arc. But it\u2019s got just enough originality, namely her encounter with the tiger apparition and her having to cope with her house burning down, to not feel recycled or boring. Not only that, but this arc wraps up her story nicely and gives her a satisfying resolution. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is a bizarre yet insanely interesting arc that focuses on Araragi and Shinobu messing with time and suffering a number of unforeseen consequences as a result. This arc in question gives us a peek into the mysterious Shinobu, portraying her as more humane and emotional. We also get to see a bit of Mayoi\u2019s past.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc focuses on Sengoku Nadeko. This arc was great because it expanded on her character. In the original Bakemonogatari, her arc seemed more focused on fanservice and getting her half naked or in a school swimsuit than on her individual character. This time around we see a focus on her personality. There\u2019s a focus on her looks but it\u2019s highlighted in an interesting way that surprisingly connects to her personality and behavior. This arc ends on a cliffhanger and continues in the final arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe fourth arc is a bittersweet one, and will probably cause you to shed a few tears. The final arc is a bit underwhelming compared to the previous arcs. It\u2019s disappointing that the anime goes out with a bit of a whimper. But on the bright side, it\u2019s pretty fun at times and focuses on Hitagi Senjogahara, everyone\u2019s favorite tsundere. Her insane threats delivered in her calm, even voice are as funny as ever. Oddly enough, Suruga Kanbaru doesn\u2019t get her own arc. In fact, she barely appears and is only mentioned a few times. Fans of her character will have to wait for the next installment in the series. \\n\\n\r\nWith each arc you grow closer to the main characters and it\u2019s a guarantee that you\u2019ll grow to love them a little more. There are a few quirky side characters that come in to the mix. But they\u2019re just that: side characters. There isn\u2019t a big focus on them, aside from being beacons of information or comedic relief. After each arc, a summary is presented to refresh everyone\u2019s memory of the previous three series. These are helpful for those who want to recall some things they may have forgotten about the previous installments, but can be skipped if you don\u2019t care to see them. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is as perfect as ever: The bright backgrounds littered with reds, whites, yellows, and blues, weird camera angles, head tilting, and quick little blurbs flashing across the screen are all back. The music maintains the same quality as the previous series as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series has come back with a bang. What sets this anime apart from other ecchi/harem anime is its unusual presentation and amazing execution. It does have fanservice and a bunch of girls vying for the same guy, but each girl isn\u2019t simply some generic, boring, archetype. It may seem that way at first (the bookworm, the loli, the cute shy girl, and the tsundere are all here), but by now we\u2019ve seen these characters grow and develop into interesting and unique individuals. The well-handled and occasionally symbolic supernatural elements sure do help out quite a bit as well. \\n\\n\r\nFans of the original Bakemonogatari will be more than pleased with this installment, even if they\u2019ve been disappointed by Nise and Nekomonogatari. Shaft hit all the right notes with this anime and hopefully its future installments will maintain this quality.",

            "content": "Shaft and Nisio Isin are like peanut butter and jelly. Both are good on their own, but together, they compliment each other with such perfect synergy to form something truly amazing. They both have their own unique quirks and styles that really come together in the best way. Isin's stories are character driven, and Monogatari is no exception. Shaft has a way of injecting so much life and personality into all his characters. You instantly fall in love with each character's personality, from Hachikuji's playful insults and Kaiki's snark and cynicism. This is especially important because of the focus on character and perspective in Season2. We get narrators besides Araragi for the first time in the series, which not only provides us with more insight but is very refreshing. It offers up opportunities for the story to be told in a whole new way. While Hanekawa is narrator we get a slow paced story about self discovery and acceptance. Switch back to Araragi and it's more faced paced shonen style. Then Kaiki takes the stage and we're left with what feels like reading a detective mystery novel. There variety lends itself to quite intricate and complex character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nMinor characters from previous entries are given new and more important roles so that we can become more familiar with them (I said with a posed look). New characters are introduced as well - including a possible antagonist of sorts, which is fantastic addition. The music in the series is up to par with what we've come to expect, if not better. The seiyuus still sing their respective openings which I always found particularly charming. Without wanting to give to much away, the last OP left a huge smile on my face - it was definitely a big surprise. If I had one complaint, it would be that we're often faced with budget starved visuals. It's disappointing that it's not the most aesthetically pleasing entry in the series, but it doesn't manage to take away from what is otherwise a fantastic show. Everything we know and love from the series is taken and improved upon in season 2. It's thought provoking, engaging and just overall and enjoyable watch. I'm confident to say that this is the best entry in the Monogatari series so far.",

            "content": "After watching Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari: Kuro, I really thought that the future Monogatari series will never live up to Bakemonogatari and will not be as good as Bake. That's not the case though because Monogatari Series: Second Season completely blew my expectations and it was miles better than Bakemonogatari.\r\n(This is an in-depth review meaning there will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (9.9/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nMonogatari Series: Second Season is a sequel to \"Nisemonogatari\" and it chronologically takes place right after the events of Nise. The bee apparition is now gone, and summer vacation where the phoenix apparition averted harm is over. Around Koyomi Araragi and the girlswho started a new trimester, apparitions, or perhaps threats even worse, were creeping in ever closer. Monogatari Series: Second Season is an adaptation of a light novels with the same which contained 6 volumes. \\n\\n\r\nI actually mean it when I said that Monogatari Series: Second Season is better than Bakemonogatari. What the show did is take everything from Bakemonogatari in terms of storytelling and plot structure that made it great  and they significantly improved it. In other words, it felt like an improved version of Bakemonogatari. Only this time, it's a sequel that's better than the predecessor. A.lot.better!\\n\\n\r\nThe series is divided into 5 arcs. Each arc containing a character with new mysteries/problem that Araragi needs to solve. Don't worry, none of these mysteries are the same as Bake. They're all fresh and new mysteries. These arcs are called \"Nekomonogatari: Shiro\", \"Kabukimonogatari\", \"Otorimonogatari\", \"Onimonogatari\", \"Koimonogatari\". No wonder, the show's called \"Monogatari Series\". These arcs are all mini-story packed into one. They could have done the same thing as Bake and Nise by separately releasing all 5 arcs into 5 separate shows but this is obviously more effective. \\n\\n\r\nNow I want to review the 5 arcs without spoiling too much. Expect some minor spoilers though. The first arc is \"Nekomonogatari: Shiro\" or \"Tsubasa, Tiger\". If you watched Nekomonogatari: Kuro then by simply looking at the name of this arc, you should already know that this is going to be focused on Hanekawa. Just by watching the first 2 episodes of this arc, you'll notice someone missing. That's right, Araragi. He's not completely missing though, he's just gone for this arc. I'm kinda glad that Araragi is not in this arc. While I do like seeing Araragi in action, Araragi not making an appearance in this arc (he does make an appearance at the end of this arc) gives Hanekawa and Senjougahara more character interaction without Araragi on their sight or else it will just turn into a love triangle. For the most part, the arc shows that Hanekawa can be an independent girl and can solve problems on her own until the ending in which she was saved by Araragi. I really don't know what to feel about the ending of \"Tsubasa Tiger\". It was nice to see Hanekawa being an independent girl and I would have loved to see Hanekawa solve her problem completely without Araragi's help. Overall, it was still a great first arc with a decent ending. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Kabukimonogatari or Mayoi Jiangshi. Just by watching the first 2 episodes of this arc, you'll notice something different again. No, Araragi is not missing again. Despite the fact that this arc was supposed to be Hachikugi's arc. It felt like it was Shinobu's arc. Let me explain, the story is focused on Hachikugi. The reason why the arc is happening is because of Hachikugi but in terms of screen-time, Shinobu got a lot more while Hachikugi was almost non-existant. Does that mean the arc was shit? Haha, No! This arc is one of the best arc I've seen in Monogatari Series. It's got a great and clever story. The arc begins with Araragi; along with Shinobu, going back in time because he forgot to do his summer homework. That alone was pretty hilarious. Araragi and Shinobu discovered that they traveled 11 years back into the past. Araragi finds out that they traveled in a time period where Hachikugi was still alive and he decides to save her. However, this messed up the entire world. Everything after that is just awesome. Finding out that they actually visited an alternate reality?!...I am done. I never even thought of that. It's like they threw the \"time travel\" concept right out of the window. Not only does this arc have a great and clever story, this also developed Shinobu's character even further and made her the most interesting character in Monogatari Series. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Otorimonogatari or Nadeko Medusa. Ughh, this arc. I have a love and hate relationship with this arc. I love the arc because of the great story and plot-twist and I hate this arc because Nadeko has now turned into a yandere bitch. To be more specific, I hate her more than the arc itself. Look, I understand what Nadeko was going through but turning into a snake god because you don't want to be called cute anymore and killing Araragi, Shinobu and Senjougahara because of your damn jealousy? In my opinion, she took it way too far. She could have moved on because there are other things to do out there besides romance. She acted like it was the end of the world because her romance didn't work out the way she wanted it too. Despite all of this, this greatly builds and develops Nadeko's character. In Bake, she was this cute character that had a problem but in Monogatari Series: Second Season, there's a reason why she didn't want to be treated like she's special just because she's cute. This, in turn, made her into what she is today. A psychopathic yandere bitch. Why psychopathic you ask? She's hearing voices bruh. That voice wasn't even from the snake god. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Onimonogatari or Shinobu Time. You'll notice something different again while watching this arc. That's right, this time Hachikugi gets way more screentime than Shinobu despite the fact that this is her arc. In other words, Onimonogatari and Kabukimonogatari are kind of flipped around if you think about it. There is a difference though..Shinobu got a decent amount of screentime and most of her screentime was dedicated to explaining what the \"darkness\" is. To summarize, the \"darkness\" was chasing Araragi and Hachikuji, they (or we) learn what \"it\" is, they realize that they can't stop the \"darkness\" and Hachikugi says her fairwells and goes on to live the \"next life\". I have to say, the story was fairly simple but this arc developed Hachikugi's character even further. This arc can do either one of these things to you. Break your manliness or be depressed for the whole day. I got the second one. This arc depressed the living hell out of me for the whole day.  \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's Koimonogatari or Hitage End. In my opinion, this is the best arc out of the 5. Just like Nekomonogatari: Kuro and Otorimonogatari, Araragi is non-existant. That's good, meaning that I get to see Senjougahara; my favourite character in the Monogatari Series, get more screentime. Oh, how I was wrong. While I was watching this arc, I noticed that Kaiki; the main antagonist in Nisemonogatari, is getting more screentime than Senjougahara..I was quickly disappointed but that disappointed quickly turned into a smiley face after the 1st episode of her arc. I can't believe it...An antagonist...was quickly turning into my favourite villians of all time. The moment where he was deciding; on the front of a mirror, whether he should help Araragi and Senjougahara or not, I knew his character was going to get even better and it did. Monogatari Series: Second Season did a wonderful job presenting Kaiki's change in character. The final arc of the series also kept developing Nadeko's character and revealed more and more about her past life and her intentions. I honestly thought that Nadeko was going to be ignored after her arc in Bake because she barely got any screentime in the second half of Bake and the entirety of Nise but I'm glad she's not being ignored. Even though she's now one of the most hated characters in Monogatari Series. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue scenes that is so ever famous in the Monogatari Series is back and if you've managed to come at this point of the series then you already know that the series is full of dialogue scenes that can last for a whole episode. Some people found the dialogue scenes to be extremely boring, hence the reason why the dropped the series. Let's be real here. If you've come this far then you shouldn't have any issues with the dialogue scenes. I said shouldn't. \\n\\n\r\nPutting the story aside, fanservice in Monogatari Series: Second Season has been reduced significantly when compared to Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari. You can still spot some fanservice scenes like the first couple of episodes in \"Tsubasa Tiger\" arc and in later arcs but they're easy to ignore and doesn't really affect the serious tone of the show. \\n\\n\r\n\"Monogatari Series: Second Second\" has one minor issue and one minor issue only. It's the recap episodes. It would have been ok if there was one but there's three. Why?.......Like I said, it's just a minor issue and it affected the show's rating only by .1. Not that big of a deal\\n\\n\r\nLast thing that I want to talk about is the pacing...In my Bakemonogatari review, I mentioned that the only reason why I didn't give the show a 10 is the pacing. It was going pretty fast but not too fast that will make the show a failure like some certain A-1 Pictures anime. Monogatari Series: Second Season's pacing is damn perfect. It's seriously perfect. It wasn't too fast nor was it too slow. It was at a normal pacing and it explained the situation in a smooth manner so I was able to understand what was going on in all 5 arcs without any troubles. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nNow this is the animation that I was looking for Shaft. They didn't have to change the visuals because it was perfect to begin with. What they needed to fix was the lighting because the lack of reflection and shadows in the previous shows was quite irritating and that's what they did here. Indeed, there were some shadows in the previous shows but those were forced. They weren't present all the time. All the weird animation from the previous shows are still here (SHAFT head tilts, messy camera angles, flashing text, etc.). \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nNote that majority of the score for the \"Sound\" category comes from the Opening theme and part of it comes from the Ending theme so it doesn't matter if the soundtrack is crap or the voice acting is crap, it won't affect my sound rating that much. I'm not, however, saying that the soundtrack and the VA is crap because they're not. OST sounds great, the soundtrack sounds great and the VA's did a wonderful job voicing the characters. Especially Nadeko's VA with her supposedly cutesy moe voice. Now, the OP and ED theme songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"chocolate insomnia\" by Hanekawa Tsubasa, \"happy bite\" by Hachikugi Mayoi, \"Mosou Express\" by Nadeko Sengoku, \"white lies\" by the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus, \"fast love\" by Hitagi Senjougahara, and \"Kogarashi Sentiment\" by Hitagi Senjougahara and Kaiki Deshou. The ED theme songs are \"Ai wo Utae\" by Luna Haruna,  \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" by supercell, \"Sono Koe wo Oboeteru\" by Marina Kawano, and \"snowdrop\" by Luna Haruna \u00d7 Marina Kawano. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want my opinions on the OP theme songs, they all sound great. None of them were bad and most of the OP theme songs made it into my favourite opening songs. I love the 1st OP theme song because of Hanekawa's cute voice and the song's catchy tunes. I love the 2nd OP theme song because of the catchy tune. Hachikugi's voice was just an added bonus. I love the 3rd OP theme song because of its effective use of foreshadowing. When I first heard the 3rd OP theme song, I knew something bad was going to happen to  Nadeko but what I didn't know is she did it to her self. Watching the 3rd OP theme song again, I guess it also shows her breakdown. Even the lyrics themselves are foreshadowing the character's actions. I don't know what to feel about the 4th OP. It wasn't bad but I would have preferred Shinobu's VA to sing the OP theme song. Well, real life sucks sometimes with all these contracts and other unknown reasons. Then there's the 5th OP which contains 2 versions. The 1st version where Senjougahara was singing and the 2nd version where Kaiki and Senjougahara were both in a duet. I just want to say that the Opening Animation used for the 5th OP was so clever and something original for once. Just watch the OP yourself. I also want to mention the singers for the 5th OP. I didn't have any problem with Senjougahara singing but the duet version...Jesus Christ...what the hell is up with Kaiki's voice?! I was literally laughing my ass off when I heard him singing. If that was intentional and I am very sure it was, then great job for Kaiki's VA because his singing is comedy gold. The ED theme songs are decent in my opinion but none of the ED theme songs here has beaten Bakemonogatari's ED yet. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (10/10)\\n\r\nMost of the characters you know and love from the Monogatari series returns here in the Second Season. I gotta say, the show did an outstanding job with the character development. By taking out Araragi in 3 of the 5 arcs and the series being 26 episodes, the show gave the girls more screentime, they're more fleshed out and like I said, they got character development. However, there were 3 girls that didn't get screentime at all and that's the Fire Sisters and Kanbaru Suruga. I'm going to have to cut Kanbaru because she gets her own arc after the Monogatari Series: Second Season. I guess the Fire Sisters have no more stories to be told. You can still hear them in the \"Previews\" but I don't think that counts as screentime. \\n\\n\r\nThis category ain't that long because most of my character reviews are in the \"Story\" category. I guess moving them in this category would be more sensible but I'm satisfied with how I wrote my review and what category I put the reviews in. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nI never thought I would enjoy the Monogatari Series: Second Season so much. Even though the show is 95% dialogue, I still enjoyed this show a helluva lot more than a \"shounen\" show that contains 95% action. Bakemonogatari used to be on my Top 10 list but after watching this show, Monogatari Series: Second Season will take that spot. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Monogatari Series: Second Season\" is truly an outstanding anime that blows Bake, Nise and Neko out of the water. This is also one of those rare sequels that beats the original show. The show takes everything from Bake and improved it. I'm talking about the dialogue scenes, huge improvement in pacing, significantly reduced fanservice and the story is a lot more clever than Bake. I will also say that it's a lot better than Bake. If you have watched Bake, Nise and Neko then it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you watch this show now. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+All 5 arcs have outstanding stories and are all well though out\\n\r\n+Outstanding and Unique Animation \\n\r\n+Soundtrack is a masterpiece\\n\r\n+All the characters are developed and fleshed out\\n\r\n+Significantly improved pacing\\n\r\n+Fanservice reduced significantly\\n\r\n+Kaiki's change in character is perfect\\n\r\n+Dialogue scenes are way better than the predecessors\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Three Recap Episodes",

            "content": "Brilliant! Probably the most interesting Monogatari season to date! They made many references and built upon subtle clues from the original seasons that just fascinated me. There was a ton of dialogue as well as character development that made me question who was the real protagonist of the story. The ending was a masterpiece and completely unexpected. This season was long 26 episodes, but made me crave more nonetheless. I cannot wait for more Monogatari content to be released~\r\nSTORY: 10/10\r\nWas intricate and the episodes were intentionally not in the correct order in terms of plot progression time-wise. The entirety of S2 references the previous seasonsheavily so you must have watched those beforehand. There are a lot of small details that end up playing huge roles throughout the story and the unpredictability of how things will turn out. While a lot of loose ends are tied from the previous seasons, even more questions are left open for the future seasons. This is intentional. This season also takes a bit more of a tragic/dark turn compared to the previous seasons as we witness death/equivalent occur to some characters. The story was engrossing and had me hooked like a crack addict every week waiting to get my ~26minute fix every week. Like previous seasons most of the episodes consist of the characters mainly talking around backgrounds or just with seizure inducing screen flashes of narrator thought processes. The story definitely gets a perfect from me. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nTypical Shaft artwork for the monogatari series thusfar. They had some creative OP and ED animations but nothing too surprising overall given their past seasons. A few of the episodes (especially the last one) had some sloppy and somewhat uninteresting artwork and backgrounds. The artwork wasn't as crisp as Nisemonogatari but it was still much more interesting than most other anime released. I suppose I am being stingy, but I am comparing Shaft to its previous work and being stingy :p\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs were all mostly spectacular and I enjoyed listening to them. I even downloaded Happy Bite, Kogarashi Sentiment and Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari to my phone to listen to on my daily commute. However the osts and various background sounds from the anime were nothing too special. They were mainly the same from previous seasons or slightly remixed. They still fit most situations brilliantly but they aren't anything too spectacular, perhaps because I have grown used to hearing them? Overall the sound was well done and I really shouldn't complain about it too much. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is HUGE in this season. We learn more about all of the characters and the narrators are all different people throughout the season. If you watched the season you know what I am talking about when I say one narrator completely wins the \"most interesting character\" award for the entire series really in just around 6 episodes. All the characters show a lot of their backstories and problems in ways not portrayed to us (in previous seasons). We laugh at their jokes, cheer for them during their struggles and cry when they fail or are in trouble. There are many emotional scenes throughout the season that can make you feel overjoyed or traumatized by the character's outcome. Overall the characters were brilliantly done and well flushed out. This season made a previously minor character (in my eyes) into one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nSaying I enjoyed this would be a understatement. I was addicted to this season and I am already feeling the withdrawal symptoms now that is over. It was well planned and the presentation/implementation was amazing. The characters and story altogether made for the best anime two seasons straight. S2 easily joins my top 5 anime and I can't wait for this to come out on Blu-Ray. This season officially converted me into joining the Monogatari Cult!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nI highly recommend you watch this. If you never jumped into the Monogatari series before now is the time to begin. Even if you dislike the first few seasons your opinion will change after watching this season.",

            "content": "(Minor Onimonogatari spoilers)\r\nMonogatari Second Season was a competent and decent followup in the Monogatari series. Since Second Season was split into 5 parts, so to shall this review. Do bear in mind that each part is of varying quality, hence, the average score may undermine how good some of the parts are.\r\nOf course, before I begin, given this is part of the Monogatari series, the animation quality is without a doubt superb. Shaft's surreal animation style works wonders for otherwise long and boring dialogue sessions. Off model characters are off putting though, and it seems that off model characters do appear more often particularly inthe Onimonogatari arc.\\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari Shiro : Tsubasa Tiger -\\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari focuses its story on Hanekawa Tsubasa, now with short hair and no glasses! This arc's quality was fairly decent. Though it did dip a fair bit near the end. Hanekawa's interactions with the aberrations and the revelation on the true identities of said aberrations were well done. The resolution to this arc was quite poor though, as Hanekawa, despite growing stronger in terms of character, still requires the assistance of a secondary character for the arc to completely resolve. Not a fan of that approach and it does rub me off the wrong way. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nKabukimonogatari : Mayoi Jiangshi- \\n\\n\r\nDespite its title, this arc focuses more on Shinobu, where Mayoi herself is a plot device and her character isn't explored much. Definitely the weakest arc of the five. While we do learn quite a bit on the world that Monogatari takes place in, the characters simply aren't interesting enough to drive the plot. Shinobu comes across as whiny and unlikable throughout, and the serious moments are fairly cringe worthy and difficult to watch. Its ending was passable if not decent, but even that is not enough to save the whole mediocre arc.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari : Nadeko Medusa-\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest arcs in the series. This focuses on Sengoku Nadeko, the childhood friend brat of Araragi. Nadeko's character is simply fun to follow, and her being the Unreliable Narrator would mean that events in the arc are (slightly) distorted due to how mentally ill this girl is. The subversion to Nadeko's character is so well done, but is foreshadowed well back in Bakemonogatari so that it doesn't seem out of place. And the plot twist to this arc is magnificent, playing into the Unreliable Narrator trope and showcasing just how twisted and insane this girl is. For how much her seiyuu is typecasted into always losing innocent childhood friend roles, this change in character is simply magnificent and plays with audience expectations so well. The arc even ends with a lovely fake preview done by Nadeko, still narrating and still insane.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnimonogatari : Shinobu Time-\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to Kabuki, Oni focuses on Mayoi rather than Shinobu, who is also reduced to a mere plot device. Onimongatari is very heavy on world building ,giving great insight as to how the Monogatari world functions as well as leaving enough mysteries to keep the viewer interested in future installments. Character interaction is passable, borderlining on weak. Mayoi's sudden declaration of love felt so unnecessary  that it dampens the scene it takes place in, making an otherwise serious scene a tad bit cringe worthy. Still, it ended on a very high note, and I am very pleased with how they resolved the scene.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nKoimonogatari : Hitagi End-\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt the best and most entertaining arc of the five. Unlike the rest, this arc focuses squarely on Kaiki Deishuu, one of the most interesting characters to follow in the series. Taking place immediately after Otorimonogatari, it mainly revolves around Kaiki helping out Senjougahara on her problems. Kaiki's interactions with the characters are simply brilliant, and he definitely provides an insight to the world from a mature and realistic perspective, unlike the rest of the cast. The actual arc itself was extremely enjoyable, with plenty of twists and turns as well as insight into Kaiki's character. It's just a brilliant arc. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn fact if you wanna enjoy Second Season to the fullest, just watching Otorimonogatari and Koimonogatari is sufficient. The other arcs if anything dampen the overall quality of the entire season, so it's only the best course of action to just watch the two I just mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score\\n\r\n 7/10",

These voids become manifest in different characters throughout the show, where these characters get their own arcs, making for very remarkably well written stories with their own unique narrative, and nicely done within the same universe, still relating to an overarching theme with interweaving connections through our main character without losing their individual identity in their own, personal arcs. \r\nIt's really hardand weird to explain, but that's the best that I can manage.\\n\r\nIf I could explain it any other way, imagine a show where each character is one of the seven deadly sins, where the sins manifest as the characters' underlying natures when one of the characters is either unconscious or allows their negativity or void to come out.  \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it's a show on the negative aspects of our humanity that we all contain within us, addressing characters who have a stronger negative aspect than others, and it's done really well.",

            "content": "Monogatari Series: Second Season is the continuation of the series right after the events of Nisemonogatari. As a watcher of the previous seasons of Monogatari. I am happy to say that SHAFT continues to bring out its beautiful art style which is joined by its use of sound to create a strange but unique story in the anime.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe storytelling in the Second Season is slightly different then its previous seasons. As almost each arc is told by one of the supporting characters with the help of Araragi and Shinobu who are the main protagonists. Each specific arc in the series is told at differenttimes ranging from summer to winter season in the story. The story itself requires many to watch the previous seasons as the Second Season is fairly complex. The complex story is appealing as it usually surprises me in the ending of the arc. The Story in the Monogatari Series is truly unique as each arc is slowly united into another arc which show the outcome of the consequences that Araragi or another character makes. The pacing in the story is slow likes its previous season. The Season Season does not contain really any fanservice unlike Nisemonogatari except more of an occasional comedy while still maintaining its seriousness in the storytelling. I did not like that the Otorimonogatari arc was pushed aside to be resolved until another arc was finished. The second season was also missing the Hanamonogatari arc.  The ending of Season Season however was great as it paves the way for a new season in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe series excels very well in its unique art style and visuals. A lot of the visuals and scenery that were hand painted were beautifully incorporated into the anime. The art style is realistic as the illustration utilizes the light and shadows in the background to create a wonderful setting for the story without using too much color. I believe the art style fits the story as fine like its previous seasons. The art style was relatively the same quality as before. Near the end of the season the opening visual of the Koimonogatari arc seemed outdated and old. The backgrounds are definitely memorable as VOfan's illustration is very distinct in his paintings and drawings. The character designs were appealing along with the hair style. Each character looked different and special in their own style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters that were portrayed in the previous season fits the different characters great. I believe the voices actors were chosen to fit their typical role for the voices. The background music is a big key to the art and story of Monogatari. By using the beautiful art style and sound like the previous seasons it allows the series to set up a bright or gloomy setting for the story. The soundtracks enhanced the action scenes for the different arcs. The OST that was used in the anime is intriguing and I would probably listen to it when it gets released. The OP/ED always have been one of the best which changes every time a new arc starts or ends. The Nekomonogatari: Shiro, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari OP/ED were one the most notable and best in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nMany of the characters in Monogatari were well-rounded having a human flaw and strength. They all bare the traits of human nature. Some of the characters are either clever, manipulative, innocent, wise , selfish and brave in someway. The characters reacted in a realistic way; learning and understanding the problems that pop up in the story. I was not able to relate any of the characters together as they were all special in their own way. Some of the characters did deteriorate to the point where they were willing to risk anything to change the outcome and or hide their true intention. I believe it is fine for the characters to deteriorate as it will be interesting to see how it progress in the future seasons of the Monogatari Series.  Shinobu and Kaiki would be the foils for Araragi and Senjougahara in the series as play a strong support role in the last 2 arcs of the season. The main antagonist in the story had a open motivation which to some may seem insane or extreme, however we are told slowly on how the antagonist become this way near the end of the season which is realistic due to natural human behavior of being selfish. We are not really told much in the second season about Ougi Oshino but it seems most likely that the character is the second antagonist in the future. The supporting cast was just fine and perfect without it being overcrowed as Monogatari mostly focuses on the one  supporting character for each specific arc. The main character Koyomi Araragi is the most prominent and memorable character just like the in previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI believe many people will like this anime as the art and story arc are fascinating. I think non-anime/manga fans may like this anime for its unique style but some individual maybe discouraged due to the slow pacing. I might re-watch the entire series in the future if I read the light novel. I think re-watching the series will help me understand some of the information that I missed the first time. If they had complete Monogatari Series translated or straight from Japan I would definitely buy it because I love the story telling with the occasion comedy and action in Monogatari. The Monogatari Series is pretty memorable as it ended year on a good note.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nAs you can see, SHAFT continues to bring out a compelling anime series that will satisfy many of its fans with its great story and unique art/sound from the previous season.\\n",

Then, add to that, a lot of inner dialog that borders on the neurotic and you have a show that can become tedious to watch. However, there is a good payoff because the characters are interesting, as are the reveals at the end of each vignette. \r\nDo watch the series from the beginning (Bakemonogatari, Niseimonogatari, Monogatari) to fully understand and enjoy all the subplots.",

            "content": "A series as long as Monogatari typically loses a lot of the original energy and entertainment value as it progresses. With four iterations thus far, Monogatari shows no signs of letting up and I\u2019m happy to eat up whatever is thrown at me. While this season provides a lot of what made the previous seasons so successful, it also is plagued with some weaker arcs, some bad characters, and a loss of the character neutrality that I enjoyed so much in the previous seasons.\r\nFor those not in the know, Monogatari is a character driven harem/comedy and horror hybrid that centers on Araragi Koyomi and thegirls he picks up on his strange adventures. This second season further emphasizes the development of some of the best loved characters while throwing others on the backburner. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t see them, it\u2019s that they show up once in the series and are left forgotten for the rest.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story does do right, though, is focus on characters we want more of. This sounds pretty ridiculous considering I just condemned the show for not paying attention to certain characters, but let me explain. The first season and Nisemonogatari did a pretty good job of making every character in the series seem important in the grand scheme of things. Even if it were just a quick, pointless visit, Araragi would go to see them and the audience would feel like that character would come up at some point, for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nKanbaru, despite being talked about, is given no screen time but for one tiny scene. The same can be said of Araragi\u2019s sisters. I spent a lot of the series wondering what they were up to and trying to understand whether they were important to the plot any longer, or had been used to their fullest extent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not even my biggest problem with the story as far as presenting characters go.\\n\\n\r\nThis season doesn\u2019t emphasize the romance between Senjougahara and Araragi. It mentions it, and Senjougahara herself tries to protect it, but we\u2019re not seeing the two together. Why does this bother me? Because Araragi is fucking around with four or five other girls. In a harem-esque anime like this, it\u2019s imperitive to give some importance to the main romantic thread. Ignoring it completely instead of giving the audience some general sense of what is happening in that relationship makes us feel like it doesn\u2019t matter. And truthfully, the romance between Senjougahara and Araragi does matter. He is Senjougahara\u2019s everything and we get a lot of her side of things, but nothing on Araragi\u2019s end, nor any synthesis between the two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter relations and attention to them may be a little off, but the stories are good, right? This season doesn\u2019t just focus on Araragi, and gives us a look into the minds of some other characters. It starts with a new story concerning Hanekawa and her cat form, a pretty good story that addresses her insecurities and love problems. It continues to a time-traveling, apocalypse scenario. This story wasn\u2019t in any way my favorite. A whole lot of Sengoku in the third arc. It\u2019s not a bad arc, but it does have Sengoku in it\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWe finish it out with an arc concerning Shinobu that becomes really emotional in the end, and a final arc from the perspective of Kaiki, one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some issues pervading the story. The time travel arc, as I said, wasn\u2019t that great and I feel like anything concerning Shinobu is just exposition for the sake of exposition. She has a whole episode dedicated to her past that gives some perspective on her, but ultimately serves as nothing more than more plot explanation. Shinobu seems to be everyone\u2019s favorite character, but I don\u2019t think she has enough character to even give a damn about.\\n\\n\r\nI love the fact that this season jumps around but everything comes together. There are big time gaps that are filled later on and questions that are asked but not answered until another arc. It feels very natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s focus on the characters proper and not their place in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSengoku is still one of the worst characters ever. The resolution to her problems is ridiculous, her intentions and motives are idiotic, and she\u2019s overall a piece of crap who should have died.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu, as stated, is nothing but loli exposition.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode and Gaen are characters who\u2026just don\u2019t have a place, especially Episode. I don\u2019t think Gaen was very interesting either, though I can see her and Episode playing bigger roles later on.\\n\\n\r\nOther than them, the other characters are all really good. There is a large enough range of characters that you can find a favorite. The inclusion of Ononoki is a good choice and she provides more added cuteness and the Yuki Nagato type character the series was lacking.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t go through a best girl game. No point doing it every time. This season\u2019s best girl is Hanekawa. Runner up is Ononoki.\\n\\n\r\nThough plagued with a variety of minor issues, Monogatari is still an enjoyable and highly watchable continuation of a series that doesn\u2019t seem to be losing any steam. It\u2019s animation, directing, writing, and characters are all (for the most part) top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nWith a new short series coming this year, as well as a film, there\u2019s no better time to pick up Monogatari  and give it a whirl.",

            "content": "(8.0/10)\r\nThis isn't Bakemonogatari. This definitely isn't Nisemonogatari. \r\nIn its second season, the show i've struggled with coming to terms with (see my Bakemonogatari review for more information) has changed completely. \r\nPerhaps its my willingness to \"go along\" with whatever the show will throw at me, but i felt significantly less confused watching this new show. There was no more \"Uhh... that 12 year old girl is naked and i don't even know how to feel about what's going on.\" Or, \"so these characters are terrible right? They're tropes. Cliches. Bullshit. Then how come I like them so much?\" \r\nNo more. Instead, the show builds uponits predecessor, Bakemonogatari, as if it was simply the groundwork for the show to come. This is the building that the creator wanted to build and Bakemonogatari served as simple introduction to almost every single character that gets used in this series. \\n\\n\r\nWith my confusion gone and my wits about me, I quickly noticed just how many things changed with the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFan service - GONE\\n\\n\r\nAction - GONE\\n\\n\r\nPervasive Animation - GONE\\n\\n\r\nA lot of what made this show what it was has slowly drifted away and what we have left is a show wearing the skin of its predecessor. Or so I thought. \\n\\n\r\nI won't be breaking up this review like my original Bake/Nise-monogatari review, separating all the different categories. Instead i'll simply go over my general thoughts with four different parts. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIf Nisemonogatari was the show at its most indulgent, this season felt like it was the show at its least indulgent. Especially when it comes to fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nI never thought i'd say this, but after the first arc I found myself missing it, too. Not because I wanted to bop the balogna to the creator's specific fetishes. But because it certainly added a... feeling to the show.\\n\\n\r\nI described Bake and Nisemonogatari as exploitative, gross, sleazy, sexist, beautiful, fascinating, memorable, and confusing. A lot of the time i felt like I was watching something that I should feel bad about watching. I felt like i was both becoming everything i hated, but also understanding a little more about myself. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a really unique experience. The second season, I didn't. There was structure, storytelling, fucking EXPOSITION. It baffled me. I hated it at first. \\n\\n\r\nI want my god damn sleazy guilty pleasure back! Until I began understanding the direction. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 1] : The First Arc & Change\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, the first arc of this second season was awful. In fact, it was so horrible that i found myself longing for the days of Nadeko's first arc, where she was sexually assaulted by an invisible snake for the entire episode. \\n\\n\r\nIn this first arc I saw my absolute favorite character twist and contort into an amalgamation of writing that was attempting character growth, while not showing it at all. \\n\\n\r\nAt risk of massive spoilers (but still be warned), the entire story was about overcoming something and not needing anyone to help you. To fight your own battles, in a way. Even the theme song asked the protagonist \"not to wait for a prince to save you from your castle.\" \\n\\n\r\nSo while the story was predictable, it would have still been fine for character growth. Instead the writer chose to completely ignore everything they were building up to and have the protagonist of the story get saved from everything she was trying to fight against... and if that wasn't enough salt rubbed in the wound, she was then treated like some fucking barn animal and patted on the head for being a 'good girl', or some shit. \\n\\n\r\nWhat. \\n\\n\r\nFor once I felt like the show's innate focus was on the story and they BLEW it. The character left with a shoddier character design, a worse personality, and worst of all, changing very little. It was a bad episode. Most likely my least favorite. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAfter this disaster of a first arc I began to harbor reservations for what this show is going to have in store for me in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nThere were multiple things clear. The three things i listed above being completely nixed from the show, as well as the fact that the show was generally not remotely as happy as it was in Bake/Nisemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nSince the writer/s want to tell a serious story, they decided to take out a lot of the comedy. I once again never expected to say this about anime but this is one of the few animes that actually has made me laugh. So that was another disappointing change they made.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I got instead was a five episode arc ruining my favorite character, with slow, meta dialogue that constantly refers to the well-being of the missing main character - who, in this scenario, was being used as a vessel to talk about the audience. \\n\\n\r\nIn one of the shows more extended scenes in this first arc, the two titular girls in this episode decided to bathe together for the sake of Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi being the viewer. The show was handing us a fanservice scene. Maybe that's why I had so much issue with it? Maybe it was a clever way of foreshadowing that nothing in this show is like the previous season? Regardless, it felt strange, and thinking back on it I find myself marveling at the fact that the writer and creator was kind enough to tell us that, \"Yeah, Nisemonogatari was a mistake, here, have this story.\" \\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nTalking about characters, lets talk Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nIn Nise he recieved a small overhaul. Instead of acting as more of a straight-man and self-insert, he instead was given a bit more of a playful personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by playful I mean sexual assault-y. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi went as follows : Self-Insert>Lover boy>Pedophile\\n\\n\r\nIn that order. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, i prefer pedophile over blank slate. So i was fairly happy with the fact that at least he now has a presence on screen and isn't just overshadowed by the vastly superior supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhile they definitely toned down the creepy ass pedophilic Araragi, what we got was a more brooding and serious Araragi, which fit this more dialogue-indulgent shows second season.\\n\\n\r\nHe still was a pedophile though, in the most basic sense anyway. The dude gropes and kisses every underage girl in the show at least at some point.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 2] : Episodes\\n\\n\r\nSo with that out of the way, I was definitely skeptical. I don't know what I got myself into, and not in the intriguing way. I was just hoping they wouldn't ruin another one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nOh look, my other favorite character's episode is right after the first arc!\\n\\n\r\nJoy. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________\\n\\n\r\nGoing into the second arc i was uneasy. But i was pleasantly surprised that i was greeted with more shinobu/Araragi chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nBut now that this show has ditched trying to be a parody of romantic comedies, it now has to focus on being a drama. I have to judge it on its ability to tell a dramatic story.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of exposition in the first episode of this second arc was a bit jarring to anyone that has seen Bake/Nise, but not jarring if you've seen any other anime ever. \\n\\n\r\nSo that's fine. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thankfully, the story itself was a drastic change from the more boring, character-ruining story that came previously. \\n\\n\r\nIt was also probably the most \"out there\" story, as it didn't feel grounded in the world around the characters from the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the story was engaging and showed that the show has gotten back to a \"new normal\", as a call it. It returned to form, but the form that it returned to isn't a show that's similar to the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nNo character ruined.\\n\r\n_________________________\\n\\n\r\nWith that settled, the arc after was even better. It acted as my favorite arc at the time. They managed to take one of the least remarkable characters in the show and change her setup from the first season into a full-fledged story in the second. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, the episode had a bit more laughs, as well as a more interesting story. I felt the show began to blend its more indulgent half from season 1, and its more focused half with season 2. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe penultimate arc was another detour from the norm, with an absolutely staggering amount of exposition. Specifically the second episode, which was where the show was at its most boring. It was literally just a scrolling still image. \\n\\n\r\nBut boring doesn't necessarily equal unnecessary, and it set up the conclusion of the arc nicely with what was the second season at its more heartfelt. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a melancholy end and I appreciated the shows maturity when the credits rolled. \\n\\n\r\n____________________________\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last arc, to be blunt, was spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nThe final arc helped me come to terms with the shows change, and actually appreciate it. I don't think the show in its more Bake/Nise form would have been able to tell Hatagi End arc in a convincing way. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, much like a lot of this seasons episodes, the focus of this arc wasn't really Araragi. This made room for more character developement and a really well thought out story with an absolutely shatteringly good ending. \\n\\n\r\nI adored these episodes, they were by far the best episodes of the season and the best arc of the show. Combining the storytelling chops that the show has been building up with very pretty animation, likable and increasingly interesting characters, and a narrative that I can't wait to see more of. \\n\\n\r\nIt solidified this second series as being a step above the first, even if it was almost nothing alike. \\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 3] : Beast\\n\\n\r\nMonagatari Series : Second Season was a wildly different beast than the first. Apart from its first arc, it was generally solid throughout and didn't have filler. \\n\\n\r\nThe show no longer has fanservice and while i still maintain that the absolutely crazy mother-of-all-fanservice first season was necessary, I've grown to really think the second one is an evolution. \\n\\n\r\nIts almost as if the creator was working tirelessly to rid the show of the glaring mistakes from the first season, and he mostly succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nThe final arc determined that the show was here to tell a story now. You are to be invested in these characters, not because they're adorable lolis half the time, or restrained tsunderes, or whatever other trope I'm not weab enough to know the name of yet... but because they're engaging characters.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose that's the struggle with this show now. I had such a hard time judging the characters from the first season, it feels almost unnatural to just think of them as characters now. Characters like any other, in a show that's a bit more structured, while maintaining a distinct style that I haven't seen in animation before. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe combination of crazy trope-based characters in the first season and the more realized characters in the second makes an interesting commentary on character portrayal in any television show. \\n\\n\r\nMixing these two aspects together is very strange, and it creates a very memorable experience. \\n\\n\r\n_________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIf you are to take one thing from this review, and maybe my Bake/Nise review I wrote before this, its that i've come to terms with a medium I was never really into before. \\n\\n\r\nThat medium being anime. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like with this show, i've went through a character arc. Now i don't know if it was remotely as interesting as a few that happened this second season, but its important for me as someone wanting to make television in the future. \\n\\n\r\nI'll attempt to sum it up here. \\n\\n\r\n____________________________\\n\\n\r\n[BONUS PART] : My Arc\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe country, genre, or medium a piece of entertainment is created in does not dictate whether its good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nI've realized that now and i feel stupid that I didn't before.\\n\\n\r\nI hold a grudge against anime for being so \"escapist\", so \"self-pleasing\", so \"masturbatory\" in the most unnatural way. Its something that's made to please a demo. To get blue-ray sales, to sell as many figurines/merchandise. \\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't tell you whether the medium is good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nIt instead just means the medium experiences massive content bursts. Unlike western television, there are upwards of fifty anime's a season. Each one having that goal. \\n\\n\r\nThe determining factor of quality is time. \\n\\n\r\nIt always was time, and it always will be time. What lays in time is effort, talent, and refinement. \\n\\n\r\nAnything can be good and engaging if those principles are thrust upon it. \\n\\n\r\nThe creators and animators have put the time into any television show, its chances of being something a lot of people remember skyrocket. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________\\n\\n\r\nI feel like if this show did anything it allowed me to realize this. \\n\\n\r\nI just hope I see more things that get time put into them. It doesn't matter if its romance, action, adventure, or comedy. Monogatari proves that any kind of genre can be good with time. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________\\n\\n\r\nThat's my wrap up, I hope you enjoyed the read and if you did and haven't watched the second season of this show, I highly recommend it. I haven't seen anything like it before.\\n\\n\r\nPeace, Peace!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It is rare to find anime that use the medium to its full potential. Anime can use multiple aspects of its visuals, sound and dialogue to tell a story and present information to us. Anime producers often don\u2019t bother or can\u2019t afford to use things like movement, transitions or perspective to help tell their story. The Monogatari Series has always been a great example of how to use the full potential of anime to tell a story and the Monogatari Series: Second Season continues to impress.\r\nThis review is written for a reader who has already watched the previous installments in the series and may containsome spoilers. I recommend watching the previous seasons before reading the rest of this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series is renowned for its exceptional use of visuals to help tell the story. Scenes are always evolving with the characters, events and dialogue to show the character's impression of the situation as well as how they are feeling. Rather than telling us a character's thoughts through needless exposition. The use of flash screens makes a return. These flash screens work fantastically for delivering us information quickly without breaking the dialogue. The flash screens are often used to overload us with information so we only get an impression of what the character might be thinking. The use of both constantly evolving scenes and chaotic presentation of information drags us into the character's head and immerses us in the scene.\\n\r\nThe second season upholds the quality of visuals set by the series and improves upon some areas. There are several sequences of exposition that use imagery and transitions rather than just showing us the character talking. This is fantastic delivery and gives us a more in depth look into what they\u2019re saying.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area that the Monogatari Series likes to experiment with is sound. There are frequent dramatic sound effects and changes in voice mixing to help emphasise what the characters are saying and doing. This sound design helps further pull us into a character's head and effectively communicates to us how they interpret events. The second season sports a solid score filled with the style of music we\u2019ve come to expect from the series. While there isn\u2019t much improvement from the previous season, it remains an effective use of sound design.\\n\r\nWithout realising it, the events of previous season are coloured by Araragi Koyomi\u2019s perspective. The second season features several story arcs that are told from different characters\u2019 perspectives. This changes the way locations appear and how characters behave. It\u2019s interesting and refreshing to see how the other characters interact with each other as well as how they solve their problems without Koyomi. This change in perspective allows us to experience the characters from another angle giving us better insight into who they are.\\n\\n\r\nThere has always been one issue I\u2019ve had with the Monogatari Series. A large amount of Monogatari featured casual discussions between characters and it doesn\u2019t always seem relevant to the current story. Some of the longer segments of dialogue drag on and often feel completely pointless. This combined with interesting distractions in the animation can often cause someone to completely lose the point of the conversation. This is often an issue for me when viewing the show because I occasionally lose interest. While this is less of an issue in the second season, it is still a prevailing problem. The stories have better pacing than previous seasons and most of the dialogue is relevant and interesting. However, there are still a few run-on conversations that I find frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two new recurring characters introduced in the second season. The first of which is Oshino Ougi who enters into the same highschool as Koyomi as his underclassman. She is an apparition specialist who claims to be the niece of Oshino Meme. She remains a mysterious character and it\u2019s never clear what her true intentions are nor if she is actually trying to help Koyomi and his friends.\\n\r\nThe second character is Izuko Gaen. Another apparition specialist who is said to know everything. She will often abuse her knowledge and others\u2019 lack of knowledge in an attempt to control the future. Again it is hard to tell if she could be considered an ally. \\n\r\nThese new characters don\u2019t have fleshed out stories and remain mysterious. However, they\u2019re used very well in several stories both giving us information and creating conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season continues to use dialogue to progress the story. Rather than having characters simply reacting to what is happening around them, everything is discussed and debated. This style of storytelling benefits highly from the diverse characters the series has established. Each character has a different style of approaching problems and different methods of communication that reflect their character. Not only are the characters interesting but they are used well throughout the series to create conflict and affect the way each problem is approached.\\n\r\nThis dialogue heavy storytelling can be detrimental to the pacing of the show. Dialogue often drags on and can bring the story to a halt. Overall, however, the pacing is much improved over the previous seasons and the story presented here is much more engaging for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is split into 5 arcs. The first of which, Nekomonogatari Shiro, is told from Hanekawa Tsubasa\u2019s perspective. By telling a story from her perspective we get a better understanding of her character when not viewed through Koyomi\u2019s eyes. We also get a different insight into how Hanakawa interacts with other characters and this is one of the more interesting aspects of this arc. Because of this, the arc has some of the best character development in the series and is a great start to the season.\\n\r\nFor the second arc, Kabukimonogatari, we switch back to Koyomi\u2019s perspective for a story with Oshino Shinobu. This story challenges Koyomi\u2019s ideals and the way in which he understands the world. There is some great development for both Koyomi and Shinobu and shows how they may not truly understand the full effect of their powers and actions.\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari is the third arc which has another perspective shift, this time following Sengoku Nadeko. I found this arc to be the weakest of the 5 as it features some poor storytelling. The story itself was not the problem, it was more a problem of how information is presented. I would go into more details but it would spoil the story. However, the story is important setup for future arcs and it is interesting to see how Nadeko sees things and how people behave towards her.\\n\r\nIn the fourth arc, Onimonogatari, we switch back to Koyomi who is joined by Hachikuji Mayoi, Ononoki Yotsugi and Shinobu. The cast are troubled by an unknown presence and we get to see how they approach the situation. This arc is very dialogue heavy and has some of the more interesting conversations in the season. The way the characters debate what the presence is and how to deal with it is very well done and really brings out each girl's differing characteristics.\\n\r\nFinally we have Koimonogatari. Probably the strongest arc in the whole of the Monogatari Series thus far. We follow Deishuu Kaiki\u2019s perspective, once again seeing characters from a new perspective which gives us new insights into the characters and world. The pacing is what made this arc so strong; the story is driven by new information and each episode is very compelling.\\n\r\nOverall the different arcs work well together and their timelines become apparent during each arc. There were no noticeable plot holes and each issue was resolved or at least setup to be resolved in a future season. The storytelling in the second season is a big step in the right direction for the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series continues to demonstrate the full potential for storytelling when working with anime. Even if you don\u2019t like the series it is easy to appreciate the way they use the medium. The second season is a large improvement over previous seasons so it is a must watch for any fans of the series.\\n\r\nI hope other anime produces are inspired by the Monogatari Series and, in future, try to fully utilize the medium to tell their story.",

I mean where was Araragi the whole season? Nadeko kind of just became the most pathetic type of yandere ever. The Hanekawa arc was such a bland and boring way to start the season. The one girl just knows everything to ever happen anywhere ever just because she knows?\r\n      This season featured some of the absolute worst writing I've ever witnessed. The traditional monologues wereboring, the logic was broken, and the characters where all needlessly deceptive and sneaky. I mean if you have to say something just say it, please. No one ever just says what they're thinking in this season.\\n\\n\r\n       I mean maybe it was always that bad, but at least we had Araragi to speak his mind before. This season really just felt like they wrote out whatever they felt like with zero thought, then wrote some random lines trying to tie the terrible writing all together.\\n\\n\r\nI give Monogatari Season 2 a 5/10 overall.",

            "content": "Stories. \r\nEveryone wants to hear or tell a story people will remember by. It doesn\u2019t matter if the story is fictional, realistic, sarcastic, humorous, imaginative, mysterious, psychological, speculative, or even twisted as it can be. Stories are created by ideas that are formed from the very thoughts we experience in our lives. In order for stories to be told well, they have to evoke feelings, reactions, and attract audience that appreciates its ideas. Monogatari Second Series - the anime that not only attracted me to its franchise - but also presented it in an extravagant way that takes the art of storytelling to a wholenew level. \\n\\n\r\nThat level of storytelling was already clearly evidenced from its predecessor that achieved international success. Yes, I\u2019m talking about Bakemonogatari that debuted back in 2009. Its success has later spawned other series in the forms of Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari: Kuro, and the soon-to-debut Kizumonogatari . Now, it\u2019s back once again as an ongoing story narrative. Monogatari Series: Second Season is an anime adapted from the novel of the same name written by Nisio Isin with artwork by Vofan. If you\u2019re a fan of the previous Monogatari series franchise, then this should be no shadow of a doubt be part of your watch-list as we are told stories at its most definite form.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to what some people might notice in the past, the Monogatari series presents itself in an unique form of storytelling. The term \u2018monogatari\u2019 itself defines as literature. For a series based on storytelling to succeed though usually requires a character base with insightful plot, creative setting, descriptive ideas based on connections, and a strong literal sense of execution. Monogatari series plays on most of these concepts but constructs it like an experiment. Whether you dare to take on the experiment might have different experiences. However, there\u2019s no doubt that this series and its franchise has tested their experiment and succeeded in their message. Indeed, the storytelling of Monogatari mixes itself with visual arts and dialogues. The strength of the series comes from its dialogues that creates humor, sense, and might evoke people\u2019s minds to think its true meaning. Most of the time, the meaning of the dialogues are metaphoric and conveys to many ideas. Its usage of word plays presents its unique art style to attract viewers toward its messages. Through these messages, viewers will find out just how exclusive this shows\u2019 storytelling separates itself from most forms of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nMonogatari Series: Second Season isn\u2019t just about storytelling though. As mentioned before, a strong character cast will attract viewers to almost any form of genre. Luckily, this show has plenty of that starring our Koyomi Araragi, a high school student whose life has changed forever after a certain incident. Obviously, I would assume that you have seen the original Bakemonogatari to understand this but Araragi makes his return in this sequel. He makes his presence well known as other characters in the series speculate him as many things - a lolicon, dangerous, pervert, just to name a few. However, we know that Araragi is a character of loyalty as seen through his relationship with Hitagi Senjougahara. More importantly though, he is also protective towards others including his friends, family, and even strangers. Some of his actions might be interpreted in the wrong way by other characters but the guy definitely has proven many times that he is the type that others can depend on. He seeks to achieve the endings that allows characters live in peace. However, this often puts a burden on himself as Araragi finds that sometimes, he can\u2019t achieve everything alone. This even puts his own lives at risk many times. But hey, he is that type of that guy that takes risks. From a narrative perspective, his actions are often awarded although he doesn\u2019t always takes everything for granted. Instead, he keeps his more of the \u2018it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2019 attitude. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting characters from the novels makes their appearances in the story arcs including Tsubasa Hanekawa, Mayoi Hachikuji, Suruga Kanbaru, Nadeko Sengoku, Shinobu Oshino, and Hitagi Senjougahara. All these characters plays their different roles that fulfills some sort of theme or morality to its title. Each of these titles present a different insight on our characters as we see a sort of journey to embark on. And of course, every journey begins with the first step. There\u2019s already trouble in the beginning as we get a hint of supernatural madness going on. To make matters worse, Tsubasa herself finds trouble with her life as sudden changes occurs. \\n\\n\r\nThe first story arc initially reintroduces its narrative aspect to get viewers to familiarize themselves the format of how Monogatari works. Its supernatural themes takes on a more gruesome turn later on but there\u2019s also hope and prosperity. As for the other arcs, each of them has a different theme and plot. Some of these arcs also explores the back stories of our supporting characters. Along with that, there\u2019s character interactions that are dynamic with development. Additionally, each arc contains a similar style of storytelling through word plays, visual presentations, and dialogues. As the series contains supernatural elements as well, expect legends to unfold and discoveries to be made. These include spirit apparitions, vampires, mythic cats, and even Gods. The power of its dialogues enhances the experience with the power of its words. It\u2019s an experience you won\u2019t forget especially with some plot twists like one with a snake a girl.\\n\\n\r\nJudging on another level of the series is its humor. The style of Monogatari invokes humor in a sense that is quite peculiar. By peculiar though, I mean it as as a brilliant way because the show likes to experiment. Its stylish dialogues often mixes in parodies of other genres and themes for experimentation. These accompanied with the expressions of our characters creates a lavish theater of animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs good as the series sounds, there\u2019s a few aspects I found to be lacking. Namely, there\u2019s perhaps a bit of too much fan service in the beginning that can be distracting. These don\u2019t seem to have any meaning or dynamics and sometimes may distract viewers from the words play and dialogues. Other times, Araragi\u2019s interactions with some of the other characters might even seem a bit creepy or hard to take for granted. This is especially true in one of the later arcs involving Shinobu that takes itself to a rather defiled way with their interactions. More importantly is the fact that the show sometimes likes to get a bit carried away with its conversations. Some of them might even drag on with small talk that can seem to be mundane. Other times, they flash way too fast to be read that can frustrate viewers in attempting to fully understanding its meaning. (if it has one at some occasions) Finally, there are some recap episodes between each story arc that drags the series together. They might help refresh a bit of its previous predecessors but can also be a waste of time for people who wants the series to accelerate itself. \\n\\n\r\nShaft handles the production of this series. You know what that means right? If extraordinary is a word that just popped into your mind, then you\u2019re on the right track. By that term, Shaft is known to pull out a variety of series over the past year that have impacted the world. Names such as EF: A Fairy Tale of the Two, Arakawa Under the Bridge, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica are just a few that comes to mind. The artwork of Monogatari is in a sense that can be both visually attractive and descriptive the same time. When not presented as comedy, they hold a deeper meaning or metaphor behind them. Other times, they are connected to the dialogues spoken by the characters to convey their thoughts and feelings. Speaking of characters, most of them are designed in a similar way as their predecessors. Araragi still has that noticeable hair-like antenna sticking out of his head while his girlfriend still retains her haircut. Other characters like Shinobu, Nadeko, and Tsubasa all possesses artistic traits similar to their supernatural counterparts. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, the series maintains an eerie like atmosphere. During more of the climatic scenes, the series shifts its gears to a more dramatic tone with explosive entrances and executions. Other times, the series likes to keep its more balanced atmosphere along with comedic vibrations. The soundtrack might not be the most powerful device of the show but its various OP & ED songs makes up this department with its various styles. Almost every arc has a different song accompanied by the voice involving the star of that story. Similar to its word plays, they contain a pattern of artistic visuals to brings out the power of its orchestra. With its cast members also lies in the strength of their voices. Almost every characters demonstrates this with their voice mannerisms. These include the cunning Shinobu (Maaya Sakamoto), the kuudere Senjougahara (Chiwa Saito), innocent Nadeko (Kana Hanazawa), the mature Tsubasa (Yui Horie), the playful sisters of Karen and Tsukihi, and Araragi (Hiroshi Kamiya). Because the narrative aspect of the show is so strong with the dialogues, it is important to characterize each of their voices as a focus in order to bring out their best. And yes, I am grateful that these characters all bought forth their best thanks to the talents of their voice actor/actresses.\\n\\n\r\nSo,this anime might not be for everyone. That\u2019s something I\u2019m sure most people have heard about the Monogatari franchise before. But if you pass this up for whatever reason, I still would recommend at least giving the first arc a try. That way, it might refresh a bit of experience of what you get out of the other series. However, I highly recommend watching this series only after you have completed its previous predecessors to gain full experience of its presentation. The Monogatari franchise has already achieved universal success thanks to its unique narrative, powerful dialogues, artistic word plays, and unique characters. Its humor will knock you out with high doses of laughter accompanied by its strange twist of stories. It even has bits of action too so violence is not out of the question there for fans looking for some intensity. (that and maybe its goal of achieving anemia with its fan service.) But all in all, Monogatarai series definitely took on the storytelling concept like never before creating an enjoyable experience. Now that is the ecstasy of success. \\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHonestly, I'm surprised... surprised I was able to make it through to the end of this show.  \r\nI'm afraid the long, unnecessary, drawn out conversations that constitute this entire series are a severe test of my patience. More on this in a bit. Due to this being the sole emphasis, the characters should be crucial right?\r\nWell quite frankly there is only one good character in the show, and this guy ends up being the true hero. He is the only character I like. To avoid spoilers... I'll just say, to my severe disappointment, that it doesn't end well.  \r\nThe restof the main characters are immature, irrational  imbeciles. Sorry, but I hate tsunderes or whatever Senjougahara's personality is. Aragagi is as bad as any typical shounen protagonist who thinks he can save everyone. The only difference is that's he's a pedophile, not that really I care about that detail in particular - that's not even one of the things I hate about him. I hate the fact that every girl falls in love with him, when there's really nothing special about him. Is it that he's such a goody-two-shoes?  You can find white knights everywhere. His existence itself is probably the main reason I hate Senjo - the fact that she loves someone like him, that she's willing to die for this guy who doesn't understand anything. I don't remember much from Bakemonogatari as I saw it like 5 years ago, but to my recollection the only reason she's given is that it's because \"he is who he is\" or some vague bullshit like that. Yeah, whatever. Ignoring the fact that Hanekawa loves him too, she to me is a soulless creature, a vanilla. If you watch, it's well documented in those oh-so-long conversations as to why that is, in my opinion. I'm trying to put this in a nutshell because describing how I really feel about these people would require a long-winded essay each. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know; maybe Nisio Ishin doesn't intend for these people to be likable. For those of you who don't know, apparently the writer likes to intentionally make main characters who are unlikable and unrelatable. I\u2019ve learned this from reading Medaka Box. If so, considering the ending and all the implications... he's pretty good at that. Pretty deep stuff, I'll give him that.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to those conversations - those endless dialogues between characters that I don't particularly even like.\\n\\n\r\nTake the very first episode for example. Hanekawa meets a tiger. Then her house burns down. Then she gets yelled at by Senjo. Three significant things happen. None of them take very long - around a couple minutes each. That's what like 6 - 10 minutes on the meat of the plot? The rest of the 20-minute episode was spent having unnecessary conversations and soliloquies. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I'm well aware that that some of this banter leads to some important plot conclusions later. But too much of it is trivial and could easily be shortened without losing anything other than the weird fan-service or whatever it is that so much effort is spent on. The interaction between Hanekawa and Senjo that centers on taking a shower together at the end of the episode goes on for several minutes and well into the next episode. Then it gets even worse - only one thing truly necessary to the plot that happens is another short sighting of the tiger. I mean the majority of an episode is some long drawn-out, redundant small talk. Overall the first arc, 5 long episodes, could easily be shortened to one or two episodes. Most of the show is like this.\\n\\n\r\nWe're getting to my point on why this is the main problem with this show. It's not like I wasn't paying attention to all this dialogue. Rest assured. I weathered the storm, waiting patiently for some meaning, some payoff, hanging on to nearly every word. Because naturally I'm always curious as to what is the point. What is the conflict? What is the goal? It's hardly ever obvious in this show when it's there at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn a later arc, an episode begins with Araragi and a mysterious creature named Ougi having a conversation about traffic lights. This takes around. four. whole. minutes. Why is this a problem? Well, this conversation is happening for one of three reasons apparent to me:\\n\r\n- It's leading up to something important to the plot.\\n\r\n- It's some kind pretentious symbolism.\\n\r\n- It's part of that weird fan-service or whatever it is that draws people to this show that I don't fully understand.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it doesn't really matter which of these three possible reasons this is conversation is happening, because on the surface it's a pointless conversation. On the surface, I don't know why they are having this conversation. On the surface, it's a long drawn out conversation about nothing, leading to nothing until way later. That is if it leads to anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is that if most of the time I'm listening to long seemingly pointless conversations waiting for an eventual meaning, then watching this show has become a chore. It has become a job filled with boredom and ennui. Because it's not like many of these conversations are particularly fascinating. This is why the \"four whole minutes\" I emphasized about the traffic lights example doesn't seem very long in retrospect, but it felt very, very long. The vague connection with this traffic thing doesn\u2019t show up until a while later. And this kind of thing happens often in this show.\\n\\n\r\nI will say in fairness, the plot was there. And it was mildly interesting. The time travel and the last arc were kind of alright. But it almost felt like the plot just was a backdrop for... conversation porn... because on the surface this is a show about people who stand around talking. I understand why this is. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is based on light novels. And this situation might work well in books, but it doesn't work very well on screen. In an attempt to keep it interesting and dress up the fact that people are just standing around talking all the time, the animators even feel the need to flood the screen with constant camera angle shifts, queer poses, flashy patterns and loops, and surreal art. It gets old and irksome pretty fast.  I\u2019ll admit that some of the dialogue, mainly the dialogue that unsubtly advanced the plot, was interesting. There wasn't enough of this kind.\\n\\n\r\nThe important thing though is that the plot is a backdrop for the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, all described and analyzed in vivid detail by all these conversations and soliloquies. The important thing is that, small talk aside, the significant dialogue places that much greater emphasis on all their awful traits. That is why this show, why these people left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t enjoy this show because it started out badly with *very* slow pacing and ended badly with a frustrating ending in my opinion, ruining what little redemption it could have had.  Yeah, I\u2019m aware this series is probably not over. But I also didn\u2019t enjoy it because I didn't care for most of the protagonists, and there was simply too. much. talking. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cAfter nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world.\u201d \r\n-Phillip Pullman\r\nOn that note, the second season (although technically third or fourth depending if you count Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari) of the Monogatari Series was promised to be a two cour delivering viewers the excellent experience that the first season, Bakemonogatari, did. Rest assured that if you enjoyed Bakemonogatari, you will not be disappointed by the second season. \r\nStory: (10/10): Monogatari S2's story is the driving point of the anime itself, the beating heart at its core. The storytelling in this anime is top notch, as it is an almost completelydialogue driven anime. If you don't like characters sitting down and fleshing things out, exploring the facets of their inner thoughts, strengths and flaws, then you might not enjoy this season. However, assuming that you watched the first season, you probably would have already figured out whether the Monogatari Series was right for you or not. Needless to say if it is for you, you're in for a treat. The story covers additional stories for Hanekawa, Hachikuji, Shinobu, Nadeko and Kaiki. Most of the characters from the original series make an appearance, although there is a bit of absence of Kanbaru. Shaft's unique way of organizing the anime leaves the free flowing story to explore the great characters within the story, as well as progress through the life of our lively MC, Ararararararagi. All the arcs seem to have different flavors to them, some being more action oriented, others being a lot more explorative, and some very emotional. Shaft has done an excellent job of succeeding the original series, as the viewer truly never finds themselves disappointed by the story aspect of Monogatari. The arcs only get better and better, leaving with a truly memorable experience in the final arc (Koimonogatari) which I'll leave you all to discover for yourselves. The fact of the matter, or the conclusion rather is that on the story basis, Monogatari is outstanding, and it makes me sad that I won't be able to experience the great storytelling until a hopefully additional season comes out. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10): The art in Monogatari S2 is very much like its predecessors. The characters are all well defined, and all have unique aspects to them, however if you're someone who is very picky about animation and slick transitions, you might feel a little disappointed. Shaft cycles through animations during dialogue, zooming in and accentuating different nuances to the speaker's body. The famous slow motion head turn and zooming right into their face. It helps to keep the viewer enticed in the dialogue while they are talking, but other than that it does get repetitive. Besides that, the avant garde nature of some of the apparitions and environments (things made completely of Kanji) are always a treat, as the peculiarity only seems to add to the experience. That being said, since Monogatari S2 is such a dialogue based anime, this really isn't a problem. Besides that the transition slides usually have a bit of text, that you can choose to neglect or to pause and read, and people may find that annoying, although I didn't seem to mind it as much. As I mentioned before, if you don't like the way the art and animation is done, you probably would have figured it out in the earlier seasons. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10): The sound in Monogatari S2 is great at doing what it was made to do. Complimenting dialogue with a good soundtrack is very difficult. Fortunately, it's done very well in Monogatari S2, as you will find that what would have been a more stale conversation is brought to life a bit more by the beautiful pieces in the soundtrack. The OPs and EDs are some of the best I've seen, as the music is always great, as it was in the previous seasons. There's a few clips of ambient sounds when transitioning to other scenes, but they only add to the experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10): The characters in Monogatari S2 really help define what the anime is like. Since it is a storytelling anime, the storytellers should be interesting as to keep the viewers interested as well. Luckily the unique set of characters we have are very well defined and interesting to the end. One of the great parts of Monogatari S2 is the way that it highlights the flaws of people fundamentally. This is through the apparitions that they get latched onto, as the apparitions themselves target weakness and the vulnerable. You have a cast of characters who all have their unique flaws, but all find ways to get through it, and that is the beauty and joy that you will experience through the expert storytelling of Shaft. As expected, the character development is very good, as there are plenty of learning experiences of the characters as they tell their stories. You will grow more attached to your favorite characters, and learn to understand the characters that you don't like as much. The beauty is, there's plenty of choices. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10): Frankly speaking, Monogatari S2 was a very enjoyable experience for me. I loved Bakemonogatari, and watching the series finally get back on track with a two cour season was a delight for me. Picking up on the nuances of the dialogue, and watching the characters retell some amazing stories really never gets old for me. Since this is a sequel, I'll word it like this. If you liked Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari or Nekomonogatari, you will find something to appreciate in Monogatari S2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As 2013 winds down, Monogatari Series: Second Season serves as one of the highlights of the year, allowing fans of the series to rejoice once more in Shaft's excellent work in creating an atmosphere and story truly unparalleled. You will feel for the characters, you will laugh with the characters, and you will cry with the characters through their toughest and most jovial experience all told amazingly through clever dialogue and plot. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: A solid 9/10. There are some things that can't be explained in words, and I definitely recommend this season to fans of the previous ones.",

            "content": "Since the release of Bakemonogatari, the first part of Monogatari series, this unique show has been splitting the community in two parts, one side being the Monogatari fans, like myself, who threat it like a rare philosophical gem of the anime universe, and the other side which sees it as just another harem show that tries to cover the fanservice with some 'random' philosophy.\r\nBy writing this review, I want to show you my view on this show, not to force you to have the same opinion on it as I do.\r\nAs you are familiar with the series (I assume, since this is the review onthe SECOND SEASON of Monogatari series), I will skip the intro and get right onto what made me like this anime so bad, and that is definitely the creativity of the story, and the unique way of storytelling. Monogatari Series: Second Season is featuring five new stories (+ and additional Hanamonogatari) showing us, once again, how human mind can be sick and twisted. Nisio Isin is playing with endless possibilities of the universe he has created, as our heroes struggle in this psychological adventure. While the plot in Bakemonogatari was highly repetitive and stereotipical (where Araragi happens to run into a girl in trouble and helps her), Second season is way more creative. Each story is darker, deeper, and more f*cked up than the ones in Bakemonogatari, and through each story you can find a bit more about the characters, their past, relationships, and a mysterious connection with the supernatural entity, while being trapped in a twisted paranormal adventure.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there would be no story without the characters themselves, having in mind that everything happening in the show, is subconsciously created by the characters themselves. Through this philosophical masterpiece, you can see the protagonists of the Monogatari series in totally   different way, discover their backstories, dreams and fears, and even get inside of a parallel what-could-be universe. Also, you can see them changing due to all the paranormal happenings, both psychically and physically. Second Season can probably show the best interaction between the characters in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and the background music remain fantastic as they always were, since they are done by the SHAFT studio. The art is even better, and the animation is more fluid, which makes your personal enjoyment more a nd more superior. As the studio is getting used to the show, each segment is being more perfected. Atmosphere remains flawless, either if it is a horrific mystery scene, or the super-hot ecchi scene. It is so enjoyable, that I have finished the entire Second Season in three days.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that this show is not for all the audience, as it contains lots of mature content like gore and nudity, and it can sometimes be really hard to follow the story line, or to read the subtitle and watch the show at the same time. Also, the SHAFT's way of presenting and animating can be awkward at times, so it can easily cause a headache to ones unfamiliar with it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are fan of the series, and you happen to like it so far, I highly recommend you check this out, as it is by far the best Monogatari yet. If you are somehow reading this review and thinking about watching this series, you should first go check Bakemonogatari, and then find out whether you like it or not. And if you are in a not-so-small group of people that were not satisfied with the first one or two parts of the series, I still recommend you checking this one out, as you might change your opinion.",

            "content": "Even though it\u2019s been over half a year since I saw this anime, on impulse I decided that it was about time I said a few words about it, because I feel like I almost never see anyone ever talking about the \u201cother\u201d side of Monogatari and the quite clear problems the show has.\r\nNow before you instantly downvote this because I\u2019m not giving this the very highest score, I just want to clarify that I do not hate this show, nor do I think it is a bad one however there are a number of things that make it far from perfect in my eyes,and they are not spoken of all too often.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice when it comes to Monogatari (besides the wacky art style) is its choice of storytelling. Like so many other series out there, it is divided into many smaller arcs that together build up a grander overarching story. Roughly it goes something along the lines of:\\n\\n\r\n1) A girl gets possessed by an Oddity or at least has her life messed up by it in one way or another.\\n\r\n2) Araragi investigates the situation, and after some less than flawless work he manages to rescue the damsel in distress.\\n\r\n3) The girl is then blatantly tossed aside in order to return to the status quo so that the story can proceed unhindered to its next arc, starting over from step 1 again.\\n\\n\r\nSee that last part there? This is the source of most of the problems of the whole series, and quite frankly I find it to be quite disrespectful writing on the author\u2019s part. You know how people like to complain about the role Asuna was given in the second half of Sword Art Online? Well this is basically the same thing except it happens to almost every character in the entire show at least somewhere during the course of its progression.\\n\\n\r\nBasically what happens is that since every arc is about resolving the problems of one of its many heroines, as soon as that arc is over she no longer has any role at all for the next arc. Bar a few exceptions, the only relevant characters at any point in time of the story are Araragi himself, Shinobu (because she\u2019s stuck with him) and whichever girl who\u2019s arc it currently is (and perhaps some antagonist-like character as well). The rest of the cast basically gets ignored completely, and this is not a small cast we\u2019re talking about here, nor are the arcs all that short either. As a result, characters that might have appeared to be main characters at one point might completely disappear from the story for up to 20 episodes sometimes over the course of the seasons, (not discounting his supposed girlfriend) and that\u2019s not exactly a small amount of time for this type of anime. Consequently, Araragi and Shinobu are the only characters that are given consistent character development over the course of the show, whereas everyone else has theirs completely halted every so often.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not the kind of person who\u2019d get upset over the death of a main character, actually I think there\u2019s not enough of that in today\u2019s anime, however this is a completely different issue as the heroines are just pushed aside for no obvious reason for huge amounts of time. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re actually gone, they just\u2026 temporarily disappear.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know part of this problem stems from the fact that the arcs of the Monogatari Series aren\u2019t aired in the same order as they were written in the original Light Novels, and I understand that reading them might clear up a thing or two. However to me that is not really an excuse; an anime is its own product after all and should be able to deliver on consistent and easy-to-follow storytelling all on its own. You shouldn\u2019t have to go read the source material just to get the full experience of the anime; they\u2019re separate mediums for a reason after all.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said it of course doesn\u2019t hamper all the good sides of the series. The animation is completely crazy and very much so up to interpretation but I think it looks absolutely beautiful at least. The soundtrack is not particularly memorable but it has its moments and is certainly not bad. And as far as the enjoyment value goes (which is what really matters in the end), I generally find it very inconsistent and spiky. There are some segments and dialogues in it that are simply brilliant, but just as often I find myself tapping my fingers on my desk in impatience for the series to actually get going.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, there is still a little bit more to come from this series and I\u2019m still hopeful that the final part(s) will be able to tie the whole thing together in some way that makes it all feel connected and relevant, because currently I\u2019m sort of missing that part. It just feels like there\u2019s no clear goal regarding where the overarching story will end up and there are a lot of things to patch up and resolve before the eventual conclusion. I still think it can be done though and I hope the author can positively surprise me on this one, but as it currently stands I cannot make myself wholeheartedly approve of the direction this franchise has taken.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough if there is one thing you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s that the series sure as hell is unique, and that alone can take you quite a long way in today\u2019s industry.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s to a brighter future!",

            "content": "To live in a world with apparitions, what danger will Araragi face?\r\nThe Monogatari Series is one outstanding series. The light novel is well written and the animated series is beautiful. One important aspect of Monogatari Series is that there are many tropes and themes where viewers and readers can enjoy. Monogatari Series provide a variety of interest and it will make the audience want more. What is understandable is the fact that the underlying themes in Monogatari Series make the series stand out.\r\n\tOne theme that is shared throughout the series is random act of kindness. This theme is important because it shapes people psychologically. Theserandom acts of kindness can vary from giving directions to a stranger to saving a person\u2019s life. If a person is in need of help, it is best to help that person out. Even though there are more themes and tropes, they are all able to connect beautifully. Monogatari Series also have dark themes. These dark themes are used to portray reality and fantasy. To discover the truth behind the dark themes is to uncover the mystery behind apparitions. The saying goes: if there is light, there is also darkness.\\n\\n\r\n\tMonogatari Season Two is the continuation of Nisemonogatari. Studio SHAFT plans to animate the whole light novel. There will be a total of three seasons. Monogatari Season Two focuses on Nekomonogatari White, Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari, and Koimonogatari. These titles are significant because they relate deeply to the story. For an example, Kizumonogatari, Kizumono means \u2018damaged good\u2019, but also \u2018a woman who has been deflowered\u2019. Monogatari would mean story. Based off the title, it foreshadows the underlying dark theme. \\n\\n\r\n\tSince there is a sequel, the introduction of Monogatari Season Two provides a recap of what happened previously. The sequel started with Nekomonogatari White. Therefore, the story continued from Nisemonogatari time wise and a continuation of plot to Hanekawa in Nekomonogatari Black. Though, Nekomonogatari Black took place before Bakemonogatari. This may be confusing, but the timeline and plot is completely different. Araragi is helping out people with apparitions and it would be boring if the plot was to be linear. As the anime progress, characters have special appearance in certain situations. There are multiple characters and each character has their own arc. In short, each character is important to their respective arc. There are interactions among these characters even though they are not focused in these arcs. Although they are not focused, it gives insight to the character and provides development. What is given for sure is that this technique is smart and well used throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnimations are one reason to seek interest in an anime. If the art work is great and the animations are smooth, most people would tend to watch it because it is appealing to the eye. When it is appealing to the eye, it is easier to enjoy the anime and not complain. One reason that makes the Monogatari series good is because of Studio Shaft. Studio Shaft tends to make unique animations. Unique animations as in great camera view, amazing art work, detailed background and effects. There is also a gag where Studio Shaft likes to put their characters in a difficult head tilt. This is just for comedy purposes, but it is indeed interesting. This can be related to paintings as they have their own form of interpretation. Last but not least, the characters are very detailed, the transitioning is beautiful and the art is crystal clear.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs the story progress through, the characters adapt to changes. The adaption can be either negative or positive. It is truly boring to watch a static character. Seeing a dynamic character can trigger new events. Having a dynamic character allows the plot to be flexible and create suitable settings. This is important because Monogatari focuses on Araragi and apparitions. As Araragi progress throughout the story, he will learn and experience new information. This is also the same for any other characters in Monogatari. Since there are dynamic characters, there is a beautiful resolve. The resolve can be either a good ending or tragic ending. As characters face an obstacle, they would have to overcome the experience. The journey may be short or long, but the experience is all that matters.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe character of Araragi Koyomi is notable throughout the Monogatari series. His goal was to protect those who he cared for. To achieve these goals, he has to fight against apparitions and try to help the victims face reality. There are times where people tend to seclude themselves away from reality. Reality is definitely harsh and not pleasant for those who struggle. What makes human the superior race is that humans overcome their problems and advance forward. Throughout Monogatari Second Season, Araragi has starred in most of the arcs and made a huge impact on the plot. Besides the fact that Araragi is the main character, there are other characters that are significant.\\n\\n\r\nAs each arc starts, the audience views a nature that a character has hidden. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.\u201d \u2013 Greta Garbo.\\n\\n\r\nThis quote pretty much sums up the dark themes from Monogatari Second Season. Each character has their own hardships and it is tough to see them face their own problems. Characters such as Hanekawa Tsubasa and Hitagi Senjougahara have their own problems to deal with, but doesn\u2019t show it until their respective arc shows. To acknowledge these problems, each character is related in a special way. Other characters such Oshino Shinobu, Hachikuji Mayoi, Kanbaru Suruga, and Sengoku Nadeko also has their dark secrets. The audience grasps on these secrets and expands their curiosity. These characters are brought over from season one. These characters undergo more development and thus the audience learns more about the character. There is also an apparition that dwells under the host due to their problems. In order to solve the problem, the character would have to adapt and face reality to overcome their problem.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe voice actors and actress are kept the same. This is generally a must since there is a sequel. It would be quite awkward for a character to have a different voice actor or actress unless it was meant. Nobody in Bakemonogatari had different personalities causing it to have different voice actors or actress. What is known for sure is that the audio is great throughout. The opening is normally made by the arc\u2019s main character. For an example, Nekomonogatari White starred Hanekawa Tsubasa so the voice actress of Hanekawa would sing the opening song. It is unique and it requires money and effort to be made. This is one way to show that Studio Shaft is trying to keep the same format as Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe audio for Monogatari Season Two is great. The opening is kept classy with the main character of the arc starring in the opening. For an example, if Hachikuji was the main character of the arc, Hachikuji will voice the opening and have a unique opening animation. This concept was started in Bakemonogatari and was brought over. I really liked this concept and it was used beautifully in Monogatari Second Season.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, Monogatari Second Season is a good anime to watch. It is a genre that all could enjoy. I am sure that SHAFT poured their hearts out to appeal to their fan base and the general anime audience. The story is worth following up upon and the light novels are a great read. One cannot judge a book by its cover until its contents was seen. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Favorite Monogatari season by far. Deep and complex character interactions(Kaiki-Senjougahara, Nadeko-Kaiki, Hachikuji-Araragi etc),most interesting stories, strong feelings and heartwarming momments.  Nekomonogatari white, second and final part of nekomonogatari completes Hanekawa's arc in the best way. I find Hanekawa's personality kind of annoying and her gimmick doesnt help her so much but in this story she presented another aspect of her essence and i find it pretty interesting and loveable. In other hand her co-competitor, Senjougahara remains a character with a difficult personality who doesnt know how to comunicate and all her act seems fake \r\nif we consider her age but one boy can fixthat easily. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have Hachikuji's story. Araragi and Shinobu try to rescue Hachikuji from her fate with the most enjoyable and loveable time-travel story ever made. Their interaction is amazing  and with momments like when they meet loli class prez, when they ask informations for a lost unknown to them 10yo old girl in the police office and the \"first\" meeting with Hachikuji put the show in a shiny way.\\n\\n\r\nAlso leading role in this season has the snake girl. Its true that i love her design but i didnt except to love her personality too. Absolutely love the fact that she is obsessed with araraki and tried to do anything to take him with her. On the surface she is just a girl who doesnt like to be called \"cute\" cause some self-esteem or maybe more complicated problems. \u0397er problem finally broke with an exaggeration way but in the end an adult advice was enough to solve that. Kaiki conquer Nadeko's heart but not only her, he was the absolutely mvp of the season.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of my review i want to write some words for my favorite part of the season and those 2 momments that i couldnt ever forget. When Shaft chooses to direct the monogatari series with a specific way(with lack of mobility) knew well that the details are those that going to make the show a success. An example was the kissing scene with the blonde vampire, her body moves speak of their own, the cuts were so much intense that didnt need words to discribe the scene. Shinobu and Araragi connection is the strongest one and they prove it every time. One more scene that left me speechless was samurai's story narration. Sakamoto Maaya(Shinobu seiyuu) skills and a well down writing scenario were enough to create one of the best momments in series.\\n\\n\r\nI couldnt possible forgot the purest creature on earth, Mayoi Hachikuji, but i want to keep my thoughts on me cause i dont want to destroy that amazing scene, i cant review that, picture had so much power there that words doesnt matter at all. To close, Kaiki-Senjougahara relationship was so powerfull too, when Senjou breaks her character is a lovable creature and Kaiki help her so much with that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sequels to any body of work have a reputation to uphold; a certain quality it must meet to please its viewers that are eager for the return of their favorite characters and stories. This is especially the case with this little nugget of a series here.\r\nThe Monogatari Series Second Season had quite a bit to live up to. The original Bakemonogatari provided a very unique take on the ecchi/harem genre, coupling sexy fanservice with unusual animation, lengthy dialogue, and individual arcs focusing on Araragi\u2019s interaction with different characters and their supernatural problems. However, its sequel, Nisemonogatari, while still good, was a step down from Bakemonogatari.Its arcs were missing the pizzaz and interesting character development of Bakemonogatari\u2019s arcs. To make things worse, for whatever reason, they tried to remedy this by piling on more fanservice. Nekomogatari as well, overdid the fanservice and somewhat felt like a recycled version of the previous Tsubasa arc from Bakemonogatari. Well\u2026that and an excuse to show Black Tsubasa in her underwear.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this in mind, it\u2019s understandable that one might be wary of the Second Season. Well, rest assured, it delivers everything that was great about the original series and THEN SOME. Brand new arcs are given for many of the characters who appeared in the original, revealing all new sides to each of them. Its execution is excellent and the animation, dialogue, music, and voice acting are better than ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc focuses on Tsubasa, and once again deals with the cursed cat that inhabits her body. It in some ways mirrors her initial arc from Bakemonogatari and Nekomongatari, so this definitely isn\u2019t the strongest arc. But it\u2019s got just enough originality, namely her encounter with the tiger apparition and her having to cope with her house burning down, to not feel recycled or boring. Not only that, but this arc wraps up her story nicely and gives her a satisfying resolution. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is a bizarre yet insanely interesting arc that focuses on Araragi and Shinobu messing with time and suffering a number of unforeseen consequences as a result. This arc in question gives us a peek into the mysterious Shinobu, portraying her as more humane and emotional. We also get to see a bit of Mayoi\u2019s past.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc focuses on Sengoku Nadeko. This arc was great because it expanded on her character. In the original Bakemonogatari, her arc seemed more focused on fanservice and getting her half naked or in a school swimsuit than on her individual character. This time around we see a focus on her personality. There\u2019s a focus on her looks but it\u2019s highlighted in an interesting way that surprisingly connects to her personality and behavior. This arc ends on a cliffhanger and continues in the final arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe fourth arc is a bittersweet one, and will probably cause you to shed a few tears. The final arc is a bit underwhelming compared to the previous arcs. It\u2019s disappointing that the anime goes out with a bit of a whimper. But on the bright side, it\u2019s pretty fun at times and focuses on Hitagi Senjogahara, everyone\u2019s favorite tsundere. Her insane threats delivered in her calm, even voice are as funny as ever. Oddly enough, Suruga Kanbaru doesn\u2019t get her own arc. In fact, she barely appears and is only mentioned a few times. Fans of her character will have to wait for the next installment in the series. \\n\\n\r\nWith each arc you grow closer to the main characters and it\u2019s a guarantee that you\u2019ll grow to love them a little more. There are a few quirky side characters that come in to the mix. But they\u2019re just that: side characters. There isn\u2019t a big focus on them, aside from being beacons of information or comedic relief. After each arc, a summary is presented to refresh everyone\u2019s memory of the previous three series. These are helpful for those who want to recall some things they may have forgotten about the previous installments, but can be skipped if you don\u2019t care to see them. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is as perfect as ever: The bright backgrounds littered with reds, whites, yellows, and blues, weird camera angles, head tilting, and quick little blurbs flashing across the screen are all back. The music maintains the same quality as the previous series as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series has come back with a bang. What sets this anime apart from other ecchi/harem anime is its unusual presentation and amazing execution. It does have fanservice and a bunch of girls vying for the same guy, but each girl isn\u2019t simply some generic, boring, archetype. It may seem that way at first (the bookworm, the loli, the cute shy girl, and the tsundere are all here), but by now we\u2019ve seen these characters grow and develop into interesting and unique individuals. The well-handled and occasionally symbolic supernatural elements sure do help out quite a bit as well. \\n\\n\r\nFans of the original Bakemonogatari will be more than pleased with this installment, even if they\u2019ve been disappointed by Nise and Nekomonogatari. Shaft hit all the right notes with this anime and hopefully its future installments will maintain this quality.",

            "content": "Shaft and Nisio Isin are like peanut butter and jelly. Both are good on their own, but together, they compliment each other with such perfect synergy to form something truly amazing. They both have their own unique quirks and styles that really come together in the best way. Isin's stories are character driven, and Monogatari is no exception. Shaft has a way of injecting so much life and personality into all his characters. You instantly fall in love with each character's personality, from Hachikuji's playful insults and Kaiki's snark and cynicism. This is especially important because of the focus on character and perspective in Season2. We get narrators besides Araragi for the first time in the series, which not only provides us with more insight but is very refreshing. It offers up opportunities for the story to be told in a whole new way. While Hanekawa is narrator we get a slow paced story about self discovery and acceptance. Switch back to Araragi and it's more faced paced shonen style. Then Kaiki takes the stage and we're left with what feels like reading a detective mystery novel. There variety lends itself to quite intricate and complex character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nMinor characters from previous entries are given new and more important roles so that we can become more familiar with them (I said with a posed look). New characters are introduced as well - including a possible antagonist of sorts, which is fantastic addition. The music in the series is up to par with what we've come to expect, if not better. The seiyuus still sing their respective openings which I always found particularly charming. Without wanting to give to much away, the last OP left a huge smile on my face - it was definitely a big surprise. If I had one complaint, it would be that we're often faced with budget starved visuals. It's disappointing that it's not the most aesthetically pleasing entry in the series, but it doesn't manage to take away from what is otherwise a fantastic show. Everything we know and love from the series is taken and improved upon in season 2. It's thought provoking, engaging and just overall and enjoyable watch. I'm confident to say that this is the best entry in the Monogatari series so far.",

            "content": "After watching Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari: Kuro, I really thought that the future Monogatari series will never live up to Bakemonogatari and will not be as good as Bake. That's not the case though because Monogatari Series: Second Season completely blew my expectations and it was miles better than Bakemonogatari.\r\n(This is an in-depth review meaning there will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (9.9/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nMonogatari Series: Second Season is a sequel to \"Nisemonogatari\" and it chronologically takes place right after the events of Nise. The bee apparition is now gone, and summer vacation where the phoenix apparition averted harm is over. Around Koyomi Araragi and the girlswho started a new trimester, apparitions, or perhaps threats even worse, were creeping in ever closer. Monogatari Series: Second Season is an adaptation of a light novels with the same which contained 6 volumes. \\n\\n\r\nI actually mean it when I said that Monogatari Series: Second Season is better than Bakemonogatari. What the show did is take everything from Bakemonogatari in terms of storytelling and plot structure that made it great  and they significantly improved it. In other words, it felt like an improved version of Bakemonogatari. Only this time, it's a sequel that's better than the predecessor. A.lot.better!\\n\\n\r\nThe series is divided into 5 arcs. Each arc containing a character with new mysteries/problem that Araragi needs to solve. Don't worry, none of these mysteries are the same as Bake. They're all fresh and new mysteries. These arcs are called \"Nekomonogatari: Shiro\", \"Kabukimonogatari\", \"Otorimonogatari\", \"Onimonogatari\", \"Koimonogatari\". No wonder, the show's called \"Monogatari Series\". These arcs are all mini-story packed into one. They could have done the same thing as Bake and Nise by separately releasing all 5 arcs into 5 separate shows but this is obviously more effective. \\n\\n\r\nNow I want to review the 5 arcs without spoiling too much. Expect some minor spoilers though. The first arc is \"Nekomonogatari: Shiro\" or \"Tsubasa, Tiger\". If you watched Nekomonogatari: Kuro then by simply looking at the name of this arc, you should already know that this is going to be focused on Hanekawa. Just by watching the first 2 episodes of this arc, you'll notice someone missing. That's right, Araragi. He's not completely missing though, he's just gone for this arc. I'm kinda glad that Araragi is not in this arc. While I do like seeing Araragi in action, Araragi not making an appearance in this arc (he does make an appearance at the end of this arc) gives Hanekawa and Senjougahara more character interaction without Araragi on their sight or else it will just turn into a love triangle. For the most part, the arc shows that Hanekawa can be an independent girl and can solve problems on her own until the ending in which she was saved by Araragi. I really don't know what to feel about the ending of \"Tsubasa Tiger\". It was nice to see Hanekawa being an independent girl and I would have loved to see Hanekawa solve her problem completely without Araragi's help. Overall, it was still a great first arc with a decent ending. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Kabukimonogatari or Mayoi Jiangshi. Just by watching the first 2 episodes of this arc, you'll notice something different again. No, Araragi is not missing again. Despite the fact that this arc was supposed to be Hachikugi's arc. It felt like it was Shinobu's arc. Let me explain, the story is focused on Hachikugi. The reason why the arc is happening is because of Hachikugi but in terms of screen-time, Shinobu got a lot more while Hachikugi was almost non-existant. Does that mean the arc was shit? Haha, No! This arc is one of the best arc I've seen in Monogatari Series. It's got a great and clever story. The arc begins with Araragi; along with Shinobu, going back in time because he forgot to do his summer homework. That alone was pretty hilarious. Araragi and Shinobu discovered that they traveled 11 years back into the past. Araragi finds out that they traveled in a time period where Hachikugi was still alive and he decides to save her. However, this messed up the entire world. Everything after that is just awesome. Finding out that they actually visited an alternate reality?!...I am done. I never even thought of that. It's like they threw the \"time travel\" concept right out of the window. Not only does this arc have a great and clever story, this also developed Shinobu's character even further and made her the most interesting character in Monogatari Series. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Otorimonogatari or Nadeko Medusa. Ughh, this arc. I have a love and hate relationship with this arc. I love the arc because of the great story and plot-twist and I hate this arc because Nadeko has now turned into a yandere bitch. To be more specific, I hate her more than the arc itself. Look, I understand what Nadeko was going through but turning into a snake god because you don't want to be called cute anymore and killing Araragi, Shinobu and Senjougahara because of your damn jealousy? In my opinion, she took it way too far. She could have moved on because there are other things to do out there besides romance. She acted like it was the end of the world because her romance didn't work out the way she wanted it too. Despite all of this, this greatly builds and develops Nadeko's character. In Bake, she was this cute character that had a problem but in Monogatari Series: Second Season, there's a reason why she didn't want to be treated like she's special just because she's cute. This, in turn, made her into what she is today. A psychopathic yandere bitch. Why psychopathic you ask? She's hearing voices bruh. That voice wasn't even from the snake god. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Onimonogatari or Shinobu Time. You'll notice something different again while watching this arc. That's right, this time Hachikugi gets way more screentime than Shinobu despite the fact that this is her arc. In other words, Onimonogatari and Kabukimonogatari are kind of flipped around if you think about it. There is a difference though..Shinobu got a decent amount of screentime and most of her screentime was dedicated to explaining what the \"darkness\" is. To summarize, the \"darkness\" was chasing Araragi and Hachikuji, they (or we) learn what \"it\" is, they realize that they can't stop the \"darkness\" and Hachikugi says her fairwells and goes on to live the \"next life\". I have to say, the story was fairly simple but this arc developed Hachikugi's character even further. This arc can do either one of these things to you. Break your manliness or be depressed for the whole day. I got the second one. This arc depressed the living hell out of me for the whole day.  \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's Koimonogatari or Hitage End. In my opinion, this is the best arc out of the 5. Just like Nekomonogatari: Kuro and Otorimonogatari, Araragi is non-existant. That's good, meaning that I get to see Senjougahara; my favourite character in the Monogatari Series, get more screentime. Oh, how I was wrong. While I was watching this arc, I noticed that Kaiki; the main antagonist in Nisemonogatari, is getting more screentime than Senjougahara..I was quickly disappointed but that disappointed quickly turned into a smiley face after the 1st episode of her arc. I can't believe it...An antagonist...was quickly turning into my favourite villians of all time. The moment where he was deciding; on the front of a mirror, whether he should help Araragi and Senjougahara or not, I knew his character was going to get even better and it did. Monogatari Series: Second Season did a wonderful job presenting Kaiki's change in character. The final arc of the series also kept developing Nadeko's character and revealed more and more about her past life and her intentions. I honestly thought that Nadeko was going to be ignored after her arc in Bake because she barely got any screentime in the second half of Bake and the entirety of Nise but I'm glad she's not being ignored. Even though she's now one of the most hated characters in Monogatari Series. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue scenes that is so ever famous in the Monogatari Series is back and if you've managed to come at this point of the series then you already know that the series is full of dialogue scenes that can last for a whole episode. Some people found the dialogue scenes to be extremely boring, hence the reason why the dropped the series. Let's be real here. If you've come this far then you shouldn't have any issues with the dialogue scenes. I said shouldn't. \\n\\n\r\nPutting the story aside, fanservice in Monogatari Series: Second Season has been reduced significantly when compared to Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari. You can still spot some fanservice scenes like the first couple of episodes in \"Tsubasa Tiger\" arc and in later arcs but they're easy to ignore and doesn't really affect the serious tone of the show. \\n\\n\r\n\"Monogatari Series: Second Second\" has one minor issue and one minor issue only. It's the recap episodes. It would have been ok if there was one but there's three. Why?.......Like I said, it's just a minor issue and it affected the show's rating only by .1. Not that big of a deal\\n\\n\r\nLast thing that I want to talk about is the pacing...In my Bakemonogatari review, I mentioned that the only reason why I didn't give the show a 10 is the pacing. It was going pretty fast but not too fast that will make the show a failure like some certain A-1 Pictures anime. Monogatari Series: Second Season's pacing is damn perfect. It's seriously perfect. It wasn't too fast nor was it too slow. It was at a normal pacing and it explained the situation in a smooth manner so I was able to understand what was going on in all 5 arcs without any troubles. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nNow this is the animation that I was looking for Shaft. They didn't have to change the visuals because it was perfect to begin with. What they needed to fix was the lighting because the lack of reflection and shadows in the previous shows was quite irritating and that's what they did here. Indeed, there were some shadows in the previous shows but those were forced. They weren't present all the time. All the weird animation from the previous shows are still here (SHAFT head tilts, messy camera angles, flashing text, etc.). \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nNote that majority of the score for the \"Sound\" category comes from the Opening theme and part of it comes from the Ending theme so it doesn't matter if the soundtrack is crap or the voice acting is crap, it won't affect my sound rating that much. I'm not, however, saying that the soundtrack and the VA is crap because they're not. OST sounds great, the soundtrack sounds great and the VA's did a wonderful job voicing the characters. Especially Nadeko's VA with her supposedly cutesy moe voice. Now, the OP and ED theme songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"chocolate insomnia\" by Hanekawa Tsubasa, \"happy bite\" by Hachikugi Mayoi, \"Mosou Express\" by Nadeko Sengoku, \"white lies\" by the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus, \"fast love\" by Hitagi Senjougahara, and \"Kogarashi Sentiment\" by Hitagi Senjougahara and Kaiki Deshou. The ED theme songs are \"Ai wo Utae\" by Luna Haruna,  \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" by supercell, \"Sono Koe wo Oboeteru\" by Marina Kawano, and \"snowdrop\" by Luna Haruna \u00d7 Marina Kawano. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want my opinions on the OP theme songs, they all sound great. None of them were bad and most of the OP theme songs made it into my favourite opening songs. I love the 1st OP theme song because of Hanekawa's cute voice and the song's catchy tunes. I love the 2nd OP theme song because of the catchy tune. Hachikugi's voice was just an added bonus. I love the 3rd OP theme song because of its effective use of foreshadowing. When I first heard the 3rd OP theme song, I knew something bad was going to happen to  Nadeko but what I didn't know is she did it to her self. Watching the 3rd OP theme song again, I guess it also shows her breakdown. Even the lyrics themselves are foreshadowing the character's actions. I don't know what to feel about the 4th OP. It wasn't bad but I would have preferred Shinobu's VA to sing the OP theme song. Well, real life sucks sometimes with all these contracts and other unknown reasons. Then there's the 5th OP which contains 2 versions. The 1st version where Senjougahara was singing and the 2nd version where Kaiki and Senjougahara were both in a duet. I just want to say that the Opening Animation used for the 5th OP was so clever and something original for once. Just watch the OP yourself. I also want to mention the singers for the 5th OP. I didn't have any problem with Senjougahara singing but the duet version...Jesus Christ...what the hell is up with Kaiki's voice?! I was literally laughing my ass off when I heard him singing. If that was intentional and I am very sure it was, then great job for Kaiki's VA because his singing is comedy gold. The ED theme songs are decent in my opinion but none of the ED theme songs here has beaten Bakemonogatari's ED yet. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (10/10)\\n\r\nMost of the characters you know and love from the Monogatari series returns here in the Second Season. I gotta say, the show did an outstanding job with the character development. By taking out Araragi in 3 of the 5 arcs and the series being 26 episodes, the show gave the girls more screentime, they're more fleshed out and like I said, they got character development. However, there were 3 girls that didn't get screentime at all and that's the Fire Sisters and Kanbaru Suruga. I'm going to have to cut Kanbaru because she gets her own arc after the Monogatari Series: Second Season. I guess the Fire Sisters have no more stories to be told. You can still hear them in the \"Previews\" but I don't think that counts as screentime. \\n\\n\r\nThis category ain't that long because most of my character reviews are in the \"Story\" category. I guess moving them in this category would be more sensible but I'm satisfied with how I wrote my review and what category I put the reviews in. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nI never thought I would enjoy the Monogatari Series: Second Season so much. Even though the show is 95% dialogue, I still enjoyed this show a helluva lot more than a \"shounen\" show that contains 95% action. Bakemonogatari used to be on my Top 10 list but after watching this show, Monogatari Series: Second Season will take that spot. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Monogatari Series: Second Season\" is truly an outstanding anime that blows Bake, Nise and Neko out of the water. This is also one of those rare sequels that beats the original show. The show takes everything from Bake and improved it. I'm talking about the dialogue scenes, huge improvement in pacing, significantly reduced fanservice and the story is a lot more clever than Bake. I will also say that it's a lot better than Bake. If you have watched Bake, Nise and Neko then it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you watch this show now. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+All 5 arcs have outstanding stories and are all well though out\\n\r\n+Outstanding and Unique Animation \\n\r\n+Soundtrack is a masterpiece\\n\r\n+All the characters are developed and fleshed out\\n\r\n+Significantly improved pacing\\n\r\n+Fanservice reduced significantly\\n\r\n+Kaiki's change in character is perfect\\n\r\n+Dialogue scenes are way better than the predecessors\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Three Recap Episodes",

            "content": "Brilliant! Probably the most interesting Monogatari season to date! They made many references and built upon subtle clues from the original seasons that just fascinated me. There was a ton of dialogue as well as character development that made me question who was the real protagonist of the story. The ending was a masterpiece and completely unexpected. This season was long 26 episodes, but made me crave more nonetheless. I cannot wait for more Monogatari content to be released~\r\nSTORY: 10/10\r\nWas intricate and the episodes were intentionally not in the correct order in terms of plot progression time-wise. The entirety of S2 references the previous seasonsheavily so you must have watched those beforehand. There are a lot of small details that end up playing huge roles throughout the story and the unpredictability of how things will turn out. While a lot of loose ends are tied from the previous seasons, even more questions are left open for the future seasons. This is intentional. This season also takes a bit more of a tragic/dark turn compared to the previous seasons as we witness death/equivalent occur to some characters. The story was engrossing and had me hooked like a crack addict every week waiting to get my ~26minute fix every week. Like previous seasons most of the episodes consist of the characters mainly talking around backgrounds or just with seizure inducing screen flashes of narrator thought processes. The story definitely gets a perfect from me. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nTypical Shaft artwork for the monogatari series thusfar. They had some creative OP and ED animations but nothing too surprising overall given their past seasons. A few of the episodes (especially the last one) had some sloppy and somewhat uninteresting artwork and backgrounds. The artwork wasn't as crisp as Nisemonogatari but it was still much more interesting than most other anime released. I suppose I am being stingy, but I am comparing Shaft to its previous work and being stingy :p\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs were all mostly spectacular and I enjoyed listening to them. I even downloaded Happy Bite, Kogarashi Sentiment and Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari to my phone to listen to on my daily commute. However the osts and various background sounds from the anime were nothing too special. They were mainly the same from previous seasons or slightly remixed. They still fit most situations brilliantly but they aren't anything too spectacular, perhaps because I have grown used to hearing them? Overall the sound was well done and I really shouldn't complain about it too much. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is HUGE in this season. We learn more about all of the characters and the narrators are all different people throughout the season. If you watched the season you know what I am talking about when I say one narrator completely wins the \"most interesting character\" award for the entire series really in just around 6 episodes. All the characters show a lot of their backstories and problems in ways not portrayed to us (in previous seasons). We laugh at their jokes, cheer for them during their struggles and cry when they fail or are in trouble. There are many emotional scenes throughout the season that can make you feel overjoyed or traumatized by the character's outcome. Overall the characters were brilliantly done and well flushed out. This season made a previously minor character (in my eyes) into one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nSaying I enjoyed this would be a understatement. I was addicted to this season and I am already feeling the withdrawal symptoms now that is over. It was well planned and the presentation/implementation was amazing. The characters and story altogether made for the best anime two seasons straight. S2 easily joins my top 5 anime and I can't wait for this to come out on Blu-Ray. This season officially converted me into joining the Monogatari Cult!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nI highly recommend you watch this. If you never jumped into the Monogatari series before now is the time to begin. Even if you dislike the first few seasons your opinion will change after watching this season.",

            "content": "(Minor Onimonogatari spoilers)\r\nMonogatari Second Season was a competent and decent followup in the Monogatari series. Since Second Season was split into 5 parts, so to shall this review. Do bear in mind that each part is of varying quality, hence, the average score may undermine how good some of the parts are.\r\nOf course, before I begin, given this is part of the Monogatari series, the animation quality is without a doubt superb. Shaft's surreal animation style works wonders for otherwise long and boring dialogue sessions. Off model characters are off putting though, and it seems that off model characters do appear more often particularly inthe Onimonogatari arc.\\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari Shiro : Tsubasa Tiger -\\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari focuses its story on Hanekawa Tsubasa, now with short hair and no glasses! This arc's quality was fairly decent. Though it did dip a fair bit near the end. Hanekawa's interactions with the aberrations and the revelation on the true identities of said aberrations were well done. The resolution to this arc was quite poor though, as Hanekawa, despite growing stronger in terms of character, still requires the assistance of a secondary character for the arc to completely resolve. Not a fan of that approach and it does rub me off the wrong way. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nKabukimonogatari : Mayoi Jiangshi- \\n\\n\r\nDespite its title, this arc focuses more on Shinobu, where Mayoi herself is a plot device and her character isn't explored much. Definitely the weakest arc of the five. While we do learn quite a bit on the world that Monogatari takes place in, the characters simply aren't interesting enough to drive the plot. Shinobu comes across as whiny and unlikable throughout, and the serious moments are fairly cringe worthy and difficult to watch. Its ending was passable if not decent, but even that is not enough to save the whole mediocre arc.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari : Nadeko Medusa-\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest arcs in the series. This focuses on Sengoku Nadeko, the childhood friend brat of Araragi. Nadeko's character is simply fun to follow, and her being the Unreliable Narrator would mean that events in the arc are (slightly) distorted due to how mentally ill this girl is. The subversion to Nadeko's character is so well done, but is foreshadowed well back in Bakemonogatari so that it doesn't seem out of place. And the plot twist to this arc is magnificent, playing into the Unreliable Narrator trope and showcasing just how twisted and insane this girl is. For how much her seiyuu is typecasted into always losing innocent childhood friend roles, this change in character is simply magnificent and plays with audience expectations so well. The arc even ends with a lovely fake preview done by Nadeko, still narrating and still insane.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnimonogatari : Shinobu Time-\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to Kabuki, Oni focuses on Mayoi rather than Shinobu, who is also reduced to a mere plot device. Onimongatari is very heavy on world building ,giving great insight as to how the Monogatari world functions as well as leaving enough mysteries to keep the viewer interested in future installments. Character interaction is passable, borderlining on weak. Mayoi's sudden declaration of love felt so unnecessary  that it dampens the scene it takes place in, making an otherwise serious scene a tad bit cringe worthy. Still, it ended on a very high note, and I am very pleased with how they resolved the scene.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nKoimonogatari : Hitagi End-\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt the best and most entertaining arc of the five. Unlike the rest, this arc focuses squarely on Kaiki Deishuu, one of the most interesting characters to follow in the series. Taking place immediately after Otorimonogatari, it mainly revolves around Kaiki helping out Senjougahara on her problems. Kaiki's interactions with the characters are simply brilliant, and he definitely provides an insight to the world from a mature and realistic perspective, unlike the rest of the cast. The actual arc itself was extremely enjoyable, with plenty of twists and turns as well as insight into Kaiki's character. It's just a brilliant arc. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn fact if you wanna enjoy Second Season to the fullest, just watching Otorimonogatari and Koimonogatari is sufficient. The other arcs if anything dampen the overall quality of the entire season, so it's only the best course of action to just watch the two I just mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score\\n\r\n 7/10",

These voids become manifest in different characters throughout the show, where these characters get their own arcs, making for very remarkably well written stories with their own unique narrative, and nicely done within the same universe, still relating to an overarching theme with interweaving connections through our main character without losing their individual identity in their own, personal arcs. \r\nIt's really hardand weird to explain, but that's the best that I can manage.\\n\r\nIf I could explain it any other way, imagine a show where each character is one of the seven deadly sins, where the sins manifest as the characters' underlying natures when one of the characters is either unconscious or allows their negativity or void to come out.  \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it's a show on the negative aspects of our humanity that we all contain within us, addressing characters who have a stronger negative aspect than others, and it's done really well.",

Oh and btw this an edited version.......3rd time co'z them ....you know who,  orders me to do it.\r\nStory- Very Good 8\r\nI like the way how this anime was divided into 5 mini series ( not including the summaries), basically it didn't follow the usual arc it did with its previous monogatari seasons.\r\nArt- Fair 6.\r\nWell, I got to hand to studio Shaft, the first miniseries \"Tsubasa tiger\" was intense to say the least especially with Hanekawa's skinship thing with Hitagi, and that's as goodas it gets.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I kind like the opening theme \"Chocolate insomnia,\" but not the rest of the opening and closing themes that were featured in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Very Good 8. \\n\\n\r\nBecause it wasn't just confined to Araragi and Shinobu alone, here we get to see Kaiki and Nadeko in a whole new light, so the score is for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Good 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable to some extent, but the recall summaries ware just a drag, in fact I don't see any point as to why studio Shaft has to include it. Frankly it just adds as useless filler.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say its \"VERY GOOD! And I have nothing more to say.\\n",

            "content": "Monogatari Series: Second Season is the continuation of the series right after the events of Nisemonogatari. As a watcher of the previous seasons of Monogatari. I am happy to say that SHAFT continues to bring out its beautiful art style which is joined by its use of sound to create a strange but unique story in the anime.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe storytelling in the Second Season is slightly different then its previous seasons. As almost each arc is told by one of the supporting characters with the help of Araragi and Shinobu who are the main protagonists. Each specific arc in the series is told at differenttimes ranging from summer to winter season in the story. The story itself requires many to watch the previous seasons as the Second Season is fairly complex. The complex story is appealing as it usually surprises me in the ending of the arc. The Story in the Monogatari Series is truly unique as each arc is slowly united into another arc which show the outcome of the consequences that Araragi or another character makes. The pacing in the story is slow likes its previous season. The Season Season does not contain really any fanservice unlike Nisemonogatari except more of an occasional comedy while still maintaining its seriousness in the storytelling. I did not like that the Otorimonogatari arc was pushed aside to be resolved until another arc was finished. The second season was also missing the Hanamonogatari arc.  The ending of Season Season however was great as it paves the way for a new season in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe series excels very well in its unique art style and visuals. A lot of the visuals and scenery that were hand painted were beautifully incorporated into the anime. The art style is realistic as the illustration utilizes the light and shadows in the background to create a wonderful setting for the story without using too much color. I believe the art style fits the story as fine like its previous seasons. The art style was relatively the same quality as before. Near the end of the season the opening visual of the Koimonogatari arc seemed outdated and old. The backgrounds are definitely memorable as VOfan's illustration is very distinct in his paintings and drawings. The character designs were appealing along with the hair style. Each character looked different and special in their own style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters that were portrayed in the previous season fits the different characters great. I believe the voices actors were chosen to fit their typical role for the voices. The background music is a big key to the art and story of Monogatari. By using the beautiful art style and sound like the previous seasons it allows the series to set up a bright or gloomy setting for the story. The soundtracks enhanced the action scenes for the different arcs. The OST that was used in the anime is intriguing and I would probably listen to it when it gets released. The OP/ED always have been one of the best which changes every time a new arc starts or ends. The Nekomonogatari: Shiro, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari OP/ED were one the most notable and best in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nMany of the characters in Monogatari were well-rounded having a human flaw and strength. They all bare the traits of human nature. Some of the characters are either clever, manipulative, innocent, wise , selfish and brave in someway. The characters reacted in a realistic way; learning and understanding the problems that pop up in the story. I was not able to relate any of the characters together as they were all special in their own way. Some of the characters did deteriorate to the point where they were willing to risk anything to change the outcome and or hide their true intention. I believe it is fine for the characters to deteriorate as it will be interesting to see how it progress in the future seasons of the Monogatari Series.  Shinobu and Kaiki would be the foils for Araragi and Senjougahara in the series as play a strong support role in the last 2 arcs of the season. The main antagonist in the story had a open motivation which to some may seem insane or extreme, however we are told slowly on how the antagonist become this way near the end of the season which is realistic due to natural human behavior of being selfish. We are not really told much in the second season about Ougi Oshino but it seems most likely that the character is the second antagonist in the future. The supporting cast was just fine and perfect without it being overcrowed as Monogatari mostly focuses on the one  supporting character for each specific arc. The main character Koyomi Araragi is the most prominent and memorable character just like the in previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI believe many people will like this anime as the art and story arc are fascinating. I think non-anime/manga fans may like this anime for its unique style but some individual maybe discouraged due to the slow pacing. I might re-watch the entire series in the future if I read the light novel. I think re-watching the series will help me understand some of the information that I missed the first time. If they had complete Monogatari Series translated or straight from Japan I would definitely buy it because I love the story telling with the occasion comedy and action in Monogatari. The Monogatari Series is pretty memorable as it ended year on a good note.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nAs you can see, SHAFT continues to bring out a compelling anime series that will satisfy many of its fans with its great story and unique art/sound from the previous season.\\n",

On one level, it is one of the more difficult shows to follow the story line. Then, add to that, a lot of inner dialog that borders on the neurotic and you have a show that can become tedious to watch. However, there is a good payoff because the characters are interesting, as are the reveals at the end of each vignette. \r\nDo watch the series from the beginning (Bakemonogatari, Niseimonogatari, Monogatari) to fully understand and enjoy all the subplots.",

            "content": "A series as long as Monogatari typically loses a lot of the original energy and entertainment value as it progresses. With four iterations thus far, Monogatari shows no signs of letting up and I\u2019m happy to eat up whatever is thrown at me. While this season provides a lot of what made the previous seasons so successful, it also is plagued with some weaker arcs, some bad characters, and a loss of the character neutrality that I enjoyed so much in the previous seasons.\r\nFor those not in the know, Monogatari is a character driven harem/comedy and horror hybrid that centers on Araragi Koyomi and thegirls he picks up on his strange adventures. This second season further emphasizes the development of some of the best loved characters while throwing others on the backburner. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t see them, it\u2019s that they show up once in the series and are left forgotten for the rest.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story does do right, though, is focus on characters we want more of. This sounds pretty ridiculous considering I just condemned the show for not paying attention to certain characters, but let me explain. The first season and Nisemonogatari did a pretty good job of making every character in the series seem important in the grand scheme of things. Even if it were just a quick, pointless visit, Araragi would go to see them and the audience would feel like that character would come up at some point, for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nKanbaru, despite being talked about, is given no screen time but for one tiny scene. The same can be said of Araragi\u2019s sisters. I spent a lot of the series wondering what they were up to and trying to understand whether they were important to the plot any longer, or had been used to their fullest extent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not even my biggest problem with the story as far as presenting characters go.\\n\\n\r\nThis season doesn\u2019t emphasize the romance between Senjougahara and Araragi. It mentions it, and Senjougahara herself tries to protect it, but we\u2019re not seeing the two together. Why does this bother me? Because Araragi is fucking around with four or five other girls. In a harem-esque anime like this, it\u2019s imperitive to give some importance to the main romantic thread. Ignoring it completely instead of giving the audience some general sense of what is happening in that relationship makes us feel like it doesn\u2019t matter. And truthfully, the romance between Senjougahara and Araragi does matter. He is Senjougahara\u2019s everything and we get a lot of her side of things, but nothing on Araragi\u2019s end, nor any synthesis between the two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter relations and attention to them may be a little off, but the stories are good, right? This season doesn\u2019t just focus on Araragi, and gives us a look into the minds of some other characters. It starts with a new story concerning Hanekawa and her cat form, a pretty good story that addresses her insecurities and love problems. It continues to a time-traveling, apocalypse scenario. This story wasn\u2019t in any way my favorite. A whole lot of Sengoku in the third arc. It\u2019s not a bad arc, but it does have Sengoku in it\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWe finish it out with an arc concerning Shinobu that becomes really emotional in the end, and a final arc from the perspective of Kaiki, one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some issues pervading the story. The time travel arc, as I said, wasn\u2019t that great and I feel like anything concerning Shinobu is just exposition for the sake of exposition. She has a whole episode dedicated to her past that gives some perspective on her, but ultimately serves as nothing more than more plot explanation. Shinobu seems to be everyone\u2019s favorite character, but I don\u2019t think she has enough character to even give a damn about.\\n\\n\r\nI love the fact that this season jumps around but everything comes together. There are big time gaps that are filled later on and questions that are asked but not answered until another arc. It feels very natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s focus on the characters proper and not their place in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSengoku is still one of the worst characters ever. The resolution to her problems is ridiculous, her intentions and motives are idiotic, and she\u2019s overall a piece of crap who should have died.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu, as stated, is nothing but loli exposition.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode and Gaen are characters who\u2026just don\u2019t have a place, especially Episode. I don\u2019t think Gaen was very interesting either, though I can see her and Episode playing bigger roles later on.\\n\\n\r\nOther than them, the other characters are all really good. There is a large enough range of characters that you can find a favorite. The inclusion of Ononoki is a good choice and she provides more added cuteness and the Yuki Nagato type character the series was lacking.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t go through a best girl game. No point doing it every time. This season\u2019s best girl is Hanekawa. Runner up is Ononoki.\\n\\n\r\nThough plagued with a variety of minor issues, Monogatari is still an enjoyable and highly watchable continuation of a series that doesn\u2019t seem to be losing any steam. It\u2019s animation, directing, writing, and characters are all (for the most part) top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nWith a new short series coming this year, as well as a film, there\u2019s no better time to pick up Monogatari  and give it a whirl.",

            "content": "(8.0/10)\r\nThis isn't Bakemonogatari. This definitely isn't Nisemonogatari. \r\nIn its second season, the show i've struggled with coming to terms with (see my Bakemonogatari review for more information) has changed completely. \r\nPerhaps its my willingness to \"go along\" with whatever the show will throw at me, but i felt significantly less confused watching this new show. There was no more \"Uhh... that 12 year old girl is naked and i don't even know how to feel about what's going on.\" Or, \"so these characters are terrible right? They're tropes. Cliches. Bullshit. Then how come I like them so much?\" \r\nNo more. Instead, the show builds uponits predecessor, Bakemonogatari, as if it was simply the groundwork for the show to come. This is the building that the creator wanted to build and Bakemonogatari served as simple introduction to almost every single character that gets used in this series. \\n\\n\r\nWith my confusion gone and my wits about me, I quickly noticed just how many things changed with the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFan service - GONE\\n\\n\r\nAction - GONE\\n\\n\r\nPervasive Animation - GONE\\n\\n\r\nA lot of what made this show what it was has slowly drifted away and what we have left is a show wearing the skin of its predecessor. Or so I thought. \\n\\n\r\nI won't be breaking up this review like my original Bake/Nise-monogatari review, separating all the different categories. Instead i'll simply go over my general thoughts with four different parts. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIf Nisemonogatari was the show at its most indulgent, this season felt like it was the show at its least indulgent. Especially when it comes to fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nI never thought i'd say this, but after the first arc I found myself missing it, too. Not because I wanted to bop the balogna to the creator's specific fetishes. But because it certainly added a... feeling to the show.\\n\\n\r\nI described Bake and Nisemonogatari as exploitative, gross, sleazy, sexist, beautiful, fascinating, memorable, and confusing. A lot of the time i felt like I was watching something that I should feel bad about watching. I felt like i was both becoming everything i hated, but also understanding a little more about myself. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a really unique experience. The second season, I didn't. There was structure, storytelling, fucking EXPOSITION. It baffled me. I hated it at first. \\n\\n\r\nI want my god damn sleazy guilty pleasure back! Until I began understanding the direction. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 1] : The First Arc & Change\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, the first arc of this second season was awful. In fact, it was so horrible that i found myself longing for the days of Nadeko's first arc, where she was sexually assaulted by an invisible snake for the entire episode. \\n\\n\r\nIn this first arc I saw my absolute favorite character twist and contort into an amalgamation of writing that was attempting character growth, while not showing it at all. \\n\\n\r\nAt risk of massive spoilers (but still be warned), the entire story was about overcoming something and not needing anyone to help you. To fight your own battles, in a way. Even the theme song asked the protagonist \"not to wait for a prince to save you from your castle.\" \\n\\n\r\nSo while the story was predictable, it would have still been fine for character growth. Instead the writer chose to completely ignore everything they were building up to and have the protagonist of the story get saved from everything she was trying to fight against... and if that wasn't enough salt rubbed in the wound, she was then treated like some fucking barn animal and patted on the head for being a 'good girl', or some shit. \\n\\n\r\nWhat. \\n\\n\r\nFor once I felt like the show's innate focus was on the story and they BLEW it. The character left with a shoddier character design, a worse personality, and worst of all, changing very little. It was a bad episode. Most likely my least favorite. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAfter this disaster of a first arc I began to harbor reservations for what this show is going to have in store for me in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nThere were multiple things clear. The three things i listed above being completely nixed from the show, as well as the fact that the show was generally not remotely as happy as it was in Bake/Nisemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nSince the writer/s want to tell a serious story, they decided to take out a lot of the comedy. I once again never expected to say this about anime but this is one of the few animes that actually has made me laugh. So that was another disappointing change they made.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I got instead was a five episode arc ruining my favorite character, with slow, meta dialogue that constantly refers to the well-being of the missing main character - who, in this scenario, was being used as a vessel to talk about the audience. \\n\\n\r\nIn one of the shows more extended scenes in this first arc, the two titular girls in this episode decided to bathe together for the sake of Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi being the viewer. The show was handing us a fanservice scene. Maybe that's why I had so much issue with it? Maybe it was a clever way of foreshadowing that nothing in this show is like the previous season? Regardless, it felt strange, and thinking back on it I find myself marveling at the fact that the writer and creator was kind enough to tell us that, \"Yeah, Nisemonogatari was a mistake, here, have this story.\" \\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nTalking about characters, lets talk Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nIn Nise he recieved a small overhaul. Instead of acting as more of a straight-man and self-insert, he instead was given a bit more of a playful personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by playful I mean sexual assault-y. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi went as follows : Self-Insert>Lover boy>Pedophile\\n\\n\r\nIn that order. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, i prefer pedophile over blank slate. So i was fairly happy with the fact that at least he now has a presence on screen and isn't just overshadowed by the vastly superior supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhile they definitely toned down the creepy ass pedophilic Araragi, what we got was a more brooding and serious Araragi, which fit this more dialogue-indulgent shows second season.\\n\\n\r\nHe still was a pedophile though, in the most basic sense anyway. The dude gropes and kisses every underage girl in the show at least at some point.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 2] : Episodes\\n\\n\r\nSo with that out of the way, I was definitely skeptical. I don't know what I got myself into, and not in the intriguing way. I was just hoping they wouldn't ruin another one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nOh look, my other favorite character's episode is right after the first arc!\\n\\n\r\nJoy. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________\\n\\n\r\nGoing into the second arc i was uneasy. But i was pleasantly surprised that i was greeted with more shinobu/Araragi chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nBut now that this show has ditched trying to be a parody of romantic comedies, it now has to focus on being a drama. I have to judge it on its ability to tell a dramatic story.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of exposition in the first episode of this second arc was a bit jarring to anyone that has seen Bake/Nise, but not jarring if you've seen any other anime ever. \\n\\n\r\nSo that's fine. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thankfully, the story itself was a drastic change from the more boring, character-ruining story that came previously. \\n\\n\r\nIt was also probably the most \"out there\" story, as it didn't feel grounded in the world around the characters from the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the story was engaging and showed that the show has gotten back to a \"new normal\", as a call it. It returned to form, but the form that it returned to isn't a show that's similar to the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nNo character ruined.\\n\r\n_________________________\\n\\n\r\nWith that settled, the arc after was even better. It acted as my favorite arc at the time. They managed to take one of the least remarkable characters in the show and change her setup from the first season into a full-fledged story in the second. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, the episode had a bit more laughs, as well as a more interesting story. I felt the show began to blend its more indulgent half from season 1, and its more focused half with season 2. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe penultimate arc was another detour from the norm, with an absolutely staggering amount of exposition. Specifically the second episode, which was where the show was at its most boring. It was literally just a scrolling still image. \\n\\n\r\nBut boring doesn't necessarily equal unnecessary, and it set up the conclusion of the arc nicely with what was the second season at its more heartfelt. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a melancholy end and I appreciated the shows maturity when the credits rolled. \\n\\n\r\n____________________________\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last arc, to be blunt, was spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nThe final arc helped me come to terms with the shows change, and actually appreciate it. I don't think the show in its more Bake/Nise form would have been able to tell Hatagi End arc in a convincing way. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, much like a lot of this seasons episodes, the focus of this arc wasn't really Araragi. This made room for more character developement and a really well thought out story with an absolutely shatteringly good ending. \\n\\n\r\nI adored these episodes, they were by far the best episodes of the season and the best arc of the show. Combining the storytelling chops that the show has been building up with very pretty animation, likable and increasingly interesting characters, and a narrative that I can't wait to see more of. \\n\\n\r\nIt solidified this second series as being a step above the first, even if it was almost nothing alike. \\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 3] : Beast\\n\\n\r\nMonagatari Series : Second Season was a wildly different beast than the first. Apart from its first arc, it was generally solid throughout and didn't have filler. \\n\\n\r\nThe show no longer has fanservice and while i still maintain that the absolutely crazy mother-of-all-fanservice first season was necessary, I've grown to really think the second one is an evolution. \\n\\n\r\nIts almost as if the creator was working tirelessly to rid the show of the glaring mistakes from the first season, and he mostly succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nThe final arc determined that the show was here to tell a story now. You are to be invested in these characters, not because they're adorable lolis half the time, or restrained tsunderes, or whatever other trope I'm not weab enough to know the name of yet... but because they're engaging characters.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose that's the struggle with this show now. I had such a hard time judging the characters from the first season, it feels almost unnatural to just think of them as characters now. Characters like any other, in a show that's a bit more structured, while maintaining a distinct style that I haven't seen in animation before. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe combination of crazy trope-based characters in the first season and the more realized characters in the second makes an interesting commentary on character portrayal in any television show. \\n\\n\r\nMixing these two aspects together is very strange, and it creates a very memorable experience. \\n\\n\r\n_________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIf you are to take one thing from this review, and maybe my Bake/Nise review I wrote before this, its that i've come to terms with a medium I was never really into before. \\n\\n\r\nThat medium being anime. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like with this show, i've went through a character arc. Now i don't know if it was remotely as interesting as a few that happened this second season, but its important for me as someone wanting to make television in the future. \\n\\n\r\nI'll attempt to sum it up here. \\n\\n\r\n____________________________\\n\\n\r\n[BONUS PART] : My Arc\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe country, genre, or medium a piece of entertainment is created in does not dictate whether its good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nI've realized that now and i feel stupid that I didn't before.\\n\\n\r\nI hold a grudge against anime for being so \"escapist\", so \"self-pleasing\", so \"masturbatory\" in the most unnatural way. Its something that's made to please a demo. To get blue-ray sales, to sell as many figurines/merchandise. \\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't tell you whether the medium is good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nIt instead just means the medium experiences massive content bursts. Unlike western television, there are upwards of fifty anime's a season. Each one having that goal. \\n\\n\r\nThe determining factor of quality is time. \\n\\n\r\nIt always was time, and it always will be time. What lays in time is effort, talent, and refinement. \\n\\n\r\nAnything can be good and engaging if those principles are thrust upon it. \\n\\n\r\nThe creators and animators have put the time into any television show, its chances of being something a lot of people remember skyrocket. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________\\n\\n\r\nI feel like if this show did anything it allowed me to realize this. \\n\\n\r\nI just hope I see more things that get time put into them. It doesn't matter if its romance, action, adventure, or comedy. Monogatari proves that any kind of genre can be good with time. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________\\n\\n\r\nThat's my wrap up, I hope you enjoyed the read and if you did and haven't watched the second season of this show, I highly recommend it. I haven't seen anything like it before.\\n\\n\r\nPeace, Peace!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It is rare to find anime that use the medium to its full potential. Anime can use multiple aspects of its visuals, sound and dialogue to tell a story and present information to us. Anime producers often don\u2019t bother or can\u2019t afford to use things like movement, transitions or perspective to help tell their story. The Monogatari Series has always been a great example of how to use the full potential of anime to tell a story and the Monogatari Series: Second Season continues to impress.\r\nThis review is written for a reader who has already watched the previous installments in the series and may containsome spoilers. I recommend watching the previous seasons before reading the rest of this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series is renowned for its exceptional use of visuals to help tell the story. Scenes are always evolving with the characters, events and dialogue to show the character's impression of the situation as well as how they are feeling. Rather than telling us a character's thoughts through needless exposition. The use of flash screens makes a return. These flash screens work fantastically for delivering us information quickly without breaking the dialogue. The flash screens are often used to overload us with information so we only get an impression of what the character might be thinking. The use of both constantly evolving scenes and chaotic presentation of information drags us into the character's head and immerses us in the scene.\\n\r\nThe second season upholds the quality of visuals set by the series and improves upon some areas. There are several sequences of exposition that use imagery and transitions rather than just showing us the character talking. This is fantastic delivery and gives us a more in depth look into what they\u2019re saying.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area that the Monogatari Series likes to experiment with is sound. There are frequent dramatic sound effects and changes in voice mixing to help emphasise what the characters are saying and doing. This sound design helps further pull us into a character's head and effectively communicates to us how they interpret events. The second season sports a solid score filled with the style of music we\u2019ve come to expect from the series. While there isn\u2019t much improvement from the previous season, it remains an effective use of sound design.\\n\r\nWithout realising it, the events of previous season are coloured by Araragi Koyomi\u2019s perspective. The second season features several story arcs that are told from different characters\u2019 perspectives. This changes the way locations appear and how characters behave. It\u2019s interesting and refreshing to see how the other characters interact with each other as well as how they solve their problems without Koyomi. This change in perspective allows us to experience the characters from another angle giving us better insight into who they are.\\n\\n\r\nThere has always been one issue I\u2019ve had with the Monogatari Series. A large amount of Monogatari featured casual discussions between characters and it doesn\u2019t always seem relevant to the current story. Some of the longer segments of dialogue drag on and often feel completely pointless. This combined with interesting distractions in the animation can often cause someone to completely lose the point of the conversation. This is often an issue for me when viewing the show because I occasionally lose interest. While this is less of an issue in the second season, it is still a prevailing problem. The stories have better pacing than previous seasons and most of the dialogue is relevant and interesting. However, there are still a few run-on conversations that I find frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two new recurring characters introduced in the second season. The first of which is Oshino Ougi who enters into the same highschool as Koyomi as his underclassman. She is an apparition specialist who claims to be the niece of Oshino Meme. She remains a mysterious character and it\u2019s never clear what her true intentions are nor if she is actually trying to help Koyomi and his friends.\\n\r\nThe second character is Izuko Gaen. Another apparition specialist who is said to know everything. She will often abuse her knowledge and others\u2019 lack of knowledge in an attempt to control the future. Again it is hard to tell if she could be considered an ally. \\n\r\nThese new characters don\u2019t have fleshed out stories and remain mysterious. However, they\u2019re used very well in several stories both giving us information and creating conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season continues to use dialogue to progress the story. Rather than having characters simply reacting to what is happening around them, everything is discussed and debated. This style of storytelling benefits highly from the diverse characters the series has established. Each character has a different style of approaching problems and different methods of communication that reflect their character. Not only are the characters interesting but they are used well throughout the series to create conflict and affect the way each problem is approached.\\n\r\nThis dialogue heavy storytelling can be detrimental to the pacing of the show. Dialogue often drags on and can bring the story to a halt. Overall, however, the pacing is much improved over the previous seasons and the story presented here is much more engaging for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is split into 5 arcs. The first of which, Nekomonogatari Shiro, is told from Hanekawa Tsubasa\u2019s perspective. By telling a story from her perspective we get a better understanding of her character when not viewed through Koyomi\u2019s eyes. We also get a different insight into how Hanakawa interacts with other characters and this is one of the more interesting aspects of this arc. Because of this, the arc has some of the best character development in the series and is a great start to the season.\\n\r\nFor the second arc, Kabukimonogatari, we switch back to Koyomi\u2019s perspective for a story with Oshino Shinobu. This story challenges Koyomi\u2019s ideals and the way in which he understands the world. There is some great development for both Koyomi and Shinobu and shows how they may not truly understand the full effect of their powers and actions.\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari is the third arc which has another perspective shift, this time following Sengoku Nadeko. I found this arc to be the weakest of the 5 as it features some poor storytelling. The story itself was not the problem, it was more a problem of how information is presented. I would go into more details but it would spoil the story. However, the story is important setup for future arcs and it is interesting to see how Nadeko sees things and how people behave towards her.\\n\r\nIn the fourth arc, Onimonogatari, we switch back to Koyomi who is joined by Hachikuji Mayoi, Ononoki Yotsugi and Shinobu. The cast are troubled by an unknown presence and we get to see how they approach the situation. This arc is very dialogue heavy and has some of the more interesting conversations in the season. The way the characters debate what the presence is and how to deal with it is very well done and really brings out each girl's differing characteristics.\\n\r\nFinally we have Koimonogatari. Probably the strongest arc in the whole of the Monogatari Series thus far. We follow Deishuu Kaiki\u2019s perspective, once again seeing characters from a new perspective which gives us new insights into the characters and world. The pacing is what made this arc so strong; the story is driven by new information and each episode is very compelling.\\n\r\nOverall the different arcs work well together and their timelines become apparent during each arc. There were no noticeable plot holes and each issue was resolved or at least setup to be resolved in a future season. The storytelling in the second season is a big step in the right direction for the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series continues to demonstrate the full potential for storytelling when working with anime. Even if you don\u2019t like the series it is easy to appreciate the way they use the medium. The second season is a large improvement over previous seasons so it is a must watch for any fans of the series.\\n\r\nI hope other anime produces are inspired by the Monogatari Series and, in future, try to fully utilize the medium to tell their story.",

I mean where was Araragi the whole season? Nadeko kind of just became the most pathetic type of yandere ever. The Hanekawa arc was such a bland and boring way to start the season. The one girl just knows everything to ever happen anywhere ever just because she knows?\r\n      This season featured some of the absolute worst writing I've ever witnessed. The traditional monologues wereboring, the logic was broken, and the characters where all needlessly deceptive and sneaky. I mean if you have to say something just say it, please. No one ever just says what they're thinking in this season.\\n\\n\r\n       I mean maybe it was always that bad, but at least we had Araragi to speak his mind before. This season really just felt like they wrote out whatever they felt like with zero thought, then wrote some random lines trying to tie the terrible writing all together.\\n\\n\r\nI give Monogatari Season 2 a 5/10 overall.",

The monogatari series does a kind of maturing here, taking darker turns in terms of tone, as well as character development. New revelations about our familiar characters make them become either more tragic figures than before, or in a particular case, more disturbing.\r\nIt almost goes without saying that in terms of sound and visuals, monogatari as a whole continues to be a work of creative genius.",

            "content": "It's very rare that I can find a show suspenseful without the show relying on heavy action and violence, however, the character focused plot of monogatari, and this season in particular, was able to hook me completely, despite myself not being a huge fan of drama or romance anime. The monogatari series as a whole is dialogue heavy, involving long drawn out sequences and events where two characters are simply conversing, and that doesnt't change for Monogatari Season 2. The arc structure also remains relatively the same from previous seasons. So what bumped this show from the 7 I rated Bakemonogatari, or the 9 thatI rated Nisemonogatari? \\n\\n\r\nMy main reasoning for this was the simple cohesiveness between the arcs. You can clearly see how the events of one impact the other, the time gaps are clear, and the entire series fits together like a puzzle. This season also concludes the stories of several characters, sticking to Monogatari's theme of small character casts. But it's not only the size of the cast that I'm impressed by but rather how the series is able to make your opinion of a character flip over the course of an arc, or make their departure from the series not only sad but also satisfying. The ability that Monogatari Season 2 has to do this puts it far ahead of its predecessors, earning it my ranking of 10/10.",

            "content": "Monogatari Series: Second season is split into 5 distinct arcs, very  much so like Bakemonogatari. Knowing it was going to be like this, I probably should've written my Bakemonogatari review differently, analyzing each arc individually given how different they are. I didn't do that then, but I'll do it now. Enjoy!\r\n*****\r\nNekomonogatari: Shiro is absolutely brilliant. It is the culmination of everything the Monogatari Series has been trying and wanting to do since the beginning. It is the best anime I've seen in years. Nekomonogatari: Shiro is the reason I watch anime in the first place; to every so often run into masterpieces like it.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single Monogatari arc before this always seemed a little off, like it was missing something. They felt like they just weren't reaching their full potential. Well, now with Nekomonogatari: Shiro, we get to experience what this beautiful storytelling masterpiece of a series can really do. \\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series had built these characters and their relationships so meticulously and for once we actually get to test them, tug at their edges and see what they're really made of. All of the character development the writers have put their sweat and blood into infusing with the viewer gets thrust into the spotlight. The strange structure of the series finally shines through and shows its intent. This feeling of wholesomeness and consolidation of themes and ideas is exactly what every work of fiction tries to convey. \\n\\n\r\nI'm being vague, I'll try to explain without spoilers, but if you're a stickler for spoilers, I'd suggest stopping here. I'll be talking about Nekomonogatari: Shiro's approach to conflict which would generally be spoiler free; but, in Nekomonogatari: Shiro, you don't know what the conflict is until episode 4 (the second to last episode). \\n\\n\r\nThe two main character driven arcs in the series (the crab and the cat) were set on a path of collision from the very beginning. And even before that, chronically speaking with Nekomonogatari: Kuro. This collision was logically bound to happen, but this common romance conflict is ordinarily ignored, glossed over, or simply left unresolved in most other romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nThink about it, what happens when two girls fall in love with the main character? (I'm not considering this a spoiler as it was alluded to throughout all of Bakemonogatari and explicitly pointed out in Nekomonogatari: Kuro). And not only does this conflict get addressed perfectly and elegantly in Nekomonogatari: Shiro, but the writers go way above and beyond. The writers switch the main character to Hanekawa and remove Araragi from the series altogether. This is a genius move because it serves multiple purposes:\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the switch. By pairing the viewer with Hanekawa, it isolates and emphasizes this conflict, with her being the third party to the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, by putting us in the head of a realistically tragic character that we now empathize with, it forces us now to deeply sympathize her. Empathy I would say is somewhat common in fiction as it is usually a writer\u2019s goal; but true sympathy? Now that's a hard one. I'm not sure I've ever sympathized with a character like this before. It's such a real, human conflict handled in a very human, realistic way that it makes it possible to sympathize with. I can empathize all day with main character trying to save the world, even Araragi style, but there's no way I can sympathize with him. His conflict is that he tries to save everyone. How do I sympathize with such an unrealistic and idealized conflict? \\n\\n\r\nThird, they throw you for a massive loop at the beginning. They introduce the aberration of this arc without a hint of what it is or why it's there. One of the main points of the anime is that Hanekawa herself does not address conflict, any conflict really. \\n\\n\r\nFourth, by removing Araragi altogether, it removes a lot of distractions from both Hanekawa and the viewer. This allows us to more effectively empathize with Hanekawa and truly experience how she feels. \\n\\n\r\nHandling this specific type of romance this way is extremely ingenious to the point I'm amazed another human being thought of doing it like this. It's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari: Shiro turns out to be a story of insecurity, loneliness, frustration, envy, rejection, redemption, acceptance, and forgiveness. Those are surprisingly fitting themes for a romance. And they're executed to such perfection with leading character development, unconventional structure, point of view shifts, and inventive storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the icing on the cake would have to be the flawless execution. I keep ranting about these 10/10 I'm giving this series on art and animation, but it really does count, especially with these themes. The directing, attention to detail, beautiful character designs, unique shot compositions, bright and abstract backgrounds, intricate animations, all of it is just so perfect, specifically for these themes. I've never felt frustration, worry, confusion, tragedy, or fear as effectively as these visuals made me feel today. It broke my heart. The fast cuts, the single frame walls of text, the minimalist style, I mean talk about creating a feeling of fragility and volatility. It's fleeting and simultaneously overwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nEnding thoughts:\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen any Monogatari before, you go watch this from the beginning. I'll even help you out, watch Bakemonogatari first, then Nisemonogatari, then Nekomonogatari: Kuro, then this. Easy? If you've seen those or you're watching this in chronological order like some sort of mad man, stop reading and this review and go watch Nekomonogatari: Shiro. Like now. Seriously, what are you doing? Get going. \\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari: Shiro is one of the best anime I've ever seen. It's the kind of anime I dream of watching. I see something this good maybe every couple of years and I'm always looking. \\n\\n\r\n*****\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh brother. This truly is like a Midsummer Night's Dream.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nKabukimonogatari is just filler. That quote from the last episode describes it pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have a whole lot to say about it. Boy goes back in time, messes up, has to save the world. A very generic storyline but done Monogatari Series-Style. It's not bad, just filler. They do the whole world line skipping thing from Stein's Gate so that literally nothing that happened really happened. That's why that dream quote is so fitting, it might as well have been a dream. This is totally skippable. But hey, at least you get to know Shinobu a little bit better. \\n\\n\r\n*****\\n\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari is an average arc from the Monogatari Series that tries really really hard recreate the Fight Club effect. It's done well enough, and ends with a cliffhanger. \\n\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari is another snake arc but done well with a character focus. It's interesting for what it does, but lackluster for what it tries to do. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was cool, but I can't talk a whole lot about that without spoilers. But yeah, not a whole lot to say about this one. \\n\\n\r\n*****\\n\\n\r\nOnimonogatari is one of the more somber, depressing arcs of the Monogatari Series. The first episode is an introduction, the second and third episodes are exposition, and the last episode is the one that hits home. \\n\\n\r\nIn Onimonogatari, there's no punchline, no overly done plot twist, nothing like that. The themes are managed in sequence. \\n\\n\r\nOnimonogatari is about the defiance of fate, nihilism, and death. I would call these about on par with the rest of the series as far as seriousness, but it's definitely one of the more depressing arcs. It gets you thinking about things you'd rather not think about, only because they're tragic and inevitable. \\n\\n\r\nOnimonogatari is stunning overall, and is handled by well. It's one of the arcs that will stand out among the other arcs. \\n\\n\r\n*****\\n\\n\r\nIn summary: Monogatari Series Second Season does a lot to progress the story and characters. Nekomonogatari: Shiro is by far the best arc to date. The other arcs are overall average; interesting in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR. Just more Monogatari.",

            "content": "Well, well, it's been a long run for another great season of 26 episodes for a beautiful series and it's time for a quick review:\r\nStory: If you are one of the persons who's been watching the bakemonogatari series from the beginning you should know better this season delivers another great story where \"heavy dialogue\" is one of best things and what matters at most. As we all know, Monogatari is divided in arcs in which you have to pay attention to even small details to fully understand what's involved and for the events to come. This season demonstrates one more time why people love thistype of series and the similarity with its predecessor Bakemonogatari itself; unlike Nisemonogatari, there wasn't the need to put fan-service to the max to reach the audience or rating and that's always a good thing. As a viewer, you can easily manage to marathon this series since the storytelling keeps you in your seat interested and wanting to know more. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:  Dude it's Shaft. We might never get tired of the epic SHAFT head tilt, who knows (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There's not too much to say about the characters. Each one of them has its own personality, beliefs and point of view which is one of those things that makes this series interesting. However, I must give Kaiki' seiyuu ( Miki) credit for the outstanding character performance and Nadeko's seiyuu (Kana) for the memorable school-snap moment. They deserve it. By the way ,did I mention the Loli fetish this season? DUDE, you know it (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Soundtrack: Another season, another OP/ED for each arc.The music was really appealing for my ears, somehow I'm the type of person who enjoy this songs at most while watching the animation [OP or ED] only, it just suits it perfectly. I didn't manage to pay attention to the soundtrack/insert songs  [ if there was any to begin with] , and to make a note aside, the OP song  for Kaiki's arc got me laughing hysterically  because initially I thought it was a troll song lol. Anyhow, the music was great. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nAs the story continuous, Monogatari was easily one of the best series this year. I enjoyed watching every episode with a little taste of action, romance, life lessons and other great things. I highly recommend this to anyone even if he/she is not into it. As for the fans, definitely this is a must watch and to archive ;]",

            "content": "* CONTAINS SPOILERS*\nSo another \"monogatarii\" season has ended, and this anime is good, so I'm gonna fuck around and get down to business:\nStory: Good 7.\nWhat we have is a 26 episode anime, it still maintain the usual, mystery, supernatural and horror genre, it a couple of romance, harem and comedy on the sides. Even so, it was still good to be watched, however, just like the anime itself there are some episode that were a bit annoying especially when three of the episodes are merely summaries of what has transpired from from various seasons of the monogatari series, so technically this anime is only 23episodes long. Also, it was nice that director Akiyuki Shinbo and Tomoyuki Itamura has reinvented this anime by dividing into a couple of mini series with various arc like; Tsubasa Tiger, Mayoi Jiangshi, Shinbou time, Nadeko Medusa which one might say was the longest one which the arc becomes a sub plot from the Hitagi end and of course the last arc Hitagi end. I limit this category to a seven since I cannot deny my frustration that studio Shaft has to include the 3 summaries and an additive for this anime, also I kinda feel bad that Koyomi has to reject Hanekawa's feelings for him.\\n\\n\\n\nArt and sound: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\nSince, it still uses the same art style from the previous monogatari season. and there isn't much of any intense fan service around either, also though there have been some changes with Hitagi and Hanekawa's hair style it was still minimal for me to comment about it. As for the sound, well voice actors and actress were still the same and for this anime's opening and closing, I guess neither like any of it nor do I like any of it as well.\\n\\n\\n\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\nSince, this anime was a combination of 5 mini series, one cannot focus on one character alone so let go with each of them:\\n\\n\nAraragi Koyomi: As usual he is still this knight in shinning armor kinda thing except that he's more of a weak-link, who is incapable to fighting and has to rely on Shinobu a lot, I guess one reason why I gave this category a 7, though he's good, he is is just isn't good enough and is even stupid for choosing the sadistic Hitagi over the mild manner Hanekawa in the Tsubasa tiger arc. I seems that studio Shaft put more emphasis on him to be with much younger cast that somehow show him being a lolicon.\\n\\n\\n\nHanekawa Tsubasa: In the Tsubasa tiger arc, she did manage to use her curse very well against a spiritual white tiger, her character is some what a kind where one would sympathize her for all the bad things that were happening to her, I wish that she put up a fight for Koyomi's affection towards Hitagi, hey, she did tried to kill Koyomi with her cat alter ego, so why didn't she do it to Hitagi, frankly I kinda see her as a good girl for Koyomi, unfortunately, looks like Koyomi is a masochist and has a ting for a sadist like Hitagi.\\n\\n\nMayoi Hachikuji: In this anime we see her formal departure, let's not forget that she would have already departure to the afterlife, but decide to stay, in Shinobu time, it was basically made as a memorable theme for Mayoi, in fact the Shinobu time was pretty much connected to Mayoi and not on Shinobu, I guess this is one arc where studio Shaft has messed up.\\n\\n\\n\nNadeko Sengoku: She is also one of the girls whom I wish that Koyomi would've had a relationship with, what I hate about her was being this snake goddess who still needs a lot of growing up, but I do find her yadere mode cute.\\n\\n\\n\nShinobu Oshino: Frankly her role is a mediocre one since she still serves Kyomi's partner, despite of having her own arc, it was merely a sob plot for Mayoi Jiangshi finale, but it was really nice to know about her history and that's as good as her character is for this anime.\\n\\n\nDeish\u016b Kaiki- here we saw him in a whole new way, despite of being a scheming gold digger, he somehow played as this honorable man who would have accepted the 3 million yen to abandon his Nadeko con game, but he stayed on despite of Ougi's warnings. At the last episode of the Hitagi end, I kinda feel bad for him,that he was stabbed by someone presumably that one whom he had conned which is another reason for me to give this part a score of 7, but here's a spoiler...he appeared in Suruga Devil which may be one of the arcs of Hanamonogatari.\\n\\n\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\nI can only say it in two words: 'VERY GOOD!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\nOverall: Good 7.\\n\\n\nWell, it was very enjoyable and this reinvented anime could be consider a \" GOOD ,\"  I limit it to a seven since I cannot deny my disgust for studio Shaft's idea of having to add 3 recall summaries that should have never been aired and just go on with the rest of the episodes, tbh, those summary episodes are nothing more than useless additives , as I've mentioned before.\\n\\n\nNow, on to \"Hanamonogatari\" I just hope it would be as good as this anime, The End.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I went into the Monogatari series with every intention of hating it. Watching the first couple episodes of Bakemonogatari was excruciating because I was nitpicking everything. From the conversations being boring, to the characters not making sense, anything I could think of. So how is it that a series I tried so hard to hate ended up becoming one of my favorites?\r\nThe Monogatari Second Season starts out a few months after the events of Nisemonogatari. There are no new characters introduced, but some characters receive more screen time and while they don\u2019t develop they are fleshed out somewhat. However, their contribution to the plot isalmost nonexistent or extremely spoilery so I won\u2019t spend too much time talking about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main difference in the Monogatari Second Season is the way the individual arcs are handled. In previous seasons we were following Araragi as he attempted to help various girls from problems with spirits. These arcs were told in present tense. They were \u201chappening\u201d at that moment. Us viewers were watching it unfold as an observer. That is not the case in most of the Monogatari Second Season. Instead, we are being told a story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is arguably my favorite part of this season. We are in the minds of one of these outstanding characters. We see the world the way they do, and this affects their story. For instance, if you and your friend experience the same event, two years later when telling someone about it, you may have different memories of how the event happened. This is usually due to perception. Everyone sees the world in a different light. So, this idea has been applied to the stories. Characters are perceived differently than they may be.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Araragi is usually just a goofy over the top pervert with a lolita and sister complex. However, when Hanekawa is telling us a story about an event in her life, it\u2019s hard to not see Araragi as a knight in shining armor. Her view and her love for him change how she perceives his actions. This is present in Nadeko\u2019s arc as well. How the characters perceive certain events changes as well depending on their mental stability and even their personality. The entire concept is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all made even more enjoyable simply because these are such fantastic characters. However, even outside of the characters the story is quite grand. I\u2019ve never been so intrigued in the plot of a Monogatari story arc as I was with the Second Season. Each is very well written and all are suspiciously connected, something that has not appeared in the previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOnly other thing left mentioning is, the fan service. Although, this time around it\u2019s a bit different mostly because\u2026 There isn\u2019t much. I was shocked. Other than a shower scene in the first arc where Hitagi and Hanekawa were having way too much fun taking a shower together and a quick Hachikuji skirt flip there wasn\u2019t any until the final arc, but even then that was a male. However, this just proves my previous statements that Monogatari is perfectly capable of telling a compelling story without needing to show us it\u2019s wonderful characters bodies near nude every few moments.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the praise I have given I figure it\u2019s about time to talk about my only real issue with the show. That is: The soundtrack. None of the music was particularly noteworthy other than Kaiki\u2019s theme. This also applies to the OPs. While each one was able to match the personality of the characters they were portraying and sported some great animation that fit well with the music, all were pretty basic and forgotten the moment they ended. I suppose this is only an issue with this show specifically, simply because the Monogarai series has had some truly great OPs and EDs in the past.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Monogatari Second Season took every major issue I had with the Monogatari series and remove it almost completely. For a show to do so much while also delivering a compelling story, staying true to the characters, while also adding a completely unique spin on things is absolutely incredible.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series is a series steeped in controversy, but despite it\u2019s issues I think it\u2019s a fantastic anime and one at least everyone should give a try.",

            "content": "While I've enjoyed all of the entries in the Monogatari franchise for different reasons, Monogatari Series: Second Season is the absolute highest point of the show, in my opinion. This is a layered, amazing collection of stories about (but not limited to) self-love, self-expression, regret, jealousy, hatred, and sacrifice. There is a story in this series for everyone, and I've always felt like that's the point of the Monogatari series.\r\nEvery story takes its protagonist somewhere unexpected and unique. This is in great part to the interesting and wonderful animation by Shaft, as well as the fantastic voice acting and soundtrack. I cannot recommend this showenough, but its hard when its right in the middle of so much other content. I think everyone should give the Monogatari series a chance at some point. It's a show with a little bit of something for anyone (I know I said this already.)\\n\r\nI'd like to talk about my favorite part of the second season that keeps drawing me back. I really think that the last arc of the series, Hitagi End, is the best in the franchise, behind Suruga Devil.\\n\r\nThe story focuses on the money loving, con man antagonist of Nisemonogatari, Kaiki Deishuu. He is asked by Senjougahara to save the lives  of her, Araragi, and Suruga from the wrath of young Sengoku. It could be said that Kaiki must save Sengoku from herself, as well. The arc takes on a detective story angle, which is reflected in how Kaiki changes his appearance, as well as the overall noir-esque tone that permeates the already stylistic animation. He is trying to figure out how to trick Sengoku, and it is never a boring task to watch.\\n\r\nThe arc is also called Koimonogatari, or love story, and that theme of love really comes through in everything Kaiki does. He is a very stoic, reserved person, and the story reveals much about him that brings certain decisions he made, that had been painted as evil in Nisemonogatari, into a new light. It is a fantastic story that could exist outside of the Monogatari franchise, but it is made all the more whole by being in it.\\n\r\nThe climax of the arc, which is in essence, just a conversation Kaiki has with Sengoku, is one of my favorite scenes in all of anime. The impact it had on me when I first saw it has never left me. Shinichiro Miki's voice work as Kaiki in the scene is gut wrenching, and has to be heard to be believed.\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspects of the series are all present, here. Of course, everyone has a favorite Monogatari story, and that's fine. This one holds several of mine, and Hanamonogatari is right beside it. Consider this a recommendation for that arc, too!",

            "content": "The Monogatari series is rather interesting in many ways, but the two most important things about it are its art style and the dialogues. They represent so high quality in the anime scene that even in themselves are worthy of praise, but put together they create one of the most unique shows ever made in the indusrty.\r\nIf we want to provide a simple description of the series we can say that it is about smart-ass people talking nonsense in front of beautiful, painting-like backgrounds. And it is kind of true, you can criticise the show for having too much unnesseccary conversations that don\u2019t push themain plot and that environments are so random that even a blank white wall would suffice. The almost entirely female cast has random encounters with each other and start talking about the issue at hand, but the dialogues usually take half of an episode to get a conclusion and have many sidetracks. They talk so fast that it is really hard to follow sometimes and the fast-cut stills burden the viewer with even more information.\\n\r\nThe truth is that Monogatari is not possible to enjoy to its fullest if you don\u2019t think hard about it. The unusual, supernatural main plot, although decent, is mainly used to start the witty, sarcastic and hilarious conversations which often have more layers of meaning. The seemingly random stills provide even more depth to the dialoguoes, especially because they are cut in at the perfect moments.\\n\r\nThe result is a series of clever, interwoven dialogues that are incredibly fun to listen to. All of the characters are well-developed with their personal monsters and ghosts and all of them have their problems they understand in depth. They love to think in an objective way about very subjective topics and try to outwit others by getting a few steps ahead of them. This is what makes Monogatari incredible: it forces the viewer to think along with the cast, otherwise their motivations remain a secret and their actions lack any logic. What they do would usually make no sense in a real world setting, but the supernatural setting enables them to engage discussions that otherwise would never happen. \\n\r\nMonogatari is not for everyone, it really misses a firm storyline, action is rare and the dialogues require a rather certain taste. But if you enjoy the taste, it is something you must see.\\n",

We are presented an insight on her family life , revealing her disconnected relationship with her parents .The dialogue scenes contribute further in revealing more of her character and emotional mindset.With the use of the beautiful symbolic aesthetics and theme of identity we are presented her struggles to find a place to belong a place where she can be her true self  a place called home. The conclusion of the first act is a lesson of philosophy and morals about human mind and heart and a relief  for Hanekawa\u2019s weight that plunder her heart and mind for so many years.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for the second act now Kabuki monogatari , a eccentric and fascinating play where our the bond between our two actors Araragi and Shinobu is questioned. The author used elements from the sci-fi domain such as time travel and parallel worlds  to portray a message about bonds, memories, sacrifice  and encounter.The weight of losing someone dear to us is portrayed for its viewer using a metaphorical  content such as world destruction  and a eerie atmosphere to signal a warning and message about us human who notice the important things for us only after we lose them. As we reach the conclusion of the act the play creates an emotional atmosphere to convey a message about sacrifice and the weight called loneliness . \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for the third act , a play about selfishness and human nature portrayed with the help of our character Nadeko. The story reveals an insight about her life  and the way others perceive her in the society . She is the realistic embodiment of  the foolishness and indecision of many teenagers in our society . The script is meant to make her be hated by the crowd and her actions  help further in  her characterization . \\n\\n\r\nWe take a break from the third act and go into the fourth act Onimonogatari where we go further into the aberrations world.  As our character Shinobu tells her story we found out more about the rule of the aberrations and what gives meaning to their existence. The story turns into a philosophy lesson about the balance in the world and morals about what is the best course of action to save a person who is dear to us. Again the details and dots from the other series are connected and help with the conclusion of the fourth act .\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for the 5 and final act in our play Koimonogatari a story told from the perspective of our main star Kaiki.It\u2019s a story about the contrast between fake and real a story that gives a purpose to all the actions and subtle details  from the other series giving a meaning . In this play we are shown a different side for our two main actors Kaiki and Senjougahara that contribute in their fabulous characterization across the play.  Kaiki\u2019s actions and confrontation between him and Nadeko bring forth a message about decisions, dreams,love and wishes. \\n\\n\r\nThe play portrays the contrast between gods and humans from the Japanese society portraying the habits and customs of the people . Those customs turn into a lesson of philosophy and morals about the limits of a god and the advantage of being a human. The conclusion is a strong message about dreams ,love and wide variety of things life brings forth for each person. A lesson of moving on and not being stuck into the past overcoming the struggles that lie ahead and enjoying the benefits from it called happiness. The curtain falls and the play is over but the final message is delivered through the last scene with the help of our character Kaiki. It\u2019s a cruel and realistic lesson about the fact that you reap what you sow .\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion SS of Monogatari Series is a unique medium of story telling from the anime industry . It uses rich and beautiful visual vocabulary and animal symbolism to portray the characters emotional state and mindset , a different style of writing from the author in each series and finally the dialogue and details from other series to connect every piece of puzzle creating the big image called Monogatari Series .\\n\r\nA masterpiece both in visual story telling and characterization.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10.\\n",

It's my first review on here so I do hope I become of help. Now, don't get me wrong, I chose to take it easy after the episode where the eruption of accumulated stress happened rather than work with a crippling sense of impending doom each day and now-- in short yay me.\r\nI consider it luck to have watched Nekomonogatari first among the others, being an ex-otaku finding her way back - no knowledge whatsoever from where I left off - ofthe whole Monogatari line up. I was stunned (I am a fan of any sensually pleasant anime) at the beautiful artwork and at how short it was. I wasn't quite satisfied with Nekomonogatari tbh so I almost forgot about it until later on after endless hours of soul searching I read about Bakemonogatari. I thought \"well, this sounds like something I've seen before,\" so I went ahead and checked it out. It was the sequel. The thing ran on. 3 more seasons. The 4 episode thing actually had--\\n\\n\r\nI was glad it did. As it's got great artwork, humour, characters, storyline, scenes, music, voice actresses and actors (name all the contributing factors to good anime by my sensual standards), it's made it's way to the top of my favorites list. The way Monogatari portrays scenarios where two people are merely talking to each other and makes it look, feel and sound like how they want the watchers to feel about it is stunning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI guess that's all, everyone. What are you gonna do with all these irrelevant opinionated thoughts?\\n\\n\r\nTo kuuurt from the previous reviews, Gaen Izuko is not Oshino's niece.",

            "content": "\"If you can't recognize it, it doesn't exist.\" \r\nAt the very least, that's the conclusion the human mind reaches. - Araragi Koyomi(Monogatari Series - Second Season - Episode 17)\r\nMonogatari series has always been weird, but in a good way. I mean, it's weird, but, it's not 'confusingly' weird. It's a first for me to find such a 'weird' series I seriously got hooked into. Oh yeah, unique is the perfect word for the monogatari series. More like, weirdly-unique. Many series have come before Monogatari which tried the same concept, but ended up leading its viewers into confusion.\r\nStory : 10\r\nLet's start off with the first arc:Nekmonogatari. Nekomonogatari is quite different from the previous seasons(remember the two-part OVA titled the same? This one's different from that, so worry not)Hanekawa Tsubasa's the one telling the story in these episodes unlike from other seasons which Araragi was the one telling the stories. As I've said, it's Nekomonagatari(Cat Story. As if you didn't know what Neko means) Araragi won't show up that much in this arc(not until the end of the arc), but, you'll get enough fan service from Senjougahara to compensate for it. The arc's heavily focused on Hanekawa, she'll deal with a new problem which will change her for the rest of the series. I don't want to spout some spoilers, so I'll stop with Nekomonagatari.\\n\\n\r\nSecond story is titled Twistory. Araragi's back on being the story teller. At the first scene, we're introduced to a new character, Oshino Oumi, a creepy girl with pitch-black eyes, although her appearance is just a cameo. The story's about Mayoi, though. And let me tell you, Hachikuji won't have that much of air-time even if the story is kinda about her. Well, Araragi will be telling the story again this time. He and Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade(Shinobu) will be the main stars in this arc. Oh yeah, throw in some Time Paradoxes on it too.\\n\\n\r\nOtori Monogatari: Nadeko Medusa is the third arc featured in Monogatari season two. Pretty much like Nekomonagatari, Nadeko is telling this one, though. You'll pretty much enjoy Kana Hanazawa's calm and soft voice in this arc(I guarantee that). Oshino Ougi will once again make a cameo in this one. And Nadeko's yandere side will come out in this arc, so please do watch out! It'll leave you hanging, though, but not for long.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth story happened around the time Hanekawa was telling the story, it's the first arc to be precise. Onimonogatari. And, this time, again, Araragi is back on being the story teller. The story starts with Araragi and Hachikuji witnessing \"it\". Yes, \"it\". A Darkness that can't be seen. Confusing, no? Well, Monogatari has always been confusing. And Ononoki Yotsugi finally gets her well-deserved air-time(Araragi's loli brigade just keeps on getting better, doesn't it?)! BANZAI!!! And finally, Shinobu's first servant will be introduced, the man who carried Heart Span(Shinobu's loooooooong sword) and Dream Span(a not-so-long sword) originally, not personally though. Shinobu's going to tell a story about him; a story 400 years ago. It's really good to hear about Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade's past, she never wanted to speak any of it in the previous seasons. The arc's ending one of the most shocking event ever in Monogatari.\\n\\n\r\n5th and Final arc: Araragi and Senjougahara's Koi Monogatari; literally Love Story. This time we'll have a unique story teller, Kaiki Deishuu, an anti-hero character, the one who tricked Senjougahara from Bakemonogatari is telling us the story. I can't give you anymore details about this arc. You need to finish Nadeko's arc to understand what's happening. It may have a different story teller, but the arc's still focused on what happened in Nadeko's arc. We'll get to know Kaiki Deishuu even more at this arc. His decieving skills, his funny side, and definitely, his serious talking skills. I'm surprised by his last speech in episode 26; I didn't even knew this guy could spout that much sense! Bravo, Kaiki, bravo.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari has one of the past-paced stories I've ever watched. Sure, it'll raise a lot of questions because a lot of things aren't explained clearly. But the feeling of wanting to know what happened makes you want to watch more of it. Monogatari made it juuuuuuust right not to make it's viewers get annoyed with things they didn't know. Of course Monogatari didn't always offer answers in a silver platter to it's viewers.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nShaft has never failed to amuse me with it's art and tilting heads. Monogatari has one of the greatest art these days. Characters were fully detailed, backgrounds are cool. And the way they censor blood is gorgeously brilliant. Ever since the first season I've always noticed the unique background Monogotari has. And again, \"weirdly-unique\" becomes the very description of it. For example, in a particular scene, the backgrounds' color changes in a matter of few zoom-ins and zoom-outs. And Araragi's house is full of \"weird\" furnitures; it looks like a movie set filled with lots' of lamps(I don't know the details, though. Maybe his parents do like those lamps). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10\\n\r\nThis season, we get to know a lot more characters than the other seasons. The character that piqued my interest the most is Kaiki Deishuu(he's officialy my favorite character now). A guy who's an anti-hero, and a guy who gets away with just simply spouting lies. A perfect liar(its not wrong to idolize him, right?). A lot of characters are introduced in this season, most of them were present in the other seasons, but didn't get they're air-time like the Mains. Ononoki gets her air-time, Gaen Izuko is introduced, Oshino Ougi is introduced, as well.\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 8\\n\r\nI love how they made the third opening with a Yandere feel with it. \"There's no escape from my love. \"You're all that matters. There's only thing I want. Everything, everything, everything, everything.\" - Lyrics from the third OP. Woooohoooo! Yey for Yandere! Sengoku's really turning into a hardcore Yandere. Enough about Sengoku Nadeko's(Kana Hanazawa) cutesy yandere-like Opening, let's get on with Hanekawa Tsubasa's(Yui Horie) Insomnia Chocolate! As usual, Yu Horie adds another great OP theme. I love Kaiki's theme too, an uknown slow music. And as for the the other OSTs, they're fairly good, too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\nSome anime sites identifies Monogatari as an ecchi series, well it's not entirely wrong though. Of course it's one of the many reasons why Monogatari is quite famous(they don't rely on 'Plots' to save their story though.). But I'm telling you, honestly, most shows today relies heavily on fan services to pull in viewers. Sure, you can tell it's part of the show. That's okay if the show is a harem, comedy, romcom, thingy type. But some overuse it(in fact, a lot of them do), making they're viewers think a panty shot is so common they won't even look at it twice. Sometimes it's better to not show someone's undies rather than showing them off like a badge. Personally, skin shots appeal to me more than breast groping, breast going into the face of the MC, breast here, breast there. But that's the market today. For some viewers, Fan service defeats Plot. Or as they say, 'Plots' defeats Plot(if you know what I mean.). Okay, sorry. I should be making a review about Monogatari, but, I'm spouting things about other shites. There's more to appreciate about Monogatari than the fan services they offer; having fan services from it should be considered a big bonus. Monogatari tends to have looooong conversations, which is not entirely wrong, since it was a light novel originally. But don't get me wrong though, they're long but they're not boring; they're not just nonsensical conversations.\\n\r\nSome episodes are entirely focused on dialouges, so don't blame yourself if you get pretty bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\nI haven't read any Monogatari light novels other than Kizumonogatari(Story about Shinobu and Araragi's first encounter; and the first arc of the whole series). So I don't know if the light novels were like what happened in this season(but I think it's completely alike). What I mean is, the ones telling the story. In the past previous seasons, we only have Araragi as the story teller. Hanekawa Tsubasa, Sengoku Nadeko, and Kaiki Deishuu are story tellers in this season. This is the longest of the three seasons, too. Containing 26 episodes with 5 arcs on it; and two arcs ending with a shocker. Man, you'll shed a tear or two in one of the arcs who's ending is unexpected. Yes, I am biased. Who the heck cares? I gave it a 9 because I enjoyed it a lot. Yes, some parts were boring as f, but Kaiki's arc was enough for me to give the whole series a 9. Overall, you might not give Monogatari a score over 8, it's understandable. Like I've said, the season's pretty much focused on dialouges. It doesn't have the action scenes of the previous seasons. But Hanekawa's arc did have some great action scenes. With this, I've finally finished my review. Laters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*** SPOlLER ALERT ***\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWHY DID MAYOI HAD TO VANISH?! Mayoi's one of my favorite Loli, so it's kinda frustrating she's gone.\\n\r\nWHY DID KAIKI DIED?! I liked the guy, for God's sake! And he was killed by a little fucking brat! Even Sengoku Nadeko(snake-god) wasn't able to kill him! Why must every great character die when they've done something good?! Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh---!\\n\r\n* leaves computer and mumbles curses on the one who killed Kaiki *\\n",

            "content": "~ People have to save themselves. ~\r\n~ PRELUDE\r\nAs chronological sequel to the events of the the beloved \"Bakemonogatari\", and contraversial \"Nisemonogatari\" installments: \"2nd Season\", is the fourth, and longest, multiple arc addition to the \"Monogatari\" series. Up until this point, the various \"Monogatari\" installments have become increasingly specific, and consequently adopted more narrow scopes. None of them with anywhere near as much comparable coverage in terms of sheer plot development, as \"Bakemonogatari\". However, with the birth of Nisio's \"2nd Season\" in 2013, SHAFT have put an end to this trend, and provided more Monogatari-oriented substance than you could ever shake a stick at. Ladies andgentlemen: Bakemonogatari version 2.0.\\n\\n\r\n2nd Season is the resurgence of fragmented, multi-arc storytelling, and whereas Nekomonogatari was edging back towards its \"Bake-\" roots, It's never been more blatent than in this 26 episode season, that SHAFT wanted to create the second incarnation, of the 2009 \"bit hit\". So rest assured fans, that\\n\r\nneither the series' signature style, nor its overriding drive of \"overcoming personal demons\", hath been tainted...\\n\\n\r\nBut whereas the format is relatively unchanging, this is by no means a reflection of the content itself. 2nd Season is all about grand, and impactful leaps for each of the concerned characters. And while both vampires and people getting cut in half can be considered dark... what you're about to start\\n\r\nwatching is considerably darker, in emotional regards.\\n\\n\r\n~ INTRODUCTION\\n\r\nThe season is an adaptation of 5 arcs, and so; far from simplistic: 2nd Season adopts a relatively perplexing timeline. With the contrast and segmented\\n\r\nedginess of \"Bake\", and the moral glossing and fluidity of \"Nise\": 2nd Season is the best of both worlds in this respect. And so while returning to the\\n\r\nall-familiar, apparition-plagued \"Monogatari\" lands, these episodes extend from \"Bakemonogatari's\" style, with additional consideration of cohesiveness.\\n\\n\r\nBy comparison of atmosphere, 2nd Season feels like a somewhat nostalgic, and parralel turn of events. Even though in reality, it is an eye-opening\\n\r\ncontinuation that breaks the prior established bounds of our female protagonists at the very least; hence \"Impactful leaps\". It largely improves the viewer's assorted contextual knowledge, as well as bringing forth another dimension to many of the characters.\\n\r\nIn perspective, 2nd Season is an almost incomprehensibly large-scale addition to all aspects of the series, and in my opinion, it doesn't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\n~ STORY AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\\n\r\n2nd Season stays true to its predecessors, by fleshing out beautifully integrated, and vivid stories; primarily in the form of dialogue. Story development\\n\r\nis of the utmost importance for the following 624 minutes, as we're presented with a radically impactful and dramatic turn of events to say the least.\\n\r\nIt was powerful, it was emotional, it was comprehensive, and intense. I'm in awe with how engaging, and unpredictable this show turned out to be. And whereas Bakemonogatari claimed to have it all, 2nd Second had considerably more fluidity, and read more like an engaging story, than artistic expression alone. It doesn't feel at all manufactured, and this adds a great deal more \"personality\" to the mix. Now this term is used loosely, but it entails that things became more plausible on an emotional level: relationships are more comprehensively documented... and perhaps all of this additional story-oriented merit is derived from the fact that everything is streamlined, and nigh-on perfectly interwoven with this 4th installment. There are even flashbacks, and confidently used time-manipulating methods: which further the comprehensiveness of the understandably fast-paced, though thoroughly worthwhile all-embracing plot. \\n\\n\r\nCome decent integration of story elements, comes this explorative and \"boundless\" feeling story line. The integration aspect actually goes the extent that it becomes  hard to distinguish character merit, from story merit. But I digress, on this front... 2nd Season treats us to a substantial and meaningful turn of events, that set the stage for us to explore Hanekawa, Hachikuji, Shinobu, Nadeko and Kaiki (primarily) in a completely different light.\\n\\n\r\nThe 5th and final arc being the most worthy of credit, as in addition to giving an intimate insight into the MC's perspective, it was the epitome of drama. Following the last few episodes was therefore my highlight of the show, as It posed so many questions, and went into so many levels of deception.\\n\r\nYou could use the term \"thought-provoking\", and that still wouldn't do it any justice. Arc 5 just generally stood out to me as even more so immersive, with a more so severe looming suspense; like you might expect from an action-thriller.\\n\r\nThe whole show closed off neatly, but went out with a BANG on episode 26 to say the least...\\n\\n\r\nContinuing with this theme, I reiterate the relevance of the term \"leap\". For the primarily documented characters in 2nd Season take great leaps/bounds/strides in terms of development. Watching 2nd Season with the prior knowledge of only its predecessors, is like an epiphany...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters undeniably remain interesting, with their well-defined and quirky personalities. The main pull-factor here though, being the massive amount of personal development each of those featured, goes through. As the season presses on, we begin to observe the arcs changing the nature primarily of our female protagonists, alike in \"Bakemonogatari\".  2nd Season unlocks a whole new level and depth of understanding for a large number of characters. The viewer is able to connect emotionally, as this comprehensive character development serves as a whole new level of understanding of our casts' personalities. It builds upon the foundation almost faultlessly, and some of these \"changes of heart\" are pretty extreme!\\n\\n\r\nPut it this way: \"Bakemonogatari\" is only half of the story, as far as character exposure is concerned.\\n\r\nThere's a lot for you to find out! :)\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\n~AUDIOVISUALS\\n\r\nThe animation is of the familiar, love it/hate it art style of which \"Monogatari\" viewers should already be acquainted with. It's particularly \"abstract\" as an outsider might remark, but overall: this highly stylized, simplistic, and conversely vivid art allows the show to be expressive beyond compare. So gear up for more visual metaphors, more obscure illustrations, and text. 2nd Season has fortunately retained the series' immortalized signature presentation style, if not: diversified it further; with a marginally increased scene-setting quality in particular. \\n\\n\r\nDark and lamenting when it wants to be, light and cheery when it wants to be, too!\\n\r\nThe \"Monogatari\" series has always prided itself in its expressive audiovisuals, and 2nd Season is no exception when it comes to the sound aspect either. While being noticeably authentic-feeling, the show's score corresponds to the type of feeling each scene is supposed to convey. It's an adaptive, and highly fitting BGM that provides a pleasant sensory experience, and subtly adds to the tone of every audible minute, nicely.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, alike in \"Bakemonogatari\", we're treated to 5 brand new opening sequences, which sound great, and appropriately work exploratively to convey the nature of each character's arc (in their own way). An OP/ED sequence is never the most important thing to consider: but once again, the producers of 2nd Season have done 5 times what many franchises cannot accomplish once...\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\n~DOWNSIDES\\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that admittedly, i'm getting blood out of a stone here...\\n\r\nWe as viewers have boundless imaginations and wild expectations corresponding to our own, illogical, and perhaps picky, personal tastes. It means that we're not likely to ever find an anime that is complete perfection, but Monogatari 2nd Season cuts it comparatively close, at least for me. Some things that hindered it include...\\n\\n\r\nMost significantly, Kanbaru's character was neglected in terms of development, and barely featured at all in the show. I maintain that it was still incredible without her, but I can't help but feel that \"a piece of the puzzle is missing.\" Furthermore, Hachikuji and Shinobu's arcs are quite misleading, as Shinobu is relatively distant in her own arc, but steals the spotlight during Hachikuji's, and vise versa. This was definitely not a deal breaker, but I'm surprised that the SHAFT perfectionists didn't rectify this imbalance. Being rather fast-paced, having to incorporate 5 arcs: character interactions slipped at times, such as during Hachikuji's highly contextual arc, and so my level of engagement fluctuated at times.\\n\\n\r\n~FINISH\\n\r\nRegardless, I can emerge with my head held high, and proclaim that this anime is a masterpiece!\\n\r\nIt adds such a vast amount to your \"Monogatari pool of knowledge\", and it's simply beyond what words can accurately describe.\\n\r\nIt's dramatic, and engaging, and yadda yadda yadda I've just written an essay about it.\\n\\n\r\nGO WATCH IT, BECAUSE THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT DOING SO (If you're a \"Monogatari\" fan), IS THAT AT SOME POINT: It will end.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\n~ Once person saving another is impossible ~\\n",

            "content": "\"What in the hell is that boy doing\" - Kaiki Deishu\r\nI like to believe there are 4 types of anime in this world. Meat, Vegetables, Candy and well, we don't talk about the last type\r\nAnime like Fullmetal Alchemist or Death Note are meat type anime. They fill the stomach, are enjoyable and provide an overall pleasant experience of the genre.\r\nThen there are candy type anime. Fanservice laden slice of life shows that initially are fun but can get very repetitive over time and end up making one sick and unhealthy if consumed in mass quantities. Although nice in small amounts, too much can cause problemslater down the line (See bodypillows and waifu shrines)\\n\\n\r\nBut what about the vegetables. These are certainly a staple of every meal, so where do they fit in my bizarre comparison review. This is what the Monogatari series falls\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series, especially this season included, is pretty much like watching a book. It's an audiovisual representation of the internal and external dialogue many characters face, with plenty of eyecandy along the way. Shaft does an excellent job of keeping the viewer occupied during stretches of long dialogue, but there are still many parts that can result in a few yawns. This is where my metaphor comes in\\n\\n\r\nLike vegetables, the positive effect of the Monogatari series may not be apparent after the first ingestion. It takes time to realize how truly awesome this series is. I'm not saying you'll need to wait until the clouds of nostalgia blind you, but if you give it a few weeks, you'll look back on it as a positive experience. It's a weird series that I can only compare to Jojo but for very different reasons\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, if you liked the first 2 parts, you'll love this. I wasn't as big of a fan of either Bake or Nise and certainly didn't find Kizu good (The CGI made me physically sick) but this season certainly stepped things up a notch in story wise. I may be biased because it contains my favorite \"Arc\" (Otorimonogatari) and a double feature of my favorite character, but fear not because all are represented. \\n\\n\r\nArt is standard shaft material (Superb), same for the sound. Overall, you'll find it to be a very thought provoking albeit slightly dull at some points series that you won't regret watching, even if it doesn't become apparent at first",

So far the best in the series, this season touches the true epitome of what anime entails, both in story, emotion, and art, you can even finding yourself in love with characters you were earlier made to hate.\r\nThe bits of reckless art that were toyed with in Bakemonogatari have settled down to a reasonable rate. In short, they improved from where they left off with Bakemonogatari, leaving Nisemonogatari aside.\r\nStory: (9) Without giving anything away its difficult to talk about.

Some arcs like Nekomonogatari Shiro was mostly a disappointment and boring due to most of it repeating the events of Nekomongatari Kuro, that arc for me was around a 6/10.\r\nBut then you have some the likes of Koimonogatari and Onimonogatari ( If im not mistaken is the darkness arc ) whichwere just utterly splendid a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has its ups and downs, having the best arcs Monogatari have ever produced to the most boring arcs in the whole story.

            "content": "I was going to give this series a 6 or lower until the last arc. Most of Monogatari is boring, and this series is replete with recap episodes. I believe there are three in total, which for a 26 episode series is pretty bad. Fortunately, Kaiki comes in in the last arc and saves this anime. If it was just that 6 episode arc I would have given this show a 10/10.\r\nI'm just going to use the rest of this space to waste words because apparently I can't submit that as a review. I think that my assessment of the Monogatari series and why Itypically give them a low score is dead on. I am unsure why most people are complete fanatics over this show.\\n\\n\r\nKaiki was, in my opinion, the best character this show had. If the show had followed him from the beginning, and he had a bigger role, then I'd rate most of the other series higher.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately we're left with Koyomi Araragi. I'm not even going to kid when I say that he's quite the creep, and I'm not sure why he has collected quite the harem as a young man. He's kind-hearted, and his relationship with Hachikuji can only be ascribed the title of a child molester. I'm not sure why most of the other girls that witness his actions concerning her haven't reported him to the police. I'm confused if that's supposed to be played up for humor as if it is it's downright bizarre. Even the Japanese, I think, would have a limit to the amount of sexual harassment they'd allow.\\n\\n\r\nAraragi is also given the role of Tuxedo Mask in the original Sailor Moon series. That is, he'll show up, say something, and then immediately get trashed. I'm so over that, it's too predictable.",

(At the time of this review)\r\nIt was an emotional ride that kept me thinking constantly, it brought characters stories to a satisfying end. It was a story that kept me going, kept me wanting more. Until the end.\r\n[Story] 9/10 - Like the other counterparts to this series, it has been split up into several arc or parts. Each arc/part focusing on one character at a time with a set cast of said characters. This isnot a bad thing, in fact it's the anime's unique way of structuring their story. Making everything in the stories more effective more meaningful. Visual storytelling plays a massive role in this anime, in fact the plot is already hard enough to decrypt but once you do it truly becomes an amazing thing.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 10/10 - I have always absolutely loved the wonderful eye candy that is this show! It's unique art style makes every character, every background a joy to look at. There is not one scene, not one! That I hated to look at. Every single scene was amazing! While this anime uses a very stiff pivital style of animation most of the time, it really does just fit the tone of the show. Even when character move or are animated fully, it is done with such care, such heart that it looks like they poured their soul into each frame.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 10/10 - If you are a film maker or an animator and you want to convey a scene. Watch this anime and learn from it. Every single scene uses a perfect music choice. Even knowing when and when not to use music. This makes some scenes really intense, while in reality it's just two characters talking about something mundane. This anime has no OP and no ED. Which makes room for more story and more character development so it's not really a loss.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 9/10 - The one reason this is not a 10, is because some of the characters are horribly confusing. Some of them I had to watch scenes over and over again just to notice the visual story telling element that went along with them. Each character is usually developed through something really subtle, this is not a bad thing. In fact if it makes the viewer think about their character, think about their emotions and why they feel that way makes the character just that more lovable.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10 - I watched this anime alone and in my opinion, that's the way it should be watched. This is a very psychological anime, making me think, making me rewatch scenes. In my opinion this is a work of art, this is not something that you and a couple of friends throw on to your tv and watch. This is something that you should binge watch in one sitting, this is something that you should be thinking about. I had an absolute blast watching this anime, it has left a major impression on me. I would rewatch certain scenes over and over again purely because they were that good.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 9.5/10 - This is so close to being my favorite anime of all time. Truly. But the story wasn't really connected that well and the characters weren't perfect. If MAL would let me rate something with a 9.5 this would be it. I love this anime.\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? YES. If you are a lover of this series like I am. This would be one of the best entries. So please do not dawdle here, go watch this anime, right now. \\n\\n\r\nIf today is your Birthday, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nHave a wonderful rest of your day everyone!\\n",

It's enjoyable to see that she became so crazy, how she drove herself to creating darkness and accidently becoming a vessel for god through self-delusion. \\n\r\nHachikuji Mayoi and her understanding of the death and life concept and how afterlife has affected her, her arc also overlaps with Shinobu's thoughts during Bake and catches your interest through this \"what if\" storyline, also gives some development to Kisshot Heartunderblade version of Shinobu and her relationship with Araragi and the nature of these evil spirits overall too. Shinobu's arc itself is an interesting story, but kinda lacks symbolism, 2deep4u meanings and other things that make other arcs so great.\\n\r\nDisappearance of Hachikuji and that atmosphere of mysterious Ougi and how she is connected to all of this is very interesting.\\n\r\nThen there is the final arc called Hitagi's end which gives us more Senjougahara and how she was trying to deal with Nadeko's death threat to her and Araragi through contacting her old enemy. It's because of how well written Senjougahara's dialogue is, she feels like a very realistic Hard-talker, and the visuals, the soundtrack and the dialogue between her and Kaiki make it probably one of the most memorable scenes of the last arc.\\n\r\nWhile i still felt all the arcs were a little to dark for my taste (Hanekawa's mental problems, Nadeko becoming an evil god because of unrequited love, Hachikuji dissapearing, Kisshot destroying the world in other timeline because she wasn't wanted, Kaiki's death even though he is an antagonist, but still is probably the most unique character in all of the Monogatari installments, mysterious Ougi manipulating things behind the scenes) i still enjoyed the tone change from Nise, while keeping fun and fanservice in (Senjougahara and Hanekawa's shower scene, Shinobu and Ononoki with Mayoi harem scene in Shinobu's arc and other things like that.",

I thoroughly enjoyed it, I found it to be a quirky and refreshing take on the harem genre with some interesting Japanese folklore thrown in. I later decided to watch Nise and was much less satisfied, although there were moments of true greatness present (I particularly enjoyed the scene with Mayoi in the first episode). While I thought of the Monogatari series as \"good\" at this point, I never understood why it was considered to be great.Why time and time again I had been recommended it by several friends. I never saw the series fulfill its true potential.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari Second Season surpasses any expectations I could have ever had for such an experience.\\n\\n\r\nA recurring trend throughout this season is arcs focused on narration from a perspective different from the protagonist of Araragi that has become the normalcy for the series. I will come outright and say that this decision is a genius one, and the series is elevated to a completely new height everytime Araragi is out of the picture. I don't actively dislike him, in fact I did enjoy the two arcs he had this season, but the three in which he is barely present are without a doubt some of the strongest stories I've seen told through anime.\\n\\n\r\nHanekawa Tsubasa takes the helm at the first arc, and from her viewpoint we see a new side of both herself and series staple(hah) Senjougahara. Its touching to see their friendship that has developed, even if it had at first only started as a result of Senjou's fear of Hanekawa. Hanekawa's narration is thoughtful and flows elegantly; very reflective of her intelligent personality. I will say I was not very invested in the supernatural aspects of this arc but Hanekawa's development comes to a nice close here.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where we get to the good stuff: Nadeko Medusa. This is where my opinion on the Monogatari series as a whole would change forever. This arc manages to deliver the complete unexpected without relying on shock value or anything as shallow as the sort. Nadeko's perspective and experiences with the rest of the cast had my opinion towards them shift drastically, I actively disliked the people around her for treating her this way. I wanted her to fight back. I wanted her to kill Araragi and his smug ass companion. This shift is something I've never really felt before in a show, and it could only have been accomplished with such a different point of view as Nadeko's. Truly excellent anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think the past paragraphs have been my true opinions on the series but no, you're completely wrong. Those arcs are mere time wasters, comparative to trash, when brought up against Hitagi End. Kaiki is the best goddamn character I've come across in years. He completely changes the show with his presence; raising every single character he talks with to a new height and revealing their flaws - even those of the perfect Senjou - for all to see. Hearing the cynical viewpoint of the previous season's villain as he narrates his tale of lies and deceit is an experience I will never forget. Truly enjoyable anime that every fan of the medium has a right to see. Nadeko's character arc comes to a surprising and, honestly, inspiring end here as well. And Kaiki ends the arc with fulfilling his promise of acting as an unreliable narrator by killing himself, the reluctant protagonist we have come to love, off in the most unfulfilling and boring way possible. Except he didn't die, as he appears at a much later date in the series. Kaiki cons you out of the ending you desired. Fucking brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways this is really all just late night ramblings after I finished a great series that I wanted to talk about, and the score I've given is pretty meaningless, I don't really believe one's enjoyment can be measured by a numerical value alone. What matters is I enjoyed this show a hell of a lot.",

            "content": "Before I start, I want to say it\u2019s been two years since I last wrote a review here, not because I wasn't interested, but because I thought my writing and judging skills were bad, but well, two years passed and here I am writing a review again, I\u2019m writing this because as soon as I finished Monogatari Second Season, I felt an urge to write something telling how incredible this anime was to me, how many things it teached me and maybe, motivate more people to know the series.\r\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I guess you already watched Second Season prequels and enjoyed them or not,or maybe you haven\u2019t watched even Bakemonogatari, or you are reading this after you finished watch this or the entire series and is looking for overall opinions. Why I\u2019m saying this? Simple, if you liked the prequels you will like this one and should read further, otherwise you should stop reading because Second Season is has the same style as Bakemonogatari. Almost the same goes for someone who haven\u2019t watched the prequels and for someone looking for opinions on the matter, so read further if you want.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): Monogatari has a unique story and dialogues, that\u2019s for sure, anyone that watched at least 1 episode or a random scene somewhere, knows that a simple dialogue can end up turning into a complex discussion that defies principles and the true nature of mankind, or even a dumb fanservice scene is able to become hot all of sudden.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari Series Second Season truly stands out for me for one reason, it focuses mostly on one thing, \u201chappiness\u201d, as opposed to the prequels that had many messages and issues to talk about. Focusing only on one emotion allows for a much more intense reflexion about principles, what the society think it\u2019s right and how you should act to be like a \u201cnormal person\u201d, and more importantly, understading other peoples feelings and learning that even if someone says that they are ok, they might not be ok at all, for example.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I think every anime fan should at least give it a try and enjoy the story, chances of you having a change in your personality are high, especially since hapinness is a relatable thing that almost every single human being has felt, as opposed to parental abuse that is something that appears many times during the series. So the series doesn\u2019t stand out because of the dialogue, but because of how almost every single dialogue has a meaning, and this season takes it to the next level.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): There are a lot of characters in Monogatari Series, and every single one of them is different from each other, that makes almost impossible for the viewer to hate all of the characters, but I\u2019m not going into details about this, I\u2019m going straight into the point of this topic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this season are much better presented and developed, often you will found them doing something that contributes to the arc that they first appeared on the Season and even to arcs that they don\u2019t appear, even the smallest action makes a difference at some point, they have a much bigger background overall, specially Shinobu and Kaiki playing an even bigger role than in the prequels, doing this certainly makes the viewer cares about the characters, understand their reasons and emotions, making a great build up to major events.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (10/10): The art is almost the same as the prequels, but they clearly made a constrat on what\u2019s important, so the viewer can always know on what he should put his focus. About the animation, it\u2019s incredible as always, smooth movements and amazing fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): Monogatari Series soundtrack in overall never was a great point for me, and this doesn\u2019t change here, in fact you you would expect that Shaft would make a new soundtrack for the Second Season, but it\u2019s full of reutilized tracks. Personally I think the way the characters talk is pretty realistic, so when they are screaming because of pain for example, you are able to know that hurted like hell.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Monogatari Series Second Season is a masterpiece, that should be watched by every fan of the series, and almost every anime fan obviously, I\u2019m talking about every anime fan that has patience to watch 2-4 episodes with only dialogues basically, think about them and enjoy the build up that those episodes prepared to the cl\u00edmax. Anyone that is able to do that, can appreciate the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the ultimate lesson that this season thaught me was that it doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t be what you want to be, because you can be anything you want except that, so why become sad? Everything in this world is replacable even your dreams.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 10/10 \\n\\n",

            "content": "This review will be about the significance of what makes this series exceptional, with emphasis on Otorimonogatari, the Nadeko Medusa arc. Basically, I will be discussing the brilliance of how this anime tells its story in a way that we can subconsciously understand. I will not be taking the traditional approach and grade the Story, Art/Animation, Sound and Character, but I do have my reasons for their score. If you are interested in them, you can message me.\r\nDisclaimer: This review is not spoiler-free.\r\nThis is a series not necessarily concerning oddities, but more about human beings and their interactive role that deals with or produces oddities.And these oddities are real, so long as you believe they are. You'll find that there is a lot of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOne quote that has made me understand the Monogatari premise comes from Bakemonogatari, and it is this:\\n\r\n\"We must be believed in, dreaded, feared, shunned, revered, respected, hated, loathed, prayed to. That's why we exist.\" - \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u7fbd\u5ddd, Burakku Hanekawa\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about anime is that people think it's supposed to be predictable.. That if you can classify certain characters, then those characters are suddenly defined.\\n\r\nAlthough making such judgments of the characters in the Monogatari series would simplify them, and prove to be an inaccurate representation of who they are.\\n\r\nYou can hardly stereotype the characters of Monogatari. The Monogatari series breaks the mold, and shows us that characters can be more than and be beyond our preconceived notions.\\n\r\nI'm sure you understand if you've ever felt before the judgments of other people about you are inaccurate/wrong, and so you could understand... the complexity of human beings.\\n\r\nIn the eyes of Sengoku Nadeko, we see that people are fixated on her \"cuteness\" more than anything. Everyone has an unchanging perception on her. But although it is common to judge someone based on their appearance, the Monogatari series shows that this character (who seemed to have no business being in the series) isn't so one-dimensional after all. Even as a character of fiction, Sengoku Nadeko has possession of her own personal thoughts, feelings, ideas and morals; whether negative or positive... it makes her character pretty damn fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\n-Sengoku Nadeko writes her own manga in secrecy. Until one day, she finds a potentially different path to her life... one that dove her ideas and morals into the realization that she could bring her life of continuous dullness to cessation... If she decides to release a god.-\\n\r\nThus is the premise of the Nadeko Medusa event.\\n\\n\r\nThe thoughts that she's had to hold in until she finally explodes in front of her classroom, expresses how human her character is. This scene was the first literary explosion of her character. The Monogatari series does well to twist our preconceived notions on its head; exclaiming that no one is simple. No one can so simply be judged.\\n\r\nSengoku Nadeko's personality is strengthened realistically more by her unique emotions of her coming into terms with her one-sided relationship that she had to bear for a long time. If and when you comprehend the entirety of Nadeko's life, you then see that the depth of this character is no exception in comparison to the others.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's interesting about the Monoagatari Series is the differing perspectives and views upon other characters in each certain arc. Each character feels different towards the main role. In Otorimonogatari (Nadeko Medusa), each characters' words are slightly altered to match the perspective of Sengoku Nadeko.\\n\r\nSome of you might raise an eyebrow and say: \"Everyone behaves the same way that they have before to me.\" But if you know the premise, that'd change your whole view, as it did mine. Recognize that Tsubasa is portrayed to be insulted by Gaen Izuko (from her perspective), and Nadeko is portrayed to be disdained by Shinobu (from her perspective)... but that is not the case for other characters. When a different character becomes the main character, all the other characters will act in a way that portray how the main character feels. Throughout the show, they (Gaen & Shinobu) held an antagonist-like spotlight against the character focuses (Tsubasa & Nadeko)... even though Gaen and Shinobu are not antagonists. Its for these reasons that I believe the show is much more brilliant than people are most times able to comprehend. And Kaiki's arc proves that no one perceives Kaiki the same way as he perceives himself. With the end of Second Season, we threw out our notions of him being \"the bad guy,\" a notion we first fabricated with when we had watched Nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nHow things are percieved depend on who our character focus is, at any one time. Shaft's cleverness is remarkable, and Monogatari Series: Second Season is an additionally phenomenal season to the Monogatari series.",

            "content": "With the return of Monogatari into the second season, we are reunited with the familiar way the story likes to be delivered, which is fast pace dialogue and thought provoking imagery, which can be understood subconsciously and consciously. The way they present this type of story telling is Monogataris biggest strong suit and clearly excels at it, although pacing is some what of an issue for any real plot progression. Sometimes it might feel rather boring and over burdening at times, with loads of text being flashed on the screen every couple seconds. Trying to keep up is certainly a challenge, but that's where Mongatarimakes its mark.\\n\\n\r\nFor fellow new comers to the series, you might find Monogatari as an oddity compared to other anime and completely lost in the story department. There is very little to none recap of what happened previously, so it is almost a must to watch the previous seasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari finds itself sluggishly moving forward to the next plot point, albeit makes up for this by the way the story is delivered. It is indeed fascinating with the whole apparition aspect of the story, but it would barely get any screen time until almost end of an episode. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8.6\\n\\n\\n\r\nI believe this and the characters department might be the right category to show Monogatari's strong suit rather than anything else. From a psychological fast moving imagery/scenes with lines of text to saturated and complementary colors emphasizing the current mood of the scene. This is how Monogatari presents their expertise in art & animation. Monogatari pays attention to the slightest detail in the way it is presented visually and stays very consistent throughout the series. By all means it deserves credit where its due.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character development and connection between the characters is also very well portrayed in Monogatari. There's a certain kind of air between the interactions with each character, which make each interaction or dialog feel unique and mysterious at the same time. However for the majority of the beginning of the series the interactions between new characters is fairly scarce and might feel dull and repetitive at times. But none the less it is very enjoyable because as mentioned, each new dialog is very thought provoking and keeps the mind on edge, not wanting to miss any line of dialog that is being conversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow Factor: 8.5\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe way everything is presented and delivered to the audience is great to watch, very refreshing and a new take of how a episode is delivered or to be more specific, how it allocates its time into plot progression. Definitely not your typical anime out there, however Monogatari is unique in many categories. One can consider this series a rather niche anime to say the least, but definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Grade:  8.5 /10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this series to watch?  Yes, however I insist you watch the previous seasons to get a feel for how this series portrays itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n           + Unique, yet thought provoking and an aberration of story telling\\n\\n\r\n           - Plot development is rather slow, not necessarily a bad thing in this         case\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview by: AzurexSky of Aniraters\\n",

With regards to all of the fan-service problems in the past, rest assured that there is much more to this than purely fanservice. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory (9/10): \r\nAmong the most interesting plotlines I've come across. Every arc was intriguing, in-depth and complete. Everything came full circle as all arcs in the show coincided. The lore behind each arc is like always, interesting and enjoyable. The plot line focuses more on strengthening the characters that didn't receive as much screen time as others, which to me was great.\r\nArt/Sound (9/10): \r\nNot much to really say here. Gorgeous, interpretive style of art, and awesome soundtrack. It fitthe story extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): \\n\r\nIf I could give a higher rating than a 10, then I would. The characters are in my opinion what made this show amazing. Each one of the characters is very developed, and at no point did I feel any of them were useless. Monogatari has the most unique, developed, and interesting characters of any show I've seen hands-down. The characters showed immense personality and depth that's very hard to find in any show period. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): I won't say this is a life changing anime, but it definitely was a very enjoyable ride. I looked forward to watching the next episode and was interested thoroughly the whole time. Definitely don't regret investing my time.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, if you've seen the previous installations of this show, it'd be a very worthwhile investment to watch this season. Kaiki, and Hachikuji's arcs especially were enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "This review contains HEAVY spoilers, along with personal biased opinions, read at your own risk, also I want to add that I watched this a while ago, so my memory isn't exactly fresh with the events so somethings might be distorted from the original settings.\r\nMonogatari is a very successful acclaimed series which resides on the base of various stories revolving around our main character, Koyomi Ararararagi, oops I sttutered, Araragi is a 18 year old, a young adult who became part vampire due to events related to Kiss-Shot Acelora-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, commonly known as Shinobu in her child form. \r\nHe has a serious chronic hero syndrome,which is a huge plus, else we wouldn't see all these stories. \\n\r\nAlso his voice actor has a really soothing voice.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with the monogatari series, you know this isn't your average anime, you can describe it as an audio-visual story with trippy backgrounds, all source of Studio Shaft, which is widely known and specializes in very fancy avant-garde animation, and even head tilting. Something that adds extra points in the animation is all the Openings and Endings they make for each story arc, each of them are accompanied by some amazing songs with great meanings for the respective arcs, one notable example would be Mousou Express.\\n\\n\r\nAs it goes for me, this was the first 'gatari series which I actually enjoyed and had major emotions while watching it! It's my most recommended 'gatari series so far and the best in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a grand total of 26 episodes, divided into 6 arcs with 3 recaps inbetween, adapted from the novels:\\n\\n\r\nNekomonogatari:Shiro [Tsubasa Tiger]\\n\r\nKabukimonogatari [Mayoi Jiangshi]\\n\r\nOtorimonogatari [Nadeko Medusa]\\n\r\nOnimonogatari [Shinobu Time]\\n\r\nKoimonogatari [Hitagi End]\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with Hanekawa's arc, Tsubasa Tiger composed by 5 episodes, which was... arguably the weakest and most boring arc from my point of view, I also wasn't very into the 'gatari series into this point, so it made my experience and enjoyment to start this series a long pushover.\\n\\n\r\nOne notable thing from this arc is that Araragi is nowhere to be found, leaving almost all screen time for Hanekawa and also Senjougahara.\\n\\n\r\nHanekawa encounters a tiger, or should I say an appearance in form of a tiger, white with what appears to be a mix of black/ping/orange stripes, who burns down her house. This tiger decides to torment Hanekawa some more and she eventually decides to confront him with the help of Black Hanekawa, her inner appearance of a cat only to be saved by Araragi wielding Kokoro Watari who downright impales the tiger, ending the danger he was imposing to Hanekawa. \\n\r\nThe scene proceeds to Hanekawa declaring her love for Araragi only to get friendzoned.\\n\\n\r\nNothing notably interesting in this arc, 5 episodes of pandering fanservice, which I guess it was okay for a lot of viewers.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7, Mayoi Jiangshi, we kick off this episode with... Oshino Ougi, a rather mysterious girl, who came out of nowhere but everyone acts as if she's perfectly normal, she engages with Araragi a conversation about traffic lights, with the undertone of someone's ability to sense danger, Araragi then reminds himself of our favorite ghost girl, Mayoi Hachikuji.\\n\\n\r\nWe proceed to the following scene where Araragi is walking around with Mayoi's backpack  (she forgot it at his home) and he meets Ononoki with a posed look, they indulge in a chat for a while until Ononoki asks Araragi if Hachikuji was truly happy being a ghost or not.\\n\\n\r\nIt was already night and Araragi still hasn't found Hachikuji, Ononoki's words still resonate within him.... is Hachikuji really happy \"living\" like this? Shinobu then suddendly appears and tells him to stop worrying about such stuff, and focus on school affairs, as he hasn't done any of his school homework yet... and summer break is about to end! Araragi promptly makes a Doreamon reference and requests Nobuemon (Nobu derivates from Shinobu) a time machine, while she teasingly denies him at first, she surprisingly accept his request, and they go to the North-Shirahebi Shrine using the force of the wandering spirits, they return to the past, but something went horribly wrong here, they went 11 years into the past.  May 13th. \\n\\n\r\nThey walk around for a while and they end up in front of the Araragi's residence, where they spot young Araragi, Shinobu apparently has a knack for his young form and almost assaults him, but is stopped on her tracks by Araragi, followed by a panel \"Someone must be a bad influence on her\", I wonder who that might be. ~\\n\\n\r\nThey follow on and keep walking on the streets, and keep thinking on why they ended up on such date, Araragi realizes that... tomorrow is mother's day and is the day that marks Hachikuji's death and decides to save her, avoiding her ghost transformation. He meets young Hanekawa and harasses her slightly, before Shinobu tells him to stop or he might be arrested, he asks for directions for Tsunade's house (Hachikuji's mother), but gets tricked by her and ends in the police department which he uses anyway to obtain directions.\\n\\n\r\nHe stands by near the house several hours waiting for Hachikuji to show up, only for her dad to tell them that she ran from home, Araragi sprints the hell out of there to search for her and he finds her in the park where they first met... and harasses her again, making her run for it, crossing a road with a red light, with a truck passing by at high speed... but she is saved by Araragi at the very last second!\\n\\n\r\nWith all this said and done, Araragi and Shinobu make their way to the Temple, which is surprisingly still in ruins like in the present time, but yet it retains enough energy to time warp yet again, and so they return... the entire world was anihilited, at the cost of saving a young girl.\\n\\n\r\nAfter making sure this is the right timeline (present) they return home, only to find it deserted and the same goes for the whole city. They return to the Temple, and they spot an amulet, a different type of amulet than Meme had given to Araragi, this amulet absorbs surrounding energy, which didn't allow them to return to the past for the time being. Suddendly they are surrounded by zombies, but these won't come near the amulet in the shrine, Shinobu decides to make an escape and promptly jumps away with Araragi and they return home... where Shinobu realizes that she destroyed the world in another timeline due to Araragi not giving her attention. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi ponders the chance of some other survivor being around, and decides to accquire fireworks, they light up the fireworks in an afternoon, only to be swarmed by zoombies yet again, but these suddendly begin to run from a rice shower...who was being thrown by Mayoi Hachikuji?! She had survived all the way from 11 years ago, and also being taught by Meme on how to fight against vampires, she carried a letter for Araragi from him as well explaining the current situation, just how wise is this man?\\n\\n\r\nThe latest part of the letter Meme request them to stop Kiss-Shot Acelora-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, so this chaotic world ceases to exist, equipped with dual Kokoro Wataris they make their way to the Temple once again, but there was no need to fight, as the cold-blooded, hot-blooded, iron-blooded vampire simply decides to make Araragi a request of patting her head before returning to their original worldline.\\n\\n\r\nHachikuji spots Araragi from afar, and salutes him like he does to her, lifting him in the air several times, while licking him, throwing him into a state of confusion thinking it's a paralel world! Only to get refuted immediatly, and proceed with some typical lovely banter between these two, Araragi finally asks if Hachikuji is happy as a ghost. She replies that turning into a ghost was an unhappy event, but she's happy because she met Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nThis episodes ends with them walking in the road, together, but Hachikuji still doesn't has her backpack, which presumably she's going to pick up, but this lampshades a critical event that is going to occur.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, Nadeko Medusa, an arc that generated so much controversy around fans, and made many people dislike Nadeko, I personally can't understand them, as this story, was the very best in terms of enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nWe start off by having Nadeko giving us a brief description of herself, including favorite stuff, but something is wrong, she has white hair, medusa-like hair. Shortly we're introduced to Kuchinawa, a snake god who is possessing/was swallowed by Nadeko turning her into a god!\\n\\n\r\nAraragi is there, but is beaten and bruised, covered in blood, his left arm is broken, literally, he is now Nadeko's enemy, together with Shinobu they try to stop her, but Nadeko effortlessly wipes them aside with an attack, and strikes Araragi's heart with an arrow-esque snake making his blood rain all over.\\n\r\nYou can see that you're in one hell of a ride when an episode starts like this, but why did this happen? \\n\r\nThat's just the introduction though, now we can enjoy fully 4 episodes of Otorimonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, notably, look closely at the OP, can you see the ressemblance of it with the OP from Nadeko Snake, the ressemblance it's uncanny, the difference from the pastel like children colors strikes you as something dark will happen, Nadeko isn't smiling anymore, she is at the right side of the screen walking backwards, and looking down having her eyes covered by her bangs, so she doesn't have to look at anyone. She was opening a book? Now she's closing it, she unties the headband that she had, she snatches Araragi as a symbol that she loves him as Kana sings \"Zenbu, zenbu, zenbu, zenbu\" and many other things which I'll let you figure out for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nExtra points for her enormous love for him being almost magic, possessive, and she's a snake, making Araragi something like a snake whisperer, it's too much of a clever pun to not be noted.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now starting the actual epsiode we have... Oshino Ougi yet again! She meets Nadeko while riding her bike and almost crashes into her, but jumps above her and crashes into the ground... they have a small banter, but if you're sharp enough you can notice she has something to do with what is going to happen, now and before.\\n\\n\r\nNadeko starts to have hallucinations of a white snake around her arm, and we're introduced to her school life, which she hates. She actually has the guts to meet with the snake Kuchinawa in the temple, and he corners her with feelings of guilt about the snakes she killed, requesting a favor, a favor to save Kuchinawa, searching for his corpse.\\n\\n\r\nShe begins to use Kuchinawa has as a fashionable scrunchie on her right arm, they can talk with each other like this, but he promises not to interfere with everyday life. \\n\r\nAt school, a teacher bumps into her, a teacher who also asked something from her, to resolve the problem in her class that nobody seem to get along, Nadeko hasn't done anything towards yet it though, and simply lowers her head with her bangs covering her eyes and the teacher leaves. \\n\\n\r\nThat night, she leaves home to search for the corpse of Kuchinawa but she is spotted by Araragi who brings her to his home during the night, and lets her stay in his room, he suggest to sleep together and gets knocked out by Shinobu, sadly. Shinobu unleashes a verbal attack upon Nadeko's attitude and way of life, but she won't even retaliate. She also notices her \"natural cuteness\", her most hated trait and easy way out of everything.\\n\\n\r\nOn the next morning Tsukihi wakes up next to Nadeko and unleashes a verbal attack towards her as well, including the words cute, how cute and also questions her love towards Araragi. Then she promptly follows and cuts her hair bangs with a scissor, making Nadeko scream pretty loudly. [Cue animation number 236 & 240].\\n\\n\\n\r\nA while after, she makes her way to school, and the teacher bumps to her again, pestering her about the class issue, Nadeko was about to use her usual method of hide and cower, but to no avail, and she simply SNAPS right there, a total 180\u00ba degree on her character that I couldn't even imagine her having, nor Kana Hanazawa having such potent vocals, she then goes upstair, kicks powerfully the door and unleashes a verbal attack upon her class, needless to say, I had my jaw dropped here, and started to enjoy 'gatari series for the first time ever.\\n\\n\r\nKuchinawa tells her that his corpse is at Araragi's house, the talisman, she finds him, but Araragi catches her, before he manages to steal it from her hands she eats it and turns into a god. \\n\\n\r\nThis turns into what we seen in the prologue of Nadeko Medusa, the battle between them, but just as Nadeko is about to kill Araragi due to the fact that she loves him so much, Araragi phone rings, being Senjougahara the caller, and she request that she may only kill Araragi, herself and Shinobu after they all graduate, Nadeko complies, and with this we get an epic post credit scene which has Nadeko murdering Araragi, Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Shinobu and Hanekawa to an amazing background song to top it off. (Welcome, Big Brother Koyomi. I'll Show You Some Love.)\\n\r\nI wouldn't even be mad if the series ended like this, it felt so complete to me, this was truly the most enjoyable arc for Monogatari so far.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWe're more than halfway in the series, at Shinobu Time now, oh, you've had too much screen time with Shinobu already? Fear not, this arc features Hachikuji Mayoi the most, as opposed to Mayoi Jiangshi.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc  takes place after Shinobu Time and it was very, very sad. It literally crushed my heart and tore it apart at the very end, I can still remember how I was sobbing and how the tears were rolling in my cheeks.\\n\\n\r\nAraragi still has to return Hachikuji's backpack, and makes fun of her claiming she looks more like a slug than a snail due to the lack of the latter. \\n\r\nWhile they keep chatting, a weird something appears, it was darkness, pure darkness which obviously was not normal and they make a run for it, with the aid of Ononoki they escape to the ruined cram school, Hachikuji becomes unconscious. Here Shinobu tells a tale from 400 years ago, and to be brutally honest I didn't find it very memorable to include it here.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Hachikuji wakes up, the darkness strikes again, but thankfully Ononoki lends them a hand yet again, and they manage to escape, after that she suggests that he should look for Izuko Gaen, someone who knows it all to help him. \\n\r\nAfter a very dialogue heavy scene, Izuko asks for 3 favors, and tells Araragi why the darkness is chasing them, is due to Hachikuji failing as a ghost. \\n\\n\r\nAs long as she is the lost cow, she has to continue making people lose their way, but Hachikuji refuses to do so anymore. Izuko also claims that the only way that the darkness will dissapear is if Hachikuji dissapears as well.\\n\r\nAraragi is immediatly shocked and doesn't accept that, trying to devote 20 years of his lifespan to her, but only to get a no. \\n\\n\r\nHachikuji requests that they make their running gag one last time, but instead they kiss, while Hachikuji cries, that she sttutered and that she loved Araragi. We pass forward the ED to see Ougi chatting with Araragi where she claims that she is returning to work, which involves darkness and punishing liars...\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo we arrive to our final arc, Hitagi End, and dear god, I didn't expect anything like this, when I saw the name I rolled my eyes thinking to myself - Bleh, a Senjougahara arc. \\n\r\nDear irony, how wrong was I?\\n\\n\r\nThis story was narrated by Kaiki Deishuu instead of our usual character Koyomi Araragi, and it was spun off around having him trying to stop Nadeko's godly form so nobody would die post graduation.\\n\r\nThere are really no words that I can use here that would make justice to Kaiki's amazing personality, acts and narration, this story includes comedy, thriller and a whole new side to the famous purple haired tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nYou won't expect the ending at all, and it will totally change how you saw this man in Nisemonogatari!\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've finished giving a brief synopsis of the episodes, I'll say it again Monogatari SS was the best of 'gatari series so far, it was the most memorable watch as well, I'm looking forward to see how it all started in Kizu and the latter stories.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if I had to rate the enjoyment here it would be : Nadeko Medusa > Hitagi End > Shinobu Time > Mayoi Jiangshi > Tsubasa Tiger\\n\r\nRemember that this is my opinion, not yours, and our opinions may and will differ.\\n",

            "content": "*THE RATINGS FOR THIS ARE SPECIFIC TO THE PART, BUT THE REVIEW IS FOR THE OVERALL SERIES*\r\n[STORY: 10/10]\r\nThe Monogatiri series comes together well to create a masterpiece of a story. This show is much deeper than alot of people think. It is filled to the brim with philosophical arguments and great storytelling. The focus isn't mainly on action, though it does have some visually stunning action scenes. Alot of the time, it will just be conversations between characters, but this is the blood that keeps this series alive and flourishing. Without it, you'd have a normal show with above average production. This type of showisn't for everyone, but I personally love it.\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe animators went all out animating this show, as detail and flamboyance embody the artistic direction of this show. Each character's design and set piece is carefully planned out, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe voice actors become their characters when they act them out, that's how into them they get. They really care about their role, you can tell. And sound effects are well done as well, nothing seems off in that department.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 10/10]\\n\r\nMost every character is important to the main plot of the story and if they aren't a main character, the style of the show makes it seem as if they don't even exist. Whether they be designed as set pieces or outlines, the show really puts emphasis on those we really care about. These characters are no joke either, pretty much none of them are one-dimensional wastes of time, which is very appeciated.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10]\\n\r\nThough some parts of the series are better than others, the series as a whole is truly an amazing body of work that I consider a masterpiece. This story is filled to the brim with beautifully crafted characters, artwork, sound design, and an amazing story that philosophically challenges the observer to think. A masterful work by Isin Nisio.",

            "content": "Monogatari Series: Second Season is the start of a long-awaited payoff for faithful fans of the series. If you've kept up with the dense dialogue of the first installment and the fanservice-fueled insanity of the second, this is your reward: one of the best seasons of anime I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Second Season is full of heartfelt moments, witty banter, and the pieces of an overarching plot finally piecing together now that we have a fully-developed cast of characters in place.\r\nI won't go into detail about the visuals and the soundtrack. This is a Monogatari installment, so it looks and sounds greatall the time always. This is nothing new. Instead, let's focus on what's new in this season that is different from Bake/Nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, in a first for the series, the audience is invited to delve into the minds of the Monogatari cast, liberated from Koyomi Araragi's headspace. This is a much-needed breath of fresh air for the franchise, for as much as we all love the perverted pseudo-vampire, at this point we've come to know him so well that his reactions usually aren't surprising or revealing anymore. Instead, we see the world through the eyes of Deishu Kaiki, Tsubasa Hanekawa, and others. We see how Koyomi is reflected in the eyes of these characters, and the results are often surprising.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, in this season the series begins setting the pieces up for a real overarching plot, something that it's never really done before. A couple new characters, Izuko Gaen and Ougi Oshino, arrive on the scene and their intentions are quite dubious as they begin initiating the events of the series via \"chance encounters\" with members of the cast. Although it is clear that these two are far more than they appear on the surface, their motives are never explained, setting the stage for a future confrontation.\\n\\n\r\nThe series still hews closely to its light novel origins, adapting each of the volumes into a 4-6 episode arc. I will say that the arcs vary quite a bit in quality. Tsubasa Tiger, Nadeko Medusa, and Hitagi End are some of the most climactic, surprising, and heartrending story arcs this series has ever produced. Mayoi Jiangshi I didn't like all that much, mostly because I have never been fond of Hachikuji, but it still told an entertaining story with a bittersweet conclusion. Shinobu Time is easily the weakest arc, a four episode time-waster only existing to set the stage for the final arc while explaining the events of the previous one. However, even it had its moments, including a tearful farewell that will tug at your heartstrings.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also includes a handful of recap episodes to refresh the viewer's memory as to the events of the previous series installments. These are optional to your enjoyment of the show proper, but it's worth your time to check them out if it's been a while since you viewed the previous seasons. These recaps are absolutely not a proper substitute for watching Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari, so if you're new to the series, get on that shit first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this season is like a loveletter from Nisio Isin and the producers at Studio Shaft. \"Hey, we know you love these characters. We love them too. This is our gift to you. Enjoy the tears. Enjoy the laughter. Enjoy watching these characters... no, these people... grow from what they were into something more. See you next time.\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing this masterpiece it almost hurts to know that the end of the series is coming all too soon. But for now, the journey has just kicked into overdrive, and the stage is set for something big. And this reviewer, for one, can't wait to see what will happen when the Monogatari stirs again.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nThe foundation for the story is a pretty basic concept. A teenage boy that is part vampire encounters girls that have become involved with aberrations; being gods, demons, mythological creatures, and such. He, Araragi, lends a helping hand the female characters out of good will. The fact that the focus is fixated on certain characters throughout the show makes the story more diverse and interesting. Seeing the independent relationships develop is addicting and will keep the viewer wanting more. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe art is not super detailed, but it is well drawn. The whole art style in itself isn't very unique, but there is characterappearance diversity. The environments  change drastically sometimes, from a well drawn simplistic environments to a more, for lack of a better term, \"trippy\" environment. Certain objects will be multiplied, as if they go on for infinity, in certain situations and that make up most of the background. It seems fitting for the story telling.\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI found the music to be subtle, which works very well with the amount of dialogue in this anime. When I did happen to pay more mind to the music, it gave a mysterious aura to the scene. The sound is nothing special, which is what is should be for this series. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters, even minor ones, feel as if they live in their own world. The characters' personalities and histories are very well thought out and become more clear with progression. On the superficial side, the characters have diverse designs which helps with making a character feel separate from the other characters. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime came from the story telling and dialogue. There is a mix of action, but the main draw is the drama involved with the character relationships and obstacles. \\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nA great story if that's what you're looking for in an anime. Even without a heap tone of action, this anime is far from being boring.",

            "content": "Those who have seen Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari will not be disappointed. I'm going to divide this review into the various arcs, because they're so distinct from each other that it'd be unfair to just lump them all together. \r\nHanekawa's arc: Absolutely brilliant. This arc is about her going through some self-discovery as she tries to cope with her love for Araragi, which lets us viewers get a new glimpse of what her true personality is. Before, she was always that intelligent girl who was deeply caring and didn't discriminate against anyone who needed her help, but this arc reveals that there is much more toher, and it also teaches a lesson that while being nice is good, lying to yourself is not. This arc's strongest point, is therefore its character development of Hanekawa, which features her journey to reconciliation with her true self. \\n\\n\r\nMayoi's arc: Not satisfied with the relationship between Araragi and Shinobu? Wished there was more about them two? Well this arc does exactly that, as Araragi and Shinobu deepen their relationship as the two encounter an extremely interesting conflict, as you will see. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to say that this 3rd installment did an excellent job with its plot development: there are more cliffhangers, and at no point will you find any episode to be filler-like or boring; the end of each episode forces you to click the Next Episode button. However, the tradeoff is since there is more action and plot, we do miss a tiny bit of that \"intelligent dialogue\" that all of us fans have fallen in love with, where the characters sometimes simply talk for 90% of an episode about things that make sense, and yet don't make sense. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Mayoi's arc is fantastic for those Araragi x Shinobu fans, as you get to explore their weird relationship since in Nisemonogatari you know they reconciled, but that Shinobu also said \"I'll never forgive you and you'll never forgive me, and that's how it will be.\" It's strange because this arc is called Mayoi's arc, but the real focus is on Araragi and Shinobu. Mayoi's true arc comes later.\\n\\n\r\nNadeko's arc: This arc will probably be the most shocking, and it really reveals the central point (in my opinion) of Monogatari Second Season: kindness is sometimes a facade, and kindness is not the solution to everything. In Bake and Nise, we saw that Araragi's kindness was enough for almost any situation: his genuine intentions to help people overpowered any conflict, but that's not really true in real life is it? In this season, we get more of a taste of just how manipulative and secretive humans are, and that adds a lot more legitimacy to the story (even though it's still about apparitions). Nadeko's arc allows us to re-explore this quiet and shy girl who has a weird obsession with Araragi. Just like in Hanekawa's arc, we learn the truth is often hidden not by those around us, but by we ourselves, and this arc will certainly offer you a new perspective on how you portray yourself, not just to others, but to yourself as well. \\n\\n\r\nShinobu's arc: This is more of Mayoi's true arc, but Shinobu plays an equally big part in it. Much of the arc is Shinobu narrating her past, and it's pretty interesting, but the real conflict is that Mayoi, Araragi, and Shinobu are being chased by \"darkness,\" something that isn't an apparition. As a huge fan of Shinobu, this arc was enjoyable, and once again we are brought to this point: kindness and even willpower cannot solve everything. Sometimes fate decides things that are out of our control, and the solution is to accept it and move on. It's not supposed to be a depressing message, but more of a realistic one, so this arc definitely does a lot to develop Araragi's character as he slowly realizes he cannot help everyone, and that acceptance is necessary to cope with certain results. \\n\\n\r\nHitagi's arc: This arc was the only thing that prevented me from giving his series a 10. Don't get me wrong, I actually thought this arc was one of the best ones: Kaiki Deishu makes a return, and befitting of the central theme, we discover he's not just a con-man, he's way more complex than that. His interaction with Hitagi makes us ponder further just what kind of girl she is, but it's her complexity that's so intriguing to watch. This arc did a fantastic job of both plot and character development as you will be dying to discover the ending the moment you start this arc, and well, who doesn't like more Senjougahara. My only problem was with how this arc ended, which is also the ending of the whole series. \\n\\n\r\nI kept trying to remind myself after I finished that one episode does not determine an entire series' worth, but the truth is endings have a pretty big effect on me since it's what I remember most clearly. It wasn't that I was entirely unsatisfied with the ending, but one of the things Monogatari fans love most is that \"intelligent dialogue\" I mentioned where the characters seemingly resolve conflicts in a roundabout and yet logical way. And with someone like Kaiki Deishu, you would definitely expect some clever answer from him, but the ending was not like that. That was really my only complaint, but like I said, there was a general lack of that \"intelligent dialogue\" throughout the whole show in return for a more interesting plot. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the series, especially since this season featured a lot of metafictional elements (google that term if you don't know what it is, and you'll get right away what I'm talking about) that weren't as prominent in the first two. As far as art and sound go, it's the same fantastic stuff we saw from the first two, and I'd even say they did a better job this time with picking their music, which has that unique style of being so simple and yet fitting of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a reason why this anime is ranked so high, so if you're hesitating to start it, don't. Just click Play.",

It touched on every character and we got to learn more about how and what is happening while also following one main basic plot of that of the Snake god,troubled in non-mutual love, Sengoku. \r\nThe ending left me sad, due to the loss on a character (or so were left to believe) and the fact that it ended so abruptly, leaving me with questions. As I move onto the next bit of this series I simply hope for those questions to be answered instead of leaving mehalf empty hoping for something more.",
