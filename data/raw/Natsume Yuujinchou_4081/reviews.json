            "content": "-INTRODUCTION-\r\nI've been looking forward to this anime ever since I saw one of the promotional images -- Natsume sitting on a tree branch with his foot slightly touching the water underneath, and an unusual looking cat by his side. I fell in love with that image alone and could not stop thinking about it. Needless to say, I watched Natsume Yuujinchou while it was still ongoing and waited eagerly for the subtitles to come out. Now that it's over, I can say for sure -- it was a short but beautiful experience, and became one of my very special personal favorites.\r\n-STORY- 10/10\r\n\"Thank you... for notgrowing to hate humans.\"\\n\\n\r\nEach episode Natsume encounters a different youkai. Sometimes, it's a youkai seeking to get his/her name back; at other times, a youkai wanting some other help from Natsume, which he can never refuse.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as those stories revolve around youkai, Natsume Yuujinchou is ultimately about humans. It focuses on the bonds between humans, as well as the bonds between humans and youkai.\\n\\n\r\nEach story is very well thought out and carries a deep message that Natsume derives from his encounters. Reasons why Natsume cannot let go of his bond with youkai, reasons why youkai fall in love with humans; Natsume Yuujinchou is a collection of beautiful bittersweet pieces of a not very ordinary every day life. Each piece left me with a somewhat sad but warm feeling and made me go back to re-watch and think upon it again and again.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is full of unique personalities. Natsume does not help youkai just because he has nothing better to do. His bond with the beings of the other world is very deep and is explored in great detail. From a boy who was forced to shut himself off from nearly all humans, Natsume grows to trust humans again and shares his experiences with others. Seemingly eager for nothing more than obtaining the Book of Friends, Madara is also not that simple of a character. With time, he becomes attached to Natsume and, despite his own constant contradictions, appears to worry more about his companion than the actual book.\\n\\n\r\nYoukai are also very interesting. Although most of them appear only in their assigned episode, each one is very memorable, and their personalities and inner troubles are so well thought out that it's hard to believe that they were really present for only twenty minutes.\\n\\n\r\n-ART/ANIMATION- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is beautiful. It may seem rather simple, but it couldn't be more perfect for this anime. In fact, the simplicity of it is what makes it truly stunning for me. It greatly enhances the story and the atmosphere with its warm colors and memorable designs. Also, every time a scene of Natsume returning youkai's name is shown, I fall in love with this anime all over again; it almost makes me feel his breath as he blows out the letters from the page.\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter the very first episode, I fell in love with both opening and ending songs. Like the artwork, the soundtrack is beautiful in its simplicity and fits Natsume Yuujinchou's atmosphere perfectly. It's the kind of music that probably would not feel the same or as special outside of the actual anime, but combined with the rest of the aspects, it becomes a wonderful soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? I fell completely in love with this anime. If you want something relaxing and heartwarming, Natsume Yuujinchou is for you.",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is possibly the most powerful, thought-provoking anime I've ever seen. The amount of emotions you'll experience is nothing short of incredible, especially when you consider the anime's 13 episode length.\r\nPity, anger, sorrow, astonishment, and absolute elation are to name a few.\r\nAnd some tears on the side...Manly tears, obviously.\r\nStory- 10/10\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is episodic, there is no defining plot line. The most common, unifying theme is Natsume's ultimate goal to return all the Youkai names that his Grandmother Reiko took and stored in the Book of Friends. The episodes range from various Youkai simply wanting their names back, to far more complex issues such aslonely spirits longing for companionship, desperate to relive the memories that are so precious to them.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is wrapped up so masterfully, so beautifully, that it's nearly impossible to not spend the next few moments contemplating what you've just seen. The messages and lessons conveyed are just as pertinent as they are meaningful. At some point in everyone's life, there will be something (a problem, ability, anything) that they feel is impossible to talk about, that no one can relate. As Natsume Yuujinchou illustrates, isolation is rarely the answer, and through purposeful human (and maybe not so human) interactions, inner peace can be achieved.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Natsume Yuujinchou is phenomenal, depicting a gorgeous countryside town. Each aspect of the landscape is drawn with amazing attention to detail, the large plains of grass not just being lush green, but also golden, with a few shades of light red. The bodies of water are drawn to ripple realistically with the hustling and bustling of fish (and water-related Youkai). The light from the sun pours through the openings of the trees in a divine manner. The human characters are drawn with that middle of the road style of animation, where they aren't too realistic but they also aren't too cartoonish, too cartoonish being enormous eyes, no visible nose, etc. Youkai are drawn in almost every way imaginable, the sky was the limit in creating these spirits as each episode continuously provides unique designs. The artwork never falters, and remains beautiful at every attempt made, from fireworks in the night sky, to majestic, elegant Youkai.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with the opening song upon first listen. Without thinking about it, I always found myself singing along, the tempo getting faster and faster, my excitement growing more and more. This opening is truly the perfect fit for Natsume Yuujinchou, as it is expressive of my anticipation for the upcoming episode. This was the same case with the end song, perfectly fitting, as it always sums up the current episode, allowing you to become engrossed in your own thoughts. The almost nostalgic way the music starts quietly playing right before the end of the episode, a slightly melancholic acoustic guitar chimes in, and emotions begin to overflow. A memorable end for an unforgettable anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the Youkai encountered are, aside from the general superiority complex over humans, very different. Their personalities are what keeps the show fresh. A Youkai that first appears to be nothing but malicious may actually have a much more complicated character, though that isn't to say there are no instances of purely malevolent Youkai. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that superiority complex, most of the Youkai do in fact have human tendencies. Love, loneliness, and real bonds of friendship are all things that Youkai are not entirely devoid of. It becomes obvious that, despite differences in appearence, powers, and social norms, humans and Youkai aren't so different...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that is enjoyable from start to finish, and as someone who is more prone to believe in the existence of the supernatural, I was enthralled. From now on, I'll think twice about those moments where a cold chill overcomes you, or when a blast of wind hits you on a relatively calm day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a fantasy masterpiece. If you're in the mood to cry tears of happiness (manly tears, naturally) or just see a great show, then this is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\n\"I can hear the footsteps of Winter, the cold night...But, this place is warm\"",

            "content": "Oh my goodness, where to start.\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a small gem of a series, and I'm glad I followed a friend's recommendation to watch it. This small, often overlooked series is so beyond charming that I wonder how anyone could pass it up!\r\nThe story is simple, because there's no overall arcing plot. The series basically consists of self-contained episodes where Natsume looks to help youkai with their problems and give them back their names. Sometimes he seeks to help out humans troubled by youkai. In any case, Natsume is always trying to help someone while \"Nyanko-sensei\" scolds him for his human stupidity.\r\nEach story serves ascharacter development, either for Natsume, the youkai involved, or both. The youkai teach Natsume about themselves and about humanity, and Natsume ends to teach the youkai that not all humans are so bad. Natsume learns to be more social and gains a few friends as the series goes on. For the most part, each episode has a fairly happy ending, though some are heartbreaking yet beautiful. Generally the show has a very optimistic outlook on things, but doesn't gloss over potential emotional tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. Everything about the style is simple and gentle, but very beautiful as a whole. The linework and soft colors work beautifully together, and the animation, when given to show off beyond walking and talking, is awesome. I welcome the simple and more realistic character designs for the humans, and the simple but not generic designs of the youkai.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the music. Like everything else in the series, it's subtle and unobtrusive, simple but very pretty. The opening and ending themes are also very fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment and overall value, let me say that I was disillusioned to anime a few years ago, and have very little patience for it now. But Natsume was so charming that I couldn't put it down once I found it. And now I'm hooked on season two! A definite recommendation.",

            "content": "Honestly, I don't really understand why this anime has so many amazing ratings. This isn't the worst anime i've ever seen- no, but I certainly do not think it's anywhere near the best.\r\nNow, let's talk about the story. \r\n3/10\r\nOne of the things I hated the most about this anime was the fact that it's episodic, and it doesn't work. In my opinion, this only makes it painfully predicable and underdeveloped. Honestly, you've seen the first three episodes you've seen the whole show. A youkai comes. Cool. They want Natsume's help. Oh. They get their help. There's a revelation. Ok.  The majority of the episodesfollow this structure. And for the first few or so episodes, yes. It's entertaining. Heartwarming even. But I wouldn't expect that to be the whole show. CAN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. CAN THE PLOT PROGRESS. CAN WE STOP THIS CYCLE. It's too simple. It got boring. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the art/animation...\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nThe art is uninteresting. It's boring. it's simple. Which pretty much matches the story. The story and the art go together. So I guess that's a good thing. It further sets the mood of the anime. It made it more boring for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sooouunnnd...\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nI hated the soundtrack of this anime. I always skipped the opening, which I almost never do. The sound effects and all that were clear. Voices, clear. So the sound is fine. That soundtrack though. No. But it does do a good job of  further setting the over all mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters...\\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime really lacks. What the hell even is Natsume's personality. He barely has one. The youkai though, they have much better personalities. But just because they're better than Natsume's doesn't mean they're deep or \"thought provoking\" no. But they are definitely entertaining. The one character I truly did like was Madara. He's a gem, really liked him. It's like they compensated for Natsume's lack of development with Madara's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment...\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\r\nIf you read what I previously wrote it's pretty obvious I did not enjoy this anime. I watched it to the end to be able to make a full conclusion about it. BUT BOY WAS THAT PAINFUL. \\n\\n\r\nOveralllllll...\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nI just think this anime wasn't for me. If you're the type of person that likes to decipher plots, enjoys suspense, twists and turns- this is really not the anime for you. Skip it. If you like more simple, heartwarming type things give this a try. This isn't the kinda anime where you're on the tip of your toes, heads spinning, mind boggling. This is the kinda anime you watch when you're in your room bored, too tired to watch something with a more developed, complex plot.",

            "content": "It might seem that I'm jumping the gun a bit here when I'm writing a review so early into this anime.  But in all honesty, I've been meaning to write a review of Natsume Yuujinchou for quite a while now.  Despite seeing a slightly familiar format here e.g., A boy who can see and communicate with spirits (think Bleach), the anime is actually rather refreshing in it's nature.  The plot line is pretty easy to follow:  Natsume inherits a book from his grandmother (whom could also see spirits).  The book contains the names of all the spirits that said grandmotherdefeated.  The spirits, in turn, want their names returned - so they go to Natsume for help.  This is the basic rundown of the  plot - needless to say, that there is more to it than that.  But you'll have to watch it for yourselves.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is geared towards a more spiritual side of things, which gives it that refreshing feeling, and keeps things interesting.  Artistically, this is wonderful.  The art is almost mellow in places, and it reminds me a lot of Mushishi in style.  The colours are lovely and clean, but appear almost soft in their appearance.  It's also very nicely detailed.  A real pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself almost seems to be setting a nice, gentle pace for itself.  Not being familiar with the manga in any way, I can only hope that it carries on for a few more episodes before delving deeper into the underlying plotline.  This anime is almost addicting in it's nature.  It's actually quite rare to see an anime where everything just seems to fit, well, perfectly.  It's definitely fair to say that this is slowly turning into a real gem.  All I can say is that Natsume Yuujinchou has a lot of potential.",

            "content": "When I first looked at this anime, I didn't think much about it. Now it's one of my favorites this season:\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is, in a nutshell, about a boy (Natsume Takashi) that can see spirits (demons, gods etc). Because of this, Natsume has been seen by his family as a \"freak\" and was never accepted in his relatives' house after his parents died.\r\nThe story takes place in a small village where another one of his relatives' house, where he found a book left behind by his late grandmother that can control any spirits that have their name in it...\r\nNatsume is a pretty episodic anime thatpacked with slice. The story is generally laid back while it still has a mysterious notion within each episode. A genuine slice of life anime. For people who doesn't understand that, slice of life pretty much means &quot;The main character going about his daily life&quot;, there's not going to be massive plot twists, epic action or anything of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of generally acceptable. Not particularly colorful like your shounen anime, but the dim coloring blends pretty well with the backgrounds. Out of the 4 episodes i've watched, there hasn't been any big changes in the animation, so i believe there won't be any degrading in the animation throughout the series\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the only setback to Natsume, the music. The OP and ED are a bit too laid back. Good for background music, but has no ipod/mp3 worthiness whatsoever in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThere are not much reoccurring characters in Natsume. \\n\r\n we have Natsume, who is a lazy but kindhearted boy and Nyako, a demon cat who just bums around but occassionally helps Natsume.\\n\r\nA major difference between this anime and other demon-themed anime is that demons in Natsume is usually good demons. While they do go berserk at times, these demons are generally friendly. A nice change compare to all those demon hunting anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm quite a fan of slice of life anime so this one is quite a treat. The nice demons were also something rare so pretty happy about that. If you want to find something else like Natsume, try Mushishi.",

            "content": "Why this anime is so far up the Top Anime list, I will never know because this was one of the worst animes I've ever watched. I'm disappointed I wasted so much of my precious time on this shit. The only reason I gave it an over 3 rather than a 2 was because I did the math. \r\nBut without further ado;\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nWas there a story? 'Cause from what I saw it was just episode after episode of the same concept. A lot like Detective Conan, I suppose, but at least that is much more enjoyable and has a bit more depth to it thanNatsume Yuujinchou. If you're the type to like watching a shallow animes with no real goal to it, this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was good - the only thing that kept me from giving the anime a 2. The sceneries were well done, and the characters were drawn beautifully. The soothing light colours emphasized the calm and relaxing environment the story took place in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI usually like sad songs, but none from this anime really struck me as great. They were all just mediocre. But it fit according to the situation, so there's a plus. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters weren't very deep. The main character is a big nono for me - I hate guys who are so sissy and shy and submissive and basically a girl in animes. Though the cat demon thing was cute, and funny (hence why I increased it to a 3). The other demons don't have too much personality, or if they did, it was similar to other characters in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI only watched it because a friend of mine recommended it, but I was literally falling asleep every episode trying to finish it. You'll never understand how happy I was to finish the season and tell her that I hated it (she asked me to finish it completely before saying it sucks, so...). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nOver all, it sucked balls, to be compeltely honest. If you're into anime with an actual plot line, this isn't for you. But see for yourselves... if you dare! ;)",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is a series that began as a shoujo manga by Midorikawa Yuki. In 2008 an anime adaptation by Brain's Base aired. You may remember them from such anime as Baccano, Durarara, Penguindrum, Ixion Saga DT & Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. So, their stuff has been pretty mixed from what I've seen. With Oregairu at the upper end and Ixion Saga & Penguindrum tied at the low end. How will this one place? Let's have a look.\r\nStory:\r\nNatsume Takashi is a lonely boy. He's been ostracised for most of his life due to his ability to see youkai. After accidentally freeinga sealed one, that happens to look like a fat cat, he discovers that his grandmother, Reiko, could also see them. Not only that, but she went around collecting their names for her \u201cbook of friends\u201d which she could use to summon and control them. Being able to think of no ways to use such a thing, Natsume decides to go about returning the names. The narrative from there follows him as he encounters youkai and goes about thinning the book of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is just that it's tedious. It shouldn't be since it has al of thirteen episodes, but it manages. The dialogue has a tendency to repeat itself a lot. The events from the episodes are painfully predictable and the series just never reaches a point where things get interesting. The result is that it feels like a slog to get through. There's also a moment where they try to bring real world fact into the series, but they get the fact wrong. Basically, it uses the urban legend that birds will abandon their babies if a human handles them. Which I'm sure was invented by some arsehole who didn't want to bother helping a distressed baby bird but didn't want to look bad in front of their kids. Or maybe it's a fabrication that stems from wanting to protect the chicks from good-hearted people who are trying to help, but aren't helping.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series are the few flashbacks we get of his grandmother when she was young. She has personality and seems to be enjoying herself. Can I watch a series about her instead? I don't think it would be brilliant, but it would probably be better than this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nHerein lies the core flaw with the series. Natsume is one of the most boring characters I've seen in quite a while. See, his whole schtick is that he's a generic nice guy who's melancholy because he's special. That's pretty much the end all and be all that passes for his personality. He's about as compelling as an empty plastic crate. Well, less compelling. At least you could put something in the crate. Which is a big part of why the narrative itself is such a slog. We have this thoroughly uninteresting protagonist and it's impossible to feel any tension or investment in him. Seriously, can we watch the grandma's story instead? She has more personality by far and she's only in roughly five minutes of flashbacks. The supporting characters really aren't much better. They're flat tropes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is, by far, the best element of the series. The backgrounds are nicely drawn and detailed. The youkai designs are pretty creative. The animation does flow well. The character designs are... okay. The biggest issue with the art is Natsume himself. The two expressions he generally has are just a blank look and dull surprise.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi. He also voiced a boring character in Hachimitsu to Clover. But he's also given strong performances voicing characters like Levi and Otonashi Yuzuru. The problem with his performance in this, and indeed most of the performances, is just that there's nothing to work with. You really can't take a boringly written character and make them complex through the sheer power of acting. The music isn't good, but it does suit the series. It is just as boring as the narrative and the protagonist. You can't claim that Yoshimori Makoto isn't good at composing music that matches the tone.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little bit. Natsume has a couple of friends who bicker like a married couple. There's also a female youkai in the series who's outright stated to have had a thing for Natsume's grandmother. I'd kind of like to see the back story behind that one, actually. Seriously, why isn't this series about Reiko?\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is by no means a bad series. It's also by no means a good one. Ultimately, it's a boring series with very little that really stands out in either a positive or negative way. My final rating on it is a 5/10. Next week is Valentine's and you know what that means, we're going to look at a romance series. This year it's Love Stage.",

            "content": "This is my first anime review, so here goes.\r\nPlot Summary:\r\nNatsume is the new kid in town, and boy is he weird. He talks to the empty air more than real people, he's withdrawn, and sometimes he takes off running for no apparent reason. As it turns out, he's not crazy, just spiritual. He was born with the spiritual powers that allow him to see youkai (Japanese mythical creatures). He inherited this ability from his grandmother, who was known among the youkai as a powerful, fierce fighter. His grandmother used her abilities to defeat youkai and take their names, thus binding them in servitude. Now it'sNatsume's quest to set them free. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere is only one word to describe the tone of Natsume Yuujinchou: chill. Everything is very laidback, tranquil. The pace is much more deliberate than most anime, taking its time to fully stretch out a story over an episode. Yes, the pacing is slow, but it's the good kind of slow, where things take their time to develop. If you like fast-paced, nail-biting adventures, you're not going to find it here. However, if you don't mind waiting around for a story to blossom, then Natsume Yuujinchou usually delivers, with every vignette well thought-out and explored.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's all there is: vignettes. Natsume Yuujinchou is episodic in nature, meaning that there is no overarching plot. While this isn't horrible, it's kind of frustrating to see interesting youkai introduced, only to stick around for one episode and then dissipate after their story is done. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty cheap. Not bad, just cheap. Don't expect any more movement then is necessary. Also, I think the original author had a mask fetish, because many of the characters have their faces partially covered, meaning facial expressions are often a non-issue. The monster designs are for the most part simple but good looking. However, the action isn't always as crisp and fluid as it could be.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOnce again, the show differs from a lot of contemporary anime by being very subdued for the most part. All of the acting is good, it's just very toned-down. It tends to make most of the performances forgettable. Also, the background music is fairly bland, and the themes that do stand out sound suspiciously close to stuff you'd hear in Azumangah Daioh. I will say this, though: the opening and closing themes rock. Well, not in the literal sense. They are both quieter, softer pieces, but they fit the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nProbably the most frustrating part of the show. The characters are usually very interesting, but so many of them are one-shots that it feels like a waste. This is partially remedied in the second season, where characters start coming back, but for this season, don't expect to see too much development outside of Natsume and Nyanko-sensei. However, both of these main characters are well-developed, and they are explored fairly well, which makes up for the other characters not getting screen-time. Although I will say this about Natsume: you could get that kid to do anything for you, if you mentioned you felt lonely. He is such a sucker for the lonely card.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is not a party anime. It's not big or loud enough to watch with a lot of friends, but it is a nice, relaxing, thoughtful piece to watch on your own. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely unique. If you don't like over-the-top, flashy anime like Gurren Lagan, then you might prefer Natsume Yuujinchou's approach to story-telling. Also, as a final note, the second season is better because it builds off what is established in this season. Anyways, if you're searching for an anime to watch after a stressful day, this is a great choice.\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou covers a familiar kind of story. We are presented with a teenage boy, who is unusually airy and doesn't socialize much, and frequently seems to be looking intently at things that aren't there. As you may have guessed, Natsume sees dead people. Well, not exactly... he can see Youkai, a kind of spirit told of in Japanese folklore.\r\nManyof the Youkai themselves seem to possess an unusual interest in Natsume. One day, as a pair of Youkai are chasing him, he accidentally breaks a seal containing a powerful Youkai... one that knows why Natsume is being chased. You see, his grandmother Reiko had the same gift as him, and used to go around beating up Youkai and making them give away their names to her (which allowed her to command them), which she collected in a book, the titular Yuujinchou (Book of Friends). And now that Reiko is dead, Natsume has to attempt to return the names, but without losing the book in the process. And his new Youkai friend Madara has agreed to help protect him, as long as he is entitled to the book upon Natsume's natural passing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is really impressive about Natsume Yuujinchou is that, from that plot summary there, you will mostly likely think of many other series from various different mediums that follow a similar blueprint. And yet Natsume is significantly better than them. Natsume, as a series, takes on this theme with a brilliant level of poignancy. Rather than being a generic shonen action series as it so easily could have been (many of the bare bones of the series show parallels to Bleach, for example), Natsume is more concerned with telling the stories of each of these Youkai. While there is the occasional flash of action, this is never really the point. It's extremely refreshing to see a premise so frequently used for nothing more than cheap kicks done so beautifully. It even strikes something of a contrast with excellent series such as Mushishi and Mononoke, in that while these are focused on the abnormality of the creatures the series is based around, Yuujinchou is far more down to earth and human-feeling.\\n\\n\r\nPlotwise, this series is episodic, with the episodes focusing on individual youkai, with the stories not generally intertwining or crossing more than one episode (though there are exceptions). Almost all of the episodes are excellent, though there's two or three I didn't really care for. The second season in particular ups the quality of these, with the last four standing out as being firmly the best out of both seasons. There's not really anything in the way of an overarching plot or any clear goal, but it's all tied together through the furthering of Natsume's character and the additional insights into Reiko which we see through the Youkai's memories, both of which are excellent features of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation in this series is truly unique. Every character is very down-to-earth and believable, and yet not quite your everyday average Joe either. They all have distinctive personalities, and yet feel totally natural. The character designs are much the same way: simple-looking, but effective and distinctive. The only characters who are consistently in every episode are Natsume himself, and his Youkai bodyguard Madara A.K.A Nyanko-sensei. Madara is mostly comic relief, but effectively so. In his true form he's much easier to take seriously, which is often used to good effect. Natsume, on the other hand, is definitely the pinnacle of the aforementioned style. He doesn't really have a clear, character-defining moment or trait, which initially makes him seem like an uninteresting character. However, the more you get to know him, the better a character he seems. He is slowly but surely characterised through musings and realizations gathered through his experiences with all the Youkai he meets, painting a subtle yet excellent portrait of his character. In the third season, this reaches it's peak, as he slowly comes to not only accept, but value his unique circumstances and all the friends he's made because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production, the animation is superb. Oddly, though, it's quite restrained about it. Aside from some really beautiful, picturesque background art, it doesn't attempt to beat you over the head with its visuals, letting them stay in the background but subtly lending a lot to the series. In the second season especially, though, it dishes out quite a few animation bumps in some of the series more excellent moments, when it really needs to be rendered better. With this, combined with an excellent character art style, Natsume Yuujinchou just plain looks beautiful all-round. Musically, the OST does much the same as the art: it is distinct, amazing, perfectly fitting, but not overbearing. The music is invariably perfectly matched to the tone of the scene rather than being used to create the tone. The voice acting is all-round excellent, but my only problem with it is, strangely enough, Natsume himself. Hiroshi Kamiya was, in my opinion, a poor choice of casting. He does, however, put in an excellent performance which is hardly surprising given how good of an actor he is, but his voice seems terribly unfit to the role, and far more suited to more average and highly strung protagonists like those he usually plays, as opposed to the awkward, airy Natsume. Still, it's hardly distracting.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have any real complaint about Natsume Yuujinchou, it's that almost every episode's plot is built from a random contrivance. Generally, Natsume encounters something vital to the plot of the episode by sheer coincidence that is not directly tied to the plot at all. It's not terribly distracting, but it's done repeatedly and always seems far too convenient.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, Natsume Yuujinchou is an excellent series. It's a calming, relaxing show that simply does its job well. The second and third seasons are better than the first, with the second having better standalone episodes, along with better art and directing than the other two, and the third contributing more to the overall story and Natsume's development. Which season is the best is really a question of style vs. substance.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Something I would solidly recommend to anyone looking for a calming, soothing anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSeason One Overall: 8/10\\n\r\nSeason Two Overall: 9/10\\n\r\nSeason Three Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Mushi-shi, XxXHoLic",

            "content": "I watched this anime basically on a whim. I read the name somewhere and just started watching it. I have to say that I wasn\u2019t too impressed by this series by the first episode, but that certainly changed later on.\r\nPlease note that this is a review of all four seasons of Natsume Yuujinchou. However, my feelings towards this show have changed significantly over the course of watching this. So here is the rough draft of my experience:\r\nSeason One: Wow, this is totally above my expectations. Pretty good. 7/10.\r\nSeason Two: Well shit, I accidently marathoned this. I fear that I\u2019m falling in love with this show.8/10.\\n\r\nSeason Three: I love this show. Please don\u2019t let it end. 9/10.\\n\r\nSeason Four: I LOVE THIS SHOW. SHIT IT\u2019S ENDING NO SHIT SHIT SHIT NOOO\u2013 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly. This show is amazing. With brilliant bittersweet episodic plotlines, likable and well-developed characters and just an extraordinary overall feeling of atmosphere, this show excels in almost everything it tries to do. This show is one of the most heartwarming anime that I have ever seen, and as it kept going, it only got better and better. A must-watch for everybody, unless you have a brick for a heart or can\u2019t stomach anything without explosions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou doesn\u2019t have an \u2018overarching plot\u2019 or anything, and mostly relies on various episodic stories to keep itself going. Most episodes follow the following structure:\\n\\n\r\n1. A youkai gets introduced. \\n\r\n2. The youkai either has a problem or causes a problem.\\n\r\n3. Natsume solves this problem and learns something about himself in the process. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends is a very simple show. But its beauty lies in how much it managed to do with such a simplistic concept. Every story is heartwarming and unique in its own way, and even if the episodes follow the same general formula, it never seems to get old. The episodes in season one and season two mainly focused on various one-off characters, while the third and fourth season began to focus more on Natsume himself. Regardless of what story they\u2019re telling, they manage to make it beautiful. Every episode I left with a small smile on my face, even if I sometimes had a knot in my stomach from the emotional moments. This anime just contains so much heart: it\u2019s very clear that the people behind the show had a certain passion for it and it shines brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nIt also helps that the entire atmosphere for this show is brilliant. The world, in and off itself, isn\u2019t really anything special. But it has this feeling to it that\u2019s very hard to pin down and describe: a feeling that is almost bittersweet, but not quite. Heartwarming, yet, at the same time, it also carries this air of melancholy. It\u2019s a very calm show, and the perfect thing to watch when you are anxious or depressed. \\n\\n\r\nIf I really had to nitpick I\u2019d say that the first episode was bad. And yeah, it is. But in the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t feel like it really matters all that much.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the story, despite (or maybe because of) its simplicity managed to create a beauty that is very rare to find among any form of media.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, just like the rest of the show, only get better and better as the seasons go on. One of this anime\u2019s strongest points, in my opinion, is Natsume\u2019s character development.  \\n\\n\r\nNatsume Takashi is the main character of this show. At a young age he lost both his parents and has since been passed down his relatives, none of whom wanted to keep him because of his ability to see youkai. Those relatives ranged from distant to downright abusive. Finally, about a month before the show starts, the Fujiwaras took him in and he finally got a stable life. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show, we see him as a lonely and somewhat depressed teenager. He has an air of sadness and maturity to him, which isn\u2019t surprising, considering his childhood has been very tough. And this shows. He is mature beyond his age, has some obvious trust issues and is very quiet. He is also very nice and genuinely cares about everything and everyone around him. He is not a saint however; he sometimes gets angry and frustrated. He has emotions like all of us and they can be hurt, but, at the beginning of the show, he is sure to suppress them and not let it show. \\n\r\nAs the anime progresses we see him grow from a self-conscious boy into one who is much more secure about himself and has more trust in the world around him. His development is so subtle that you don\u2019t even notice it until you start comparing scenes from the first few episodes to scenes in the later ones. It\u2019s brilliantly done.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that he, like the show, grows on you without you even noticing it. I initially didn\u2019t think that I cared much about him; I never noticed any sense of particular attachment. However, during an arc in season two, some youkai hurt him and I just found myself immensely furious. I wanted that thing dead, and right now. I think I might have actually started yelling at my screen. That\u2019s when I realized that I actually cared about him to the point of having my protective urges roused, something that almost never happens to me. \\n\\n\r\nAs the seasons progressed, I only found myself getting more and more attached to him, until I came to the point that I was probably sadder than him when he got into a bad situation. I think that this might just be the strongest I\u2019ve ever felt about a character.\\n\\n\r\nAnother main character that I wanted to note was Nyanko-sensei/Madara. Even though he is largely played for comic relief, he is also a really good character in himself. His interactions with Natsume are especially precious. Even though they argue most of the time and Nyanko-sensei will deny that he cares for Takashi, it is very clear that he does. The way they show this is great, with small gestures meaning a lot and moments of silence often speaking louder than words. If I had the time, I could point out the many scenes I believe illustrate this the best, but it\u2019s best if you just go and watch yourself. \\n\\n\r\nOther than him, the other reoccurring important side characters are noteworthy too. Although their development is littler than that of Natsume, it\u2019s still pretty amazing what they managed to do with relatively little screen time. The differences between the characters are so noticeable when watching the episodes from season one and four back to back, yet so unnoticeable when you\u2019re actually watching the show chronologically, the youkai characters maybe excepted. Even so, I once again have to applaud this anime for their subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nEven the episodic characters are good. Even though they only get one arc to establish themselves, they are still good enough that you actually care what happens to them. Their stories are often heart wrenching and you can\u2019t help but want the best for them, even if they aren\u2019t particularly memorable. \\n\r\nThe characters of Natsume Yuujinchou shine in their quietest moments, and the subtlety of their development makes them all the more believable. Like the rest of the show, you will find yourself unknowingly getting attached to them and not regretting a single thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are the only parts where the show isn\u2019t doing exceptionally well. The first season in particular fell short on both of these things, with bad animation and a terrible opening. The animation in the fight scenes (as short and limited as they were) was especially cringe worthy. The camera-angles were also off. I first blamed this on bad directing, but after watching the rest of the show, I know that I was wrong. I don\u2019t know what it is, though, but the choices they make are just really weird. Hiding your main character behind an umbrella while he is talking for more than a minute is very distracting, guys. \\n\\n\r\nAs the second season began, however, there was a very noticeable increase in animation budget, leading to a drastic change in animation quality. While it still wasn\u2019t the best, it didn\u2019t need to be. It managed to accentuate the tone of the show rather nicely, and the backgrounds in particular were great (they already were in the first season, for the record). I also liked the design for several of the youkai, even if I did notice a rather lack of distinction later on in the series (all \u2018good\u2019 spirits began to look a lot like humans). \\n\\n\r\nLike I already mentioned, I dislike the opening for the first season. I just can\u2019t stand it. I think it somehow sounds like a bad cover of a good song, and it bothers me. The second opening, however, is great. I love the visuals for it, and the song is very catchy. It was a joy to listen to. I thought the third opening was kind of meh again, but the fourth was pretty good. The ending to season one was slightly better than its opening, but I still didn\u2019t like it. I love all the other endings equally, though. And the art style they use in them is great.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is simple, using very few instruments (a lot of which are commonly used in traditional Japanese music) and manages to set the tone for this show perfectly. At first, I wasn\u2019t too fond of it on its own, but it grew on me, like the rest of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, even though the animation and the soundtrack aren\u2019t the greatest things ever, they still hold up pretty well and complement the show rather nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nNatsume\u2019s Book of Friends is a show that has grown very close to my heart. Before watching this, I never understood how people could want a show to go on forever. I have always wanted my shows to end, and I was always happy when I reached those endings. But with Natsume Yuujinchou, I actually found myself stalling, restricting myself to watching only so many episodes a day so that I could enjoy this as long as I could. That is the single biggest complement that I can give a show. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is brilliant in almost every way; the characters are well-developed, the plotlines are heartwarming and the music and animation create the brilliant atmosphere that makes this show what it is. I honestly have no idea how anyone can dislike this anime, unless you just really dislike shows without action or are just plain heartless. Not to say that you're a bad person if you didn't like this but just... how?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s flaws are minor, and its pros are huge. Honestly, there is no reason for anyone to skip this masterpiece, so go forth and watch it. Now.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those animes which just somehow makes its way into your heart and makes such a deep imprint that you would probably never be able to forget it. Natsume Yuujinchou (I watched all 4 seasons, and reviewing them in one go as they are more like a single entity anyway) is a beautiful rare gem in the anime world that often goes unnoticed, yet each and every person I know who have watched it have been touched so deeply by it. \r\nStory:\r\nThe highlight of this anime is the storyline, and how its delivered. It has a very laidback pace, allowing the storyto gently bloom; the exact opposite of an intense high speed story. But it manages to do that with a grace that is never dull or boring, and just mesmerizes so you are pulled along gently by the story. The anime is episodic in nature, so every episode has a different story, but the 2nd season onwards do build upon previous stories and characters, so there is a sense of continuity.The main theme is about the conflict between the supernatural world of the youkais and humans, and Natsume's struggle to find his place in between these conflicting worlds. The theme of self discovery and companionship, as well as kindness and acceptance are the main focus of the anime, and well written and developed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I love the gentle vignette style of the art, with soft colours and landscapes, rather than details and sharp contrasts, this seems to suit the characters and the story better anyway. It reminds me a bit of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's art style (Totoro especially).\\n\\n\r\nSound: Absolutely LOVED all the openings and endings for all 4 seasons, they all fit the story so well, and the atmosphere and mood of the anime. The seiyuus were also brilliant, especially Nyanko sensei (Kazuhiko Inoue, who is also the voice behind loads of famous roles like Kakashi from Naruto)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI fell utterly in love with Natsume within the first season, and fell deeper with every episode since then. The character development for Natsume and Nyanko-sensei especially were done very well, and I love how the 2nd season onwards had more regular characters who stayed on for more of the series (the first season usually had characters come on just for one ep). Even with characters who didn't stay long, they still managed to give a solid impression and a fully fleshed character setting. Every character was realistic and relatable, and managed to engage my emotions well. Natsume will always have a special place in my heart",

            "content": "\"They come without asking, and then they leave just the same. But once you meet them, even if nobody ever knows it, that encounter will change your life for the better\". This quote by Natsume Takashi might be the best to describe what this show feels like. Episodic experiences between him and youkai.\r\nAs the episodes passes by, we see how Takashi grows and adapts to his condition. Except that, this growth is at a snail's pace. This arises a question. How many of these experiences are meaningful to the story and to Takashi? If that sounds like my problem with the series, I got badnews. I'm assured that if this was the only issue of this show, it would be among my favorites right now.\\n\\n\r\nWhat breaks this anime's potential is the easy prediction of the plot. Usually two options can preceed or follow whatever that happens. And you can foresee the outcomes often with no effort. As you get used to the anime structure, you will notice that the plot can't go anywhere out of its zone of comfort. Why? Because the story setting doesn't let it at all. In a more realistic approach, Takashi would be either lost or dead with ease. Or, have at least another social breakdown. And, the world of youkai shows itself to be too dangerous to a powerless human. So, whenever Takashi is in danger, there are two ifs. If the action is from a helping party, someone (or his own powerful punch) pops up to save him. If the action is from an enemy, the youkai/villain either kidnapps him or give up on trying if it's a resolution point.\\n\\n\r\nTakashi's positive development accounts for the most beautiful moments of the series. But this spiral of positiveness also cripples the possibilities for the story. The result is the feel that there's no actual risks or stakes since everything ends alright. Takashi must end with a positive outcome, or the whole setting would fall apart otherwise. And in the end of the day, there's nothing else for the series to do to explore new grounds. Except for having our MC to meet more youkai and get more involved with them. This is what gives volume to the series. Takashi's development is minor. You'll only notice a major difference by the third season. Which, is currently the best season of Natsume Yuujinchou.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good series for a weekly, seasonal watch. The visuals are fair enough and the animation is often dull, but this don't detach anything from the anime. Soundtracks are relaxing and go on with the mood. But, expect to see them (along with the art) being the same along the seasons. There are some emotional moments that can or can not hit close to home. But, the selling point of the show that makes me recommend it to anyone is Nyanko-sensei. He is just... Hilarious. I've seen myself many times laughing at his round, fat face.\\n\\n\r\nFor a series claimed by many as \"emotional\", it's kind of a disappointment. But it's still a heart warming experience. To those needing a show to watch once in a while to relax, this is a nice pick. Too bad that for the most of it, the series almost fails to make justice to its own fame. In the end of the day, Natsume Yuujinchou isn't a dramatic tale of the sorts. It's a collection of episodic, often funny adventures of Takashi and his cat.",

            "content": "This is not an anime for people who are looking for something with action and cute characters. Natsume Yuujinchou is a thought provoking anime, one that encompasses many different genres (drama, slice of life, tragedy, fantasy). The story may look slow but each episode is well thought out and provides insights on the main characters of the anime. Each episode has a message or a lesson for Natsume, and viewers in my opinion; most of them are common knowledge, but they serve as a reminder to the people who watch the series.\r\nThe anime has a lot of fun and humour in it, but alsotragedy and sadness at the same time. Each episode left me wanting to see more of the anime just to see how Natsume would treat a new situation. Initially, I found this anime under Kamiya, Hiroshi's name before it was aired and the synopsis was kind of promising. And as each episode was aired, I found out that I really could not wait for the next episode; It was a long wait for the four seasons to finish but well worth it. Now I wish there was more for me to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is full of bittersweet moments that should generally leave a person feeling angry or upset but it is not the case here. Oddly enough, where Natsume should have ended up hating people, he ends up loving them more. The strength of his character is something that is awe worthy.  \\n\\n\r\nStory and Plot - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost people who watch this anime will not see a plot in the start of the anime, but there is one. This anime follows the day to day life of Natsume, Takashi and his youkai \"guardian\" Madara(who Natsume affectionately calls Nyanko-sensei). Natsume is not your ordinary teenage boy like in other anime; he has the ability to see youkai and this has earned him a hard childhood. Orphaned at a young age, he was passed around his extended family due to his strange nature. As a child no one believed him about the things that only he could see and everyone either thought that he wanted attention or was insane. Due to this, Natsume slowly closed himself off from other people and dealt with his pain silently. \\n\\n\r\nOne day, he accidently meets a youkai named Madara who mistakes Natsume for his deceased grandmother, who also could see youkai. Madara tells Natsume about a book that his grandmother kept called The Book of Friends, which contains the names of all the youkai she \"defeated\". This is where the story of Natsume Yuujinchou begins, as Natsume is determined to return all the names while Madara tries to stop him since he wants the book for himself. As Natsume returns the names of the youkai, he slowly learns more about his deceased grandmother and the differences in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story comes together in the four seasons of the anime. Each episode, though may seem stand alone, actually bring forth the main plot of the story which is Natsume's understanding of the world around him and his place in it. Through his many adventures, he changes his views and learns to trust other people. For the first time, Natsume makes true friends who he feels he can depend on and will not shun him due to his weird nature. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Character Design - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimple art to follow a simple anime; some people say that the art is nothing big or that it's not beautiful like other anime. Natsume Yuujinchou is not a flashy anime with a flashy story, the story is very simple and thus the art flows with it. I personally feel the art is amazing, simple and unique yet with a lot of detail. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, simple and yet beautiful music to compliment the anime. The soundtrack is as amazing as the anime, from the opening to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBest part of the anime is not the story but rather the characters. The main characters are Natsume, Takashi and Madara but Natsume, Reiko can also be seen as somewhat of a main character. There is a lot of character development for most of the characters in the series but mostly centered on Natsume, Takashi and Madara. Natsume, Reiko's character is used as an eye opener for Natsume, Takashi; where Reiko isolated herself from the rest of the world, Takashi learns to open up slowly to his friends and leave his loneliness behind. Also, each of the youkai that Natsume encounters helps Natsume understand his youkai friends, gaining more respect and understanding towards youkai in general. The youkai in the anime are shown to have the same human tendencies and are not so different from humans in reality. \\n\\n\r\nNatsume, Takashi: I guess some people may see him as a sissy or something along those lines, but can you really call him a sissy? It takes one to know one really. In society today, people who are compassionate and understanding are viewed as a sissy and this is why society does not progress much. I feel Natsume's personality is very rare to come across amongst people and quite refreshing. Regardless of the amount of torment he has gone through, Natsume still holds a lot of respect for people and shows no hatred towards anyone. He is kind and gentle but cautious at the same time with people due to his childhood experience.\\n\\n\r\nMadara or Nyanko-sensie: A powerful youkai with a lot of influence, Madara at first shows that his sole purpose of being with Natsume is to use him in order to get the Book of Friends. But slowly you see that Madara does in fact care about Natsume and a bond is formed between the two. Madara appears to understand Natsume more than most of the other characters and surprising shows a more gentler side towards Natsume in contrast to his regular boastful, selfish and kind of mean personality. \\n\\n\r\nViewer Enjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime where I could not wait for the next season to air. The re-watch value of this anime for me is very high as I have already re-watched all four seasons twice already, going on third. This anime is amongst the few that I have re-watched so many times. Don't feel ashamed if you watch this anime and find yourself in tears. Unique in its own way, Natsume Yuujinchou is a story about a journey, a journey of understanding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating - 100/10 can I?\\n",

It's a show I enjoy watching whenever life has been busy, complicated, or stressful, and I just want to clear my mind and relax.  When I don't want heavy plotlines, psychological twists, or violence.  When I crave something simple.\r\nBut simple doesn't mean childish.  This show might be rated PG, but it's still something that even adults can enjoy.  I normally don't like slice-of-life dramas, but there's something fresh and unconventional about this.  If you've read the originalmanga, or any of the other mangas by Yuki Midorikawa, you'll recognize the \"gentle\" air it has.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis:\\n\r\nNatsume Takeshi has the unfortunate ability to see spirits.  The spirits tend to look like humans or human/animal creatures.  As a little boy, he told others about them,  but was often mocked and called a liar.  Now he's in high school, living in the countryside with just his guardians.  He keeps his ability a secret, and doesn't make close friends with anyone.  One day he finds a strange home-made book with weird scribbles.  It turns out that it belonged to his grandmother, Natsume Reiko.  Reiko could also see spirits.  And being a bit of a bully, she kept their names in this book, the Book of Friends.  Whoever owns the book is the master of the spirits whose names are in it.  And now Natsume owns the book.  Wishing to right his grandma's wrongs, he decides to release the spirits enslaved by the book.  And one spirit who takes the form of a cat, decides to become Natsume's bodyguard.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how things get set up.  Most episodes are self-contained, with Natsume assisting spirits (or trying to survive evil ones) with the cat, Nyanko-Sensei (aka \"Sensei\") tagging along.  We meet a few new characters along the way, and learn about Natsume's personality and past.  His disheartening experiences with other people in the past make him a loner much of the time.  And because he appreciates his guardians, he doesn't want them to worry about him, whether it's over his abilities, or over a fever.  It's a bit heartbreaking to see him trying desperately to keep secrets from them, all for the sake of \"their own good.\"  \\n\\n\r\nSensei provides most of the comic relief.  The cat form is one he uses to conserve energy (he really looks like a giant white wolf).  But as a ridiculously fat white-and-orange cat, visible to humans, he trots around town as his own boss.  He is a huge glutton and has a great fondness for sake.  He has bad a reputation at the local \"spirit tavern.\"  He is under the impression that he is Natsume's master, and that he has the right to someday eat him and take possession of the Book of Friends.  But despite his constant threats toward Natsume, you get the idea that he actually has a soft spot for him.\\n\\n\r\nAside from those two, we don't get to know other characters that much.  There isn't a huge human cast in the first place (it's the middle of the countryside, for goodness sake), and we mostly only discover the backgrounds of the spirits that need assistance from Natsume.  The fact that we don't get very involved with other characters, emphasizes Natsume's loneliness.  But it also makes me identify a lot with him, because we're not getting intimate with anyone else.  His somewhat bland and down-to-earth personality, his naivety and ability to enjoy the simple life, make him feel realistic instead of idealized.  He's not an angsty hero teen who wants to save the world.  He just wants to live and let live.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is worth a note.  The art in the original manga is rather unconventional.  It's very light and sketchy, almost doodle-like.  It's not a style that can be easily copied into an anime.  And while it's not exactly copied, the anime art still keeps the \"light\" feel.  The faces do look the same, for the most part.  The color palatte is also very plain, more on the neutral side, and colors seem a bit washed-out, and naturalistic.  It bolsters the \"fresh\" vibe this anime gives, avoiding strong contrasts and bright, un-natural colors (there are no pink or blue-haired people!).  \\n\\n\r\nThe setting in the countryside, the bright summer sunshine, the buzzing cicadas....  It really puts you right into the lazy summer setting.  The first 13 episodes of the series take place in summer.  The second 13 (in \"Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou\") take place in winter, the season of the dying year.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music perfectly convey the mood.  The ending music (for both) is particularly wistful.\\n\\n\r\nAll the events in the anime are from the manga, though not always presented in the same order.  Because the stories are very episodic, it's easy to do.  The whole spirit of the manga is conveyed well, so if you enjoyed the manga, you should enjoy the anime, and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\n***Some people have called the series a \"shounen ai\" (BL) series.  It is NOT unless you REALLY read things into it.  To emotionally protect himself, Natsume keeps his spirit-vision a secret.  But he eventually discovers Natori, a young, but slightly older man who can also see spirits.  They are both rather excited, since they've finally found someone they don't have to keep their ability a secret from.  Though Natsume is still not ready to be close friends with him yet, Natori expresses interest in being his mentor.  Natori's day job is an actor, so he has a bit of a flamboyant air.  But that's as far as things go.***\\n\\n\r\nThere's essentially no objectionable content.  There's some mild language, and a small amount of peril and violence.\\n\\n\r\nSo when you need to relax, and clean out your mind with something fresh, give \"Natsume\" a try.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nFirst of all i need to mention that this review will be a review of all the seasons so i will post this to here and to the sixth season's review section.\r\nWhen i first started watching Natsume Yuujinchou, it felt kind of boring. It was cute and all but i am not a person who watches episodal anime that much. I felt like i would drop it if it continued like that. Because every episode Natsume met with a new youkai and gave their name or helped them. And i found it a bit boring. But i kept watching. At the end ofseason one, i got used to how the story goes on and i got used to the characters.\\n\r\nThen i started watching the second season. I realized that i actually started liking it.\\n\r\nAnd when i started watching the third season, i loved it. \\n\r\nIt probably wasnt because the third season had better quality than the second season or the first season. It was probably because, you get to know some characters during the first two seasons, you get to know the whole town and the anime makes you feel like you are a part of that world now. You feel the characters feelings as if they are you friends, you feel the sadness in the air, you feel the happiness... \\n\r\nSo yes, it started slowly but it was done like that to be able to have a really good setting. And when you get into it, you love it.\\n\r\nAlso when they were finished with introducing the characters and the setting, they started telling a main story too. And the main story interested me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAfter i started liking it, i loved watching all the episodes. The fifth season had some boring episodes in my opinion but only \"some\".\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou had a really calming atmosphere. There were many episodes i watched with a smile on my face. There were many episodes that made me forget my saddness. And there were many episodes that made me really emotional too. Natsume meets with many youkai and has a journey with many youkai. Of course you can not relate to all of the youkai's feelings but there were many times i related a lot and felt like crying a lot. And also when they became happy, there were a lot of times i became happy too.  \\n\r\nStory-8\\n\\n\r\nThe art develops a lot. There are 3 years between the first season and the second season. Also there is 4 years between the fourth season and the fifth season. Thats why the art gets a lot better in the sixth season and its really beautiful. Especially the sixth season's opening is a feast for one's eyes.\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\\n\r\nI really liked many of the openings and the endings except the first season's. Also the insert songs are great imo too. There is especially one song called Haru wo shiraseru mono. Whenever i hear it, i feel so many emotions inside.\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\\n\r\nI really like nearly all of the characters. I even like Reiko and want to see her a lot more. \\n\r\n*Natsume is the best boy*\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, i loved Natsume Yuujinchou. If you would like to watch something relaxing you should deff give it a chance. And dont drop it in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nBtw my 9 starts is for the whole series\\n\r\n1st season-7stars\\n\r\n2nd season-8 stars\\n\r\n3rd season-9 stars\\n\r\n4th season-9 stars\\n\r\n5th season- 8 stars\\n\r\n6th season-9 stars",

            "content": "-INTRODUCTION-\r\nI've been looking forward to this anime ever since I saw one of the promotional images -- Natsume sitting on a tree branch with his foot slightly touching the water underneath, and an unusual looking cat by his side. I fell in love with that image alone and could not stop thinking about it. Needless to say, I watched Natsume Yuujinchou while it was still ongoing and waited eagerly for the subtitles to come out. Now that it's over, I can say for sure -- it was a short but beautiful experience, and became one of my very special personal favorites.\r\n-STORY- 10/10\r\n\"Thank you... for notgrowing to hate humans.\"\\n\\n\r\nEach episode Natsume encounters a different youkai. Sometimes, it's a youkai seeking to get his/her name back; at other times, a youkai wanting some other help from Natsume, which he can never refuse.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as those stories revolve around youkai, Natsume Yuujinchou is ultimately about humans. It focuses on the bonds between humans, as well as the bonds between humans and youkai.\\n\\n\r\nEach story is very well thought out and carries a deep message that Natsume derives from his encounters. Reasons why Natsume cannot let go of his bond with youkai, reasons why youkai fall in love with humans; Natsume Yuujinchou is a collection of beautiful bittersweet pieces of a not very ordinary every day life. Each piece left me with a somewhat sad but warm feeling and made me go back to re-watch and think upon it again and again.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is full of unique personalities. Natsume does not help youkai just because he has nothing better to do. His bond with the beings of the other world is very deep and is explored in great detail. From a boy who was forced to shut himself off from nearly all humans, Natsume grows to trust humans again and shares his experiences with others. Seemingly eager for nothing more than obtaining the Book of Friends, Madara is also not that simple of a character. With time, he becomes attached to Natsume and, despite his own constant contradictions, appears to worry more about his companion than the actual book.\\n\\n\r\nYoukai are also very interesting. Although most of them appear only in their assigned episode, each one is very memorable, and their personalities and inner troubles are so well thought out that it's hard to believe that they were really present for only twenty minutes.\\n\\n\r\n-ART/ANIMATION- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is beautiful. It may seem rather simple, but it couldn't be more perfect for this anime. In fact, the simplicity of it is what makes it truly stunning for me. It greatly enhances the story and the atmosphere with its warm colors and memorable designs. Also, every time a scene of Natsume returning youkai's name is shown, I fall in love with this anime all over again; it almost makes me feel his breath as he blows out the letters from the page.\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter the very first episode, I fell in love with both opening and ending songs. Like the artwork, the soundtrack is beautiful in its simplicity and fits Natsume Yuujinchou's atmosphere perfectly. It's the kind of music that probably would not feel the same or as special outside of the actual anime, but combined with the rest of the aspects, it becomes a wonderful soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? I fell completely in love with this anime. If you want something relaxing and heartwarming, Natsume Yuujinchou is for you.",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is possibly the most powerful, thought-provoking anime I've ever seen. The amount of emotions you'll experience is nothing short of incredible, especially when you consider the anime's 13 episode length.\r\nPity, anger, sorrow, astonishment, and absolute elation are to name a few.\r\nAnd some tears on the side...Manly tears, obviously.\r\nStory- 10/10\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is episodic, there is no defining plot line. The most common, unifying theme is Natsume's ultimate goal to return all the Youkai names that his Grandmother Reiko took and stored in the Book of Friends. The episodes range from various Youkai simply wanting their names back, to far more complex issues such aslonely spirits longing for companionship, desperate to relive the memories that are so precious to them.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is wrapped up so masterfully, so beautifully, that it's nearly impossible to not spend the next few moments contemplating what you've just seen. The messages and lessons conveyed are just as pertinent as they are meaningful. At some point in everyone's life, there will be something (a problem, ability, anything) that they feel is impossible to talk about, that no one can relate. As Natsume Yuujinchou illustrates, isolation is rarely the answer, and through purposeful human (and maybe not so human) interactions, inner peace can be achieved.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Natsume Yuujinchou is phenomenal, depicting a gorgeous countryside town. Each aspect of the landscape is drawn with amazing attention to detail, the large plains of grass not just being lush green, but also golden, with a few shades of light red. The bodies of water are drawn to ripple realistically with the hustling and bustling of fish (and water-related Youkai). The light from the sun pours through the openings of the trees in a divine manner. The human characters are drawn with that middle of the road style of animation, where they aren't too realistic but they also aren't too cartoonish, too cartoonish being enormous eyes, no visible nose, etc. Youkai are drawn in almost every way imaginable, the sky was the limit in creating these spirits as each episode continuously provides unique designs. The artwork never falters, and remains beautiful at every attempt made, from fireworks in the night sky, to majestic, elegant Youkai.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with the opening song upon first listen. Without thinking about it, I always found myself singing along, the tempo getting faster and faster, my excitement growing more and more. This opening is truly the perfect fit for Natsume Yuujinchou, as it is expressive of my anticipation for the upcoming episode. This was the same case with the end song, perfectly fitting, as it always sums up the current episode, allowing you to become engrossed in your own thoughts. The almost nostalgic way the music starts quietly playing right before the end of the episode, a slightly melancholic acoustic guitar chimes in, and emotions begin to overflow. A memorable end for an unforgettable anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the Youkai encountered are, aside from the general superiority complex over humans, very different. Their personalities are what keeps the show fresh. A Youkai that first appears to be nothing but malicious may actually have a much more complicated character, though that isn't to say there are no instances of purely malevolent Youkai. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that superiority complex, most of the Youkai do in fact have human tendencies. Love, loneliness, and real bonds of friendship are all things that Youkai are not entirely devoid of. It becomes obvious that, despite differences in appearence, powers, and social norms, humans and Youkai aren't so different...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that is enjoyable from start to finish, and as someone who is more prone to believe in the existence of the supernatural, I was enthralled. From now on, I'll think twice about those moments where a cold chill overcomes you, or when a blast of wind hits you on a relatively calm day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a fantasy masterpiece. If you're in the mood to cry tears of happiness (manly tears, naturally) or just see a great show, then this is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\n\"I can hear the footsteps of Winter, the cold night...But, this place is warm\"",

            "content": "Oh my goodness, where to start.\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a small gem of a series, and I'm glad I followed a friend's recommendation to watch it. This small, often overlooked series is so beyond charming that I wonder how anyone could pass it up!\r\nThe story is simple, because there's no overall arcing plot. The series basically consists of self-contained episodes where Natsume looks to help youkai with their problems and give them back their names. Sometimes he seeks to help out humans troubled by youkai. In any case, Natsume is always trying to help someone while \"Nyanko-sensei\" scolds him for his human stupidity.\r\nEach story serves ascharacter development, either for Natsume, the youkai involved, or both. The youkai teach Natsume about themselves and about humanity, and Natsume ends to teach the youkai that not all humans are so bad. Natsume learns to be more social and gains a few friends as the series goes on. For the most part, each episode has a fairly happy ending, though some are heartbreaking yet beautiful. Generally the show has a very optimistic outlook on things, but doesn't gloss over potential emotional tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. Everything about the style is simple and gentle, but very beautiful as a whole. The linework and soft colors work beautifully together, and the animation, when given to show off beyond walking and talking, is awesome. I welcome the simple and more realistic character designs for the humans, and the simple but not generic designs of the youkai.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the music. Like everything else in the series, it's subtle and unobtrusive, simple but very pretty. The opening and ending themes are also very fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment and overall value, let me say that I was disillusioned to anime a few years ago, and have very little patience for it now. But Natsume was so charming that I couldn't put it down once I found it. And now I'm hooked on season two! A definite recommendation.",

            "content": "Honestly, I don't really understand why this anime has so many amazing ratings. This isn't the worst anime i've ever seen- no, but I certainly do not think it's anywhere near the best.\r\nNow, let's talk about the story. \r\n3/10\r\nOne of the things I hated the most about this anime was the fact that it's episodic, and it doesn't work. In my opinion, this only makes it painfully predicable and underdeveloped. Honestly, you've seen the first three episodes you've seen the whole show. A youkai comes. Cool. They want Natsume's help. Oh. They get their help. There's a revelation. Ok.  The majority of the episodesfollow this structure. And for the first few or so episodes, yes. It's entertaining. Heartwarming even. But I wouldn't expect that to be the whole show. CAN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. CAN THE PLOT PROGRESS. CAN WE STOP THIS CYCLE. It's too simple. It got boring. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the art/animation...\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nThe art is uninteresting. It's boring. it's simple. Which pretty much matches the story. The story and the art go together. So I guess that's a good thing. It further sets the mood of the anime. It made it more boring for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sooouunnnd...\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nI hated the soundtrack of this anime. I always skipped the opening, which I almost never do. The sound effects and all that were clear. Voices, clear. So the sound is fine. That soundtrack though. No. But it does do a good job of  further setting the over all mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters...\\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime really lacks. What the hell even is Natsume's personality. He barely has one. The youkai though, they have much better personalities. But just because they're better than Natsume's doesn't mean they're deep or \"thought provoking\" no. But they are definitely entertaining. The one character I truly did like was Madara. He's a gem, really liked him. It's like they compensated for Natsume's lack of development with Madara's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment...\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\r\nIf you read what I previously wrote it's pretty obvious I did not enjoy this anime. I watched it to the end to be able to make a full conclusion about it. BUT BOY WAS THAT PAINFUL. \\n\\n\r\nOveralllllll...\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nI just think this anime wasn't for me. If you're the type of person that likes to decipher plots, enjoys suspense, twists and turns- this is really not the anime for you. Skip it. If you like more simple, heartwarming type things give this a try. This isn't the kinda anime where you're on the tip of your toes, heads spinning, mind boggling. This is the kinda anime you watch when you're in your room bored, too tired to watch something with a more developed, complex plot.",

But in all honesty, I've been meaning to write a review of Natsume Yuujinchou for quite a while now.  Despite seeing a slightly familiar format here e.g., A boy who can see and communicate with spirits (think Bleach), the anime is actually rather refreshing in it's nature.  The plot line is pretty easy to follow:  Natsume inherits a book from his grandmother (whom could also see spirits).  The book contains the names of all the spirits that said grandmotherdefeated.  The spirits, in turn, want their names returned - so they go to Natsume for help.  This is the basic rundown of the  plot - needless to say, that there is more to it than that.  But you'll have to watch it for yourselves.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is geared towards a more spiritual side of things, which gives it that refreshing feeling, and keeps things interesting.  Artistically, this is wonderful.  The art is almost mellow in places, and it reminds me a lot of Mushishi in style.  The colours are lovely and clean, but appear almost soft in their appearance.  It's also very nicely detailed.  A real pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself almost seems to be setting a nice, gentle pace for itself.  Not being familiar with the manga in any way, I can only hope that it carries on for a few more episodes before delving deeper into the underlying plotline.  This anime is almost addicting in it's nature.  It's actually quite rare to see an anime where everything just seems to fit, well, perfectly.  It's definitely fair to say that this is slowly turning into a real gem.  All I can say is that Natsume Yuujinchou has a lot of potential.",

It has a Mushishi-like elegance to the artwork and storytelling while at the same time following an xxxholic-esque structure aka. schoolboy meets schoolghost.\r\nIt is, however, naive to think that it is merely run of the mill supernatural anime stuff for it does have an extraordinarily well-written plot that follows closely to its original roots in the manga. It's brilliance is not in a complex storyline, grandiose tales of self-discovery or even the attainment of some extraordinary superpowers but the sharp, simple, \"I make this sound so ordinary\"feel to it. Like a haiku, it starts, develops and ends a story neatly within a chapter and any lingering sentiment after will only reflect the strength of its character developments within that short a period of time. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist too, is not extremely perculiar. He is Watanuki without the drama, changing and adapting without a lot of fuss. Taking his self-discovery all within stride, without any dramatic fireworks or outbursts either.

            "content": "When I first looked at this anime, I didn't think much about it. Now it's one of my favorites this season:\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is, in a nutshell, about a boy (Natsume Takashi) that can see spirits (demons, gods etc). Because of this, Natsume has been seen by his family as a \"freak\" and was never accepted in his relatives' house after his parents died.\r\nThe story takes place in a small village where another one of his relatives' house, where he found a book left behind by his late grandmother that can control any spirits that have their name in it...\r\nNatsume is a pretty episodic anime thatpacked with slice. The story is generally laid back while it still has a mysterious notion within each episode. A genuine slice of life anime. For people who doesn't understand that, slice of life pretty much means &quot;The main character going about his daily life&quot;, there's not going to be massive plot twists, epic action or anything of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of generally acceptable. Not particularly colorful like your shounen anime, but the dim coloring blends pretty well with the backgrounds. Out of the 4 episodes i've watched, there hasn't been any big changes in the animation, so i believe there won't be any degrading in the animation throughout the series\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the only setback to Natsume, the music. The OP and ED are a bit too laid back. Good for background music, but has no ipod/mp3 worthiness whatsoever in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThere are not much reoccurring characters in Natsume. \\n\r\n we have Natsume, who is a lazy but kindhearted boy and Nyako, a demon cat who just bums around but occassionally helps Natsume.\\n\r\nA major difference between this anime and other demon-themed anime is that demons in Natsume is usually good demons. While they do go berserk at times, these demons are generally friendly. A nice change compare to all those demon hunting anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm quite a fan of slice of life anime so this one is quite a treat. The nice demons were also something rare so pretty happy about that. If you want to find something else like Natsume, try Mushishi.",

I'm disappointed I wasted so much of my precious time on this shit. The only reason I gave it an over 3 rather than a 2 was because I did the math. \r\nBut without further ado;\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nWas there a story? 'Cause from what I saw it was just episode after episode of the same concept. A lot like Detective Conan, I suppose, but at least that is much more enjoyable and has a bit more depth to it thanNatsume Yuujinchou. If you're the type to like watching a shallow animes with no real goal to it, this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was good - the only thing that kept me from giving the anime a 2. The sceneries were well done, and the characters were drawn beautifully. The soothing light colours emphasized the calm and relaxing environment the story took place in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI usually like sad songs, but none from this anime really struck me as great. They were all just mediocre. But it fit according to the situation, so there's a plus. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters weren't very deep. The main character is a big nono for me - I hate guys who are so sissy and shy and submissive and basically a girl in animes. Though the cat demon thing was cute, and funny (hence why I increased it to a 3). The other demons don't have too much personality, or if they did, it was similar to other characters in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI only watched it because a friend of mine recommended it, but I was literally falling asleep every episode trying to finish it. You'll never understand how happy I was to finish the season and tell her that I hated it (she asked me to finish it completely before saying it sucks, so...). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nOver all, it sucked balls, to be compeltely honest. If you're into anime with an actual plot line, this isn't for you. But see for yourselves... if you dare! ;)",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is a series that began as a shoujo manga by Midorikawa Yuki. In 2008 an anime adaptation by Brain's Base aired. You may remember them from such anime as Baccano, Durarara, Penguindrum, Ixion Saga DT & Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. So, their stuff has been pretty mixed from what I've seen. With Oregairu at the upper end and Ixion Saga & Penguindrum tied at the low end. How will this one place? Let's have a look.\r\nStory:\r\nNatsume Takashi is a lonely boy. He's been ostracised for most of his life due to his ability to see youkai. After accidentally freeinga sealed one, that happens to look like a fat cat, he discovers that his grandmother, Reiko, could also see them. Not only that, but she went around collecting their names for her \u201cbook of friends\u201d which she could use to summon and control them. Being able to think of no ways to use such a thing, Natsume decides to go about returning the names. The narrative from there follows him as he encounters youkai and goes about thinning the book of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is just that it's tedious. It shouldn't be since it has al of thirteen episodes, but it manages. The dialogue has a tendency to repeat itself a lot. The events from the episodes are painfully predictable and the series just never reaches a point where things get interesting. The result is that it feels like a slog to get through. There's also a moment where they try to bring real world fact into the series, but they get the fact wrong. Basically, it uses the urban legend that birds will abandon their babies if a human handles them. Which I'm sure was invented by some arsehole who didn't want to bother helping a distressed baby bird but didn't want to look bad in front of their kids. Or maybe it's a fabrication that stems from wanting to protect the chicks from good-hearted people who are trying to help, but aren't helping.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series are the few flashbacks we get of his grandmother when she was young. She has personality and seems to be enjoying herself. Can I watch a series about her instead? I don't think it would be brilliant, but it would probably be better than this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nHerein lies the core flaw with the series. Natsume is one of the most boring characters I've seen in quite a while. See, his whole schtick is that he's a generic nice guy who's melancholy because he's special. That's pretty much the end all and be all that passes for his personality. He's about as compelling as an empty plastic crate. Well, less compelling. At least you could put something in the crate. Which is a big part of why the narrative itself is such a slog. We have this thoroughly uninteresting protagonist and it's impossible to feel any tension or investment in him. Seriously, can we watch the grandma's story instead? She has more personality by far and she's only in roughly five minutes of flashbacks. The supporting characters really aren't much better. They're flat tropes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is, by far, the best element of the series. The backgrounds are nicely drawn and detailed. The youkai designs are pretty creative. The animation does flow well. The character designs are... okay. The biggest issue with the art is Natsume himself. The two expressions he generally has are just a blank look and dull surprise.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi. He also voiced a boring character in Hachimitsu to Clover. But he's also given strong performances voicing characters like Levi and Otonashi Yuzuru. The problem with his performance in this, and indeed most of the performances, is just that there's nothing to work with. You really can't take a boringly written character and make them complex through the sheer power of acting. The music isn't good, but it does suit the series. It is just as boring as the narrative and the protagonist. You can't claim that Yoshimori Makoto isn't good at composing music that matches the tone.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little bit. Natsume has a couple of friends who bicker like a married couple. There's also a female youkai in the series who's outright stated to have had a thing for Natsume's grandmother. I'd kind of like to see the back story behind that one, actually. Seriously, why isn't this series about Reiko?\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is by no means a bad series. It's also by no means a good one. Ultimately, it's a boring series with very little that really stands out in either a positive or negative way. My final rating on it is a 5/10. Next week is Valentine's and you know what that means, we're going to look at a romance series. This year it's Love Stage.",

            "content": "This is my first anime review, so here goes.\r\nPlot Summary:\r\nNatsume is the new kid in town, and boy is he weird. He talks to the empty air more than real people, he's withdrawn, and sometimes he takes off running for no apparent reason. As it turns out, he's not crazy, just spiritual. He was born with the spiritual powers that allow him to see youkai (Japanese mythical creatures). He inherited this ability from his grandmother, who was known among the youkai as a powerful, fierce fighter. His grandmother used her abilities to defeat youkai and take their names, thus binding them in servitude. Now it'sNatsume's quest to set them free. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere is only one word to describe the tone of Natsume Yuujinchou: chill. Everything is very laidback, tranquil. The pace is much more deliberate than most anime, taking its time to fully stretch out a story over an episode. Yes, the pacing is slow, but it's the good kind of slow, where things take their time to develop. If you like fast-paced, nail-biting adventures, you're not going to find it here. However, if you don't mind waiting around for a story to blossom, then Natsume Yuujinchou usually delivers, with every vignette well thought-out and explored.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's all there is: vignettes. Natsume Yuujinchou is episodic in nature, meaning that there is no overarching plot. While this isn't horrible, it's kind of frustrating to see interesting youkai introduced, only to stick around for one episode and then dissipate after their story is done. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty cheap. Not bad, just cheap. Don't expect any more movement then is necessary. Also, I think the original author had a mask fetish, because many of the characters have their faces partially covered, meaning facial expressions are often a non-issue. The monster designs are for the most part simple but good looking. However, the action isn't always as crisp and fluid as it could be.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOnce again, the show differs from a lot of contemporary anime by being very subdued for the most part. All of the acting is good, it's just very toned-down. It tends to make most of the performances forgettable. Also, the background music is fairly bland, and the themes that do stand out sound suspiciously close to stuff you'd hear in Azumangah Daioh. I will say this, though: the opening and closing themes rock. Well, not in the literal sense. They are both quieter, softer pieces, but they fit the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nProbably the most frustrating part of the show. The characters are usually very interesting, but so many of them are one-shots that it feels like a waste. This is partially remedied in the second season, where characters start coming back, but for this season, don't expect to see too much development outside of Natsume and Nyanko-sensei. However, both of these main characters are well-developed, and they are explored fairly well, which makes up for the other characters not getting screen-time. Although I will say this about Natsume: you could get that kid to do anything for you, if you mentioned you felt lonely. He is such a sucker for the lonely card.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is not a party anime. It's not big or loud enough to watch with a lot of friends, but it is a nice, relaxing, thoughtful piece to watch on your own. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely unique. If you don't like over-the-top, flashy anime like Gurren Lagan, then you might prefer Natsume Yuujinchou's approach to story-telling. Also, as a final note, the second season is better because it builds off what is established in this season. Anyways, if you're searching for an anime to watch after a stressful day, this is a great choice.\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou covers a familiar kind of story. We are presented with a teenage boy, who is unusually airy and doesn't socialize much, and frequently seems to be looking intently at things that aren't there. As you may have guessed, Natsume sees dead people. Well, not exactly... he can see Youkai, a kind of spirit told of in Japanese folklore.\r\nManyof the Youkai themselves seem to possess an unusual interest in Natsume. One day, as a pair of Youkai are chasing him, he accidentally breaks a seal containing a powerful Youkai... one that knows why Natsume is being chased. You see, his grandmother Reiko had the same gift as him, and used to go around beating up Youkai and making them give away their names to her (which allowed her to command them), which she collected in a book, the titular Yuujinchou (Book of Friends). And now that Reiko is dead, Natsume has to attempt to return the names, but without losing the book in the process. And his new Youkai friend Madara has agreed to help protect him, as long as he is entitled to the book upon Natsume's natural passing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is really impressive about Natsume Yuujinchou is that, from that plot summary there, you will mostly likely think of many other series from various different mediums that follow a similar blueprint. And yet Natsume is significantly better than them. Natsume, as a series, takes on this theme with a brilliant level of poignancy. Rather than being a generic shonen action series as it so easily could have been (many of the bare bones of the series show parallels to Bleach, for example), Natsume is more concerned with telling the stories of each of these Youkai. While there is the occasional flash of action, this is never really the point. It's extremely refreshing to see a premise so frequently used for nothing more than cheap kicks done so beautifully. It even strikes something of a contrast with excellent series such as Mushishi and Mononoke, in that while these are focused on the abnormality of the creatures the series is based around, Yuujinchou is far more down to earth and human-feeling.\\n\\n\r\nPlotwise, this series is episodic, with the episodes focusing on individual youkai, with the stories not generally intertwining or crossing more than one episode (though there are exceptions). Almost all of the episodes are excellent, though there's two or three I didn't really care for. The second season in particular ups the quality of these, with the last four standing out as being firmly the best out of both seasons. There's not really anything in the way of an overarching plot or any clear goal, but it's all tied together through the furthering of Natsume's character and the additional insights into Reiko which we see through the Youkai's memories, both of which are excellent features of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation in this series is truly unique. Every character is very down-to-earth and believable, and yet not quite your everyday average Joe either. They all have distinctive personalities, and yet feel totally natural. The character designs are much the same way: simple-looking, but effective and distinctive. The only characters who are consistently in every episode are Natsume himself, and his Youkai bodyguard Madara A.K.A Nyanko-sensei. Madara is mostly comic relief, but effectively so. In his true form he's much easier to take seriously, which is often used to good effect. Natsume, on the other hand, is definitely the pinnacle of the aforementioned style. He doesn't really have a clear, character-defining moment or trait, which initially makes him seem like an uninteresting character. However, the more you get to know him, the better a character he seems. He is slowly but surely characterised through musings and realizations gathered through his experiences with all the Youkai he meets, painting a subtle yet excellent portrait of his character. In the third season, this reaches it's peak, as he slowly comes to not only accept, but value his unique circumstances and all the friends he's made because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production, the animation is superb. Oddly, though, it's quite restrained about it. Aside from some really beautiful, picturesque background art, it doesn't attempt to beat you over the head with its visuals, letting them stay in the background but subtly lending a lot to the series. In the second season especially, though, it dishes out quite a few animation bumps in some of the series more excellent moments, when it really needs to be rendered better. With this, combined with an excellent character art style, Natsume Yuujinchou just plain looks beautiful all-round. Musically, the OST does much the same as the art: it is distinct, amazing, perfectly fitting, but not overbearing. The music is invariably perfectly matched to the tone of the scene rather than being used to create the tone. The voice acting is all-round excellent, but my only problem with it is, strangely enough, Natsume himself. Hiroshi Kamiya was, in my opinion, a poor choice of casting. He does, however, put in an excellent performance which is hardly surprising given how good of an actor he is, but his voice seems terribly unfit to the role, and far more suited to more average and highly strung protagonists like those he usually plays, as opposed to the awkward, airy Natsume. Still, it's hardly distracting.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have any real complaint about Natsume Yuujinchou, it's that almost every episode's plot is built from a random contrivance. Generally, Natsume encounters something vital to the plot of the episode by sheer coincidence that is not directly tied to the plot at all. It's not terribly distracting, but it's done repeatedly and always seems far too convenient.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, Natsume Yuujinchou is an excellent series. It's a calming, relaxing show that simply does its job well. The second and third seasons are better than the first, with the second having better standalone episodes, along with better art and directing than the other two, and the third contributing more to the overall story and Natsume's development. Which season is the best is really a question of style vs. substance.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Something I would solidly recommend to anyone looking for a calming, soothing anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSeason One Overall: 8/10\\n\r\nSeason Two Overall: 9/10\\n\r\nSeason Three Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Mushi-shi, XxXHoLic",

            "content": "I watched this anime basically on a whim. I read the name somewhere and just started watching it. I have to say that I wasn\u2019t too impressed by this series by the first episode, but that certainly changed later on.\r\nPlease note that this is a review of all four seasons of Natsume Yuujinchou. However, my feelings towards this show have changed significantly over the course of watching this. So here is the rough draft of my experience:\r\nSeason One: Wow, this is totally above my expectations. Pretty good. 7/10.\r\nSeason Two: Well shit, I accidently marathoned this. I fear that I\u2019m falling in love with this show.8/10.\\n\r\nSeason Three: I love this show. Please don\u2019t let it end. 9/10.\\n\r\nSeason Four: I LOVE THIS SHOW. SHIT IT\u2019S ENDING NO SHIT SHIT SHIT NOOO\u2013 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly. This show is amazing. With brilliant bittersweet episodic plotlines, likable and well-developed characters and just an extraordinary overall feeling of atmosphere, this show excels in almost everything it tries to do. This show is one of the most heartwarming anime that I have ever seen, and as it kept going, it only got better and better. A must-watch for everybody, unless you have a brick for a heart or can\u2019t stomach anything without explosions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou doesn\u2019t have an \u2018overarching plot\u2019 or anything, and mostly relies on various episodic stories to keep itself going. Most episodes follow the following structure:\\n\\n\r\n1. A youkai gets introduced. \\n\r\n2. The youkai either has a problem or causes a problem.\\n\r\n3. Natsume solves this problem and learns something about himself in the process. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends is a very simple show. But its beauty lies in how much it managed to do with such a simplistic concept. Every story is heartwarming and unique in its own way, and even if the episodes follow the same general formula, it never seems to get old. The episodes in season one and season two mainly focused on various one-off characters, while the third and fourth season began to focus more on Natsume himself. Regardless of what story they\u2019re telling, they manage to make it beautiful. Every episode I left with a small smile on my face, even if I sometimes had a knot in my stomach from the emotional moments. This anime just contains so much heart: it\u2019s very clear that the people behind the show had a certain passion for it and it shines brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nIt also helps that the entire atmosphere for this show is brilliant. The world, in and off itself, isn\u2019t really anything special. But it has this feeling to it that\u2019s very hard to pin down and describe: a feeling that is almost bittersweet, but not quite. Heartwarming, yet, at the same time, it also carries this air of melancholy. It\u2019s a very calm show, and the perfect thing to watch when you are anxious or depressed. \\n\\n\r\nIf I really had to nitpick I\u2019d say that the first episode was bad. And yeah, it is. But in the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t feel like it really matters all that much.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the story, despite (or maybe because of) its simplicity managed to create a beauty that is very rare to find among any form of media.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, just like the rest of the show, only get better and better as the seasons go on. One of this anime\u2019s strongest points, in my opinion, is Natsume\u2019s character development.  \\n\\n\r\nNatsume Takashi is the main character of this show. At a young age he lost both his parents and has since been passed down his relatives, none of whom wanted to keep him because of his ability to see youkai. Those relatives ranged from distant to downright abusive. Finally, about a month before the show starts, the Fujiwaras took him in and he finally got a stable life. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show, we see him as a lonely and somewhat depressed teenager. He has an air of sadness and maturity to him, which isn\u2019t surprising, considering his childhood has been very tough. And this shows. He is mature beyond his age, has some obvious trust issues and is very quiet. He is also very nice and genuinely cares about everything and everyone around him. He is not a saint however; he sometimes gets angry and frustrated. He has emotions like all of us and they can be hurt, but, at the beginning of the show, he is sure to suppress them and not let it show. \\n\r\nAs the anime progresses we see him grow from a self-conscious boy into one who is much more secure about himself and has more trust in the world around him. His development is so subtle that you don\u2019t even notice it until you start comparing scenes from the first few episodes to scenes in the later ones. It\u2019s brilliantly done.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that he, like the show, grows on you without you even noticing it. I initially didn\u2019t think that I cared much about him; I never noticed any sense of particular attachment. However, during an arc in season two, some youkai hurt him and I just found myself immensely furious. I wanted that thing dead, and right now. I think I might have actually started yelling at my screen. That\u2019s when I realized that I actually cared about him to the point of having my protective urges roused, something that almost never happens to me. \\n\\n\r\nAs the seasons progressed, I only found myself getting more and more attached to him, until I came to the point that I was probably sadder than him when he got into a bad situation. I think that this might just be the strongest I\u2019ve ever felt about a character.\\n\\n\r\nAnother main character that I wanted to note was Nyanko-sensei/Madara. Even though he is largely played for comic relief, he is also a really good character in himself. His interactions with Natsume are especially precious. Even though they argue most of the time and Nyanko-sensei will deny that he cares for Takashi, it is very clear that he does. The way they show this is great, with small gestures meaning a lot and moments of silence often speaking louder than words. If I had the time, I could point out the many scenes I believe illustrate this the best, but it\u2019s best if you just go and watch yourself. \\n\\n\r\nOther than him, the other reoccurring important side characters are noteworthy too. Although their development is littler than that of Natsume, it\u2019s still pretty amazing what they managed to do with relatively little screen time. The differences between the characters are so noticeable when watching the episodes from season one and four back to back, yet so unnoticeable when you\u2019re actually watching the show chronologically, the youkai characters maybe excepted. Even so, I once again have to applaud this anime for their subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nEven the episodic characters are good. Even though they only get one arc to establish themselves, they are still good enough that you actually care what happens to them. Their stories are often heart wrenching and you can\u2019t help but want the best for them, even if they aren\u2019t particularly memorable. \\n\r\nThe characters of Natsume Yuujinchou shine in their quietest moments, and the subtlety of their development makes them all the more believable. Like the rest of the show, you will find yourself unknowingly getting attached to them and not regretting a single thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are the only parts where the show isn\u2019t doing exceptionally well. The first season in particular fell short on both of these things, with bad animation and a terrible opening. The animation in the fight scenes (as short and limited as they were) was especially cringe worthy. The camera-angles were also off. I first blamed this on bad directing, but after watching the rest of the show, I know that I was wrong. I don\u2019t know what it is, though, but the choices they make are just really weird. Hiding your main character behind an umbrella while he is talking for more than a minute is very distracting, guys. \\n\\n\r\nAs the second season began, however, there was a very noticeable increase in animation budget, leading to a drastic change in animation quality. While it still wasn\u2019t the best, it didn\u2019t need to be. It managed to accentuate the tone of the show rather nicely, and the backgrounds in particular were great (they already were in the first season, for the record). I also liked the design for several of the youkai, even if I did notice a rather lack of distinction later on in the series (all \u2018good\u2019 spirits began to look a lot like humans). \\n\\n\r\nLike I already mentioned, I dislike the opening for the first season. I just can\u2019t stand it. I think it somehow sounds like a bad cover of a good song, and it bothers me. The second opening, however, is great. I love the visuals for it, and the song is very catchy. It was a joy to listen to. I thought the third opening was kind of meh again, but the fourth was pretty good. The ending to season one was slightly better than its opening, but I still didn\u2019t like it. I love all the other endings equally, though. And the art style they use in them is great.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is simple, using very few instruments (a lot of which are commonly used in traditional Japanese music) and manages to set the tone for this show perfectly. At first, I wasn\u2019t too fond of it on its own, but it grew on me, like the rest of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, even though the animation and the soundtrack aren\u2019t the greatest things ever, they still hold up pretty well and complement the show rather nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nNatsume\u2019s Book of Friends is a show that has grown very close to my heart. Before watching this, I never understood how people could want a show to go on forever. I have always wanted my shows to end, and I was always happy when I reached those endings. But with Natsume Yuujinchou, I actually found myself stalling, restricting myself to watching only so many episodes a day so that I could enjoy this as long as I could. That is the single biggest complement that I can give a show. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is brilliant in almost every way; the characters are well-developed, the plotlines are heartwarming and the music and animation create the brilliant atmosphere that makes this show what it is. I honestly have no idea how anyone can dislike this anime, unless you just really dislike shows without action or are just plain heartless. Not to say that you're a bad person if you didn't like this but just... how?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s flaws are minor, and its pros are huge. Honestly, there is no reason for anyone to skip this masterpiece, so go forth and watch it. Now.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those animes which just somehow makes its way into your heart and makes such a deep imprint that you would probably never be able to forget it. Natsume Yuujinchou (I watched all 4 seasons, and reviewing them in one go as they are more like a single entity anyway) is a beautiful rare gem in the anime world that often goes unnoticed, yet each and every person I know who have watched it have been touched so deeply by it. \r\nStory:\r\nThe highlight of this anime is the storyline, and how its delivered. It has a very laidback pace, allowing the storyto gently bloom; the exact opposite of an intense high speed story. But it manages to do that with a grace that is never dull or boring, and just mesmerizes so you are pulled along gently by the story. The anime is episodic in nature, so every episode has a different story, but the 2nd season onwards do build upon previous stories and characters, so there is a sense of continuity.The main theme is about the conflict between the supernatural world of the youkais and humans, and Natsume's struggle to find his place in between these conflicting worlds. The theme of self discovery and companionship, as well as kindness and acceptance are the main focus of the anime, and well written and developed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I love the gentle vignette style of the art, with soft colours and landscapes, rather than details and sharp contrasts, this seems to suit the characters and the story better anyway. It reminds me a bit of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's art style (Totoro especially).\\n\\n\r\nSound: Absolutely LOVED all the openings and endings for all 4 seasons, they all fit the story so well, and the atmosphere and mood of the anime. The seiyuus were also brilliant, especially Nyanko sensei (Kazuhiko Inoue, who is also the voice behind loads of famous roles like Kakashi from Naruto)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI fell utterly in love with Natsume within the first season, and fell deeper with every episode since then. The character development for Natsume and Nyanko-sensei especially were done very well, and I love how the 2nd season onwards had more regular characters who stayed on for more of the series (the first season usually had characters come on just for one ep). Even with characters who didn't stay long, they still managed to give a solid impression and a fully fleshed character setting. Every character was realistic and relatable, and managed to engage my emotions well. Natsume will always have a special place in my heart",

            "content": "\"They come without asking, and then they leave just the same. But once you meet them, even if nobody ever knows it, that encounter will change your life for the better\". This quote by Natsume Takashi might be the best to describe what this show feels like. Episodic experiences between him and youkai.\r\nAs the episodes passes by, we see how Takashi grows and adapts to his condition. Except that, this growth is at a snail's pace. This arises a question. How many of these experiences are meaningful to the story and to Takashi? If that sounds like my problem with the series, I got badnews. I'm assured that if this was the only issue of this show, it would be among my favorites right now.\\n\\n\r\nWhat breaks this anime's potential is the easy prediction of the plot. Usually two options can preceed or follow whatever that happens. And you can foresee the outcomes often with no effort. As you get used to the anime structure, you will notice that the plot can't go anywhere out of its zone of comfort. Why? Because the story setting doesn't let it at all. In a more realistic approach, Takashi would be either lost or dead with ease. Or, have at least another social breakdown. And, the world of youkai shows itself to be too dangerous to a powerless human. So, whenever Takashi is in danger, there are two ifs. If the action is from a helping party, someone (or his own powerful punch) pops up to save him. If the action is from an enemy, the youkai/villain either kidnapps him or give up on trying if it's a resolution point.\\n\\n\r\nTakashi's positive development accounts for the most beautiful moments of the series. But this spiral of positiveness also cripples the possibilities for the story. The result is the feel that there's no actual risks or stakes since everything ends alright. Takashi must end with a positive outcome, or the whole setting would fall apart otherwise. And in the end of the day, there's nothing else for the series to do to explore new grounds. Except for having our MC to meet more youkai and get more involved with them. This is what gives volume to the series. Takashi's development is minor. You'll only notice a major difference by the third season. Which, is currently the best season of Natsume Yuujinchou.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good series for a weekly, seasonal watch. The visuals are fair enough and the animation is often dull, but this don't detach anything from the anime. Soundtracks are relaxing and go on with the mood. But, expect to see them (along with the art) being the same along the seasons. There are some emotional moments that can or can not hit close to home. But, the selling point of the show that makes me recommend it to anyone is Nyanko-sensei. He is just... Hilarious. I've seen myself many times laughing at his round, fat face.\\n\\n\r\nFor a series claimed by many as \"emotional\", it's kind of a disappointment. But it's still a heart warming experience. To those needing a show to watch once in a while to relax, this is a nice pick. Too bad that for the most of it, the series almost fails to make justice to its own fame. In the end of the day, Natsume Yuujinchou isn't a dramatic tale of the sorts. It's a collection of episodic, often funny adventures of Takashi and his cat.",

            "content": "This is not an anime for people who are looking for something with action and cute characters. Natsume Yuujinchou is a thought provoking anime, one that encompasses many different genres (drama, slice of life, tragedy, fantasy). The story may look slow but each episode is well thought out and provides insights on the main characters of the anime. Each episode has a message or a lesson for Natsume, and viewers in my opinion; most of them are common knowledge, but they serve as a reminder to the people who watch the series.\r\nThe anime has a lot of fun and humour in it, but alsotragedy and sadness at the same time. Each episode left me wanting to see more of the anime just to see how Natsume would treat a new situation. Initially, I found this anime under Kamiya, Hiroshi's name before it was aired and the synopsis was kind of promising. And as each episode was aired, I found out that I really could not wait for the next episode; It was a long wait for the four seasons to finish but well worth it. Now I wish there was more for me to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is full of bittersweet moments that should generally leave a person feeling angry or upset but it is not the case here. Oddly enough, where Natsume should have ended up hating people, he ends up loving them more. The strength of his character is something that is awe worthy.  \\n\\n\r\nStory and Plot - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost people who watch this anime will not see a plot in the start of the anime, but there is one. This anime follows the day to day life of Natsume, Takashi and his youkai \"guardian\" Madara(who Natsume affectionately calls Nyanko-sensei). Natsume is not your ordinary teenage boy like in other anime; he has the ability to see youkai and this has earned him a hard childhood. Orphaned at a young age, he was passed around his extended family due to his strange nature. As a child no one believed him about the things that only he could see and everyone either thought that he wanted attention or was insane. Due to this, Natsume slowly closed himself off from other people and dealt with his pain silently. \\n\\n\r\nOne day, he accidently meets a youkai named Madara who mistakes Natsume for his deceased grandmother, who also could see youkai. Madara tells Natsume about a book that his grandmother kept called The Book of Friends, which contains the names of all the youkai she \"defeated\". This is where the story of Natsume Yuujinchou begins, as Natsume is determined to return all the names while Madara tries to stop him since he wants the book for himself. As Natsume returns the names of the youkai, he slowly learns more about his deceased grandmother and the differences in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story comes together in the four seasons of the anime. Each episode, though may seem stand alone, actually bring forth the main plot of the story which is Natsume's understanding of the world around him and his place in it. Through his many adventures, he changes his views and learns to trust other people. For the first time, Natsume makes true friends who he feels he can depend on and will not shun him due to his weird nature. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Character Design - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimple art to follow a simple anime; some people say that the art is nothing big or that it's not beautiful like other anime. Natsume Yuujinchou is not a flashy anime with a flashy story, the story is very simple and thus the art flows with it. I personally feel the art is amazing, simple and unique yet with a lot of detail. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, simple and yet beautiful music to compliment the anime. The soundtrack is as amazing as the anime, from the opening to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBest part of the anime is not the story but rather the characters. The main characters are Natsume, Takashi and Madara but Natsume, Reiko can also be seen as somewhat of a main character. There is a lot of character development for most of the characters in the series but mostly centered on Natsume, Takashi and Madara. Natsume, Reiko's character is used as an eye opener for Natsume, Takashi; where Reiko isolated herself from the rest of the world, Takashi learns to open up slowly to his friends and leave his loneliness behind. Also, each of the youkai that Natsume encounters helps Natsume understand his youkai friends, gaining more respect and understanding towards youkai in general. The youkai in the anime are shown to have the same human tendencies and are not so different from humans in reality. \\n\\n\r\nNatsume, Takashi: I guess some people may see him as a sissy or something along those lines, but can you really call him a sissy? It takes one to know one really. In society today, people who are compassionate and understanding are viewed as a sissy and this is why society does not progress much. I feel Natsume's personality is very rare to come across amongst people and quite refreshing. Regardless of the amount of torment he has gone through, Natsume still holds a lot of respect for people and shows no hatred towards anyone. He is kind and gentle but cautious at the same time with people due to his childhood experience.\\n\\n\r\nMadara or Nyanko-sensie: A powerful youkai with a lot of influence, Madara at first shows that his sole purpose of being with Natsume is to use him in order to get the Book of Friends. But slowly you see that Madara does in fact care about Natsume and a bond is formed between the two. Madara appears to understand Natsume more than most of the other characters and surprising shows a more gentler side towards Natsume in contrast to his regular boastful, selfish and kind of mean personality. \\n\\n\r\nViewer Enjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime where I could not wait for the next season to air. The re-watch value of this anime for me is very high as I have already re-watched all four seasons twice already, going on third. This anime is amongst the few that I have re-watched so many times. Don't feel ashamed if you watch this anime and find yourself in tears. Unique in its own way, Natsume Yuujinchou is a story about a journey, a journey of understanding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating - 100/10 can I?\\n",

            "content": "\"Natsume's Book of Friends\" (Natsume Yuujinchou) is like a loaf of bread.  Not spicy, not over-sweet, pretty plain...and yet very satisfying.  It's a show I enjoy watching whenever life has been busy, complicated, or stressful, and I just want to clear my mind and relax.  When I don't want heavy plotlines, psychological twists, or violence.  When I crave something simple.\r\nBut simple doesn't mean childish.  This show might be rated PG, but it's still something that even adults can enjoy.  I normally don't like slice-of-life dramas, but there's something fresh and unconventional about this.  If you've read the originalmanga, or any of the other mangas by Yuki Midorikawa, you'll recognize the \"gentle\" air it has.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis:\\n\r\nNatsume Takeshi has the unfortunate ability to see spirits.  The spirits tend to look like humans or human/animal creatures.  As a little boy, he told others about them,  but was often mocked and called a liar.  Now he's in high school, living in the countryside with just his guardians.  He keeps his ability a secret, and doesn't make close friends with anyone.  One day he finds a strange home-made book with weird scribbles.  It turns out that it belonged to his grandmother, Natsume Reiko.  Reiko could also see spirits.  And being a bit of a bully, she kept their names in this book, the Book of Friends.  Whoever owns the book is the master of the spirits whose names are in it.  And now Natsume owns the book.  Wishing to right his grandma's wrongs, he decides to release the spirits enslaved by the book.  And one spirit who takes the form of a cat, decides to become Natsume's bodyguard.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how things get set up.  Most episodes are self-contained, with Natsume assisting spirits (or trying to survive evil ones) with the cat, Nyanko-Sensei (aka \"Sensei\") tagging along.  We meet a few new characters along the way, and learn about Natsume's personality and past.  His disheartening experiences with other people in the past make him a loner much of the time.  And because he appreciates his guardians, he doesn't want them to worry about him, whether it's over his abilities, or over a fever.  It's a bit heartbreaking to see him trying desperately to keep secrets from them, all for the sake of \"their own good.\"  \\n\\n\r\nSensei provides most of the comic relief.  The cat form is one he uses to conserve energy (he really looks like a giant white wolf).  But as a ridiculously fat white-and-orange cat, visible to humans, he trots around town as his own boss.  He is a huge glutton and has a great fondness for sake.  He has bad a reputation at the local \"spirit tavern.\"  He is under the impression that he is Natsume's master, and that he has the right to someday eat him and take possession of the Book of Friends.  But despite his constant threats toward Natsume, you get the idea that he actually has a soft spot for him.\\n\\n\r\nAside from those two, we don't get to know other characters that much.  There isn't a huge human cast in the first place (it's the middle of the countryside, for goodness sake), and we mostly only discover the backgrounds of the spirits that need assistance from Natsume.  The fact that we don't get very involved with other characters, emphasizes Natsume's loneliness.  But it also makes me identify a lot with him, because we're not getting intimate with anyone else.  His somewhat bland and down-to-earth personality, his naivety and ability to enjoy the simple life, make him feel realistic instead of idealized.  He's not an angsty hero teen who wants to save the world.  He just wants to live and let live.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is worth a note.  The art in the original manga is rather unconventional.  It's very light and sketchy, almost doodle-like.  It's not a style that can be easily copied into an anime.  And while it's not exactly copied, the anime art still keeps the \"light\" feel.  The faces do look the same, for the most part.  The color palatte is also very plain, more on the neutral side, and colors seem a bit washed-out, and naturalistic.  It bolsters the \"fresh\" vibe this anime gives, avoiding strong contrasts and bright, un-natural colors (there are no pink or blue-haired people!).  \\n\\n\r\nThe setting in the countryside, the bright summer sunshine, the buzzing cicadas....  It really puts you right into the lazy summer setting.  The first 13 episodes of the series take place in summer.  The second 13 (in \"Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou\") take place in winter, the season of the dying year.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music perfectly convey the mood.  The ending music (for both) is particularly wistful.\\n\\n\r\nAll the events in the anime are from the manga, though not always presented in the same order.  Because the stories are very episodic, it's easy to do.  The whole spirit of the manga is conveyed well, so if you enjoyed the manga, you should enjoy the anime, and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\n***Some people have called the series a \"shounen ai\" (BL) series.  It is NOT unless you REALLY read things into it.  To emotionally protect himself, Natsume keeps his spirit-vision a secret.  But he eventually discovers Natori, a young, but slightly older man who can also see spirits.  They are both rather excited, since they've finally found someone they don't have to keep their ability a secret from.  Though Natsume is still not ready to be close friends with him yet, Natori expresses interest in being his mentor.  Natori's day job is an actor, so he has a bit of a flamboyant air.  But that's as far as things go.***\\n\\n\r\nThere's essentially no objectionable content.  There's some mild language, and a small amount of peril and violence.\\n\\n\r\nSo when you need to relax, and clean out your mind with something fresh, give \"Natsume\" a try.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nFirst of all i need to mention that this review will be a review of all the seasons so i will post this to here and to the sixth season's review section.\r\nWhen i first started watching Natsume Yuujinchou, it felt kind of boring. It was cute and all but i am not a person who watches episodal anime that much. I felt like i would drop it if it continued like that. Because every episode Natsume met with a new youkai and gave their name or helped them. And i found it a bit boring. But i kept watching. At the end ofseason one, i got used to how the story goes on and i got used to the characters.\\n\r\nThen i started watching the second season. I realized that i actually started liking it.\\n\r\nAnd when i started watching the third season, i loved it. \\n\r\nIt probably wasnt because the third season had better quality than the second season or the first season. It was probably because, you get to know some characters during the first two seasons, you get to know the whole town and the anime makes you feel like you are a part of that world now. You feel the characters feelings as if they are you friends, you feel the sadness in the air, you feel the happiness... \\n\r\nSo yes, it started slowly but it was done like that to be able to have a really good setting. And when you get into it, you love it.\\n\r\nAlso when they were finished with introducing the characters and the setting, they started telling a main story too. And the main story interested me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAfter i started liking it, i loved watching all the episodes. The fifth season had some boring episodes in my opinion but only \"some\".\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou had a really calming atmosphere. There were many episodes i watched with a smile on my face. There were many episodes that made me forget my saddness. And there were many episodes that made me really emotional too. Natsume meets with many youkai and has a journey with many youkai. Of course you can not relate to all of the youkai's feelings but there were many times i related a lot and felt like crying a lot. And also when they became happy, there were a lot of times i became happy too.  \\n\r\nStory-8\\n\\n\r\nThe art develops a lot. There are 3 years between the first season and the second season. Also there is 4 years between the fourth season and the fifth season. Thats why the art gets a lot better in the sixth season and its really beautiful. Especially the sixth season's opening is a feast for one's eyes.\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\\n\r\nI really liked many of the openings and the endings except the first season's. Also the insert songs are great imo too. There is especially one song called Haru wo shiraseru mono. Whenever i hear it, i feel so many emotions inside.\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\\n\r\nI really like nearly all of the characters. I even like Reiko and want to see her a lot more. \\n\r\n*Natsume is the best boy*\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, i loved Natsume Yuujinchou. If you would like to watch something relaxing you should deff give it a chance. And dont drop it in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nBtw my 9 starts is for the whole series\\n\r\n1st season-7stars\\n\r\n2nd season-8 stars\\n\r\n3rd season-9 stars\\n\r\n4th season-9 stars\\n\r\n5th season- 8 stars\\n\r\n6th season-9 stars",

Understanding one another as a moral hasn't been executed so imaginitavely. This story is full of mysteries waiting to be answered in the next seasons and I'm excited to see them unfold and I'm also curious about whether or not this formula will last many seasons...\r\nCON - But the ending felt off, like it was filler to tick us over. It felt like half of the seasonwas missing, which wouldn't be an issue if I was judging the entire show, but I'm critiquing this one and only season I have watched hitherto. The character development for Takashi is almost non-existant, we're introduced to him as a lonely and misunderstood character and while he does have friends he hasn't developed meaningful or deep relationships with them so far. Besides those nitpicks I still enjoyed the show and can't wait to get started on the next.",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujnichou is a great anime series which I absolutely adore wholeheartedly. All 13 episodes contain different stories which are linked together at some point. The way the plots are constructed is basically the same, yet it absolutely doesn't make them neither irksome nor boring. Every single episode should be highly appreciable, as the series concern important matters. It's not one of those profoundly sad stories or infantile ones. It's just remarkable. Composition is done greatly, the stories are very entertaining not mentioning the way the characters are developed. Only sometimes did I find anime series where equivalence between sadness and happiness is remained sosplendidly as it is here. That makes the series subtle and delicate. Instead of violence, it shows many aspects of being unique and how hard is to cope with it and keep it a secret. The subject of solitude is also presented very good. Natsume Yuujinchou bears with the issues very well, making the series one of the greatest in recent years. Actually, I dare to say it's probably one of the best ever. Despite the fact there are a lot of rather sad plots, it doesn't make the series depressing. It's more like the saying goes 'always look on the bright side of life'. And so the characters do. The anime resembles life with its ups and downs. That's the thing I probably like the most in it. It doesn't seem to be about some unrelated world. It's very convincing despite the supernatural features.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main character inherits from his grandmother a book of friends, a nightmare for spirits. And that's basically what the series is all about. There's just one thing in common and the rest are accidental, sometimes even not related stories. Natsume has the capacity of seeing spirits which had brought him a lot of sorrow and troubles in the past. He doesn't exactly know why he can see them. They had been bothering him all his life, and he has no clue what they wanted from him. He desperately seeks other people who can see youkai. One day he sets free a noble spirit. They make a promise and since then, their friendship gradually become stronger, though no one will ever admit it. They eventually become inseparable and go through many hardships. Both characters are developed surprisingly good. At first, it's hard to find out what kind of relationship is between them, as they constantly beat or scold themselves. As the story goes further, Natsume finds himself being surrounded by many friends - humans as well as youkai and he doesn't feel lonely any more. He has to choose between youkai or people, as he helps both of them simultaneously, which is not an easy matter.\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs the youkai appears only for each episode, every one of them leaves warm memories. Some of them appear every now and then, so we get to know them thoroughly. They are like people - some seek revenge, others are eager to befriend. For Natsume it doesn't matter if it is a human being or a youkai - he just wants to help them and tries to work out in which world he feels more poised. There are a lot of human characters who show up unexpectedly in various episodes. They are also very significant, because most of them carry important messages.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the music is wonderful. It gets along with the series, making it even more magical. As I like anime soundtracks, I can honestly say this one made a good impression on me. Openings' music as well as endings' is so catchy that it doesn't want to get away from my head. I don't mind it, but I feel a great desire to listen it over and over again.\\n\r\nMUSIC 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth, at first I didn't like the art in this anime. Particularly because it seemed to me too simple. I thought the youkai should be more detailed and the colours more powerful (fancy speaking, I started watching it backwards - from the second series ^^\"). But then I realised that's the way it should be made and started admiring it ever since.\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it to anyone who wants to relax themselves. You definitely should see it, as it displays a warmth and cool affection.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10",

            "content": "Let\u2019s imagine, if someone has an eye which can see things that others can\u2019t, how he/she will feel? No-one will believe it and no-one can.\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is rather simple anime. In every episode, it has an individual story related to each kind of youkais written in Yuujinchou. It\u2019s a small, and peaceful series that can be EASILY overlooked. NO. It\u2019s filled with irreplaceable memories that you can\u2019t forget.\r\nThere is no plot for this anime (or whatever.). Of course, it\u2019s slice of life anime, and it has its advantages and disadvantages. It\u2019s hard to keep the genre of \u2018supernatural\u2019 and \u2018slice of life\u2019 at once, butNatsume Yuujinchou covered that nicely. All episode are simply beautiful and breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nAh. Character development. This is what you expect when you watch this anime. Natsume is all alone boy who hates to interact with other people. He is gentle and kind. He tries to help EVERYONE. Well, you can call him hero in that aspect, but he actually thinks that he has no power at all. He keeps contradicting himself, about whether staying in human world, or being with Youkai like His grandmother Raiko did. \\n\\n\r\nIn each story, Youkai tells Natsume about kindness, humanity and other lessons that he has been overlooked or forgot. His side kick cat always scolds him about how selfish and bad humans are. When he first met youkai in his new town, most of their responses are \"don\u2019t believe humans\". But in the end, he finds out that not all humans are evil. Youkai themselves also realises and learns about their mistaken view towards humans. Very optimistic stories, right? However, it is not that cheerful anime. Its mood is somehow down from the start to the end. That kind of ambiguous tone is the one that makes this anime more intriguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are evil youkais of course. They are just evil. Same goes to human. Some youkais also struggles like human. This anime contrasts and compare those monsters and humans. We can see how Natsume's thinking changes through the whole series. He feels empathy toward those youkais. Most of them has been felt lonely or have been suffered from the problems of themselves. It's Natsume's job to cure those suffering youkais and tries to prove kindness of humans.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is some problems with it, too. I sometimes got annoyed by Natsume's reflection about how he was lonely or get ignore. He seeks for similar people as him, but not trying to create a new relationship. That theme of 'loneliness' is something that has been used so much in other animes, especially in shonen. I mean, he lost his parents. Yet, he seems to feel nothing about it all the time. He never even mention it. They should have gave more background information about 'who exactly is Natsume'.\\n\\n\r\nArt, probably one of my favourite character designing I\u2019ve ever seen. Pastel style drawing and cute drawn youkais are just gorgeous. You can\u2019t see anything like this in other anime. Very, very unique. Most of the background is consist of soft lines and colours, which creates very gentle atmosphere; contributing to the story. Sound aspect also reflects its atmosphere really well, though I\u2019m not to sure about OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nVoices~~ well there is only 2 notable seiyuus here because\u2026 others just are just all recurring characters. Kamiya Hiroshi did surprisingly well with voice of Natsume, and you can sometimes here his usual \u2018ZETSUBOU SHITA!\u2019 style screaming. It\u2019s fun indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall value and enjoyment on this anime was higher than my expectation. Although it keeps with simple stories with simple plot settings, it manage to bring some beautiful development on characters and creation of overall atmosphere. It\u2019s calm and peaceful. Nothing like Shonen stuffs packed with fight. So, this is definitely number one priority for those who just started animes.",

            "content": "\u201cLoneliness cannot stand alone\u201d\r\nThe Story...\r\nIt revolves between spirits and a person who can see them, Natsume Takashi. Natsume Takashi inherits the power to see youkai from his passed away grandmother, Natsume Reiko. As his life moves on he encounter various youkai that need his help and sometimes become a threat to his life.\r\nThe main attraction would be the tranquility of the story. It contains a calm and peaceful pace that keeps the story attractive. Even though the concept is quite simple they made it interesting by putting some minor arcs though out the whole series, minor arcs that also something to do with the mainarc.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also maintains the calmness on each episode even though they put drama and some puns to make it quite different, but in the end the calmness is still there as watchers will savor the meaning though out of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation...\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful, as it really contains as what you'll expect to this kind of genre. Scenery and backgrounds that gives a calm feeling, character design that is simple to fit to its surroundings, and animation that gives a big factor in making it as beautiful as possible, and also the one responsible for making it interesting to watch and gives emotions for every action on the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED songs are great as it contains implication to its story. The voices of each characters are well delivered, the voices matches the attitudes of each characters which is kind of amusing. The background sounds/musics makes it even more charming thus it plays melodic, deep, calm, and soothing sounds and music for each theme of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main character of the story Natsume Takashi, he is a person with a warm-hearted towards youkai, a simple guy who lives in fear and been lonesome for quite a time. As time goes by he accepts being shun by human beings because of his special powers but even though he was treated like that he became friendly as possible to them. A good view about him is he possess kindness towards youkai and human beings that shows humility towards its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe advantage of the main character Natsume Takashi is he shows tranquility that greatly affects the outcome of the series but on the other hand it has disadvantage that might be the cause of the problem on the show, he is quite simple that has constant acts. Being simple is not that bad in a way that it will make a difference but in this series they didn't make some other scheme to improvise or make a difference on being repeated.\\n\\n\r\nMadara is the other main character on the show that gives some amusement, he is a powerful youkai with some rude attitude, and also he become the guardian of Natsume Takashi for he will be protected towards some bad spirits. A good view about him is that he is too naughty in some ways that gives a grin in your face, always saying \"stupid\" whenever he have a chance to scold or make fun of Natsume.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they fill up the series as intended to be part of it, they make a minor arc and appearance which also help maintain its calmness. Also being part of it helps the whole to revolve by making new friends and to explore the outside world that the main character doesn't encounter before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of simple as it pertains simplicity in life, achieving that you haven't done before, courage to move forward, and being straightforward on every actions. With these kind of perspective you will enjoy it by its peaceful manner. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWhen you put all of these it will create a series that will surely hook you, but with these aspects it will surely be loved by those who wants an anime with peaceful appearance.",

By contrast, the male lead in xxxHolic is a bit less aggressive and effective.",

            "content": "When sifting through a large amount of anime, you mostly find ones that are average and a little bit above average. They are the series that usually keep you entertained throughout, but with little more to be satisfied with. But sometimes, you occasionally stumble upon a series that is much, much more. With only 13 episodes to its name, I can say with sincerity that Natsume Yuujinchou is one of those series that i can definitely say is nothing short of a masterpiece. \r\nFrom what I've watched so far, I can distinguish that most 13 episode series are either average or poorly done, with somefew exceptions. Natsume Yuujinchou is an episodic series, meaning that it follows no straight plot but rather, tells one story per episode. Initially, you might think that because of this the plot will be rather loose and fragmented, but everything seems to intertwine nicely. \\n\\n\r\nThe series follows the teenage protagonist, Natsume, in his journey towards understanding and helping the fellow Youkai and Ayakashi in his neighbourhood. What really shines is the interactions between him and the Youkai; they are so beautifully done that more often than not you'll find yourself tearing up a little as he passes through each of them. I guess part of the flaws of this anime is that the interactions are sometimes too short - the impact they give you makes you want to find out about them just a little bit more. Most of the episodes end with a bittersweet feeling that leaves you satisfied but melancholic. It's hard to describe, but it's kind of a sad but heartwarming effect. Each episode is relatively simple in terms of plot; in fact, the whole series is as simple as it can be. One could say that this is a flaw, but I say that it is a positive. It's just about an adolescent boy who, with his trusty cat companion, finds new ways to understand both humans and Youkai. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I give the series credit for the most is the animation and the soundtrack. In terms of quality, Natsume Yuujinchou definitely doesn't shine in terms of crispness and it doesn't possess cutting edge graphics that can be compared to say, Guilty Crown. However, the animation of Natsume is very unique; everything is composed of pale, pastel and dreamy like qualities which accentuate the softness of the storyline and gives it that extra boost. The art blends together nicely with the interactions of the Youkai, and I found the scenery particularly pretty. That being said, I also loved the OP and the ED especially, simply because the art went so well with the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe art also goes hand in hand with the soundtrack, which is composed of mostly slow, melodic tunes which really emphasize the raw nature of the series. I found the music really soothing in some parts, yet saddening in the scenes which ended up being bittersweet. The different components of the anime really flatter each other and, as a result, make it so much better as a series. \\n\\n\r\nFor a 13 episodic series, Natsume Yuujinchou develops a surprising amount of depth and symbolic meanings as each episodes passes by. You get to see Natsume transition into a much better person through the interactions of Youkai; beings that he had disliked when he was younger. Throughout the series, I was expecting the whole thing to be a little disjointed or even a little fragmented in places, but I was pleasantly surprised with the result. I think that, by having a series with not much complexity in its plot means that it can be exploited into becoming a startlingly meaningful show by focusing efforts into developing the characters and everything else.  \\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/9\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm halfway into Season 3 of Natsume Yuujinchou and I'm writing this review with mixed feelings and here's why...\r\n1) Story Concept 6/10\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou's storytelling style reminds me of Doraemon as in every episode is made up of mini story arcs surrounding the main characters. The story in itself is rhetoric. It can go on and on as long as the author doesn't run out of new youkai ideas. But while I enjoyed Doraemon very much without needing a story progression because the gadget surprises from his 4D pocket are more than enough to entertain me, I can't say the same for Natsume Yuujinchou. For thelatter, it gets mundane and you start to wonder, \"So what are all these leading to...?\"\\n\\n\r\n2) Characters Development 5/10\\n\r\nI gave this an average rating not because I don't like the characters. In fact, all of them are likeable including most of the youkais. What disappoints me is the severe lack of character depth even in the main characters. After more than 30 episodes, I still don't know much about Natsume other than he's an orphan living with some relatives on his father's side. He has a pretty face, is kind-hearted and a wimp. Talking about being a wimp... I would think that Natsume would grow out of his fear of youkais after a few encounters especially with Nyanko-senei protecting him, but NOOOO. He still shrieks and runs at the sight of them, which puzzles me. Shouldn't he be used to them by now?? This again reminds me of Doraemon where the main character, Nobita, is forever a coward. But while I can understand Nobita being a child, Natsume isn't, so I expected some growth in courage. Basically his character doesn't change much other than he made some new friends (but not by his own accord). Even then, he holds these friends at arm's length. All in all, Natsume is a very bland character. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character has to be Nyanko-sensei for he provides much comic relief. I cannot imagine this anime without him. In fact, I think Nyanko-sensei is the one who holds up the entire story. Even then, all I know about him is that his real form is a giant white wolf. Why was he sealed? By who? What was his relationship with Reiko? Not the slightest hint even after 30+ episodes. Is there a need to keep this such a big mystery? And I would have accepted any kind of lame backstory. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are nice but really forgettable side characters. There're no backstories about them and they only appear when they're helping Natsume or just saying 'hi' to him in school. BLAND AS WATER. And did I mention that the youkais are starting to look the same?\\n\\n\r\n3) Artwork 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style is generally nice with good looking characters but visual effects are non-existence. Every exorcism scene looks similar. The way Natsume returns the names to the youkais are so simplistic it's not even visually entertaining. I would rather watch Sailormoon transform 100 times. \\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nWatching Natsume Yuujinchou is like drinking lemon honey water - a little sweet, a little sour, but not flavourful. I really hope that the story can develop more depth. I also feel that it will be nice to add a romantic interest for Natsume although the author had said that she does not want to focus on romance. But I feel that the romance doesn't have to be heavy and it may add more complexity to Natsume's character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating is sadly only 6/10.",

This anime is so relaxing and a good slice of life with that supernatural feel, so if that's what you're looking for then definitely check it out.  Almost every episode made me laugh or tear up for bittersweet reasons. If you have more time on your hands, I definitely recommend to watch the other seasons as well.  This is one of the few anime where the other seasons still contains the feeling thatthe first season gave off.",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is a touching, thought-provoking and sweet anime. It leaves you with a warm, content feeling after each episode, and a wish for more of it when it's over (luckily there's some sequels :)).\r\nNatsume, the protagonist, is one of the loveliest I've come across (although he does pack a mean punch when necessary). Natsume can see youkai, something most cannot, and due to this, in childhood, he was ostracised and shifted from house to house (a little something explored more in the anime). Despite these difficulties caused by his ability, Natsume continues to be kind and wants to help the youkai, and humans troubledby them, in anyway he can. He is the owner of the book of friends, a relic passed down to him from his grandmother who also shared his ability, which contains many youkai names which he sets out to return to their owners (in turn learning a bit about his grandmother's past along the way). \\n\\n\r\nThe only other main character is Madara \u201cNyanko-sensei\u201d; Natsume's catlike (literally) and somewhat begrudging guide/bodyguard to the youkai world. They do have a funny, yet caring relationship. Natsume's classmates also make a nice addition to the pack as recurring characters, one of them, Tanuma, a little more notable than the rest. As do Natsume's guardians, the lovely Fujiwara couple. There's a few youkai that make more than one appearance as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are lovely to listen to, and also look great. The art and music coupled together, help to create a pleasant atmosphere in the anime. Some beautiful music and the art, and colours used, fit with the story very well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend it. You'll experience a rollercoaster of emotions but it'll be worth it. I hope you enjoy the series as much I did. If you have watched, and liked, Mushishi you will probably like this. I hope you have a great day.",

            "content": "\u201cSo, you can see youkai huh?\u201d\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou follows Natsume, a high school student and his encounters with youkai. Youkai are basically ghosts, but not the kind you see in kids\u2019 cartoons or horror movies \u2013 they are just funky looking monsters that are invisible to most humans. Once a youkai gives its name to a human, then it pledges its soul to the human and they can never truly pass on unless they have their names back. Natsume\u2019s grandmother, Reiko, had collected the names of various youkai and recorded them in a book called the \u201cYuujinchou\u201d or \u201cThe Book of Friends\u201d. After her death, thisbook falls into Natsume\u2019s hand, who decides to free any youkai from its contract by giving the youkai its name back upon request. However, while some youkai just want their name back, some want to have the entire Yuujinchou so that they can control the other youkai. Along with his bodyguard Madara, the demon cat, Natsume begins to return the youkai\u2019s names, one by one\u2026\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a watered down cross between Mushishi, xxxHOLiC and Kino\u2019s Journey. In each episode, Natsume encounters a youkai who has some unfinished business in this world and needs Natsume\u2019s help to finish it, so that they can move on. However, this is easier said than done, as some of the youkai\u2019s requests are unreasonable to say the least and could even result in Natsume\u2019s death. The anime has its genres mixed in the right proportion, with a strong dose of \u201cFantasy\u201d, a spoonful of \u201cAction\u201d and a dash of \u201cSlice of Life\u201d. Set in an episodic format, all these elements come together really well, and each episode tells a fascinating tale that is truly heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, certain episodes felt like \u201cfiller\u201d episodes, which is inexcusable in a 13 episode series, and contained an unduly high amount of slapstick comedy. And although the overall plot is pretty unique and is handled in a charming fashion, it is pretty predictable. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but after watching Mushishi, Kino\u2019s Journey and xxxHOLiC, NY seemed rather linear and somehow didn\u2019t quite capture the mood like the anime above did. Another place where this show went wrong was by mixing in some shounen elements, which did not work out well \u2013 this anime should\u2019ve strictly stuck to the seinen genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is perfect for this kind of series \u2013 soft, subtle and clean. Backgrounds were sharp and were beautiful to look at. The characters look pretty realistic and the eyes, thankfully, don\u2019t occupy half of the character\u2019s face. But, I felt that the youkai could\u2019ve been drawn more artfully. When I picked this series up, I did not expect the youkai to look like the low grade demons in Inuyasha or the evil monsters from Gegege no Kitarou. Sadly, they did. Although it was not intolerable by any means, it was one of the reasons why I didn\u2019t give this anime a ten or a nine. An overall solid job - Brains Base excels again!\\n\\n\r\nThe music was excellent. The OP was superb and the lyrics actually made sense, which is something you don\u2019t see every day. The ED was a bit weird, with shaky vocals and a pleasant rhythm. The BGM was apt and fit the scenes perfectly. There were a few quirky tracks, a few melancholy ones and a few dramatic ones. And they all do a great job in setting the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters consisted mainly of Natsume and Madara. There are a couple of other characters, but they don\u2019t have a lot of role to play. Natsume is your standard high school protagonist \u2013 shy, quiet and kind. He talks to himself; his parents are dead and he is shunned by the society because he can see youkai, while no one else can. And his very stereotypical portrayal is what gives this anime a shonen feel. I mean, the kid is just too easy to read. The one other character that you see in every episode is Madara, the demon cat. Madara offers to be Natume\u2019s bodyguard and for payment for his services, he gets the Yuujinchou when Natsume dies. Madara is mainly intended for comic relief, but sometimes, he can just be boring, with the jokes becoming stale fast. And this silly humor relaxes the atmosphere and makes the mood less serious, which, in my opinion, is not a good addition at all, as shows like NY are meant to be charming, yet focused at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe interaction between Natsume and Madara is extraordinarily similar to that of Kino and Hermes, certain youkai\u2019s stories are extremely similar to that of xxxHOLiC\u2019s and the Tanamu is just a replica of Adashino from Mushishi. And seeing that this anime was released in 2009, way after the release of all the above three anime, eyebrows are bound to be raised. Also, the boy seeing ghosts reminds me strongly of the Hollywood movie \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBut, when it\u2019s all said and done, NY is a great anime that succeeds mainly because of its focus on humans and not on the youkai. The youkai are just a medium to bring out the various kinds of bonds two humans can have. Once you get that into your head, NY will not disappoint. The first four episodes were somehow not as good as the rest of the series, but they were not terrible either. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was neatly done and the subs by BSS were awesome as always.\\n\\n\r\n[THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a beautiful show. With a generous helping of genres such as comedy, slice of life and drama, this anime is proof that you don\u2019t always need the guns, women or a prophecy, for telling an absorbing tale of a boy with superpowers. Charming animation breathes life into the series and the stellar soundtrack is perfect for this show. However, poor characters, boring comedy and inconsistency in the quality of the episodes pull down this episodic series\u2019 score. Strong similarities to other shows of the same genre also make the viewers question the originality of the producers. But, even these glaring errors cannot prevent you from adoring this anime. Natsume Yuujinchou is definitely worth your time. If you\u2019re unsatisfied after the first six episodes, then this series is probably not for you. However, the sequel, Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou, is far better than this season, so if you didn\u2019t like this one, there\u2019s a much better chance you\u2019ll like the sequel. Natsume Yuujinchou is exactly what the MAL score of 8 means \u2013 a very good show. \\n\\n\r\n(As always, feedback of any form is welcome. Thank you for your time ^^ !)",

            "content": "Story \u2013 7/10\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou\u2019s (NY) story is very light and charming. There is no over-arching plot with twists, though there are occasional flashbacks that help develop Reiko and Takashi\u2019s character. The story mostly consists of light comedy, some sad situations, and many happy endings for each individual stand alone episode. Some episodes are better than others (that is to be expected), especially towards the last few episodes of the season. Therefore, the quality of the story varies for each episode. While this anime\u2019s plot is not as heavy and emotionally engaging as other anime (ex. Fruits Basket), the story is quite charming and enjoyable.\r\nAnimation \u20138/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is for this show is very good. The human character drawings are consistently good, with very few instances where the quality is less than acceptable. In other words, the soft colors, human character designs, and their backgrounds complement the show\u2019s charm. Further, the spirit design is wide and varied that separates each individual spirit from each other. Though there is a more noticeable drop in quality for the spirit drawings when compared to the humans.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters Natsume and \u201cNyanko-sensei\u201d (Madara) are a funny couple to watch. Some of the characters turn out to be very likeable despite only seeing them for a few episodes (for example, the wolf boy), however some are rather one dimensional. Overall, the main and supporting cast of NY is characterized in a good manner.\\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf anything stands out for me in this series, it is the music. The ED of the show is rather slow and peaceful like the series itself; the singing and lyrics are full of emotion. The OP is good too, however the ED is more memorable because of its melodies. Overall, the soundtrack was excellent with emphasis on the ED.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that this anime did its job of delivering its charming and playful message to the audience. It may not have all the frills and thrills of other shows, however it\u2019s a good anime to pick up if you are in the market for a light feel good show with a little bit of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAverage Series Rating \u2013 7.375/10",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is anime with unique atmosphere. While watching this series (especially first three seasons) you can feel some kind of \"magic\" flowing out of your screen. Depending on personality, many emotions can reach you. For sure, the biggest amount of emotions is being felt by melancholic. But this isn't the point. Everyone can see \"Natsume Yuujinchou\", but not every person would tolerate slowly plot and in consequence not every person would feel the full potential of this anime.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nBut let's slow down a bit. Basically, the plot line tells about a regular student living in common japanese village. His name is Natsume Takashiand what's important - his parents deceased. Because of that, he need to face the reality and people who simply treats him bad. The most important is his ability which allows him to see demons and ghosts called \"youkai\". Excluded between people, living between ghosts - this is main topic taken by creator. The spectator's job is to confirm the fact, that Natsume is doing well in his \"little own world\".\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art: admittedly it's getting better and better with every season. It's not extra-special but also it's not worst. Gradually with watching, the viewer gets used to the art. The point is to survive until it happen. ; )\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt could be controversial for Natsume's fans, but in my opinion music used in whole series is it's weak point. To be precise: i mean OST inside anime, without openings and endings. On the other hand, every OP and ED matches this anime in 100%. The rest of sound is like art - it also matches, but it could be better. (if openings and enings matches in 100% then OST would match in 55%). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen i look back on Natsume and his \"pet\" (yes, he have a \"uniqe\" cat), i remember the contrast between this main characters. We have a introvert and shy Natsume who \"attack\" the spectator with huge amount of emotions. But this attack is very, very subtle. In the other hand we have Madara or maybe Nyanko-sensei, who is expressive and direct. Except this two, we have Natsume's friends. Every of them have something that Natsume is missing. That makes us see the characters.as a \"puzzle\". Everyone is completing with each other - especlially with Natsume.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's forget about music and art and move to enjoyment. If you're into fights and blood, stop reading this. And don't watch Natsume Yuujichou. Really, it's for your sake. But! If you don't mind calm and light mix of drama and comedy, you'll feel all of possible enjoyment flowing out of this anime, like i felt. The Natsume adventures are exciting, even if they're monotonous. (I know, it sounds unbelievable, but it is truth XD)\\n\\n\r\n*drums* Overall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't get angry, shounen fans. Personally, I'm melancholic and calm like this anime is. And that's why I ended with rating it on 10 points.I'm almost sure that if you're even a bit like me, you'll like the Natsume series because of it's magic. But it's not only magic. It's both a striking realism (Natsume in society thread) and a thin veil of fiction whitch covers the real world. So, we have 8, 6, 6 ,8 and 10. But who cares about the average score from this numbers? Only final feelings matters, doesn't it? ; )\\n",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is about the bonds and relationships we come across no matter how short or long they last. This series is beautiful for not only its\u2019 characters and stories, but for the art and music as well.\r\nIt is not often that I can right out say what a favorite of mine is; for example movies,\r\nbands, tv shows, actors, and so on. But if someone was to ask me what my favorite anime was, I\u2019d immediately say, \u2018Natsume Yuujinchou\u2019.\r\nThis series as made me cry, laugh, and sigh with its\u2019 story telling. Most of the episodes introduces a new youkai and their trouble. At first itis only the ones that have their names\u2019 in Reiko\u2019s old book of friends, but as the series goes on ones that Natsume just happens to come across and meet show up. 9 out of 10 times they cause trouble, but most of the time their intent is not malicious.\\n\\n\r\nThe one episode stories can be so heartbreaking, and there is struggle and pain that has to be faced. Yet there is a resolution that comes at the end, not always as Natsume hoped it would be, but there is always a sense of peace at the end; even in the sadness.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series Natsume meets some humans that he can relate too. Though isn\u2019t as he hoped it would be, there is regret in the joy. Again his interactions help him grow and shape into a stronger and surer character.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume is an excellent lead; there is a sad history that is easy to sympathize with, yet he doesn\u2019t live by that history. He\u2019s very much a present and future focused type of character; keeping him from being whiny and annoying. He also is a very empathetic and kind person that always wants to help; even it means risking his life (something that really annoys Nyanko-sensei). It\u2019s very hard not to like him; at least a little.\\n\\n\r\nNyanko-sensei is the teacher and main source of humor for the series. He is the relief from overload of tension. Some might find him annoying at first, until it becomes clear that he\u2019s growing attached to Natsume; no matter how much he might deny it. There is a heart under all the fat and selfishness.\\n\\n\r\nTogether it is heaven, opposites in some ways and kindred souls in others. Their ever evolving relationship is what shapes the core of this series. One of the best none romantic partnerships out there for anime and manga, even if in season one it is new and just starting to develop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are the heart and soul of Natsume Yuujinchou. Their history and outlook on life makes it easy to connect and feel for them. Sometimes their stay is very brief and others they just happen to reappear (sometimes much to Natsume\u2019s chagrin) giving a familiar face to see once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the characters wouldn\u2019t so memorable if it wasn\u2019t for the people giving them voices. The talent is mind boggling it is so impressive. It is hard to imagine anyone but Kamiya Hiroshi as Natsume what with his gentle and smooth voice being the narration. Or Inoue Kazuhiko as Nyanko-sensei; he is good at being hilarious and serious at the same time, still have no clue how he does that. The rest of the cast is just as good, but not as important (lead wise). If you watch a lot of recent anime you\u2019ll recognize a bundle of seiyu or voices.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to combine the music and art together, because they complement each other so well. That and when I hear the soundtrack I think of the art or vice versa. The art is soft and full of pastels. The sky is full of fluffy clouds and the backgrounds draw you in and make you feel like you really could be in Japan\u2019s open and expansive farm and country lands. The music is always soft and flowing (like the clouds) and match the setting or feeling perfectly. There isn\u2019t much heaviness to the soundtrack. The opening and ending themes fit the theme well and always as me listening to them as the credits and animations scroll by.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s easy to enjoy this season. It\u2019s deep enough that it doesn\u2019t feel fake or cheap, but it isn\u2019t so heavy that exhausts and bores either. It has steady and even pacing for an introduction of the later seasons (even if there was a lot of us that had to wait about a year between two and three each).\\n\\n\r\nIt is very easy to go straight into Zuko without and problems. The season ends at a good cut off point and leads very nicely into the next season. No confusion or too much recap.\\n\\n\r\nI am writing this after the third time rewatching so there is another plus.\\n\\n\r\nOnly negative thing is Sasada Jun, I find her annoying and more annoying. She\u2019s mostly for gags than anything else, but the season really could have done without her.\\n\\n\r\nMy score is 10 all the way; I\u2019d rate it higher if I could. The start of my favorite series and the reason why I keep watching anime. Seriously everyone should give this a try.",

            "content": "I can't believe it took me so long to watch this. Initially I wasn't sure I would like it because the premise just didn't sound that appealing to me, but now that I finally got around to it, well, this is probably the first time I'm genuinely happy a slice-of-life series has a bajillion seasons.\r\nStory 10/10: This is a very interesting show because, though it is certainly episodic, each episode presents an entire story, and that's what sets it apart from other such anime. The stories unfold slowly and the messages are subtle, but by the end of each episode I felt as though Ihad learnt something.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: The art is not incredibly polished, but it's colourful without being jarringly bright, and the backgrounds are drawn in a watercolour-y way, thus giving the entire show an aura of softness. The creatures we encounter are wonderfully diverse, ranging from cute to weird to sometimes creepy, which I really appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: My only complaint about the sound is the voice acting, which was good but could have been better at times. Other than that, the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, especially the ending theme. The background music is very peaceful and atmospheric, and, though not upbeat, it can be uplifting even when listened to outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Natsume has become one of my favourite protagonists, because even in such a short amount he learns and grows, but he still has a long way to go. My favourite thing about him is how kind he is, especially towards the youkai, though they have inadvertently caused him a fair bit of suffering. He desperately longs for human connection, but at the same time finds it hard to open up to others, which is something a lot of us would find relatable. Other than him, there are a few recurring characters, and there are of course the creatures themselves, whose personalities and stories are just as diverse as their designs, and they are really what make the show as interesting as it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: There were some moments I found dull, though few, and I have to be in a particular mood to be able to watch this show. It's probably one of the least-bingeable shows I've come across, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, as I wouldn't really want to finish a season of it in an afternoon. Apart from that, it's certainly enjoyable, but not upbeat or comedic, more like peaceful or even melancholic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: It would be very easy to give this a 10/10 but I am reserving that for its future seasons which I'm sure are even better. I do understand why this is one of, if not the, most popular 'healing' type anime, - I wholeheartedly agree with it, and honestly? I would absolutely recommend it to anyone, especially if you enjoy slow and atmospheric shows.",

I always felt a tranquil feeling at the end of every episode.\r\nSo, if you're a fan of anime like Bleach or Noragami, I think this is something you'll enjoy. As I said, it's a lot more laid back than those anime, but it does give off the same vibe that they do. One thing I think you'll get a lot of through this anime is some really great stories. Natsume spends his days helping these youkai, and because of that, a lot of lovely storiesget told. That, I'd say, is what this anime is best at. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, I love Natsume as a main character and how complexly he was written. You get to see a very compassionate character spread his kindness to everyone he can, and it's wonderful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe few, we'll say, \"negatives\" I have about this anime are simply that I wanted more expansion. Now, this seems like an issue that will be resolved in subsequent seasons, because this is an issue a lot of first seasons have. I want to see more about Natsume's background and upbringing to really get a sense for why he's so compassionate. Also, I'd like to see a continuous storyline crop up in the future because this season was, essentially, a new story for every episode. Lovely though they were, I'd like to see something a little more consistent.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I think this anime is gonna be a great one for just about anyone. There's something fantastical about it, and yet, it comes with a serene calm. If you want to relax with something, please try out this anime, because I think it'll be just what you're looking for.",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is about a high school boy who can see Yokai, who inherits the \"Book of Friends\", basically a book for contracts with the Yokai. Accompanied by his cat-like friend, Mandara, otherwise known as Nyanko-sensei, as they return the names in the Book of Friends to the contracted Yokai.\r\nTo be honest, I was hesitant to watch the series at first, but it is an excellent watch and will definitely leave a great feeling when you finish the series! Be sure to watch the other three seasons too because they're awesome!\r\n[Note: This review is for the WHOLE series. Also, this review has no spoilers!]\r\nNow toget into the details...\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThe story is unique in it's own way, I've never seen an anime quite like it and I don't know if I will be able to find one like it for along time. Some episodes will leave you tears because oh my gosh it's so sad sometimes. The story pulls you in and then keeps you itching for the next episode. It's gets really saddening though, as you watch episode after episode before reaching the end. You might even want to slow down so you'll have more time to savor such heartwarming storytelling. The limited romance and a good dose of action scenes, which makes it extremely enjoyable to those who want to step away from all the kissing and tsunderes for a moment.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the first time I liked all the characters I came across. Unlike animes where I hate this one particular character, I found coming to the conclusion that I can't really hate anyone in this anime. Sure I may dislike some of the characters, but all the characters really grow on you. I would like to comment on how well the female characters are executed. There are no super tsunderes that get on your nerves or that super shy girl that is super clumsy. All the girls are relatively normal and I grew to like them, making it the first time I liked female characters as much as I loved the male characters. \\n\\n\r\nNatsume Takashi basically became my favorite during the few fist episodes. He's been through hell, but he just keeps trudging forward. The way he tries to avoid to cause inconvenience to the people around him is just so admirable, although I wish he would open up a bit more. I feel so sorry for him sometimes and I find myself shedding tears for him more than once. Nyanko-sensei is probably my favorite non-human favorite character too. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to forget the characters you've seen, even the bad guys. Sometimes you're watching and you go \"Hey, I wonder what this character is doing.\" Needless to say, you won't be forgetting about any of the characters here soon.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION - 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is extremely good for it's day and age. Although rather plain looking to some people, it really has some gorgeous-simple scenes that make you want to wish that you lived there. I myself, would jump at the chance at living at such a peaceful town that Natsume is living in. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough some could compare this anime's animation to that of Sword Art Online, this anime was made in 2008 PEOPLE, 2008. It's pretty good if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - 10/10\\n\r\nOh my gosh, the OST of this anime is so...beautiful. My favorite opening is from the second season (Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou), but my favorite song from this series is Ito wa Kanashi (OST Music). The music is fits right in with the action. Hearing some of the music makes you want to just sit on your porch and just watch nature to think about how fragile your life is. This is what the music is like. Also, everything is mostly traditional. There's no electronic tunes, most of the music is made by the traditional Japanese instruments, which gives this anime a very very peaceful feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL JUDGEMENT - 10/10\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is probably one of the anime that I will never forget even though I tried. This is the first time an anime left me in such a peaceful state of mine. I had to take a moment after watching the last episode to just cry by myself. Yea, that's how the last episode of the series is like, just so peacefully happily sad. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, Natsume Yuujinchou is probably became one of my most favorite anime. I haven't watched anything this good in a long long time. It's also like a breath of fresh air for those who are watching intense action scenes all the time. I highly recommend this anime to everyone! The series (including the other three seasons and 2 OVAs) is quite long too, so you don't worry about it being too short. I really hope that there's a fifth season, otherwise I would be rather saddened, but Season 4 has a pretty solid ending so I won't mind if it never did continue the anime. If not you can always read the Manga.\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS IF YA HAVEN'T WATCHED IT, WATCH IT. IT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD.",

            "content": "Best show i have seen in a long time. Natsume Yuujinchou is thought-provoking, heart-warming, and emotional all in one. Every episode is fantastically made, giving viewers a wide variety of situations where they could place themselves in Natsume's shoes, not including the spirits of course. with many of these scenes there are moments that can be heart-breaking, sad, and can even bring a viewers who prepared themselves to let out a few tears, but what is so amazing about the anime is that it always finishes the episode with a warm ending, but not an ending that leaves viewers unsatisfied.\r\nStory/Characters - 10\r\nGiven that it wasonly 13 episodes in length, the story progressed perfectly. But in some cases the order in which some episodes are watched doesn't really matter or affect the viewers understanding of the plot. in each episode natsume becomes involved with one or a group of spirits (Youkai as said in the anime). this encounter leads to a episodic adventure in which Natsume will help or solve that spirits problems. At a glance this sounds like a typical slice of life series, but what makes Natsume Yuujinchou stand out above the rest is the emotion that is put into each episode, friendship being one of them,  because it is a big part of Natsume's past which is a source of much of the emotion in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are perfect. Nothing more can be said about them except that they are a perfect match for this show and its themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nDefinitely worth watching.",

            "content": "My rating for this is a 95/100 (for both seasons)\r\nEver since I saw a promotional image for this long ago, I looked forward to this series. I heard that it was going to be good, but I sure didn't imagine that a series like this was going to be THIS good! Yeah, the story's simple and has been done before. Boy sees demons, gets hated for it, fights them, etc. But this series  strays away from most of the stereotypes you see in those plots.\r\nFirst off, let me start off by saying that this is the perfect summer series. All of the episodes arecalm, dreamy, and pleasant and leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. This series really does succeed at creating a perfect, dream-like atmosphere that the series emits. The pretty production values and adorable soundtrack contribute to that too. This series doesn't try to be super duper epic with a gabillion explosions or heavenly lights or anything of the sort. It simply does what it feels it has to do, and I feel they did it perfectly! For those of you looking for sparkly bishounen with rainbow-colored hair and big abs, this isn't the series for you. The character designs are perfectly normal and realistic (the only exception is that orange-haired girl) and don't try to be super duper beautiful, yet they do a great job with what they have!\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters! I haven't even begun talking about the characters yet! Everyone is neatly developed, even the youkai. Takashi Natsume proves that he's quite a strong character and is able to carry the series perfectly. Plus I can identify with him and his craving for acceptance and friends, since I myself have those problems too. He's had to suffer quite a deal in his childhood because of his ability, but he's learned from his mistakes from the past. Plus Nyanko is basically cracktastic in the best kind of ways! He's too hilarious to hate! Plus the series doesn't make the youkai seem like totally evil monsters who just like being evil. The youkai spend most of their time alone, and just one simple act of kindness, no matter how small, can mean the world to them. My personal favorite episode was the one with the little fox boy. He was soooo adorable and cute!\\n\\n\r\nI guess the message that this series is trying to throw at us is that kindness, no matter how small or big, is never wasted and that there's value that comes from being in a group of friends, be it humans or youkai. This series captures this feeling perfectly. Everything is so dream-like and endearing, you would love to watch this series before bed. A wonderful series this is!",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou turned out to be a rather simple, very human series at heart. The gentle simplicity to some of the tales, and each tale's lovely cast of characters, does a great job with creating a relaxing, slow-paced yet heartwarming series. The subtleties to a lot of the stories, and their endearing yet sometimes melancholic themes, tailors a rather lovable series that touches upon simple themes of life. While I was initially worried about was the very episodic nature of this series, it ended up that such worries were unfounded. Each 1-2 episode arc did an excellent job telling the story of Natsume as helooks to help out youkai in his own little way. The strength to this series would, almost definitely, be the characters, especially Natsume, Nyanko-sensei, and quite a few of the spirits(aka youkai) involved in the plot. There is a great sense of characterization amongst the cast, resulting in a fair number of enjoyable and well thought out characters. The pacing is a bit on the slow side, though, so don't expect any sort of hot-blooded, fast paced youkai action or anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise to the story is actually rather generic sounding, which originally rang off alarms in my head. Natsume, the main character, is a boy who was able to see youkai since his childhood. He inherits a book with the names of youkai written in it, and Natsume decides to return the names of the youkai to their respective owners.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story sounds typical, it's really the execution here that makes the series so endearing. The stories aren't very one-sided like one would expect, but rather, they are more balanced in perspective. It's easy to see how both Natsume (as a human) and the youkai (as spirits) both interact with each other and teach each other about the simple things in life. We learn about each of their respective hardships through their own perspectives, which adds some interesting insights to the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc tends to have very retrospective, happy yet thought provoking endings, but at the same time this series doesn't hold back with it's melancholic, saddening arcs as well. This series touches upon simple themes in an unobtrusive, yet great way. It's amazing how powerful things such as a simple \"thank you\" or friendly \"hello\" could mean for some people, and this series does a great job at emphasizing such. This series may not always be very subtle about it's ideas, but it's certainly a series that you can easily relax to as you watch through it's endearing story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and music fit in almost perfectly with the general dream-like atmosphere to a lot of the series, adding gentle and pretty elements to the series as a whole. I can't say the music was exactly memorable, but it was very fitting for this series, and really contributed to the wonderful atmosphere this series had.\\n\\n\r\nNotably, this series does have a rather slow pacing (similar to the famous Aria slice of life series), which means this is definitely not for people that can't stomach slow slice of life series. In a sense, Natsume Yuujinchou does require a bit of acquired taste, but that doesn't stop it from being a great series to just sit down and relax to. The atmospheric calmness to the setting, and the charms to the main cast, all add together in a wonderful little 13-episode package that certainly took me by surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.3/10 (rounded down to an 8 on MAL)",

True, it has it's suspenseful moments, but the kindness and warmth that can be felt through the story telling here is what really got me hooked. \r\nIf I had to compare the feel of this anime to anything, it would be Kino no Tabi. However, some episodes of that anime left me feeling let down by the entire  human race. Natsume Yuujinchou and all of it's sequels have so far left either a smile on my face or a groove on my lip from biting too hardlol.\\n\\n\r\nI can't decide if the best thing about this anime is the incredibly detailed, life-like characters, or the beautiful stories they tell. The art is simplistic in style, but I think it lends credence to the story telling. I'm not running out to get the theme/ending song, but I'm not fast-forwarding through it either. \\n\\n\r\nI have also read the manga, or, at least as much as I could find of it. If you can, read it and watch it. However, I have noticed that the anime has a few characters and stories that so far have not appeared in the manga. These additions flow seamlessly into the story and I would suggest watching the anime just for those extra stories. Aside from that, the only differences between the manga and anime is some differences in the order of stories, and that the anime has a soundtrack and the picture moves.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot encourage people strongly enough to watch this anime. It's one of those beautiful treasures you don't find very often, quiet, unassuming but completely lovely. Before I found this anime, I had almost given up watching it entirely. Natsume Yuujinchou has re-kindled my love of anime.\\n\r\n :3",

But luckily I watched this and it became one of my favorite\u2019s series.\r\nFirst 3 words that describe this anime well:\r\n- Spirits\r\n- Slice of Life\r\n- Friendship\r\nStory: Pretty good keeps viewer interested till the end. Anime tells well spirits stories and they are touching and feelings come to up. One of my favorite scene was that Nyanko-sensei comes home in drunk and Natsume yells him.\r\nhe's walking is funny too. One thing I didn\u2019t like this anime was when Natsume were alone he always seemed miserable.\r\nStory:  10/10 \r\nArt:Seemed funny and enjoyable and the characters were drawn well. The places were drawn excellently and viewer gets feelings that he is welcomed in this world. Spirits were interesting and everyone was different which was good,\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: When OP theme begins I was so feeing the music and the scenes in OP were emotional. The Sounds that played in anime were in best of themes that I\u2019ve ever heard in anime. And I liked every song that played in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character that appeared in anime was really detailed and most of characters were funny all the time like they were doing goofy things like dig the soil and so on. I was disappointed when Natsume always were telling himself that he can't do anything most irritating and annoying scenes in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I mentioned anyone can enjoy this anime jokes are funny and characters are all different and every character has own story to tell.\\n\r\nBut I really enjoyed this anime and definitely recommend this all the viewers that like slice of life series or if you don\u2019t like those shounen series or you have seen so many already. Then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Overall, the anime meets the viewer's expectations and it does it extremely well. Series does not remain in places but will continue to flow until the last episode.\\n\r\nThis anime is not worth anyone to be  missed. Great Series.\\n\\n\r\nMy final overall score is 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A friend strongly recommended this series to me and insisted that I need to watch the whole season before drawing conclusion. While i think the season as a whole is bad. The last episode is pretty good, which gives me hope that the next season can be pretty good. So I will give season 2 a shot.\r\nArt 5/10: it does the job of telling the story but offer nothing more. Mediocre.\r\nSound 5/10: Solid voice acting except that i don't like voice acting of Nyanko, purely personal preference here. I do love the ending song though. Overall, just mediocre.\r\nCharacter 5/10: Again mediocre. There is lack ofdevelopment in general. Natsume is portrayed as a nice, lonely guy and nothing else.  The other characters are even flatter. There are some returning characters at the end of the season (i.e. the fox kid) that gives me hope that next season will be better.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10: I know what they are trying to do: having little stand alone stories that try to connect with audience on the emotional level. To me, they failed miserably for most of the episodes. The stories were often too simple. Most side characters only showed up once, resulting that  they are flat and not believeable. It is hard for me to have emotional connection if i don't buy into the story or invested in the characters. I think the season would be much better if they get rid of at least half of the episodes that has nothing to do with main character development or introducing returning characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10: 2-3 good episodes mixed with boring ones that was a waster of my time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10. In my system, this means that this is waste of my time while not offensively bad. I do feel the 2nd season can be better.",

            "content": "Thanks Jex for the recommendation. \r\nAt the beginning when I first began watching anime I couldn't bare to watch a single episodic show. I always found them as slow and less plot driven then other shows, but as I watched more anime such as Mushishi, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Violet Evergarden I come to appreciate the slow and meditative nature of these shows.  \r\nIn terms of a comparison between this show and another there is no better example then Mushishi. Both are calming and often serious and they both deal with fantasy elements or entities that effect the world around them. In thecase of Mushishi, it was less about the mushishi them selfs, but it was more focused on how the mushishi effected the people. In the case of Natsume the anime is focused on the Youkai and how they effect the main character. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 - i need more tears. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty good in this show. I do get kind of board of the modern day Japan setting, but this one was fun because it had less school elements than other shows. The best thing about an episodic shows is the individual stories that each episode tells. Much like Mushishi, Natsume is very good at this. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nIts an old anime, the animation isn't too good, but I like its simplistic style.   \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nIm a sucker for piano music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nthe cat could have ben more developed\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNever a dull moment, Loved the calmness you feel when watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nGood show worth your time.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

When i think about an anime with japanese demons or youkais this is the one that springs to mind at once this is the one that captures everything there is. Its not terribly gory or filled with scary or evil monsters its not even filled with a fight for the end of the world story no this anime creates a masterpiece by staying true to what inmy head if there ever was a world filled with youkais then this would be the one. The story gives me a feeling of loneliness that captures me to the core and the warmth that comes from both humans and youkais alike in it is even greater. For some it might feel too boring or slow but for me when i started watching it i cant help but feel trapped and needing to watch the next episode no matter what. \\n\\n\r\nIm bad at saying anything about art in anime but for me it fitted the anime theme perfect and it felt nice on the eye when watching it. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime makes it one of those masterpieces that i cant help to talk about. It gives a heart wringing sound and a feeling of what this anime is. Its music i cant help but to remember whenever i think of this anime. Its relaxing yet powerfull as it gives the true feeling of what this sad , hearwarming and great anime is. \\n\\n\r\nThe lonely boy who have problems making friends because of his ability to see youkais might sound like an old cliche for some but this anime crushed every thought about it. Natsume is a great made character who along with youkais and friends are made to truly fit the theme of this anime to bits. Its like a perfect puzzle with every piece. \\n\\n\r\nI cant tell how many times i have thought i need to rewatch it and how many times i have done exacly that. This anime is one of the greater ones out there atleast it was for someone like me. Times passed away as the anime pulled me into another world and i admit with my sheer enjoyment i have shed tears while watching this. There was never a moment i felt i didnt want to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nTo the end this anime will be in my heart which i hope will be in many others. The story, the songs the characters everything about it creates something  that makes you want it more and more and makes you feel every emotion there is possible to feel. Its an anime of greatness which calms anyones heart. So what else is there to say then you should watch it heck anyone whos love for anime is great should watch this perfect anime.",

Be aware of the spoilers in this review.Story(8)                                                                                                                              Natsume who is currently the owner of the Book of Friends, gets into lot of trouble while helping or returning the names of youkais. Some episodes are about how Natsume spent his childhood or a youkai that he met during his young days. The story is pretty good, actually. A youkai was chasing Natsume who wants her name back. Natsume, accidentally, breaks a barrier that is sealing a powerful youkai named Madara who wants the Book of Friends. Madara helps Natsume stopped the youkai who was chasing him. Madara offers Natsume to be his bodyguard in exchange he will be the owner of the Book of Friends if Natsume dies.That was the story how Natsume met Madara/ Nyanko-sensei                                                                              Art(7)                                                                                                                             The art is okay, some episodes are dimmer while some episodes are lighter.

I gave it a seven because the climax lacks music or some episodes have no back ground music at all. The voices are awesome BTW.                                            Characters (6)                                                                                                             This is the weakness of this show. Some of the youkais' personality are just bland while some are just the same. I'm actually irritated at Natsume, without Madara or other supporting characters, he'll f*cked things up. He is also getting on my nerves on how weak he was. Sometimes he punches yokai but always he cowers or runs like a chicken. Multiple seasons in and zero growth character. Sometimes Natsume gets into trouble because of Madara's uselessness but somehow he later rescues Natsume making the same excuse like \"he is my prey\". I'm always confused that if he wants Natsume that is life will end. Some supporting characters actually serves a purpose on this show.

            "content": "Main Idea : The idea of the verbose anime arrangement rotating around spirits or other extraordinary creatures is a moderately a new sensation, however one that, with a couple of special cases, has for the most part been stellar. Natsume Yuujinchou, brains Base's most recent invasion into the class, doesn't exactly pack a punch like Mushishi, however it is charming in its own privilege. By bringing a rational way to its stories and filling them with numerous enthusiastic minutes, this arrangement figures out how to draw an association between the people and the spirits, displaying them in such a route, to the point that theviewer can identify with both gatherings. This thus has the impact of permitting the viewer to comprehend and sympathize with the characters and serves to make the strong stories this arrangement decides to tell all the more noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nThrough and through, Natsume Yuujinchou infrequently squanders a second as every scene develops itself pleasantly by centering upon a basic idea like lost love or accommodating contradictions between companions. The nature and relatability of such circumstances are essential to this arrangement on the grounds that once the crowd comprehends the fundamental commence, the scene can then proceed onward to build up the enthusiastic side and pull it out to incredible impact. \\n\\n\r\nAlso build up the passionate side it does. Whether the scene is attempting to pass on the feeling of forlornness that emerges from an absence of admirers or a basic yearning to listen to a diminishing koto player's music for one final time, every scene figures out how to deliver its different mind-set in a manner that is almost impeccable. Notwithstanding whether the scene is attempting to go for comedic passage, a nostalgic minute, or an inspiring knowledge, the scene hits the check as a general rule and in such a route, to the point that the viewer is substance to kick back and be taken in the interest of personal entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nNone of this would have been conceivable if the arrangement had not taken awesome consideration to add to the characters in every scene. The spirits themselves are fleshed out rather well in light of the fact that every one has a different identity and definite foundation which provides for them a human quality that makes it simpler for the crowd to feel for them. In any case, where this arrangement truly exceeds expectations is the route in which they manage building up the principle characters, particularly Natsume. \\n\\n\r\nNatsume's part in these stories adequately makes him the extension starting with one scene then onto the next yet despite the fact that he begins as a hesitant hero, by being compelled to connect with spirits, his stance towards them diminishes as he picks up a superior thankfulness for them. Besides, his communications urge him to break out of his shell so as to standardize with individuals all the more frequently. This movement is moderate and unobtrusive, yet the Natsume toward the begin of the arrangement is obviously not the same as the one toward the end as his encounters and collaborations shape the individual he at long last gets to be. The trustworthiness of the sentiments and feelings that go into Natsume's advancement is incapacitating in a manner that is very nearly articulate. That is, it figures out how to snatch at the crowd's heartstrings by urging them to connect and structure that passionate bond with Natsume as they take in his viewpoint and identity without being strongly controlled into doing as such. \\n\\n\r\nThe fine art and the music figure out how to draw the viewer into Natsume Yuujinchou's quelled, charming setting, yet the arrangement sparkles brightest in the way it draws out the viewer's feelings as it advises its stories while adding to its thrown without limitations. In that capacity, individuals searching for an unwinding, brilliant arrangement that goes into the domains of mystical authenticity ought to most likely give this anime a shot.",

Not realistic, but at least Natsume himself is indeed vulnerable, especially whenalone... and loneliness seems to be a predominant subject in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt times it can be sweet, others almost transcendental... visceral essentially, but also attempts to think things through; Natsume doesn't often act irrationally, although he seems to be perpetually optimistic.\\n\\n\r\nThis series, along with the aforementioned, may truly be the yin and yang of y\u014dkai anime... and while the depths of the psyche can be perceived in both, Mushishi is generally darker...

Then towards the end of each episode, you'll be left with a nostalgic song; a beautiful piece of art. The highest quality of lyrics and singing will sooth your ears and submerge you in it's feelings.\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou; a very simple anime which has done almost everything right. A boy who can see youkai (spirits) that no one else can. However, rather than your usual fighting anime, this anime focuses on the struggles and growth of the main character Natsume. How difficult must it be,to be able to see things no one else can and be called a liar for speaking the truth? Whether or not we choose to blame an entire species for our misfortunes is our own choice.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is exceptionally good in my honest opinion, I myself am trying to refrain from finishing this series too quickly. As delighted as I was that there were a couple of sequels, I knew that they would be finished within the blink of an eye. Good anime's do that. They leave you always wanting more, wondering what's going to happen next. The anime is so heart warming and relaxing; it's a great break from the typical action or purely psychological sad anime. \\n\\n\\n",

The most admirable things of the series are the simplicity of it's story and the detail. With a story like this one should overlook any superficial attributes like the picture quality or the sound (which are also excellent) but the message that we take from watching the show.\r\nThe character detailing was excellent in my opinion! We have a straight-forward protagonist in Natsume who has a heart of gold who goes around helping peoplewho are troubled (which is severely criticized by his \"Sensei\").  He has no \"super-powers\" per se, just a book that he inherits from his grandmother.\\n\\n\r\nWe see an orphan loner who's been through a lot in life finally finding his peace in a caring family and also see how Natsume understands his grandmother through the \"Book of Friends\". Each episode is a story arc of it's own. Natsume and the yokai teach each other a lot of things. About how co-existence between them is possible and how they are not so different. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is a MUST WATCH.",

I absolutely loved the series and couldn't stop watching till the very end. The quality through all 4 seasons was just superb without a hint of drop-off. Once all the characters have been introduced (mostly in season 2), the show really takes off and we get a chance to really know everyone.\r\nThe range of emotions and themes covered in Nastume Yuujinchou is beyond impressive. It would have me ROFL with Nyanko-sensei's antics in one minute to within Clannad-esque tears in thevery next. However, what truly struck me was how N.Y. was able to find a duality/struggling conflict within all of these different themes and truly challenge the feelings and emotions of the viewer. This was done by creating such spectacular characters from Natsume and his family/friends down to the individual youkai that we meet for only a single episode. The creators do a magnificent job getting us emotionally invested in this world via these relatable and lovable characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an amazing ride (and I hope we get another season) as we join Natsume on his journey as he learns to accept and understand his ever changing world, the people/youkai around him, and, ultimately, himself. This is right at the top of my list of must watch anime. Don't think. Just watch.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1: 8.5/10\\n\r\nRest of the Seasons: 9/10",

            "content": "this is my favorite anime.\r\nI think the only reason why some people hate it is because it's literally a SOL (Slice of Life) meaning that it's kinda pointless and has no plot other than just following natsume's (the protagonist) life. The anime just gives you peeks into an odd boy's life and his development of personality. Sometimes, it's heartwarming; sometimes, it's sad. Either way, there's  no \"goal.\" In action anime, the protagonist has to defeat an antagonist, in romance, the characters have to end up together (not always) but in slices of lives, it's basically just drifting around in an empty room. But otherthan that, let's get to the real review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: When I first read the title a couple months back, I honestly thought it was going to be the most boring thing I'd ever seen, but it was summer and I had nothing to do, so I gave it a shot. Basically, Natsume was born with the power to see youkai (spirits) and he was ostracized for it. The whole anime tells of his development in personality as well as human AND youkai relationships. The first episode gave off a melancholic feeling. \\n\\n\r\nArt: When I first watched it, I was not impressed. I had just came here from really high graphic'd animes and I was expecting the same, but as I kept watching the series, the simple look grew on me. I can't imagine it any other way now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I remember when I first watched it, I used to skip the OPs and EDs, but months later, they're all I listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All of the characters here will always have a place in my heart, 'nuff said. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I said, I'm really biased and I personally loved it a lot. I rewatch it all the time. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd rate it a 9, only lacking in the art and animation (at first. The fifth season art is AMAZING)",

            "content": "I just finished watching this great anime. It was truly amazing. Although I heard about this anime a long time ago and knew it was on of the best animes out there, still I refrained from watching up until today. So, I finally realized what I missed out all this time.\r\nWhen I was going through the top anime list I noticed this anime and Mushihishi at the same time. After reading their synopsis, I thought both were some kind of same. So I chose Mushihishi to begin with. But when I saw the first 8 episodes, I was kind of feeling down. The anime didnot meet my expectation. So, I thought Natsume would be something similar. But after watching it, I now realize that I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Mushihishi, the story of Natsume felt like something that can be related to me and the people around myself. Because it focused on human relations more than Mushihishi.\\n\\n\r\nHow Natsume felt lonely during his childhood, how the people around him treated hime and yet he grew up to a person who did not hate humans, how his classmates treat him and tries to understand him, how his foster parents care so much about him, all seemed very warm and heart-soothing.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Mushihishi there was a story build up, you can't just watch any episode without watching the previous ones. And after watched one episode, you feel eager what's going to happen next - this is what I think the most strong point of a good story, and Natsume truly excels in it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNatsu in japanese means Summer. The anime had such a beautiful, warm depiction of it, I enjoyed this very much. The art was simple but wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHell YES. This is the best part of the anime for me. After listening to ending theme, I was so struck by the Japanese folk singer Atari Kousuke that I became a fan of him instantly. Although I watched all the episode in one go, I never skipped the ending for all the 12 episodes, it was amazing. I liked it so much that I memorized it. I even went to listen other great songs of Atari - Hana, Sorezore ni. I am ready to give the sound 10, just for the ending song. The opening was great too. But the ending seems to fit the emotion and environment of the anime the best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are SUGOKU OMOSHIROI (very interesting).\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, Reiko, Nyanko-Sensei, Tanuma, Touko-San, the Class President girl, Natori all were very very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think I don't need to tell you how much I enjoyed this anime, I think my writing reflects it perfectly. Truly sensational. SUGEI!!!",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 4 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.\r\nBefore I go on I'd like to let homeboy Natsume say a few things. Since he's quite lonely and all and he's a fictional character, he's not likely to speak his mind so I'm gonna give him a chance. So, Natsume, how do you feel right now?\r\n\"Being alone is lonely.\"\r\nOh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm curious what you're willingto do about it.\\n\\n\r\n\"I wanna do things I can do.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou're getting really philosophical Natsume. You're quite the poet. What else are you willing to share? Firetrucks are trucks on fire? The word word has 4 letters that form a word? Circles are circular round shapes known as circles in large circles of population? Despite their name, bulldogs are neither bull or dog? At least that's how it should be since pitbulls are neither pits or bulls.\\n\\n\r\nI can't claim there's many more absurd quotes like the two I've quoted from the series in Natsume's Book of Absurd Quotes, but it is a good choice for you if you're looking for a series that showcases loneliness, solitude and isolation, which are Natsume's Book of Lonely Alone Beings most prevalent theme in the content I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume's Book of People Doesn't Have A Plural And That's Why You'll Die Alone deals with a boy named Natsume who inherited his grandmother's book where she sealed the name of youkai which makes them subservient to her and he decided to give the names of these youkai back. In this process, Natsume's Book of Books Are Filled With Pages explores how Natsume and the Youkai felt isolated, were isolated and how being alone is lonely. It doesn't do a bad job in this process, actually it does do a decent job but my problem is that it withholds the same melancholic atmosphere in every episode and getting very sappy with it at times. It doesn't do a bad job presenting the feelings and circumstances through which these characters have gotten where they've gotten or a bad job in even presenting their feelings, but its overall atmosphere kills it for me. Every episode is the same with its melancholy tightly glued to it and having some generic anime humor  like oh that cat likes food hahaha oh it brought a frog, which is meant to relieve some of the tension, but since I don't share that type of humor, it does not work for me. Instead Natsume's Joke of Abstract Jokes amused me.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume's Book of A Furry Can't Eat A Hotdog Because It'd Be Cannibalism doesn't resonate with me because most of its atmosphere is reserved and quiet which while it works for the show's theme, it feels too constant and while it does give the show a relaxing tone, it doesn't really play with my expectations in any sort of way, up to the point when a twist happens, I don't really care, because everything feels on the same constant all the time. But also the worst part for this show is that I'm on the exact opposite side of the feelings the show is trying to evoke. I personally value solitude a lot, I enjoy being alone and away from the public. I feel very relaxed by myself while I have nobody to interact with and value it each time. So the theme can't resonate with me even if I recognize what it does try to do and appreciate that, but if it doesn't put the events in a way I observe the experiences shown to me in a more direct way, I can't really empatize. It does present you enough, but it feels more like it's presented to be acknowledged rather than observed, which is what I usually seek from a series with an episodic focus on its events over the overarching plot.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume's Book of Drawings Are Done By Drawing's artstyle is fine. It doesn't look impressive and fits the purpose of the show, best described as typical and traditional. Nothing wrong with that since you have a lighthearted show about youkai and isolation and I can't argue that it works. It won't impress you visually but it shouldn't bother you either.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Natsume's Book of Music Is Made With Sounds has a very relaxing and calming tone to it as a result of most of what you'll hear from the series is ambiance rather than music to deleniate the tone. Since it's set in a quiet rural area that's pretty much the result. The intro and the ending are some chilled out mellow songs that sound like classic japanese melancholy. Nothing noteworthy but definitely fitting.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume's Book of I'm Funny And My Jokes Always Make Everyone Laugh seemed like a very chilled-out slice-of-life that is willing to explore the melancholy of a lonely child who's felt isolated due to being judged for the things he was perceiving. It isn't something that I have high odds of enjoying or am particularly looking for, since the reason I've decided to give this series a shot was the character development experienced by the characters in the series and there are meaningful messages to be carried, but what the central theme is and how it was meant to be executed is important, how the tone carries out and what type of lessons are to be drawn from it. And now you know. If you want to explore melancholy in a lighthearted fashion, give Natsume a try. If you don't, being alone is lonely and do things you can do. If you want. I don't expect it to change its tone or themes, especially in its first season. So if you're starting this series, this is what you should expect.",

It completely blew me away!\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI'll warn you now, if you watch this you will most probably get emotional over every episode (At least I did). What's so amazing is that it constantly pulled out some emotion from me. Whether I was crying like a baby or smiling at the heartwarming moment, every episode was so emotional. \r\nThe spiritual stories were so beautiful. I haven'tseen something like that in so long. I really wish there were more series like this out there, the stories of loss or heartbreak, love and joy. Each episode was like a roller-coaster of emotions!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was slightly different. And if you ask me, I really couldn't tell you how but I just noticed it was unique and fit the story line so well. Especially the opening title sequence was amazing. The art fit so well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music, Oh my the music! I must have listening to the end and opening song more than 1000 times. It's not just that, the background music enhances the feeling and makes you want to cry even more. It seems very.. tradition? I don't know how to explain it well but all I know is that I didn't hear a single song in this show that I didn't absolutely love.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a bit sad that most of the characters didn't stay to long, I think it was a bit disappointing that the show couldn't be longer. ( I know there is a second season that I have yet to watch) But it was beautiful (Yes, I must have used beautiful many times, but how else can I describe a show like this?) \\n\\n\r\nBut all the spirits were so unique and I loved finding out about there stories even though it was sometimes sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen the second season yet, but I hope I enjoy it as much as this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJust perfect!",

In every episode Natsume finds out how  these beings that have lead him to besecretive are not as bad as they are depicted, and in the process can make you cry sometimes.\\n\r\nWith a new story every episode I have yet to see any other anime where just 20 mins are effectively used to make the story so sublime and characters so tender that sometimes it makes you cry. Its a feeling which any solitary person would find very restful and comforting. And I think each one of us has that little bit of solitude that would connect with it joyfully. Thats what make this series so unique and genuine. I strongly recommend this for all and see it when you are in nice space of mind to appreciate is thoroughly.\\n",

            "content": "After reading the summary for Natsume Yuujinchou I braced myself for a creepy ride. Much to my surprise though, this anime gave me more \"awww\"s than \"ahhh!\"s. No disappointment there though. \r\nSTORY: IX\r\nThe first few episodes are dedicated to introducing the characters and the impetus that sets the story into motion so there wasn't really anything to look forward to. As the story progresses, however, the plot and the characters become more interesting. It isn't because of an intense climax or an unfolding of a much bigger story. In fact, the whole anime is pretty much about the Natsume's everyday ordinary life, with the addedexception of a youkai for a bodyguard. It is because it becomes so easy to empathize with the characters. Each episode makes you understand Natsume, the boy who tries to make his already extraordinary life more extraordinary by making the most of everything that he experiences.\\n\\n\r\nART: VIII\\n\r\nThe visual presentation is pretty decent. I especially loved it when some scenes would be paused for a moment to look much like a painting. These short pauses attract attention and empathizes a particular touching moment.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: IX\\n\r\nThe background music compliments the emotion being roused by a scene in the anime. My favorite would be how the instrumental of the ending theme plays on the background during the last few seconds of an episode when Natsume reflects on what just happened.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: XIII\\n\r\nThe personality of the main characters compliments each other. Although the cool&mean-cute&kind duo where the kind guy is dominated by the mean guy is a usual sight in many animes, I liked how the less domineering Natsume won't budge to the whimpers and whines of the more domineering Madara. This creates a balance in their relationship. There were a few annoying supporting characters though. But they pretty much become more bearable at the end of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: IX\\n\r\nFor me, enjoyment is a lot of laughter and more laughter. Natsume Yuujinchou doesn't deliver much in the laughter category. It's delight, however, is a passive-looking character called Natsume and how his views about life and the world would sometimes be the same with mine even if I don't live an unusual life like he does. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: IX\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a must see for those who are bloated by the dense environment of action/gore animes or the superficial atmosphere of some romance animes. This makes a light Sunday afternoon movie - with the exception of the sudden appearance of creepy youkais.",

It's always willing to extend a hand to those who need a moment of peace, telling the story of a boy who, through his awkward position in between the human world and the world of spirits, still manages to find his own way.

It's one of my alltimes favorites and I would recomend it to everybody. \r\nActually the story is quite simple: boy can see yokai and that prevents him from having a normal life. However it's not the plot what makes Natsume such an special manga/anime, but the way the story is told. \r\n It's a slice of life show following the developement of the main character, who needs to learn how to dealwith humans and ayakashi in his everyday life. During this process he learns to forgive the wrong doings he has suffered from both sides and gets to appreciate his gift thanks to his interaction with the many supporting characters, which are all very cleverly developed. They all have good reasons to be what they are like, and they evolve, and forgive, and learn and grow... But the most important is that they are all incredibly lovable and sweet. Not in a cheesy way, but in a deep-human way. Many of them appear just in one chapter, but they are so skilfully introduced that you feel you can really understand them and want them to be happy forever.\\n\\n\r\nBesides, the animation is great. The artwork is beautiful in it's simplicity. It's amazing to be able to create such a soothing dreamlike atmosphere with so little. Plus the soundtrack fits so well with the whole. \\n\\n\r\nThe only... let's say \"negative\" side, is that many of the most intriguing aspects concerning the story of some of the main characters remain unclear in the anime, and you will need to read the manga for further details.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever as I said, it's not what we are told but the way it is told. So while we may not get all the answers we'd like to have, the anime still provides a full experience, because at the end the purpose of this anime is not to be intriguing but to be simply beautiful. Every aspect of the story is so nice and heartwarming, even the sad things are so beautifully elaborated that at the end of each chapter you feel like life is really worth it even when things do not exactly have a happy ending.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, why someone should watch this anime? Easy answer: Because it will make you feel so good.",

            "content": "The show that started it all. Natsume Yuujinchou tells the story of Takashi Natsume, a boy who leads a lonely life because nobody understands his ability to see Youkai, but one day he finds the Book of Friends, the names of all the Youkai who were defeated by Takashi's grandmother, Reiko. The concept is so simple, yet the end result is a work of art. Natsume Yuujinchou takes the best parts of its genre and creates a near-masterpiece.\r\nStory - A+\r\nLike i said above, the concept is so simple but in the end in blossoms into a strong, compelling and lovable show. Takashi goes about everyday the same as any other, with the glaring exception that he can see Youkai. They can be bad or good, Takashi at first doesn't know what to expect from them. Each episode is its own story, describing the Youkai in question, Natsume helping the Youkai and later returning that youkai's name to them. It manages to take a bland and linear formula and turn it into its own work of art. The real essence of the show is the relationship between Youkai and humans.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - A+\\n\r\nWonderful. Not too over the top, but nothing lacking. It strikes a balance, which is what Natsume Yuujinchou is essentially. Everything gets detailed: from the random background scenes to the characters themselves with precision to match.\\n\\n\r\nSound - A++\\n\r\nThat's not a typo, i gave it another +. For every scene in Natsume Yuujinchou, there's a wonderful piece of music to accompany it. Every. single. scene. Once again, though the music is simplisitic it accels in giving the viewer something to look forward to. Nothing that screams \"over the top\", but not lacking either. The opening song \"Issei no Koe\" definitely fits the tone of the show. It's calm, uplifting and transitions a bit in the second half to more upbeat. The ending song, \"Natsu Yuuzora\"...Oh my god. This song is the very definition of perfect. Listening to this song definitely screams \"the conclusion to another fine episode of Natsume Yuujinchou\". Natsu Yuuzora represents the same qualities the show has: Uplifting and calming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter A-\\n\r\nProbably the only real negative to this show, and why its a NEAR-masterpiece. Natsume serves as the titular character and as such focuses strongly on him. We have other characters as well. Natsume's adoptive parents, the Fujiwaras, serve as one of the few people whom Natsume clearly cares deeply about, but alas they also don't know of his ability to see Youkai and constantly struggles to keep it that way. Occasionally, we see other humans but its mostly Youkai for the most part. Each Youkai has a compellling backstory when they meet Natsume.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A+\\n\r\nI couldn't picture myself watching Natsume Yuujinchou. I was always a huge fan of the mecha and shounen animes and (stupidly) claimed that they were superior in everyway. But boy, was i wrong. A show doesn't need flashy *pew pew* lasers (aka, animation effects)  or over-used cliches to make a niche in its genre. Like most anime, you either love it, like it or hate it. This show falls in the \"love it\", but if you're not one who likes gentle, easygoing and slice-of-life shows, you may \"like it\". I can't picture anyone who can hate it, other than a lack of attention-span perhaps.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou's ultimate strength lies in its simplicity. That can also be it's downfall for many who don't have the patience for such simplicity.\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\r\nThe good: Pretty much Everything.\\n\r\nThe bad: One or two more human characters should be added, but that's it.",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou. It makes me think of frozen raspberries and a relaxed, unhurried fuzzy feeling - because that\u2019s what I was doing when I first watched it, all five seasons that had aired at the time - consuming raspberries as though they were popcorn and trying to survive the sweltering summer holidays.\r\nThe premise, it is something fairly simple and relatively familiar. The main character is an orphan, has grown up with no one there to care about him, has been ostracised from society for being either weird or abnormal and in this case, being capable of seeing supernatural beings which others cannot. Until now, hehasn\u2019t been capable of finding his own place in the world, and this is where the story starts; a new family, a new town and a new chance to, finally, discover what is is to have a place to call home.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this, you might think this is nothing you haven\u2019t seen before. But what really took me by surprise was how well it was done. The author took this idea and made it her own.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume Takashi, the main character, what with his background, does indeed illicit some sympathy and melancholy feelings from the viewers. But - how to put this - it\u2019s not thrown in your face. It\u2019s merely presented as fact. And these facts shape him for the character he is today; introverted, quiet, used to bottling things up and dealing with things on his own. A completely unhealthy mindset to be in, but that is perhaps, one of the biggest messages in the story, and unfortunately there is also truths in these states of being for the everyday lives of many people.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, this creates a lot of basis for character development. And it is there, masterfully so even if you don\u2019t notice at first glance, at a step by step pace so slow one can hardly tell the difference. Perhaps this isn\u2019t a show for people pressed for time, I\u2019m not one of them and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. This is a masterpiece so grand it should be compulsory. You see him open up, make friends, learn how to share his cares. And as a person it is revealed that Natsume is unmeasurably kind, generous and will go out of his way to help those in need - even if all he gets in return is a bad night of sleep, and perhaps might find him self in the face some form of supernatural peril. Each episode will definitely leave a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nNyanko-sensei, well, he is a contrast. The largest source of humour, with a not dislikable unvirtuous demeanour. He is great. Just great, and Natsume Yuujinchou wouldn\u2019t be Natsume Yuujinchou without him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we get to the title: Natsume Yuujinchou, in English, Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends. It\u2019s a positive name which embodies the themes, the story and the characters. Quite literally, it\u2019s named after The Book of Friends, created by his grandmother, Natsume Reiko and the only memento Takashi has of his family. Each page has a \u201cname\u201d belonging to a youkai (those supernatural beings I mentioned earlier) and the show\u2019s episodic nature tells his journeys to returning them.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, this isn\u2019t something one might feel pressed to watch all at once. Far from it, this is something one can relax with after a long, stressful day. I know I have my favourite episodes for when I\u2019m feeling anxious.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if you haven\u2019t watched this by now, you, reader, are missing out. I cannot emphasise this enough.",

            "content": "More and more studios are starting to hit their stride after the massive Studio increase around 2004 and 2005. The once rookie studios such as Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends studio Brains Base (Baccano!) is now making a name for itself and trying to separate from the others. Brains Base decided to go with Takahiro Omori in the director\u2019s seat once again, but for a much different show compared to Baccano. \r\nThe story here focuses on a young 15 year old boy called Takashi Natsume. He has the inconvenient ability to see youkai (ghosts/spirits), and this power of his is inherited. Ever since he was achild Natsume was bullied, ostracized by his family and classmates, and even chased by the spirits he claims to see. Basically, everyone looks down on him like he is crazy. One day he comes across a book left behind by his grandmother Reiko, whom also had the ability to see youkai. This is a slice of life story focused around Natsume encountering youkai related to the book left by his grandmother called the \u201cBook of Friends,\u201d and how each day seemingly impacts his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is episodic with small little pieces of information to advance somewhat of a plot. It is very similar to another show that came out prior called Mushi-shi, but with a much lighter tone and atmosphere. In this first season, Natsume comes across and befriends through a spoken contract with a cat-like spirit becomes Natsume\u2019s bodyguard of sorts. The story follows a very melancholy story as Natsume interacts with the spirits around him and how they relate to the book of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a wonderful story focused around our main character Natsume and it really does exhibit quite a bit of growth and development. The interactions between the cast and spirits never feel forced and the writing is very strong to say the least. As for storytelling, the episodic focus does tend to distract from any underlining plot from developing. However, it does maintain this melancholy, uplifting, and sentimental piece about the show to keep the audience engaged.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, no this does not meet up to Mushi-shi\u2019s levels, but is still pretty enjoyable. Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends focuses more on filling the show with emotional moments rather than tension, and touches further on sympathizing for Natsume as compared to going along with Ginko\u2019s quest in Mushi-shi. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode has some new emotional ride to go on ranging from Natusme listening to a youkai\u2019s final request or youkai wanting the book for themselves forcing Natsume to make a tough choice. Each spirit has a backstory and is fairly well fleshed out even showing how Natsume feels about each one. However, the same circumstance and emotional reaction does dull over time rather quickly. The growth of Natsume is there, but definitely stretched out as much as possible to extend the show even if the audience does see him start out with a disdain for youkai grow into a more sentimental experience.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds, music, art, character art each adds and mold well into the setting of the show. This is no doubt what a show like this needs. Just like in Mushi-shi and even another soft-toned simplistic show like Aria, Natusume\u2019s Book of Friends does a decent enough job trying to pull out the viewer\u2019s emotions one episode at a time. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a sort of honesty to the show and a cast to complement our main character to make the show worth something. Is it action pact, plenty of tension, have that plot advancement the show initially sets out? None of those seem to matter at the end unfortunately, which hurts what the show could have been. Other than that, the show is worth recommending for people looking to relax and have a melancholy feel while watching a very down-to-earth kind of anime.",

            "content": "This series is a relaxing, fantastical, supernatural series about a teen orphan named Natsume who can see Yokai aka ghosts and spirits etc. This power has led him to a life of solitude as he is shipped around to one set of relatives to another as he struggles to make friends and fit in. Upon finally settling in the village where his late grandmother Reiko grew up he discovers that his only heirloom is a book containing the names of many Yokai from in and around his new home. Commonly known to the Yokai as The Book of Friends it was accumulated by his grandmotherReiko and the inclusion of the names effectively turned all the Yokai within it to her servants. After accidentally waking the powerful Yokai Madara, Natsume decides to return the names of the Yokai.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is set around a particular story involving Natsume helping a Yokai or a person affected by Yokai. In much the same vein as the show Mushishi these stories range from lighthearted adventures, light horror or emotional drama. The show is a blissful journey and I have to say it\u2019s right up there as one of the best shows I\u2019ve watched as the show just oozes charm and is chock full of interesting personalities. It\u2019s hard to not just love the characters on offer here, Natsume is a calm but strong and endearing lead, Madara is hilarious, the side cast is full of likable characters. Alot of the Yokai are great fun too, my personal Favourite is \u2018Moustache\u2019 from \u2018The Maiden\u2019s Circle\u2019 in the Second Season.\\n\\n\r\nThe best episode so far is the very touching \u2018The Dew-God\u2019s Small Shrine\u2019 from Season 1. \u2018The Little Fox\u2019s Hat\u2019 is also hard not to love.\\n\\n\r\nBasically if you\u2019re like me and have ever stupidly put off watching this series as something you'll get around too (it took me a few years before I decided to finally watch the show) then also like me you should really get to fixing that sooner rather than later. It\u2019s a wonderful show and comes highly recommended.",

Maybe a bit too much, i feel it makes the story somewhat dull. And the different seasons of  the show follow a certain level of consistency, the problem is the way it's done. In fact the show doesn't feel like it progresses in any form. Main character doesn't get any stronger, and keeps getting his ass handed to him, and it is at a point where it gets frustrating to watch. The show also feedsyou this information that he has such a high \"spiritual level\" several times. Yet all he does is get knocked out, and show no interest in learning any ways to improve himself. \\n\\n\r\nThe show gives you his story and it's presented well, but beyond the flashbacks. He is a completely uninteresting main character. Now this could be due to the fact that the side characters are well done or that he simply doesn't increase in capability through much of the four season if any\\n\\n\r\nIt follows the same rules almost every episode which is one of either two:\\n\r\nScenario 1: Cat runs away, main char gets his ass handed to him while cat is gone, then cat returns and helps.\\n\\n\r\nScenario 2: Person or \"Spirit\" asks him for help and he helps them. And during this he most probably gets his ass handed to him\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is done decently / well, even though i dont quite feel it is on the same level as Mushishi. even though i find that they are quite similar story wise. But it really boils down to the main character, i feel that this series could have improved vastly had they offered any feeling of change. Such as more information about the Book of Friends or perhaps something interesting about the remaining pages, or even increased strength of other spirits that may be a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i liked about the series:\\n\\n\r\n-Provides good storytelling with interesting characters involved\\n\r\n-Gives you a good possibility to immerse yourself in the story and world\\n\r\n-Not really any cliffhangers\\n\\n\r\nWhat i disliked about the series:\\n\\n\r\n-With the amount of other characters that can also see spirits it makes the main character much less interesting, as pretty much any of them are more capable\\n\r\n-The story does not really progress in any way and main character doesn't evolve, in strength or mentally.\\n\r\n-Most of the important information you learn about the story through the show is given to you by the first 5 episodes or so.\\n\\n\r\nNotes of things that could be either good or bad:\\n\r\n-As far as the storytelling shows go, most of the episodes will be it's own story and have no further affect on the rest of the episodes\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nEven though there are quite a few things that bother me with the show, i wouldn't consider it to be a bad one. I would say i recommend it if the storytelling perspective interests you. But if you're looking for something a bit more meaningful as far as progression goes, I doubt anyone will find it here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i think it's a decent show, and i recommend it but wish it could have been done differently\\n",

The story was very simple, yet it is great. Such genre is one of my favorite, it reminds me of xxxholic. \r\nNatsume is your high school boy who can see various spirits... he inherited such ability from his grandmother. At the same time, he also gets the 'book of friends' wherein the name of spirits that his grandmother 'defeated' were listed there. And his part of the charade was to bring those names back to where it truly belongs..at least. Since many spirits were after that too. \\n\r\nThis plot of Natsume Yuujinchou is what i really like about it. And with the twist and turns it involves, i could say it surpasses any other kind of anime with the same genre. For me.\\n\r\nI also like the supporting characters, the way his problem gets on him, some sense of humor (at least it makes me laugh XD)...what else? The animation itself... and everything about it.\\n\r\nIt is great, i swear... i love it.",

            "content": "This is honestly one of my all time favorite animes. What draws me into anything (be it a book, movie or TV series) is usually the characters. And this show has a lot of them, very few of which are 1-demensional. Even the side characters introduced along the way have deep back-stories and their own cares and worries, which are never lost on the main character.\r\nNatsume Takashi is one of those main characters who is very easy to feel attached to. His gentle nature and \"always working for the better of others\" outlook on life make him very likable. \r\nNot only does this show focuson character development, but it also centers a lot around plot. The plot is pretty easy to decipher, and they really take time to introduce each new development, never throwing complicated twists and turns at the reader without explaining how it connects to everything else. \\n\\n\r\nI might have thought that a slow-placed, plot and character driven story would be a little dry, but that certainly isn't the case here. While a lot of the humor comes from situational comedy and irony, it provides a light-hearted and amusing tone to an otherwise serious story.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the youkai aspect of the show which is certainly interesting. I think that in order to really understand and enjoy the show at first impression, one needs to have a little understanding of Japanese folklore, which makes the shrines, seals and creatures easier to understand. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, great show. I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nI thought this was a realistic portrayal of what orphans go through. A lot of animes show characters living perfectly fine on their own but here, we see the psychological effect of an orphan moving from one relative to another in addition to the problems he run into due to his unnatural ability to see yokai. \r\nArt 9/10\r\nI thought the presentation of the yokai and supernatural beings were very creative. It's not too graphic but the simplicity in the artistic presentation is very fitting of this anime. \r\nSound 10/10\r\nThe music was very soothing and relaxing since Natsume lives in the countryside. It blended smoothlywith the scenes and emotions of the events and scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI'm super biased about my favorite character (Madara, the cat) because he's just too cute and too adorable. Although he is shown to only enjoy eating, his character development throughout the series showed a different side to him that was subtle in some sense but obvious. You'll get it as the anime progresses to the 4th season. As for the main protagonist (Natsume), I really felt like I understood where he came from and why he acts the way he does. There is a lot of depth in his character and it makes me like him a whole lot more, especially those who care about him because it helps him grow as an individual. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAgain, the fat cat is my favorite character and he acts like a comedy relief during intense scenes. He's both cute, funny, and reliable. I absolutely adore this character. I also watched this in japanese (not English dubbed) so I thought the voice actor for him did a phenomenal job of portraying his silliness at times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI have watched Mushi-shi which is very similar to the supernatural aspect of this anime, but I thought this anime took me on a journey that was both heart-warming and exciting. At the end of almost all the episodes, Nasume and Nyanko-sensei will arrive home from their adventures in the world of yokai. Natsume's life really touched me. After completing the 4 seasons, I really appreciate people like the Fujiwara's who can change the life of an orphan.",

            "content": "I got finished watching the first season of Natsume Yuujinchou and immediately went to the second. I have been looking at this show for months contemplating watching it and finally I did and I\u2019m so happy. Even though the general idea of the anime (guy who can see something nobody else can see) has been done time and time and TIME again (Moyashimon, Yuyu Hakusho, Eerie Queerie, Legal Drug) however this one is done well and with a degree of originality. \r\nStory: \r\nLet me start by saying if you look at this and see a bishounen and hope for a lovey dovey romance to ensuewith some other special human or a youkai then you should probably just walk away right now because you are going to be very disappointed. Though there are moments that Natsume gets a sort of crush on a youkai in the show, it\u2019s not the point of the show and it\u2019s not a major issue that is addressed later on in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe series (for the main part) is pretty episodic, which in most cases I hate. But every once in a while a good anime comes through and makes me love it and its episodic-ness. This is one of them. Sometimes theres a few \u201cIN THE LAST EPISODE\u201d moments, and some characters, such as the 5 acre youkai, cross over into other episodes, but for the most part the series remains episodic.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the details put into the series. Not many anime actually explain how the character knows what to do in those magical moments. It just happens. They just know to scream an attack and it happens. End of discussion. However in Natsume Yuujinchou, it shows every explaination of how he randomly learns to do something. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like is that it doesn\u2019t make all the youkai act just like humans but look funny. I like that youkai don\u2019t pay attention to gender. Creatures are just creatures. Period. And that to me is a detail that makes the story a lot better in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo finally what makes it stand out. Of course it\u2019s the title object. The book. A book full of demon names that for some reason Reiko never gave back. Learning the back stories to all of these ayakashi is what makes this series worth every single moment you spend watching it. I can\u2019t say anymore about it without spoiling an episode or two, but the more stories you go through the more you want to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is wonderful. Cons that took off two points? It is a concept that is done very often, and the concept doesn\u2019t have a huge arch to keep with. It\u2019s enough to keep a viewer watching, enjoying, and entertained, but not jumping out of your seat and excited like a 10 would do.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\\n\r\nI gave the animation an 8 out of 10. Why? It\u2019s beautiful! And every youkai looks so different! And the backgrounds are so detailed! Yes this is all true, however there were a few cons. In the more action-y scenes, you\u2019ll see a little bit of unnatural movement with the human characters. With the youkai you can shrug it off with \u201cthey don\u2019t really exist so they don\u2019t have to look natural\u201d but that doesn\u2019t work with the people. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the backgrounds as detailed as they may be at times, are unmoving. If there are a group of people in the background, the people are at a stand still. And unfortunately the show falls into the \u201cI can see the different cell\u201d trap. If there\u2019s a box that\u2019s about to burst open, it\u2019s probably the one that you see that is a slightly different color scheme than the rest of the cell. \\n\\n\r\nBut there are a lot of good things about the animation as well. The details put into the show make things beautiful. And the animation during the \u201cmagic\u201d scenes  is so flowy and serene it really changes the atmosphere from an action to a spiritual feel. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this series is absolutely beautiful. I would give it a 10 if not for one thing. THE SOUND OF NATORI\u2019S TATTOO. Ugh\u2026I hate that sound. And it happens at times that are completely unnecessary. I understand that the point is to add the detail in there, but please\u2026during those moments can it slither quietly? Please?\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the music to this series isn\u2019t as good as in the second season, I still could sit through the entire OP and EP each episode I watched (which takes a lot for some anime). And the background music is really good at fitting into the scheme of things. So I almost..aaaalllmost gave it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOkay first the big guy. The protagonist. Natsume Takashi. He\u2019s one of those guys with one of those skills that not many others posess and make him look crazy. So in reaction to that he keeps it a secret and is very much to himself. However he\u2019s different than most other protagonist in these situations. He doesn\u2019t completely shut himself off from the world on purpose. He zones out a lot and falls asleep a lot, but he welcomes friends and newcomers gladly, even if he doesn\u2019t want them all knowing his secrets. He has an outlook all his own and he won\u2019t change it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd he knows himself, which is a quality that very few main characters posess. Most main characters spend half a series finding out what their weakness is and coming to terms with is. But he will bluntly say things like \u201cIf I feel like it\u2019s important I just jump in even though I know it\u2019s a bad idea. I don\u2019t think about it.\u201d Which he knows is a flaw to most people.  Natsume\u2019s values aren\u2019t stupid either. He isn\u2019t super insecure about his family that he has, his foster parents, but he respects them and tries his best just because of what he\u2019s been though. And the more you get to know him the more you get to know how human he is. Not human in the sense of the show, but how like a human, you and me, he is. And that\u2019s probably what makes it so easy to get attached to him.\\n\\n\r\nNyan-ko Sensei, aka Madara. He\u2019s both our comedic relief and our secondary hero. There are moments where he runs off and you think \u201cWhat the crap\u2026get back over here\u201d but that just ads to his degree of imperfection necessary to make a good character. He comes to the house drunk, eats a lot, gets on natsume\u2019s nerves, and yet everyone else seems to love him. He\u2019s old and wise, though he tries not to show the old part unless he wants to scare someone, but sometimes he can just be a douche. Eh they\u2019re tiny, doesn\u2019t matter you can\u2019t fight for beans they aren\u2019t worth my time so you can deal with them, Natsume. Nyan-ko also has that \u201cOnly I can kill you\u201d complex. Though lets face it, he\u2019s not gonna kill him. But there are some points where you see  in the beginning he really didn\u2019t care if he died as long as he inherited the book, but as time goes on he goes from intrigued to entertained by the events. \\n\\n\r\nSasada. She is goofy. She has her respectable \u201cclass rep\u201d moments and her \u201cI\u2019m a mischeivous little turd\u201d moments that make her stand out. I love that she isn\u2019t just a stick in the mud and has a story of her own, unlike the other two classmates. She is really what gives depth to the other background characters, and was the topic of one episode, but all together, I can see where she could possibly a fan favorite, though mine comes as a pair up next.\\n\\n\r\nKitamoto and Nishimura. They have to be listed as a pair. This isn\u2019t just one of those cases where the two background characters come around and make everything funny and that\u2019s their whole point. I love the fact that they force Natsume to be their friend. Natsume never stood a chance at being a loner with these two around. And they provide some pretty good details to the story. Their whole point is to drag Natsume to numerous other side characters, but at least they aren\u2019t boring and at least they get screen time. They bring a smile to my face almost every time they are on screen.\\n\\n\r\nTanuma. He is awesome. I love how he and Natsume just click from the beginning. He can be a bit of a bore sometimes because he can be brought on just to pick on sasada during her crazy moments, but other times he\u2019s just a nice guy that you can\u2019t stand to hate.\\n\\n\r\nTouko and Shigeru. I love these two more than real parents in anime. Touko is such a sweet woman but not perfect, which makes her amazing. And Shigeru is so chill with everything. If these two have to have a flaw it would probably be that they don\u2019t really exist as people. I just wish I knew a little more about them. Why dont\u2019 they have kids? Why did they live alone before? That\u2019s possibly to be revealed in a sequel so we\u2019ll see I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nAnd side characters. Because this show is episodic there are a LOT of recurring and not recurring side characters. Some of my favorites would probably be the 5 acre youkai, like I said. They are just so goofy. But I love how each one has their own story and each one is either loveable or hateable. \\n\\n\r\nFinally Reiko, who isn\u2019t in the series, but is flashbacked in it. I dont like her. Why? Because she\u2019s confusing. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s a bad person or just a cocky person or if the writer of the show even knows. By the end of this series I just couldn\u2019t figure out if she was a good person or a person who constantly has to have her screw ups fixed by her grandson. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nThis show is beautiful, and amazing. If there was a 5th season I'd be watching it. I can't find where taking a point away from the enjoyment of this show would be valid because it's pretty freaking amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nSo I guess that\u2019s my review of Natsume Yuujinchou. Quickie review: It\u2019s beautiful with a few jagged moments, the sound track is gorgeous with one sound I hate, the story, though done before, is original in it\u2019s own ways which make it lovely, the characters are loveable and fun which make this an easy watch.  \\n\\n\r\nSo I would definitely say to watch this series. Now I\u2019m going on to the next season. Enjoy!",

            "content": "This is a perfect example of an anime that will make you feel entirely happy with every episode that you watch. The nostalgic flashbacks that are shown in the series hit you very lightly, but perfectly. I was very satisfied with the many episodes that came after this first season as well so give those a go after this season. \r\nStory: The slow pace of this episodic anime does not cause any harm to it at all. In fact, it helps that the story does not try to delve too far into Takashi's grandmother because it is inferred that the story will focus mainly onhim and the cat. It's hard to describe the vibe of this anime but if I had to give a few I'd say that it makes you feel mellow and relaxed while showing the kindness that exists in their world. You'll have to watch this anime if you want to know more of what it is I'm talking about. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime is definitely not the best. If I had to, I would  say that it fits in entirely with every other aspect of the anime. I am not a fan of poor art, but while this isn't the best art out there, it certainly does not disappoint so I am not going criticize it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Amazing, if there was one word to describe it purely. The music that rolls on throughout each episode is exceptionally soothing and relaxing. In a way, it's very persuasive and makes you feel what the producer intended for you to feel from the anime. I personally believe that the ending fits in brilliantly into what you have felt throughout each episode. Such a great influx of feels it makes you dwell into as you recap on what had happened in the episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are not that many main characters to focus on, which is a good thing because once you get too jumbled up with the amount of characters there are, its hard to focus that well on how the story will develop. Although that doesn't always happen, it certainly did not hurt to focus on a select few. This anime had great ties between the character being focused upon each episode and made you want to know more. Still, the satisfaction from each episode remains on the surface and you only need to know what they give you in each episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime a lot. I was ecstatic when I found out that there were more to this series. I could not get enough of the great atmosphere this anime brings. All I can say at this point is if you've read this, then you might as well give this anime a shot. Don't forget to enjoy the small things!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 For being such a great anime.",

            "content": "Art:\r\nThe art of Natsume Yuujinchou is probably the least impressive aspect, which is not to say it isn't impressive. It's simple, soft, and fluid, and there isn't much to pick on about it. The character designs are simple but hardly archetypical, and the individuality of each is accentuated even further by their differentiability.\r\nCharacter(s):\r\nYou would assume the character development of this series is limited to Natsume, as it is episodic in nature and most characters either don't reappear later or are purely fill-in supporting characters that are meant to be stereotypical, average high school students or adult figures. Wrong. In nearly every single episode, 1-2 charactersare introduced, and while most of them never reappear (save for the last episode), each and every one is fleshed out in a realistic, concise, and complete manner. Because of this, they are all given the potential to reappear (if, in fact, they don't cease to exist within the episode they are introduced) and likely do in later seasons (though this is purely speculation, since I've only seen season 1). In addition, Natsume himself evolves throughout the series and is a character that I've grown so fond of that he's become one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Story (I know that seems like an odd combination, but when I sat down to write I couldn't think of a better way to compliment the individual categories than to intertwine them, as they are in the show):\\n\r\nI've tried listening to the OST while simultaneously attempting to read a rather monotonous novel for school, but my mind couldn't help but wander onto simpler, more captivating things. Some tracks caused me to subconsciously contemplate my relationships with others, while some caused silly conversations from the day to resurface in my mind. Overall, even though some songs utilized during more action based scenes contained an almost humorous amount of yokai shouting and other traditional Japanese noisemakings, the OST is absolutely beautiful, and definitely the type that I could listen to stand-alone, without a visual aid to enjoy it.\\n\r\nAdditionally--\\n\r\nThe ending song always filled me with a sense of bittersweet sadness, like a fleeting beauty, reminding me that nothing in this life lasts, that it's only here for a short time, whether we choose to accept that or not, and the only way we can enjoy it to the fullest is to form relationships with others and show everyone kindness. The show as a whole emphasized this through each episodic arc, as well as through Natsume as he grew to love where he was in life and the people who filled him with happiness. The delicate balance of comedy and harsh, yet beautifully executed reality, was fully fledged. Never for a moment did I feel the creators rushed through an episode's emotional aspects in order to further a plot. The main concern was always to make the viewer feel something--sadness, happiness, hope, despair, nostalgia, whatever it may be--and make their own conclusions of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show made me really feel something that not many anime do--it wasn't an acute sense, a \"fangirl\" feeling, that lasted for a few seconds of intense irruption--it was a lasting sense of warmth and connection with the characters and their struggles, and always left me feeling satisfied and full of emotions that were sometimes difficult to explain, but always present and welcomed.\\n\r\nI highly recommend Natsume Yuujinchou to anyone who may be on the fence about watching it.",

The first time I saw this anime I was having doubts about watching this because of the genre shoujo/josei. But I got interested when I saw the other reviews saying that \"this anime is amazing\" etc. and also of having a good rank. So I decided to give it a try and this anime exceeded my expectations.\r\nI fell in love with this anime after watching 2 episodes. This anime will make you laugh hard and touch your heart(cry manly tears). I also liked the characters, the youkais presented at eachepisode. With a span of 24 minutes, I can't believe that sometimes I got to like them. The art is also amazing, simple yet amazing, its shoujo art but it gives tranquility and peaceful atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I definitely enjoyed this anime and I am very glad I saw this. To those people looking for an anime that is peaceful, heartwarming, and also funny then this is definitely a must watch! 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

While the concept isn't unexplored, the calm sort of atmosphere generated by the writers really does a lot of legwork.  The two main characters are both entertaining as hell to watch interact, and Nyanko-sensei is pretty much a barrel of laughs on his own.  I find myself really becoming attached to transient, episodic characters, which I think most episodic anime can't really manage.  It gives me a lot of the same feeling Mushi-shi did, but it's much more comical and seems to take itself less seriously.  Afterhaving completed the first season, I'm most likely going to finish the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime for anyone who likes comedic anime, serene nature scenes, and/or episodic plot structures.",

            "content": "----Story 10/10----\r\nThe story of Natsume is simple yet interesting. The yokai he encounters in each episode has a different story and history to them. It is relaxing and calming in a sense. Some of the yokai just want to get their names back, some has some sort of trouble they want Natsume to help them with, some are more to the dangerous side and has some sort of hatred within them. The story makes you want to know more about the yokai and the people that Natsume meets.\r\n----Art 9/10----\r\nThe art for Natsume Yuujinchou is one of the most simple yet most breathtaking to me. Thebackground uses more soft colours blended together and it just creates a very relaxing feel to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing I love the most is the part after Natsume returns a yokai's name and they just shine, turning into bright lights and disappear. It makes me feel satisfied knowing that they are at peace.\\n\\n\r\n----Sound 9/10----\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Natsume Yuujinchou is great. From the openings and endings to the music that just plays softly in the background. It always fits the situation that is happening. \\n\\n\r\nI love the moment where at the end, everything is finally done and everyone is at peace and they just play a relaxing music in the background as life kind of returns back to normal. It gives you such a nostalgic and calming feeling.\\n\\n\r\n----Character 10/10----\\n\r\nThe characters in Natsume Yuujinchou are all different, there is no one same yokai. Every character has their own personality and differences. They all have their own amazing story and history. Sometimes when the yokai flashbacks you can see what kind of person Reiko was and how the yokai is connected to her. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that every yokai is different makes you want to learn more and more about them and how they become the way they are. The bond between Natsume and the yokai he meets is one of the most interesting things. He somehow shows an understanding towards them and tries his best to help them as he can rather than being scared and running away or trying to seal them like exorcists in the anime. He even forms friendships with some of them, one of the examples is Nyanko-sensei himself.\\n\\n\r\n----Enjoyment 10/10----\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed Natsume Yuujinchou and it is my favourite anime  of all time. I loved the whole anime, from the first episode to the last and I've even rewatched the series a few times!\\n\\n\r\n----Overall 9/10----\\n\r\n I think that if you are looking for something relaxing or calming or just something to watch after a long day of work or intense anime to wind down, Natsume Yuujinchou is perfect. It gives you a sense of satisfaction and relaxation after you finished watching an episode. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the first episode and found it boring, Don't stop there! Give it a chance and continue watching and it will be worth it. You have to know Natsume and his experiences before you can fully get into the anime and it's stories. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is a manga by Midorikawa Yuki who is known for being the author of the movie: Hotarubi no mori e (I recommend too). Natsume contains 6 adaptations in anime, totaling 74 episodes.\r\nmaking a short synopsis, The Takashi (Protagonist), since he was young he was able to see Youkais / Ayakashis, who are basically \"Monsters/Demons\", and since this was too much burden for a child, he ended up having a difficult life and was half isolated of others.\r\nAt one point he inherits from his grandmother the so-called \"Book of Friends.\" and then discovers that she actually shared the same ability to see youkais ashim.\\n\r\nI will not go into the details about the book and his grandmother, because it's more fun to figure out how everything works by watching.\\n\\n\r\nEven the story spinning all the time around the youkais, natsume is also an analysis about humans. It focuses both on the bonds between humans themselves and the bonds between Youkais and Humans.\\n\r\nEvery story you see is well thought out and crafted, and it always seeks to bring a deep message and thus more developmment for the show.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume is that kind of sweet show that will always try its best to make you empathize with everything in it.\\n\r\nevery bit of it brings a sad feeling. But that feeling is at once cozy you know?\\n\r\nAnd so he ends up holding you, Exploring your emotions to the fullest and making them toy all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, Natsume is full of unique and iconic personalities, and this is not just about humans but true for youkais as well.\\n\r\nTakashi does not help the youkais because he has nothing better to do, he helps them because the bond he has with them is strong and very well explored throughout the anime. Enough even for him by himself at risk.\\n\r\nFrom a person who has been forced to move away from almost every human, takashi grows to trust humans once more, as he shares his experiences with those around him, conquering people who become totally dear to him.\\n\r\nThe madara (Nyanko), for example, at first he only has one goal and demonstrates that he could do everything for him, but over time he clings to Takashi and despite his own contradictions, he seems to care more about his mate Takashi), than with the aim of it.\\n\r\nAnother interesting part are the youkais, usually they do not get so much focus out of their respective unique episodes, but they always manage to leave their own mark, each one becomes quite memorable, their internal conflicts, their goals and personalities are all very well thought out and makes it even hard to believe that that character was only there for only 20 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nabout art and animation, Natsume is very simplistic mainly at the beginning, but this serves as a glove pro style anime, this gives you a much more complete immersion of the anime atmosphere, with beautiful designs, wonderful scenery and a beautiful color palette together with a fluid animation (and that improves with the passing of the seasons without losing the original essence).\\n\r\nNatsume has the best openings and endings I've ever heard, and I'm not just talking about the song itself but its lyrics, all instrumental composition, everything is done in detail to stay in a beautiful harmony with all elements of the anime, making you create an even greater affection throughout history.\\n\\n\r\nWell is basically this, if you want to try, I assure you that it is worth mostly for those who like slice of life and sentimental things.",

            "content": "Okay, I'm going to be real bias here, I find this Natsume Yuujinchou to be a masterpiece. I love youkais. I like paranormal settings. I like characters like Natsume Takashi. I like calming music and endearing moments of the scenes. It's simply lovely and maybe a bit dramatic, but well executed. When watching NY, I can't help but to think about my life and reevaluate it. Yes, there is flaws, but because they are so minor to me, I find the anime overall as charming. Objectively, it probably deserves an 8/10 and probably a 7/10 if youkai isn't your thing. If this isn't enough foryou, I'll go more into details down in the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nStory: To put it simple, it's about Natsume returning Youkai's name from the Book of Friend that his grandmother, Reiko, who binds most of the Youkais she have encountered. Due to the existence of Book of Friend, it is quite dangerous because whoever Youkai's name is in it has to (or should) obey the wielder, in this case, Natsume Takashi (Reiko's grandson). Natsume, however, dislike violence and despite his hate for Youkai, he doesn't want to control or harm them because that is his kind nature. Madara (AKA Nyanko-sensei) becomes Natsume's bodyguard in exchange for his promise that if Natsume ever dies, Madara could get the Book of Friend. Fortunately, there is no binding contract between because Natsume is already returning name's so it would kind of contradicts his very nature if he does it to Madara. There promise is purely word to word. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Too charming. Even though, it is meant for shoujo (little to adolescent girls), something about it just draws me in. The art working is definitely unique and I have yet to find any similar art like Natsume Yuujinchou other than the author's other works. The animation felt fluid and feels like it goes along the pace nicely. Ever watch and like Spirited Away and/or My Neighbor Totoro, I guess, if anything, Studio Ghibli would probably be the closes to similarity to NY.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Too good. From all of the past seasons to the current. I don't know how they do it, but opening and endings are always befitting to the title and background music and effects is where this anime really lit off. When there is a chill of dreadfulness, you'll hear it. When it is peaceful, you'll hear it. When it is festive and happy, you'll hear it. The sounds are really too good to be true, except that it is true. Appropriate and unique for certain moments and times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fully detailed with lots of backstory and history of the main character, Natsume Takashi. Actually, maybe a bit too much. While, I don't mind a lot of backstory and history of Natsume Takashi, I really wish they dive in more about Madara because I feel like since Nyanko-sensei is the second most on scene of the anime, a little more about \"him\" would be interesting. For instance, how did he got sealed and stuff. But otherwise, the only thing lacking from majority characters is that they need more backstory and history. I'm really glad they did one for Taki even if it's just a little bit. I kind of wish a bit more about Tanuma. I am glad that Natori has more appearance of lately.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think I have watched NY, at least, 5 times already. And I plan to watch it again very soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's an excellent watch and I would recommend to anybody that likes youkai, in general, and if you are kind of a loner or an outcast, I think you would be able to relate to Natsume really well because I know I did.",

It's not the type of anime I usually look forward, and honestly I don't remember why I started it, but I don't regret it. There is everything, all the human emotion (even if it's trough non-human characters). I cried and smiled a lot, all in simplicity. No big drama, just the simplicity of feelings, the simplicity of life. \r\nIt's a anime you can watch at any age, and it just reach you. \r\nAnd the \"plus\" of it : you learn about youkai and japonese society in the same time. \r\nI truly recommend thosewho don't look forward complex stories, but still deep one.",

            "content": "I was very hesitant on writing a review for this show because I felt as though my words couldn't express how beautiful, thought provoking, and emotional this series was. But here I am finally writing a review. This show seems to be very underrated because nobody I ask has seen it before. Anyway on with the review. \r\nStory: The story is about a boy named Natsume Takashi who could see yokai all his life, and when he inherits his grandmother, Natsume Reikos', \"Book of Friends\" he finds out that they both had the ability to see yokai. Now Natsume and his \"bodyguard\" Madara tries toreturn all of the names in the book to the yokai who had owned it. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode Natsume, and Madara run into a new yokai and is asked to do something for the yokai. Whether it be returning their name or asking for help with something. It might seem like a very simple story, and it is but Natsume Yuujinchou is really about the relationships between humans and yokai as well as learning to understand them and live with them. Each episodes has a meaning or a lesson that doesn't feel forced but the complete opposite, you accept it wholeheartedly. It might be sad, bittersweet, or heartwarming but those different aspects is what makes this show so great.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is different from your typical anime and it fits extremely well with the anime. It can be funny at times, and it can be downright beautiful as well. The way the world is drawn is absolutely beautiful and vibrant. The characters aren't too realistic but are drawn to fit perfectly with the vibe of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: My words can't really do justice to how beautiful the soundtrack is. It is so calming and soothing and it really fits extremely well with events that happen in the show. The music is never out of place and is an absolute joy to listen to. Even the opening and the endings are fantastic. If I had a sound track for this anime I would be able to listen to it all day. The music is really an experience of its own. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All the characters in this show are lovable and well developed, and the show really handles the growth of Natsume as a character very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe Yokai's are all very different and it makes watching Natsume and Madara learn, help, and bond with these different characters an absolute joy. Many of these yokai have beautiful, tragic, sad, and very interesting back stories which keeps you coming back to see or learn more about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I cannot tell you how much I have re-watched this show. It is an absolute joy to watch through and through, over and over again. I love the themes, the message, and the sheer beauty that Natsume Yuujinchou has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although no anime is ever perfect I want to say that this is perfection. It is an anime that can keep me entertained, intrigued, emotionally attached, and it has made me feel many different emotions that no other anime has made me go through. Everyone should watch or give this anime a try.",

I'm re-watching this anime this year (all the seasons) and it's my fourth time, but i still cry at most episodes. It seems like a simple plot, and simple characters, but it is sooooo special. Natsume is so great, he's such a sweetie, you can't help but love him. Nyanko-sensei is funny, and I can't imagine the anime without him. Reikois my favorite character, she's strong and complex and nice, despite how she act sometimes. And she only has a few scenes!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this anime is one of my all time favorites, 10/10, and i cant wait to re-watch it next year!",

All of these yoki are either after the book of friends or want their name book which Natsume happily gives back to them.  Natsume has had a rough life.  He is able to see spirits and yoki, because of this everyone treats him different.  After his parents death at an early age he has lived and moved from family to family due to them not being able to care for him.Natsume meets Madara which says he's after the book of friends but is almost like a guardian of sorts for Natsume.  This story follows Natsume and his quest to figure out who he is and what he believes in.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is wholesome, beautiful, and yet sad.  Natsume has an extremely hard time making friends and keeping them.  I can't imagine being in this situation and having to speak to spirits and yoki while still trying to maintain to the human side that you are a sane individual.   \\n\\n\r\nWhy I love this story:  I enjoyed this anime because even though at times it was slow paced there was always some meaning to every part of what is going on or will happen.  The story continues on into more seasons and plays out very nicely.  I loved the characters and enjoyed how they all played some role in Natsume's life or his quest to find himself and why he has the book of friends.",

            "content": "I'm not sure how to describe this anime. I certainly did not get into it right away, after the first season I was unsure I would continue, but I'm very glad I did. I've seen all 4 seasons, and for me this is a very special show. There are very few things I watch and later feel significantly impacted by them. Natsume Yuujinchou in particular has a very unique impact on the viewer. I can say that you will either get it or you won't, simple as that.  The only definite way I could describe this anime is in abstract concepts. It drags outvery complicated emotions by doing very little, other than show Natsume experience these subtle emotions without even saying so or changing his expression. It's like the feeling you get when you listen to a beautifully sad, but familiar song. The subtle feeling of loneliness that exists in simple goodbyes. The momentary awe at a simple act of kindness from a stranger. Sounds very cheesy and all, but the show reminds the viewer of these passing emotions, the ones that we sometimes forget about. \\n\\n\r\nOn a less serious note, the show's pretty funny. I mean, one of the main characters is a cat who's favorite past time is drinking. What's not to like? \\n\\n\r\n Like many other reviews have stated it's plot is very simple and the only overarching plotline is learning more of Natsume's past and his progressing character development. Season 1 is likely the most ordinary of the seasons. It demonstrates its simplicity and contains an overall wholesome 13 episodes.  If you find you like the show (even if its only a little bit) after season one, I definitely recommend you continue. The show only gets better with age. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: I will admit, it isn't the most exciting anime. It's the emotions and characters that latch onto you. Almost all of the episodes have an fascinating story following a yokai, covering all kinds of topics and genres. Lost love, unfinished business, nature, betrayal, master and servant quarrels, confused children, death, etc.  Natsume is usually tasked with assisting the yokai in whatever problem they're having.  Each of the yokai's stories are interesting to hear about, and occasionally you see a bit of Natsume's sad childhood or bits from the life of his grandmother.   \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the story is the sheer versatility in the yokai he encounters. One episode you could be seeing some sweet tale of a yokai losing an item and the next a yokai is about to eat someone. The show overall has a sweet tone, in story, art, and even in its music, but there are a few of the yokai that are legitimately frightening. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 because the art just fits so well with the anime itself? Lots of light, gentle tones and colors. Even the dark colors don't seem all that dark, I'm not entirely sure how they pull it off. It's like the artists lines were drawn with a lighter touch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 though this is more of a personal peeve rather than a critical one.  I dislike Nyanko-Sensei's voice and sometimes find his character annoying because of it. The voice isn't a bad choice either, very good voice acting, its just he just has the standard comic relief character sound. -1 point as personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Natsume is one of the most wholesome and pure characters I've ever seen. He doesn't even come off as such really, especially in the first season, but by the end of the show you can't help but see him as a literal saint. He's not a very expressive character, but the range of emotions he goes through is one of the major high points of the show. Such little things have profound emotions tied to them when it comes to Natsume. \\n\\n\r\nI like Nyanko-Sensei, though I initially thought about quitting in the first few episodes because I found his character annoying at first. He really is quite funny. Most people don't have this problem, he's typically considered the favorite character by most, but if you run into it then all I can say is he grows on you quickly. Probably.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume's friends are all great characters as well. One of my few complaints is that some of the other human characters aren't in the show enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this anime so much. I get the urge to rewatch it fairly often. I've already rewatched it once. Such little things will make me want to watch it again, I swear. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime probably isn't for everyone. Some won't find it entertaining enough and maybe you'll find the cheesy departing words after each episode just a little too sappy for your tastes. Regardless, you must at least try it. I know I will remember this show many, many years from now and recall it fondly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Much different from most of which I had been watching recently. Every episode left me with a sense of peace, a warm and fuzzy feeling within my heart.\r\n The plot was alright, nothing particularly amazing about it. The art was not outstanding but more than alright. However, the sound was outstanding. Simple, but fitting. It was the kind of music that you would put on after a long, hard day to relax. The type of music that one would use to fall asleep peacefully.Characters were nothing too special, they were alright. Unselfish guy trying to protect everyone, even the youkai which he says he's always wished he had never seen. Enjoyment is obvious if it gives one that warm and fuzzy feeling inside. So, overall, I would say this anime was great. Not outstanding, but noticeable. The perfect way to end a day, to just watch a few episodes. Or, you could easily finish this in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nStory(8)\\n\r\nArt(9)\\n\r\nSound(10)\\n\r\nCharacter(8)\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9)\\n\r\nOverall(9)",

It had great character development and sad moments that tears will fall. Each and every Ayakashi Natsume met were unique and are great characters. Almost every episode features a different Ayakashi. and in time, Natsume's book of friendsslowly thinned(not really), but his friends slowly increased. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a truly heart warming story that is fantasy yet serious at the same time. It showed us great friendships throughout the story. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime is one of the best. \\n\\n\r\nSo give it a try and see if you like it or not. Oh and, remember to watch each season by orders(Don't be like me!). Yup, I watched season 2 first then I realized that it is season 2, not one.",

The anime shows the events that unfold since he moved from the city to a country town to live with his distant relatives due to various circumstances, as well as revealing Natsume's past as he goes through his everyday life. However what makes this anime so great, is possibly simply the atmosphere of the anime itself. The anime is written superbly, the writers are able to create an anime which gives a relaxing feel while watching; as well as being entertaining. The anime does not have a linear plotor goal of any sort, which is rare for its genre of drama. Although it lacks any obvious story-line, it is obvious that after watching this anime, the writers goal was simply to take viewers on a journey through a kind hearted boys life; as he discovers more and more about himself as well has his ability to see spirits which he as always felt burdened by, he discovers that not all spirits are cruel, but some are loving, even more so than those who are living around him.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves much more praise than i am giving it, being able to reach the heart of the viewers with each and every episode. Therefore it would be more than fair to say this anime deserves nothing less than 10/10.",

There is really no actual objective in this anime (Example: trying to find a person etc.) Which in my opinion could make the anime even better, but it's a give and take situation because what it lacks in a plot it makes up in some really detailed scenery. The characters in themselves were simple yet were really nicley drawn. I thought there was a lot of sound, and there really wasn't a lot of main characters, but had a lot of side characters that appereared in only one episode. All in all, this anime waswonderfull, and I loved it so much I finished all 26 episodes in 3 days. o^.^o",

            "content": "Natsume Yuujinchou is from a genre I previously had not tested very much, thinking I wouldn't like the slower pacing of a show like this. However, I was completely, and happily surprised by it.\r\nStory: 9. The story is based around a young high school male named Natsume who can see ayakashi. One day he ends up accidentally breaking a seal on a shrine, releasing an extremely powerful demon... who is trapped in the body of what looks like a Lucky Cat statue. He becomes Natsume's bodyguard, and goes by the term \"Nyanko-sensei,\" helping Natsume in his adventures. Natsume meets and helps a variety of ayakashiand humans.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. Standing by itself, I would typically give this art a nine, but if you look at the later seasons, it just doesn't hold up. However, the art is simply beautiful, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. I don't feel like there are any major problems with the sound, I just wished there was more of a background track in some places, and to be honest I dislike the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9. With so many characters in thirteen episodes, it makes creating the breadth of characters they did truly amazing. I completely respect the creators, and with each character I feel attached and feel they bring something new that I haven't seen before. I love the way characters are animated in this show, and how their facial expressions subtly change. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because many of the male characters look extremely feminine.... a bit interesting but... makes the variation lack somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. I love this show, I really do. There's something that made me not enjoy it nearly as much as I do other things, to be honest, and that was a friend of mine complaining through it the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8. I recommend this show to every single person who likes anime. It's gorgeous, the story is wonderful, and the more I watch, the more I love. Definitely continue on with the other three seasons if you like it, because Natsume is worth it.",

Each episode is pretty much self contained though  some of the characters appear in other stories its never really major. So while the synopsis will have you believe that Natsume is bound to this book and trying hard to return all these names to spirits  its not really the case. He meets spirits along the way and willingly or reluctantly he decides to help them out with their problems. Every story issad in one way or another but they're usually resolved with happy endings. All are unique and very heart warming.\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for romance and am always looking for it in anime and  unfortunately this has none. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation :7\\n\r\nIt's very simple and clean.Nothing is ever too detailed or beautiful but you can tell this  had a strict budget so they used a lot of color to mask it and it works. It solid art and animation but nothing mind blowing. Character designs is pretty average unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nOP is weak. ED is different from what I'm used to but I really liked it. All the VA is solid and while the actual songs aren't memorable they work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nMost characters are nothing special but the spirits are definitely the highlight of the anime. As well as having their own stories they have a lot of personality to them. In my opinion they are the main attraction of the entire anime. You don't really care about Natsume returning the names or his future but the stories of all the spirits and how sad or amazing the next one is going to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nWhile it's the actual stories that drive the anime, the production side of things hold me back from giving it an 9 or 10. I love music, its a big part of anime in my opinion and so is the animation and art. Sadly both of them don't stand out in this anime. If neither of those things matter to you and you're into anime strictly for story Natsume Yuujinchou will not disappoint its a great anime especially for anyone looking for something a little different and relaxing.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been in love with Japan for a long time and supernatural series is one of my most favorite genres of all so Japanese Folklore is really one of my addictions. It\u2019s not only scary but more importantly, it has unexplainable sophistication to it. Among the folklores stories I\u2019ve encountered, the Japanese is the most interesting, very knowledgeable, exciting, mysterious, and you can really see the Japanese pride on it.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nJapanese Folklore is one of the commonly used elements in supernatural series. Well, that\u2019s granted because manga and anime are JAPANESE. However, only very few can really showcase the greatnessof this type of genre. Some would be too scary and some would be too boring. The plot can be considered as clich\u00e9 but how it\u2019s reinvented is no doubt amazingly done. It is somewhat episodic so every new episode comes with so much excitement and anticipation. The supernatural element is done nicely so it is not scary to the point of being over the top because if it\u2019s too much, the mysteriousness will lose its greatness and would be just SCARY alone. Much like how Mushishi was done. The scary and creepy part is not overwhelming the mystery part which I think is very important because supernatural should not always be necessarily horror. It\u2019s more on the mystery of it which makes it very interesting. The drama is not overly done and can be really touching. You could say every element of the story is well-balanced so the result is one amazing story. But more than being exciting, every story is heart-warming, touching, and inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting; be it humans or supernatural beings. The assortment of supernatural creatures whether they are bad or good are very interesting which make the story very exciting. I really love the character of Natsume\u2019s Grandmother, Reiko, who started all and the one responsible why there is a story in the first place. Instead of hating herself, she finds a way to help the creatures which make her much stronger than Natsume. And even though she acts like she\u2019s putting a fight with the creatures and collects their names, the truth is, she\u2019s actually helping them that shows how much she treasures the beings in that world. While Natsume\u2019s is gradually accepting the supernatural beings, they are also gradually learning that not all humans are bad.\\n\\n\r\nAbout MADARA/NYANKO-SENSEI\\n\r\nNyanko-sensei is one of the best characters in my list and of course, one of the cutest. He is so hilarious with all of his antics. Though, he started with motives on why he approaches Natsume, he also gradually gets fond of him. Throughout the series, he would often say that he\u2019s just using Natsume but deep down, he already cares a lot for him. I just love their unique yet complicated relationship. Because of their relationship, Natsume learns to love the other world and Nyanko-sensei gets fond of the human beings as well.\\n\\n\r\nAbout NATSUME TAKASHI\\n\r\nNatsume\u2019s character is probably one of the most clich\u00e9 types. However, this type of character is always a sure hit because it is always inspiring to see characters that started off with hating themselves because of their difference from others but throughout the series learns to accept it. He is weak at the beginning and very alone because of his abilities but improves a lot as the story progresses. Instead of considering his abilities as a curse, I am so glad that he learns to consider it as a gift. Because hating ones true self is like denying who you really are. He finally finds joy in the world different from most people and truly treasures it which I think the very reason why his character gradually improves and so he gets stronger and stronger as the episodes goes by. And that\u2019s not just physically but more importantly his whole being as well.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\\n\r\nThe animation is nice and the illustration of the supernatural beings might be somewhat common but it still made as original as possible and very nice. The landscapes are also great. Hiroshi Kamiya is perfect for the character\u2019s voice. He is so amazing when it comes to monologues and delivering very nice lines. The great sounds make the series even more amazing. It becomes a lot more heart-warming and touching, most especially the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nNow, who said serious supernatural series can\u2019t be fun at the same time? You will have mix emotions watching this series. You will laugh, cry, be scared, get excited, touch, inspired, and amazed. This is a very good example of an amazing series which resulted from the combination of episodic and supernatural. It doesn\u2019t have a heavy and spectacular plot like those of famous animes but it is no doubt an amazing series which will make you want for more.\\n",
