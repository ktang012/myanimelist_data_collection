            "content": "*No Spoiler Concise Review*\r\nTL;DR: An idiot girl getting into endless shenanigans that keeps viewers just laughing till their precious buttocks fall off.\r\n[Story: 4/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 9/10]\r\nWhat is Aho Girl? What isn't Aho girl? Should I even watch this anime? If you think this anime looks stupid and the premise you've read on MAL sounds dumb then you are even more of an \"Aho\" than the main girl is in this anime. Seriously, Aho Girl (Idiot Girl) is your classic boke and tsukkomi style comedy with plenty of slapstick. If you just want to turn off your brain and laughyour ass off, this is definitely that show. I have never seen so much savagery in anime. The brutality is absolutely barbaric. It's just gag after gag after gag. One of the best 15 minute ab workout ever. Your sides will hate you but they will thank you. \\n\\n\r\nThis is your classic yin-yang sort of anime where the characters and the story directly compliments each other. One can't live without the other. Though there are numerous characters introduced as the anime goes on, the main characters are, Yoshiko, a masochist idiot beyond all belief, and her childhood crush A-Kun, a genius sadist beyond all belief. Every time Yoshiko's idiosyncrasies rises to a peak, A-Kun brutally punches it down to normalize the situation. It is this exchange of quit pro quo that makes this anime so hilarious.  Even though viewers might feel bad for Yoshiko because of all the sufferings she endures due to her stupidity. However, she's literally the anthropomorphized genderbent version of Patrick Star. Not to mention she deserves every bit of it. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode consists of few short gags. Even though you know it will feature some sort of idiotic stunt from the MC, needless to say, each gag remains fresh despite reusing running joke here and there. As the show goes on, we are introduced to various side characters ranging from Yandere Killer Mom to Tsundere Lewd President to Kuudere Dumb Sister to Overtly Charismatic Doge. At first they appear smart however as the show goes everyone but A-kun slowly becomes an idiot. There's a popular fan theory from avid manga readers that it's all A-Kun's fault. He sucks the intelligence out of everyone around him. He has like a 20 foot radius that sucks away at least 50 points of intelligence from everyone who enters. True or False, well that's for you to decide. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art & animation in this anime is pretty good. The studio did great justice to this anime despite it being an anime short. It's beautifully hand drawn and all the characters somehow stand out from one another. Not just the character design, the seiyuus in this anime heightened the enjoyment factor even more. Specifically the seiyuu of Yoshiko. She did a fantastic job. The OP and ED songs are funny and compliments the comedy style of this anime. The background score didn't stand out much but that can be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are looking for a short anime with endless comedy gags with no clear story or plot but just laughter, then this anime is for you. It's slightly lewd, slightly dramatic but over the top comedy. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how great your abs look from all that laughter. \\n\\n\r\nBtw, did you know that \"Baka\" and \"Aho\" are synonyms. People who live in the eastern half of central Japan (Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba) generally use Aho whilst rarely using Baka when serious. This is reversed in the western half of Japan, (Osaka, Kyoto,) resulting in some minor arguments between Tomins (Capital Citizens) and Osakans.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "Hidden beneath the antics, the one-liners, and the pop culture references, Aho Girl\u2019s goal is obvious even to the untrained eye; it desires your attention. \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d Aho Girl screams, waving its arms and jumping about in a frenzied, excessive, and desperate manner. In doing so, this show has managed to not only work but endear itself to the audience as well. Quite a few seasonal viewers have been smitten over this show and, at first glance, it\u2019s easy to see why. Aho Girl is energetic. It\u2019s straightforward. And it\u2019s occasionally charming. However, Aho Girl is also painful to watch.\r\nFirst andforemost, this show is simply not funny. For Aho Girl, which largely subdues its aesthetics in an effort to emphasize its writing, this is a severely damaging flaw. Aho Girl fancies itself an extravagant comic extraordinaire yet it never fully ventures into the absurd; it\u2019s as if Aho Girl is frightened of abandoning its slice-of-life roots and as a result is rather hesitant of displaying signs of vivaciousness. The instances where its comic genius sparks to life are memorable in their own right (the homage to the Power Rangers, in particular) but they are few and far between. It hardly helps that Aho Girl, like most mediocre comedies, is obsessed with explaining the jokes to you; with every act of mischief, there\u2019s not only a character (read: the \u201cself-insert\u201d) elaborating on the details of said act but there are also occasional cues from Aho Girl itself that tell you how the act was intended to be funny. As this show can attest to, even comedies can be guilty of infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, Aho Girl is engaged in a war against common sense. This is a show that prides itself in its intentional stupidity; for Aho Girl, lapses in judgment and instances of in-the-moment logic are par for the course. A carefree attitude and general acts of silliness are a major source of this show\u2019s appeal. That said, Aho Girl underwhelms when it attempts a serious approach; it\u2019s as if the show doesn\u2019t understand its audience. Most viewers appreciate Aho Girl because of its slapstick humor, because of the amusing eyecatches, because of its short runtime and, yes, because of the fanservice. I doubt that these viewers picked up Aho Girl for the half-baked, insipid, and monotonous moments of insight that ultimately result in little but wasted time. These moments of insight are not only executed poorly but their suitability is subpar; Aho Girl tends to observe the most trivial matters, like a low score on a quiz, and overexert itself when it should be focusing on the more important problems, like the abusive relationship at the center of it all.\\n\\n\r\nEvery problem that arises from Aho Girl stems from the disastrous dynamic between its protagonists; it\u2019s the repugnant elephant in the room that Aho Girl\u2019s fanbase has condoned, glossed over, neglected, and outright ignored at times. The cast members are defined by a single trait but no cast member has as damaging a trait as Akuru Akutsu (the \u201cself-insert\u201d) and Yoshiko Hanabatake (the show\u2019s poster girl). Yoshiko\u2019s defining trait is idiocy while Akuru\u2019s is anger; while Yoshiko compensates for her lack of intellect with a can-do attitude, Akuru offers little outside of his constant rage. There have been plenty of characters similar to Akuru, like Last Exile\u2019s Alex Row, that have provided substance, versatility and growth to their cast beyond their brooding tendencies and hair-trigger temper. Akuru, however, is feeble in comparison; he makes little effort to express himself beyond screaming matches and physical abuse. When he encounters a problem, Akuru explodes. When his friend attempt helping him, Akuru becomes spiteful; he insults, he torments, he belittles, he punches, he kicks, and he hurls expletives at his friends simply because he perceives them as annoying. Sure, Akuru apologizes once in a while but he never bothers to change. Honestly, why should he? The other cast members, specifically Yoshiko, and Aho Girl itself by proxy have long since accepted this as rational behavior. That the show has treated Akuru\u2019s abusive tendencies as a gimmick, that the show\u2019s fanbase has little reaction to it, is sickening to me.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a place in this world for Aho Girl, where it can exist without scrutiny of any sort. Aho Girl has established itself and thrived in GIFs, in Vines, in reaction videos, in memes and in the Weird Side of YouTube. It is there that Aho Girl\u2019s positive traits can flourish. However, under any sort of analysis, Aho Girl not only leaves you unsatisfied but more than a little repulsed as well. This show, allergic to depth and disgusted by morality, is at best mildly amusing and at worst one of the biggest disgraces of a thoroughly mediocre season. Aho Girl makes a spectacle of itself -  presenting faux-meaningful observations; idolizing its vapid female lead; overindulging in panty shots; deploying one tired, overused clich\u00e9 after another (the sister complex, among others); and fishing for attention - while accomplishing absolutely nothing in the end. While its peers in the comedy genre have pushed boundaries, expanded horizons, enlightened its fans, and revolutionized the medium, Aho Girl has contributed little beyond munching on bananas.",

            "content": "Oh boy.. Summer 2017 animes are ending already and it was quite a hustle... From the isekai genre shows like ''In Another World With My Smartphone'' that so many hates about,\r\n,the A-1 pictures version of the Fate series, the gambling-crazy anime Kakegurui, the action packed 2nd season of Boku No Hero Academia, to the romantic anime Koi To Uso, we all have been blessed with so many good shows though there is something missing.. An anime that is mainly focused on humor, laughter or should I say.. The legendary ''Comedy'' genre. There comes the hidden wonder ''Aho Girl''. It looks like an anime version of''Minions'' but focused mostly on the daily high school life of our beloved banana-loving girl Hanabatake Yoshiko and her childhood love but a brutal wrestler who can supplex her everyday because of her stupidity, Akutsu Akuru or simply, A-kun.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nOn my opinion, I prefer stories that goes with the intro, rising, climax, falling then resolution. Thats whats lacking Aho Girl.. Though this anime gives us ''part'' where it has almost all the elements of a perfect plot, though I said ''Almost''. Not everytime. The comedic side though is very superior on this anime which balance the enjoyment of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this anime... The characters sketches are easily aliked to any other animes out there but the action-packed art scenes/effects and the mouth along with the eyes of the characters makes it unique and entertaining. Comedic + Good Art = Worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nHey hey.. They said the opening of the anime is not that good. I'm like ''Am I the only one who loves it?''. Along with the humor side of the opening, its music is preferable to the anime itself to be honest. Then comes the little background music when the shows rolls on stating that this anime will be a high school/laughable anime...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime shows us that even characters that are hard to read like A-kun can be an element to a joke or humor and they did it perfectly along with other characters. All of the characters have their roles on the line from Main to Supporting, which supports the show even more on its genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n9/10 is already pretty high for me. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. A 12-minute anime like Aho Girl, for me, its like already 24 minutes (but I'm begging for more Lmao).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf theres 9.5/10 I could really give this anime that rating. Enjoyable, funny, great art, excellent characters, wrestling supplexes, everything here is almost perfect and I love this show very much.",

            "content": "This time: Aho Girl! Review!\r\n12 episodes, each is around 12 minutes. Each episode is split into 3 or 4 smaller parts.\r\nNow, Aho Girl doesn't have any story, it contains random unrelated stories which are funny with different characters from the cast.\r\nIt was pretty funny at the beginning, and I even wanted full 24 minutes episodes, but..... Somewhere in the middle I felt like I'm already done with Aho Girl. It became a lot less funny, and many of the jokes repeated themselves.\r\nAt one point new characters were introduced, and which felt to me too much. I liked the original cast and now that half ofthe scenes are focused on Yoshiko and other random characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Aho Girl is simple- Yoshiko, the main character, is stupid (Well, \"Aho\") and does nothing but play around. She doesnt study and doesnt even care about it. She thinks everybody loves her and basically... she acts like a 4 years old girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yea it was funny at first, but then again, it just becomes repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to take all the stories together and give them a score, 5/10 would fit.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7/10 as nothing too special, but it wasn't unappealing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10. Nothing worth remembering, neither the OP or the OST (if there even was one)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've already described Yoshiko, but all the characters repeat the same pattern. While they are pretty funny in the beginning (because you have yet to see they follow the same pattern over and over again). \\n\\n\r\nYou already know the pattern from episode one (or the first episode every character is introduced).\\n\\n\r\nI'll confess, because there aren't any character complexity  nor development, nor story, I can't really say much about this anime. You can try it, as it was funny at the beginning, but... Don't hope too much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment+Overall: 7/10. Thank you for your time.",

            "content": "Sometimes, silly actions can make us laugh, stupid comments are hilarious, unexplained decisions are funny, but it isn't the case of Aho Girl. I wonder if the author respects women or not. \r\nThe story, a stupid girl Yoshiko with a brain of the size of a monkey that has some attention disorder illness. She takes stupid decisions all the time and tries to capture the \"love\" and interest of Akutsu. Also, she likes bananas, so the author refers to her as a monkey.  She has been near Akutsu since their youth, but this guy incomprehensibly hates her. Honestly, \u00bfisn't that fun?  We willlaugh in some scenes, I can't deny that some of them are funny but others no. Is like seeing a mentally ill person doing any stupid thing and someone will punch that person, and we end laughing for that actions. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't funny seeing a guy beating a woman all the time, he hits Yoshiko, insults her, minimizes her and even compares her to a piece of filth. And that doesn't end there he does similar actions to her mom, Yoshie that is desperate to give her daughter to the first person that appears nearby, in this case, Akutsu. It isn't funny seeing a progression like this. It will be funnier if Akutsu tries helping the poor soul of Yoshiko by all means in a similar case as with his sister and ends failing. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, what can I say? It is a monkey as described in the show (Yoshiko) vs. and orangutan (that arrogant guy one). The other characters are forced, like Yoshiko's friends and appear in a very useless way. To add some competition for her, the author just added another female from her school that falls in love for Akutsu. \\n\\n\r\nUpdate recent episodes:  In the last episodes, I noticed that if you remove Akutsu from the story, the show will go from bad to abysmal. The story failed entirely in being a balanced and real comedy. The show can't make people laugh without the abusive orangutan around. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice over, \u00bfwhat happened Aoi? You are better than this. Honestly, she isn't the voice for Yoshiko. The character needs to yell too much, and she ends doing a pinch that gets annoying because she uses a high pinch and can't maintain it regularly so ends pushing harder and the tone isn't balanced.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art, it is normal. We aren't seeing any master piece here, but your eyes aren't going to suffer from it either.  The songs are good. The OP has a good rhythm. The sound, in general, is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I am sure that a lot of persons will love this kind of shows and I can't argue with them. I am neutral and will end watching it because I am hoping that Akutsu will change his actions or that Yoshiko could hit this orangutan.\\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while, there is that anime that you just keep watching without knowing why you are doing it but you're still enjoying it so much and Aho Girl is just like that for me. I started the anime out reluctant to do it as I felt it was going to be stupid and mediocre but I sure was wrong.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is nothing special. The story follows Yoshiko, a girl extremely stupid you'll feel stupid yourself just watching her, and her every day life with her childhood friend, A-kun. She is always doing something stupid and he is always trying to stopher. She also adds suffering to the life of the rest of her friends.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is normal for an anime like it. I can see them making the most out of their budget, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme is somewhat catchy. There isn't much to say about the sound considering most of the background music is like something you'd find in Youtube video about comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nAll characters are cliched in their personality but they are extreme in it. Yoshiko is a free-spirited, stupid girl but taking it to the extreme. A-kun is the aggressive character that's forced to put up with the stupidity of Yoshiko but he is missing a machine gun.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI haven't laughed as hard since Konosuba. This anime is pretty hilarious and would just make you laugh pretty much the whole time. As always, comedy as subjective so what I might be laughing at, another person might find unfunny. It's all a matter of preferences and personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAho Girl isn't some kind of perfect anime that has great narrative, interesting story, deep characters, breathtaking art, or best soundtrack in history but it is something you watch when you're free an wanna have a good laugh. I'd recommend it to any comedy fans and just casuals that wanna try something funny. It should NOT be taken seriously or you might not enjoy it at all. Overall, you just need to pause your brain for the 12 minutes in every episodes and enjoy it no matter how weird it seemed.",

            "content": "Aho girl is, despite the title, not actually an idiotic show. Yoshiko, the titular girl of the show, loves bananas, she loves Akutsu, and she loves playing around. She is also absolutely imbecilic, managing to consistently get 0's on every test in school. Yet she has a certain charm to her, and a devious insight into the behaviour of those around her, that sometimes make you wonder whether she's really stupid or just sees the world very differently from everyone else.\r\nAkutsu on the other hand is a thoroughly disagreeable fellow, he's very smart and has a punch that can knock out anyone. Most of thetime he's punching Yoshiko (in a gender equality kind of way which would make Kazuma of Konosuba proud).  The setup for many of the early jokes in the series relies on this dichotomy between Yoshiko and Akutsu. Yet the series quickly moves on to bigger and greater things. It parodies shounens, racing anime (the sequence which parodies Initial D is absolutely spot on), and most other genres under the sun. Even if you haven't seen the shows which it parodies, your enjoyment of it is hardly going to suffer. Aho Girl doesn't hold its punches, and toys around with all kinds of situational comedy, parody in general, as well as more down to earth humor about the human condition.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that loves poking fun at others, but does so with a conscious nod to the genres it parodies. Not unlike One-Punch Man, the love toward the genres it makes fun of is ever-present. More than anything, the very short format of the series (12 minute episodes as compared to the 25 minute episodes of normal shows) makes for an absolute blast when watching Aho Girl. Any given episode usually has 2-4 stories in it, meaning even if one segment might not be in your taste, you're sure to get something wildly different within minutes.\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything, Aho Girl is FUN. The jokes are often on point, the shenanigans of Yoshiko, the depraved nature of Fuuki Inchou, the long-suffering nature of Akutsu, the sweet nature of Sayaka who inexplicably agrees to most of the shenanigans, and the constant failures of Ruri, Akutsu's Aho sister, all plays into the manic nature of Aho Girl. This is a comedy show that's perfect to watch while eating, on the subway, or when you're bored. It is probably the most unexpectedly good show of the season it was released in and an absolute blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any cohesive narrative and some segments less interesting nature notches the show down a bit, but I would gladly recommend this show to anyone looking for a laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl gets a well deserved 8/10",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe banana is sometimes considered one of nature\u2019s most amazing creations.\r\nCommonly produced. Comes in bunches. Easy to hold. Sweet taste. Biodegradable packaging. Penchant for comedy. Not since the apple has there been such a fruit, such a food that has given humans so much with so little.\r\nWhile people love bananas, nobody loves them as much as Yoshiko of Aho Girl. And, while she may have less brains than one of these yellow-wrapped fruits, she upstages their comedic value with her own brazen stupidity.\r\nSTORY\r\nAt roughly thirteen minutes per episode, Aho Girl has only so much timeto get its audience laughing. The show knows this dilemma, and so it delivers unto them a near constant stream of comedy that does not stop for nearly its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this comedy revolves around Yoshiko, the titular character of this project and quite possibly the dumbest person to ever exist. Ever. That\u2019s not a slight against her. Everyone in the show agrees with this statement, and Yoshiko herself couldn\u2019t care less what others think about her let alone what they do for and around her.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads directly into what Aho Girl showcases.\\n\\n\r\nIt loves its loudness. Yoshiko and the others did not learn about the concept of inside voices, so their exchanges quite quickly devolve into shouting matches. Admittedly, some people may be put off by the obnoxious yelling throughout the season, especially from the banana-pining girl who elevates her voice when even remotely excited. But such high energy supercharges the mundane events depicted, giving them a comedic push down the right path.\\n\\n\r\nSlapstick never goes away. Yoshiko\u2019s vacant noggin equates to weakened pain receptors, so she often succumbs to many a bruising and a beating both of her own accord and at the hands of Akutsu. Of course, everyone involved punches, kicks, and tackles without remorse. From the three gyaru girls simultaneously punching the lovable idiot to Yoshie duking it out with Iinchou, the physical comedy complements the loudness with ease.\\n\\n\r\nThe idiocy does not falter. The events seem normal at first, but Yoshiko\u2019s arrival, words, or mere existence twist the dial of intelligence down to zero. She plays hide-and-seek for days on end. Akutsu and Dog bond over a particular movie scene. Yoshie must confirm Sayaka\u2019s purity while revealing too much information about her own person. In other words, the show is stupid not in a negative sense but in a purposefully ridiculous one, further improving the overall hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl also makes small decisions here and there that help guide the show along. Its scenes split up into distinct parts with a small amount of crossover and callbacks to make the stream of comedy that much more digestible. Moreover, the show also varies up its content as much as it can, like when Yoshiko disguises as the male Yoshio to cheer up their teacher or that time where the group go on summer vacation filled with a couple of ecchi escapades.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, nothing within the anime is exactly novel. But that doesn\u2019t stop its loudness, its slapstick, and its idiocy from giving this comedy anime its clout.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl continues its strong execution with an appreciable set of visuals.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, due to the time constraint, the show makes use of its opening track\u2019s frames to deliver even more comedy. They almost always change the setup: Iinchou looking longingly at Akutsu, Sayaka acting as an angel in a play, a flurry of Yoshiko faces that fill the entire screen. Small stuff really, but these constant changes give the audience something to look forward to at the start of every episode rather than the same tired montage.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the anime includes elements that continue down its comedic path. Lots of speed lines accentuate the characters\u2019 yelling and crazy actions. Missing pupils give them their \u201cdead\u201d looks after a kerfuffle of any kind. A cheerful banana censors out any particularly ecchi displays. And the various imaginative sequences, like a giant Banana Froppeccino Deluxe floating in the sky, a flurry of hearts as Yoshiko jumps in for a kiss, or a manga-like style as she races a motorbike rider while riding Dog herself, change up the often-lacking background artistry.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation in general remains involved throughout the season, too, lending further credit to its strong execution. This direction is thanks mostly to the constant brawls, reactions, and situations the group normally find themselves in and make for each other.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Aho Girl does not perform as well when it comes to the designs of its characters. While the cast members often just wear their unassuming garb for school, their somewhat same-face looks \u2013 especially when yelling all big mouthed and wide eyed \u2013 reduce variety in their potential depictions the most. It also does not help that their colors and looks in general do not go for anything too striking.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, those fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and noticeable movements keep the anime going strong despite the designs not quite stacking up.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs purely a comedy anime, the characters of Aho Girl focus first and foremost on, well, comedy. They toss aside complexity and say to themselves, \u201cLet\u2019s get the audience smiling with our strangeness.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMany of those smiles come from Yoshiko herself. It cannot be overstated how dumb she is. She has next to zero attention span, has little care for consequences, and has no desire to do anything except what she deems as in-the-moment fun.\\n\\n\r\nThus, she does not pick up on even the most normal of societal cues, leading to her raucous behavior no matter where she is or what she is doing. It may mean running all the way to a farmer\u2019s farm X kilometers away just to tell him that she likes his produce, or it could be the case that she pukes from eating one banana too many after declaring that she cannot eat another. Either way, Yoshiko refuses to follow the norm, and, for this reason, she improves the comedy present without fail.\\n\\n\r\nWhen she isn\u2019t playing dolls a little too realistically with the local kids at the park, she often spouts backwards logic that somehow, someway makes sense in her signature lunacy. Most importantly, Yoshiko desensitizes the audience to and accentuates the strange traits of the other cast members. Akutsu\u2019s standoffish personality. Iinchou\u2019s stalking tendencies. Yoshie\u2019s psychotic mindset (like mother, like daughter). If nothing else, Dog is literally smarter than her, giving his scenes an actual basis besides just being more aware than usual as a pet animal.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, Yoshiko\u2019s relationships create even more comedic opportunities. Ruri is sadly an idiot like Yoshiko on certain levels, so Yoshiko tries to bond with her fellow moron whenever she can. Ryuuichi looks up to her as his boss, going from a delinquent to a dude who just wants to hang out with some friends. And Sayaka, the most regular person of the whole group, offsets Yoshiko\u2019s overbearing asides, but even she breaks down on occasion around her friend, the contrast inviting another round of funnies.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters are simple. But that fits Aho Girl perfectly. And, at the end of the day, they follow through on what they had in mind. Which means that it\u2019s tough to ask for much more out of them.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe anime packs in as much fun into its audio design as it can.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Aho Girl wouldn\u2019t be Aho Girl without its, well, \u201caho\u201d girl. To this end, Aoi Yuuki as Yoshiko deserves a ton of props for her lead role as the twin-tailed weirdo. If she isn\u2019t passed out on the floor after taking a punch to the face, she\u2019s yelling as much as possible, creating an annoying yet hilarious voice for the star that doesn\u2019t let up for the show\u2019s whole (and short) run.\\n\\n\r\nTomokazu Sugita as Akutsu also dishes out hilarity with his scathing hatred for his less-than-ideal neighbor, but the opening track \u201cZenryoku\u2606Summer!\u201d brings even more smiles into this sound space. During its one-minute timeframe, it goes all over the place while still following a clear path. Quick lyrical deliveries, differing vocal tones, bongos, the distinct noise of a metal bat hitting a baseball. Combined with the occasional chimes and goofier background sound-effects, the OP forms as a silly, catchy tune that sets the comedic tone for the series without any effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the music, however, doesn\u2019t reach those same hits-a-funny-bone heights. The ending track \u201cOdore! Kyu-kyoku Tetsugaku\u201d is pretty much an afterthought, playing underneath the outro scenes of Aho Girl as a mediocre poppy song. And the original soundtrack \u2013 even with its different meandering, guitar, and classical pieces \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly push forward with a ton of intrigue. It at least doesn\u2019t take anything away from the show, though.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with hilarious VA performances and a just-as-funny OP to back them up, the music and sound for Aho Girl partly accomplishes arguably its most important goal: bringing a sizeable chunk of fun.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a while since I laughed so consistently while watching one specific anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I burst out laughing so much so that it would be unfair of me to list any scenes since they all got me smiling or chuckling. Of course, as a show defined by how funny its characters manage to be, they were the cornerstone to my laughter.\\n\\n\r\nThinking back on the show, I liked all of them. Yoshiko somehow one-upping herself in stupidity constantly. Her mom Yoshie doing everything in her power to only allow Akutsu to hook up with her daughter to secure her future retirement. Dog being a good puppy. Akutsu\u2019s little sister Ruri cutely struggling with life. Iinchou\u2019s flashbacks and flashforwards. Sayaka crying as she barely keeps up with their collective antics. Their teacher Atsuko in the classic Christmas Cake role. The gyaru girls introducing a new angle. Ryuuichi just trying to be buddies with Akutsu. Sure, some are better than others, but they each still got me to laugh a lot all the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found that the anime was the right length for its content. It had some \u201cromance\u201d too which, while leading nowhere tangible, got a thumbs-up from me. And it also hardly ever strayed away from its comedy roots, remaining straightforward and sure of itself. Truth be told, this anime isn\u2019t exactly clever let alone unique \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want it to be any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl no doubt embraces the first half of its title. It\u2019s short. It\u2019s quick. It\u2019s funny. A three-way combo that ensures an entertaining time. While not the banana of this medium, it peels ahead regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, loudness, slapstick, and of course idiocy keep the laughs of this multipart comedy streaming without ever showing any signs of stopping\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and nice actual animation give the visuals strength even if the character designs do not\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Yoshiko is an unintentionally funny girl thanks to her \u201caho\u201d nature, highlighting the strangeness of the other cast members and holding distinct relationships with all of them\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, boisterous VA performances and a silly-sounding OP rise above a mediocre ED and a passable OST\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, have not laughed so much and so consistently in a long while\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

It's silly to the point it's genius like Mr. Bean.\r\nSJWs might find this distasteful as Akuru always hit Yoshiko whenever she pisses him off (most were quiet and find it funny when a female tsunderehits a guy, though).

            "content": "\"Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.\"\r\n      - Robert A. Heinlein\r\nTake that quote, put it in anime form, and crank the \"stupidity\" up to 100. Then multiply that with the most fun you've had in a long time. That's how Aho-Girl was created (literally, the title is exactly what it is). \r\nMany have written this anime off because of the countless number of memes and clips you've seen of it on the internet make it seem like a joke. None of them have given it a fair chance. They don't know what they're missing out on.\r\nStory: 7\r\nOnce upon a time,humanity was cursed by the gods and suffered a terrible fate. That fate was Hanabatake Yoshiko. She and her intricate tactics to overthrow humanity were bound to reign down on the mere mortals below in due time. Thus, it was up to Akutsu Akuru, humanity's knight in shining armor, to put a stop to this.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, that was the dramatic version. In reality, this show is simply about a girl's stupidity and what kind of situations it puts herself and others in. While there is no overarching plot of speak of (except one man's struggle to stop her terror), each episode contains a few small, generally self-contained stories, that provide a stage for all the wacky antics we see our characters get themselves into. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAt first glance, the artwork and animation are quite basic. However, as the series progresses and the situations become more wild, the art becomes more distinct and expressive. If a character is mad, they look furious. If a character is shocked, they look distraught. The animation conveys every action and emotion with such fluidity and precision. \\n\r\nIn addition, there a few segments where the animators either change the style of the show completely, or change the kind of animation itself. At one point, a segment turns into a manga-like high-speed chase scene on a highway. Another time, it transforms into a shounen-like battle scene. In general, you're always in for a treat, even if there are a few noticeable mistakes and mishaps sprinkled throughout.\\n\r\nAlso, the opening for every episode changes. For a show that you'd think would have a low-budget, this is quite unique and deserves praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nEvery time music plays, it fits the scene it accompanies well. In addition, the opening and ending themes are nice to listen. As for the opening in particular, it displays the show's playful and upbeat nature perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI'll go ahead and say this now, there is very minimal character development to be found. Yet, the show dances around this roadblock with grace. Each character has great chemistry with every other character they interact with. The characters are what sold this anime to me. Every funny moment is because of the characters. While the characters could technically be defined as one-note, each individual personality is so strong that you won't care in the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'd be lying if this wasn't one of the funniest anime I've seen. The anime is bold in nature and constantly strives to defy one's expectations of what comes next. Every trope that it could possibly be subjected to, is turned on it's head. Every episode was like a roller coaster, except the ride only ever went down when it was finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime is not meant to be judged critically. By those standards, the show is quite poor. However, if you are willing to turn off your brain for 12 minutes at a time, you will love this anime for what it is. If you legitimately give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nI decided to begin my summer anime crusade on something that I thought wasn't going to be that good, but surprisingly enough for an anime that is only 12 minutes per episode was actually entertaining.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story is about Yoshiko Hanabatake a girl so stupid she gets zero's on every test and has a fascination with Banana's, the only person who can keep her stupidity in check is her friend Akuru Akutsu.\r\nNow the story is the weakest aspect of the show mainly because there isn't really a story at all though considering it was developed from a 4-Koma Manga it's going to bedifficult to make a full show from this and because of this there isn't really an end goal for the show instead it mainly has Yoshiko getting either herself, Akuru or even her friends into stupid or bad situations and everyone suffers for it in the end although it is very funny how they get into these messes.\\n\r\nThe final episode is what you think either as the final episode decides to be an origin story of how Yoshiko and Akuru met which was actually pretty good, but other than that there isn't much to say about the story hence why the score isn't that high.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were definitely a ball of fun especially Yoshiko who out of all the characters surprised me the most.\\n\r\nYoshiko is the female MC and is probably the most stupid character I have ever encountered, but much like Kintarou from Golden Boy this is a good stupid which is a stupid that will make you feel weird, but you will be laughing at the same time although it did surprise me how Yoshiko was very smart in one aspect and that was the art of love because somehow she made a teacher feel better about herself which is probably the only good thing she did in the show which also reminds that she is surprisingly contagious like her methods may be stupid, but they make people happy and overtime she actually starts making more and more friends from her actions which either felt like dumb luck or everyone is stupid too.\\n\r\nAkuru the male MC is a rare site for me which is the male Tsundere and boy does he take the Tsundere troupe seriously yet you understand the suffering he has gone through with his relationship with Yoshiko since he has to deal with her stupidity 24/7  and this guy feels no remorse for her as he is happy to whack her in the face whenever she steps out of line, but he isn't always an angry looking guy because whenever he interacts with his sister or with Dog (yes that's the name of the dog) he actually seems like a kind guy yet somehow since his sister is suffering from whatever Yoshiko is he always ends up hurting her feelings.\\n\r\nSayaka is Yoshiko's best friend and is pretty much the most normal character of the show since she is the cute and innocent type however that doesn't stop her from blowing a gasket whenever Yoshiko or any of the other characters go a little too far like when Yoshiko and Iinchou snuck into Akuru's room.\\n\r\nIinchou is another female character who is the Disciplinary Committee President so she hates the stuff Yoshiko does, but she ends up having a crush on Akuru when he helps her out during one of Yoshiko's moments however her view of love is of the stalker type though not to the point of being a Yandere and whenever she tries to get close to him he just sees her moves as weird which always put's her down.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle wasn't amazing it felt very samey compared to other anime's that I have seen or just not impressive, but for some reason the fact that Yoshiko always had this ridiculous smile on her face reminded me of the smile Saitama would make in OPM in fact everyone's facial expressions were actually really funny which is pretty much the reason why the art gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI know this is going to sound stupid, but that intro was actually very catchy because at first it seemed weird or stupid however the more I listened to it the more enjoyable it got which actually surprised me because the intro's from the spring period were actually very lackluster apart from a few and it's funny how the first intro I watch of the summer period is actually alright and I also liked how the intro had something different going on in the background.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is the icing on the cake for this show because despite how stupid it was the comedy felt fresh in some way even when they were using cliched looking moments or scenes they didn't feel like rehashes of stuff we've seen countless times in other anime's so I applaud this short series for managing to make something funny feel fresh for once.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance part of the show is probably the most confusing one because you don't really know who to support because Yoshiko is stupid as hell, Akuru is a very violent and short-tempered person and Iinchou is a stalker leaving Sayaka as the only character who seems appealing yet she never gets any action which is funny yet sad at the same time so yeah a show like this having Romance just didn't feel right although it is strange how Yoshiko is actually a master at knowing the feeling of love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall despite the length of the show it was a surprisingly entertaining show and a pretty good start to the summer 2017 anime's so if anyone's looking for something short that can give you a good laugh then try this one.",

            "content": "It is said that humans are the most intelligent creatures on the planet.\u00a0 Who said it?\u00a0 Why humans of course.\u00a0 And as much our species loves to boast about its dominance over dear mother earth despite the logical fallacy, there're always gonna be a couple...less than stellar members of the bunch.\r\nStory: With a title that literally translates to 'Idiot Girl', Aho Girl follows the comedic school romp of an idiotic girl named Yoshiko and her childhood 'friend' Akuru filled with fast comedic misunderstandings, leaps in logic, and some vaguely illegal things, ultimately creating a show that when you put it into perspective...makes absolutely no sense.\r\nIna word, Aho Girl is pure nonsense.\u00a0 Based on a 4-koma manga of the same name, the entire runtime of Aho Girl spans roughly six full length episodes (or twelve, twelve minute long episodes) purely about pure insanity about a high school girl with a head so empty you'll wonder how she ever got to high school, and if she even has a functioning brain stem.\\n\\n\r\nThe show primarily uses a double act style of comedy, where someone (usually Yoshiko) begins a chain of misunderstandings and high energy moments only to be counteracted by the few members of the cast who act as the straight man for a resolution to the whole thing and bring the energy back down to earth after it's spiraled out of control to astronomical proportions.\u00a0 You'd think the show would be tiring after using this routine in basically every scene, but each episode manages to bring out different situations with different members of the side cast to really create a...unique viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nI think the best part about Aho Girl is the fact that the jokes don't overstay their welcome.\u00a0 We get the setup, the buildup, a little more buildup, the payoff, end.\u00a0 It's quick, it's snappy, and it makes just enough impact for the viewer to know what's going on and potentially want to continue watching just to see what kind of shit Yoshiko's gonna bring the rest of the cast into.\u00a0 So as a result, the show feels refreshing and is honestly quite amusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Quick, snappy comedy\\n\r\n+ Jokes don't overstay their welcome\\n\r\n+/- Comedy is subjective\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Hanabatake Yoshiko, the Aho Girl herself, is no doubt the show's biggest selling point as not only is she the titular character, but her character is so devoid of intelligent or rational thoughts that it's a wonder how a character like this hasn't really been advertised like her.\u00a0 A simple creature with an extreme fondness for bananas, Yoshiko spends the entire series dragging in practically every member of the cast into her brainless schemes, usually dramatizing everything up to the payoff for the sake of comedy.\u00a0 As expected her character both doesn't change and is incapable of change, but has a nice healthy dose of comeuppance to counteract the crazy shit and splintering headaches that she gives to those around her who have even half of a working brain.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Aktsu Akuru, the show's primary straight man and childhood friend to Yoshiko.\u00a0 As a man who primarily focuses his time on studying, Akuru is a character who is completely out of fucks to give, easily giving into his temperament when it comes to what Yoshiko does in order to try and involve him with things.\u00a0 So I guess he's kinda stupid for falling for that so many times...\u00a0 Which actually brings up a very good point.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show does follow the style of a double act, everyone in this show has a few screws loose, and the straight men as a result have problems maintaining their position given the state of the situation spiraling out of at hand.\u00a0 Each member of the side cast brings their own brand of insanity from stalker, to lonely and needy housewife, an intelligent dog, to even comedically branded learning disabled children (poor Ruri), mixing around who is involved in what situation so we get to see how some of these characters react with others, and wait and see to witness what in the hell we're about to see in front of us.\u00a0 They're wacky, they're nonsensical, and quite honestly, that's what makes them at the very least fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Strange yet fun cast\\n\r\n-\u00a0 No one is safe from stupidity.\u00a0 NO ONE!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Diomedia, the art for Aho Girl really isn't that noteworthy.\u00a0 It's of decent quality and has enough to it so that you're aware with what's going on, but the nitty gritty of it has very few interesting things to tell.\u00a0 This is most likely because the characters are so animated and bounce all over the place that any additional effort on the quality of the art would increase the amount of work needed to produce the show.\u00a0 Really though, it's not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show has only one track to show for itself.\u00a0 Its OP named \"Zenryoku\u2606Summer!\" is a sporadic, nonsensical, fast piece that...for some reason sounds like it veers into like three different genres of music.\u00a0 It's such a weird piece that I can't help but call it memorable simply for that reason alone.\u00a0 It's not actually that bad either, and it's very fitting.\u00a0 It's just...I don't have words to make of it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: As someone who read and enjoyed its source material, Aho Girl is a very faithful replication of the 4-koma with the right amount of insanity added in to have it make absolutely no sense, yet somehow still be interesting yet fun to watch.\u00a0 I'm a simple person, I like stupid shit, so yes, I did giggle like a schoolgirl watching the sheer lack of brain cells and logic leaps that these failures as human beings showcased in their daily lives.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 My favorite parts involve the disciplinary committee chairwoman.\u00a0 I find it amusing seeing a character fall from grace all because of one person and the kind of depravity they fall into without knowing the full extent of their descent from the moral high ground.\u00a0 Also the dog.\u00a0 The dog is great.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nYoshiko.\u00a0 To be fair, I believe you're supposed to hate her because she's the epitome of 'dumb' but still acts all high and mighty sometimes to an almost annoying degree only to get comeuppance later by Akuru later so she can't bask in her self-satisfaction.\u00a0 Or something.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nIf you want some quick and stupid comedy, this is a perfect fit.\u00a0 It definitely is a 'turn off your brain' show, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\u00a0 The show was made purely for entertainment reasons, so watching something dumb for the sake of getting a good chuckle is good enough in my book.\u00a0 Plus, you'll probably never find this many characters with this much lacking thinking power in one place again.\u00a0 So that's something.",

It's about a very, VERY stupid girl who sort of causes misery to everyone around her. \r\nNow, I only started watching this anime the other day, expectations sort of low, and was very surprised by how funny this anime actually is. The humor can be random, but it's a hilarious sort of random. I legitimately had to pause a few times because I was laughing too hard. Each episode is only 12 minutes long, with 3-4 separate segments and they're nearly all winners every episode. \r\nThere's Yoshiko, our main character, who's unsurprisingly, well, stupid. She's blunt,hyper, and at moments, obnoxious in a good way. Then, we have her childhood friend, Akutsu, who I would've called a 'tsundere' but he genuinely seems to loathe Yoshiko with a passion so that wouldn't quite fit. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI honestly dunno if 'romance' really fits this anime, given how uninterested he seems. But then again, I haven't read the manga so maybe he starts to develop feelings for her later. Another thing is, nearly everyone in this show seems to wanna get in his pants, including Yoshiko's newfound delinquent bro ;). \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character would HAVE to be Yoshiko's mom. She's...something else. I can't say much without spoiling, but she's so utterly scummy and I adore her so much. \\n\\n\r\n(Also, heavy props to Yoshiko's voice actress, because holy shit. Sometimes just the way she delivers a line makes a joke 100% funnier.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for something with no plot, an idiot for a main character, and all-around hilarity, then Aho girl is definitely for you! \\n",

            "content": "Aho-girl is a series I nearly gave up on after the first two episodes - it's a 4-koma adaptation with short episodes and very random, sometimes outright dumb humour. The titular character, \"idiot girl\" named Yoshiko, is often more annoying than funny and her writing only at rare occasions reaches the witty and surprising qualities I would expect from a series in this formula. However, the more action focuses on the supporting cast and the protagonist Akkun, the more compelling it becomes. After five episodes, I have to admit that I had some decent laughs and even enjoyed re-watching earlier episodes while knowing a bitmore context to the story and roles certain characters would take on later.\\n\\n\r\nSome reviews here points to Akkuns \"violence\" against Yoshiko (and rarely other women) and interprets the show as misogynist - I think it's an obvious misreading, as all those scenes are in the formula of slapstick comedy and shouldn't be taken literally. There's also a bit of sexual humour, with Yoshiko trying to \"seduce\" Akkun in various, absurd ways, but I find it all less questionable than typical fanservice in many comedy anime titles (and here it's always part of the gag rather than actual fanservice). Parts of the humour might be off-putting to some, but I think it would be unfair to reject the whole series based on those fragments and I personally didn't mind them, outside of the somewhat-gross last episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I was very much sceptical about this series when I first encountered it, but I think that later in the season it really starts working well as a quick, absurd comedy it's ought to be. It's not for everyone and I was still sometimes disappointed by the quality of the writing, but it was also able to positively surprise me with some more creative gags. It might not be a must-watch, but still worth giving it a try, at least to find whether its kind of over-the-top absurdity appeals to you.",

            "content": "*No Spoiler Concise Review*\r\nTL;DR: An idiot girl getting into endless shenanigans that keeps viewers just laughing till their precious buttocks fall off.\r\n[Story: 4/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 9/10]\r\nWhat is Aho Girl? What isn't Aho girl? Should I even watch this anime? If you think this anime looks stupid and the premise you've read on MAL sounds dumb then you are even more of an \"Aho\" than the main girl is in this anime. Seriously, Aho Girl (Idiot Girl) is your classic boke and tsukkomi style comedy with plenty of slapstick. If you just want to turn off your brain and laughyour ass off, this is definitely that show. I have never seen so much savagery in anime. The brutality is absolutely barbaric. It's just gag after gag after gag. One of the best 15 minute ab workout ever. Your sides will hate you but they will thank you. \\n\\n\r\nThis is your classic yin-yang sort of anime where the characters and the story directly compliments each other. One can't live without the other. Though there are numerous characters introduced as the anime goes on, the main characters are, Yoshiko, a masochist idiot beyond all belief, and her childhood crush A-Kun, a genius sadist beyond all belief. Every time Yoshiko's idiosyncrasies rises to a peak, A-Kun brutally punches it down to normalize the situation. It is this exchange of quit pro quo that makes this anime so hilarious.  Even though viewers might feel bad for Yoshiko because of all the sufferings she endures due to her stupidity. However, she's literally the anthropomorphized genderbent version of Patrick Star. Not to mention she deserves every bit of it. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode consists of few short gags. Even though you know it will feature some sort of idiotic stunt from the MC, needless to say, each gag remains fresh despite reusing running joke here and there. As the show goes on, we are introduced to various side characters ranging from Yandere Killer Mom to Tsundere Lewd President to Kuudere Dumb Sister to Overtly Charismatic Doge. At first they appear smart however as the show goes everyone but A-kun slowly becomes an idiot. There's a popular fan theory from avid manga readers that it's all A-Kun's fault. He sucks the intelligence out of everyone around him. He has like a 20 foot radius that sucks away at least 50 points of intelligence from everyone who enters. True or False, well that's for you to decide. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art & animation in this anime is pretty good. The studio did great justice to this anime despite it being an anime short. It's beautifully hand drawn and all the characters somehow stand out from one another. Not just the character design, the seiyuus in this anime heightened the enjoyment factor even more. Specifically the seiyuu of Yoshiko. She did a fantastic job. The OP and ED songs are funny and compliments the comedy style of this anime. The background score didn't stand out much but that can be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are looking for a short anime with endless comedy gags with no clear story or plot but just laughter, then this anime is for you. It's slightly lewd, slightly dramatic but over the top comedy. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how great your abs look from all that laughter. \\n\\n\r\nBtw, did you know that \"Baka\" and \"Aho\" are synonyms. People who live in the eastern half of central Japan (Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba) generally use Aho whilst rarely using Baka when serious. This is reversed in the western half of Japan, (Osaka, Kyoto,) resulting in some minor arguments between Tomins (Capital Citizens) and Osakans.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "Hidden beneath the antics, the one-liners, and the pop culture references, Aho Girl\u2019s goal is obvious even to the untrained eye; it desires your attention. \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d Aho Girl screams, waving its arms and jumping about in a frenzied, excessive, and desperate manner. In doing so, this show has managed to not only work but endear itself to the audience as well. Quite a few seasonal viewers have been smitten over this show and, at first glance, it\u2019s easy to see why. Aho Girl is energetic. It\u2019s straightforward. And it\u2019s occasionally charming. However, Aho Girl is also painful to watch.\r\nFirst andforemost, this show is simply not funny. For Aho Girl, which largely subdues its aesthetics in an effort to emphasize its writing, this is a severely damaging flaw. Aho Girl fancies itself an extravagant comic extraordinaire yet it never fully ventures into the absurd; it\u2019s as if Aho Girl is frightened of abandoning its slice-of-life roots and as a result is rather hesitant of displaying signs of vivaciousness. The instances where its comic genius sparks to life are memorable in their own right (the homage to the Power Rangers, in particular) but they are few and far between. It hardly helps that Aho Girl, like most mediocre comedies, is obsessed with explaining the jokes to you; with every act of mischief, there\u2019s not only a character (read: the \u201cself-insert\u201d) elaborating on the details of said act but there are also occasional cues from Aho Girl itself that tell you how the act was intended to be funny. As this show can attest to, even comedies can be guilty of infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, Aho Girl is engaged in a war against common sense. This is a show that prides itself in its intentional stupidity; for Aho Girl, lapses in judgment and instances of in-the-moment logic are par for the course. A carefree attitude and general acts of silliness are a major source of this show\u2019s appeal. That said, Aho Girl underwhelms when it attempts a serious approach; it\u2019s as if the show doesn\u2019t understand its audience. Most viewers appreciate Aho Girl because of its slapstick humor, because of the amusing eyecatches, because of its short runtime and, yes, because of the fanservice. I doubt that these viewers picked up Aho Girl for the half-baked, insipid, and monotonous moments of insight that ultimately result in little but wasted time. These moments of insight are not only executed poorly but their suitability is subpar; Aho Girl tends to observe the most trivial matters, like a low score on a quiz, and overexert itself when it should be focusing on the more important problems, like the abusive relationship at the center of it all.\\n\\n\r\nEvery problem that arises from Aho Girl stems from the disastrous dynamic between its protagonists; it\u2019s the repugnant elephant in the room that Aho Girl\u2019s fanbase has condoned, glossed over, neglected, and outright ignored at times. The cast members are defined by a single trait but no cast member has as damaging a trait as Akuru Akutsu (the \u201cself-insert\u201d) and Yoshiko Hanabatake (the show\u2019s poster girl). Yoshiko\u2019s defining trait is idiocy while Akuru\u2019s is anger; while Yoshiko compensates for her lack of intellect with a can-do attitude, Akuru offers little outside of his constant rage. There have been plenty of characters similar to Akuru, like Last Exile\u2019s Alex Row, that have provided substance, versatility and growth to their cast beyond their brooding tendencies and hair-trigger temper. Akuru, however, is feeble in comparison; he makes little effort to express himself beyond screaming matches and physical abuse. When he encounters a problem, Akuru explodes. When his friend attempt helping him, Akuru becomes spiteful; he insults, he torments, he belittles, he punches, he kicks, and he hurls expletives at his friends simply because he perceives them as annoying. Sure, Akuru apologizes once in a while but he never bothers to change. Honestly, why should he? The other cast members, specifically Yoshiko, and Aho Girl itself by proxy have long since accepted this as rational behavior. That the show has treated Akuru\u2019s abusive tendencies as a gimmick, that the show\u2019s fanbase has little reaction to it, is sickening to me.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a place in this world for Aho Girl, where it can exist without scrutiny of any sort. Aho Girl has established itself and thrived in GIFs, in Vines, in reaction videos, in memes and in the Weird Side of YouTube. It is there that Aho Girl\u2019s positive traits can flourish. However, under any sort of analysis, Aho Girl not only leaves you unsatisfied but more than a little repulsed as well. This show, allergic to depth and disgusted by morality, is at best mildly amusing and at worst one of the biggest disgraces of a thoroughly mediocre season. Aho Girl makes a spectacle of itself -  presenting faux-meaningful observations; idolizing its vapid female lead; overindulging in panty shots; deploying one tired, overused clich\u00e9 after another (the sister complex, among others); and fishing for attention - while accomplishing absolutely nothing in the end. While its peers in the comedy genre have pushed boundaries, expanded horizons, enlightened its fans, and revolutionized the medium, Aho Girl has contributed little beyond munching on bananas.",

            "content": "Oh boy.. Summer 2017 animes are ending already and it was quite a hustle... From the isekai genre shows like ''In Another World With My Smartphone'' that so many hates about,\r\n,the A-1 pictures version of the Fate series, the gambling-crazy anime Kakegurui, the action packed 2nd season of Boku No Hero Academia, to the romantic anime Koi To Uso, we all have been blessed with so many good shows though there is something missing.. An anime that is mainly focused on humor, laughter or should I say.. The legendary ''Comedy'' genre. There comes the hidden wonder ''Aho Girl''. It looks like an anime version of''Minions'' but focused mostly on the daily high school life of our beloved banana-loving girl Hanabatake Yoshiko and her childhood love but a brutal wrestler who can supplex her everyday because of her stupidity, Akutsu Akuru or simply, A-kun.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nOn my opinion, I prefer stories that goes with the intro, rising, climax, falling then resolution. Thats whats lacking Aho Girl.. Though this anime gives us ''part'' where it has almost all the elements of a perfect plot, though I said ''Almost''. Not everytime. The comedic side though is very superior on this anime which balance the enjoyment of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this anime... The characters sketches are easily aliked to any other animes out there but the action-packed art scenes/effects and the mouth along with the eyes of the characters makes it unique and entertaining. Comedic + Good Art = Worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nHey hey.. They said the opening of the anime is not that good. I'm like ''Am I the only one who loves it?''. Along with the humor side of the opening, its music is preferable to the anime itself to be honest. Then comes the little background music when the shows rolls on stating that this anime will be a high school/laughable anime...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime shows us that even characters that are hard to read like A-kun can be an element to a joke or humor and they did it perfectly along with other characters. All of the characters have their roles on the line from Main to Supporting, which supports the show even more on its genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n9/10 is already pretty high for me. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. A 12-minute anime like Aho Girl, for me, its like already 24 minutes (but I'm begging for more Lmao).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf theres 9.5/10 I could really give this anime that rating. Enjoyable, funny, great art, excellent characters, wrestling supplexes, everything here is almost perfect and I love this show very much.",

Each episode is split into 3 or 4 smaller parts.\r\nNow, Aho Girl doesn't have any story, it contains random unrelated stories which are funny with different characters from the cast.\r\nIt was pretty funny at the beginning, and I even wanted full 24 minutes episodes, but..... Somewhere in the middle I felt like I'm already done with Aho Girl. It became a lot less funny, and many of the jokes repeated themselves.\r\nAt one point new characters were introduced, and which felt to me too much. I liked the original cast and now that half ofthe scenes are focused on Yoshiko and other random characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Aho Girl is simple- Yoshiko, the main character, is stupid (Well, \"Aho\") and does nothing but play around. She doesnt study and doesnt even care about it. She thinks everybody loves her and basically... she acts like a 4 years old girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yea it was funny at first, but then again, it just becomes repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to take all the stories together and give them a score, 5/10 would fit.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7/10 as nothing too special, but it wasn't unappealing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10. Nothing worth remembering, neither the OP or the OST (if there even was one)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've already described Yoshiko, but all the characters repeat the same pattern.

            "content": "Sometimes, silly actions can make us laugh, stupid comments are hilarious, unexplained decisions are funny, but it isn't the case of Aho Girl. I wonder if the author respects women or not. \r\nThe story, a stupid girl Yoshiko with a brain of the size of a monkey that has some attention disorder illness. She takes stupid decisions all the time and tries to capture the \"love\" and interest of Akutsu. Also, she likes bananas, so the author refers to her as a monkey.  She has been near Akutsu since their youth, but this guy incomprehensibly hates her. Honestly, \u00bfisn't that fun?  We willlaugh in some scenes, I can't deny that some of them are funny but others no. Is like seeing a mentally ill person doing any stupid thing and someone will punch that person, and we end laughing for that actions. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't funny seeing a guy beating a woman all the time, he hits Yoshiko, insults her, minimizes her and even compares her to a piece of filth. And that doesn't end there he does similar actions to her mom, Yoshie that is desperate to give her daughter to the first person that appears nearby, in this case, Akutsu. It isn't funny seeing a progression like this. It will be funnier if Akutsu tries helping the poor soul of Yoshiko by all means in a similar case as with his sister and ends failing. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, what can I say? It is a monkey as described in the show (Yoshiko) vs. and orangutan (that arrogant guy one). The other characters are forced, like Yoshiko's friends and appear in a very useless way. To add some competition for her, the author just added another female from her school that falls in love for Akutsu. \\n\\n\r\nUpdate recent episodes:  In the last episodes, I noticed that if you remove Akutsu from the story, the show will go from bad to abysmal. The story failed entirely in being a balanced and real comedy. The show can't make people laugh without the abusive orangutan around. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice over, \u00bfwhat happened Aoi? You are better than this. Honestly, she isn't the voice for Yoshiko. The character needs to yell too much, and she ends doing a pinch that gets annoying because she uses a high pinch and can't maintain it regularly so ends pushing harder and the tone isn't balanced.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art, it is normal. We aren't seeing any master piece here, but your eyes aren't going to suffer from it either.  The songs are good. The OP has a good rhythm. The sound, in general, is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I am sure that a lot of persons will love this kind of shows and I can't argue with them. I am neutral and will end watching it because I am hoping that Akutsu will change his actions or that Yoshiko could hit this orangutan.\\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while, there is that anime that you just keep watching without knowing why you are doing it but you're still enjoying it so much and Aho Girl is just like that for me. I started the anime out reluctant to do it as I felt it was going to be stupid and mediocre but I sure was wrong.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is nothing special. The story follows Yoshiko, a girl extremely stupid you'll feel stupid yourself just watching her, and her every day life with her childhood friend, A-kun. She is always doing something stupid and he is always trying to stopher. She also adds suffering to the life of the rest of her friends.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is normal for an anime like it. I can see them making the most out of their budget, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme is somewhat catchy. There isn't much to say about the sound considering most of the background music is like something you'd find in Youtube video about comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nAll characters are cliched in their personality but they are extreme in it. Yoshiko is a free-spirited, stupid girl but taking it to the extreme. A-kun is the aggressive character that's forced to put up with the stupidity of Yoshiko but he is missing a machine gun.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI haven't laughed as hard since Konosuba. This anime is pretty hilarious and would just make you laugh pretty much the whole time. As always, comedy as subjective so what I might be laughing at, another person might find unfunny. It's all a matter of preferences and personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAho Girl isn't some kind of perfect anime that has great narrative, interesting story, deep characters, breathtaking art, or best soundtrack in history but it is something you watch when you're free an wanna have a good laugh. I'd recommend it to any comedy fans and just casuals that wanna try something funny. It should NOT be taken seriously or you might not enjoy it at all. Overall, you just need to pause your brain for the 12 minutes in every episodes and enjoy it no matter how weird it seemed.",

            "content": "Aho girl is, despite the title, not actually an idiotic show. Yoshiko, the titular girl of the show, loves bananas, she loves Akutsu, and she loves playing around. She is also absolutely imbecilic, managing to consistently get 0's on every test in school. Yet she has a certain charm to her, and a devious insight into the behaviour of those around her, that sometimes make you wonder whether she's really stupid or just sees the world very differently from everyone else.\r\nAkutsu on the other hand is a thoroughly disagreeable fellow, he's very smart and has a punch that can knock out anyone. Most of thetime he's punching Yoshiko (in a gender equality kind of way which would make Kazuma of Konosuba proud).  The setup for many of the early jokes in the series relies on this dichotomy between Yoshiko and Akutsu. Yet the series quickly moves on to bigger and greater things. It parodies shounens, racing anime (the sequence which parodies Initial D is absolutely spot on), and most other genres under the sun. Even if you haven't seen the shows which it parodies, your enjoyment of it is hardly going to suffer. Aho Girl doesn't hold its punches, and toys around with all kinds of situational comedy, parody in general, as well as more down to earth humor about the human condition.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that loves poking fun at others, but does so with a conscious nod to the genres it parodies. Not unlike One-Punch Man, the love toward the genres it makes fun of is ever-present. More than anything, the very short format of the series (12 minute episodes as compared to the 25 minute episodes of normal shows) makes for an absolute blast when watching Aho Girl. Any given episode usually has 2-4 stories in it, meaning even if one segment might not be in your taste, you're sure to get something wildly different within minutes.\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything, Aho Girl is FUN. The jokes are often on point, the shenanigans of Yoshiko, the depraved nature of Fuuki Inchou, the long-suffering nature of Akutsu, the sweet nature of Sayaka who inexplicably agrees to most of the shenanigans, and the constant failures of Ruri, Akutsu's Aho sister, all plays into the manic nature of Aho Girl. This is a comedy show that's perfect to watch while eating, on the subway, or when you're bored. It is probably the most unexpectedly good show of the season it was released in and an absolute blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any cohesive narrative and some segments less interesting nature notches the show down a bit, but I would gladly recommend this show to anyone looking for a laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl gets a well deserved 8/10",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe banana is sometimes considered one of nature\u2019s most amazing creations.\r\nCommonly produced. Comes in bunches. Easy to hold. Sweet taste. Biodegradable packaging. Penchant for comedy. Not since the apple has there been such a fruit, such a food that has given humans so much with so little.\r\nWhile people love bananas, nobody loves them as much as Yoshiko of Aho Girl. And, while she may have less brains than one of these yellow-wrapped fruits, she upstages their comedic value with her own brazen stupidity.\r\nSTORY\r\nAt roughly thirteen minutes per episode, Aho Girl has only so much timeto get its audience laughing. The show knows this dilemma, and so it delivers unto them a near constant stream of comedy that does not stop for nearly its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this comedy revolves around Yoshiko, the titular character of this project and quite possibly the dumbest person to ever exist. Ever. That\u2019s not a slight against her. Everyone in the show agrees with this statement, and Yoshiko herself couldn\u2019t care less what others think about her let alone what they do for and around her.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads directly into what Aho Girl showcases.\\n\\n\r\nIt loves its loudness. Yoshiko and the others did not learn about the concept of inside voices, so their exchanges quite quickly devolve into shouting matches. Admittedly, some people may be put off by the obnoxious yelling throughout the season, especially from the banana-pining girl who elevates her voice when even remotely excited. But such high energy supercharges the mundane events depicted, giving them a comedic push down the right path.\\n\\n\r\nSlapstick never goes away. Yoshiko\u2019s vacant noggin equates to weakened pain receptors, so she often succumbs to many a bruising and a beating both of her own accord and at the hands of Akutsu. Of course, everyone involved punches, kicks, and tackles without remorse. From the three gyaru girls simultaneously punching the lovable idiot to Yoshie duking it out with Iinchou, the physical comedy complements the loudness with ease.\\n\\n\r\nThe idiocy does not falter. The events seem normal at first, but Yoshiko\u2019s arrival, words, or mere existence twist the dial of intelligence down to zero. She plays hide-and-seek for days on end. Akutsu and Dog bond over a particular movie scene. Yoshie must confirm Sayaka\u2019s purity while revealing too much information about her own person. In other words, the show is stupid not in a negative sense but in a purposefully ridiculous one, further improving the overall hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl also makes small decisions here and there that help guide the show along. Its scenes split up into distinct parts with a small amount of crossover and callbacks to make the stream of comedy that much more digestible. Moreover, the show also varies up its content as much as it can, like when Yoshiko disguises as the male Yoshio to cheer up their teacher or that time where the group go on summer vacation filled with a couple of ecchi escapades.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, nothing within the anime is exactly novel. But that doesn\u2019t stop its loudness, its slapstick, and its idiocy from giving this comedy anime its clout.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl continues its strong execution with an appreciable set of visuals.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, due to the time constraint, the show makes use of its opening track\u2019s frames to deliver even more comedy. They almost always change the setup: Iinchou looking longingly at Akutsu, Sayaka acting as an angel in a play, a flurry of Yoshiko faces that fill the entire screen. Small stuff really, but these constant changes give the audience something to look forward to at the start of every episode rather than the same tired montage.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the anime includes elements that continue down its comedic path. Lots of speed lines accentuate the characters\u2019 yelling and crazy actions. Missing pupils give them their \u201cdead\u201d looks after a kerfuffle of any kind. A cheerful banana censors out any particularly ecchi displays. And the various imaginative sequences, like a giant Banana Froppeccino Deluxe floating in the sky, a flurry of hearts as Yoshiko jumps in for a kiss, or a manga-like style as she races a motorbike rider while riding Dog herself, change up the often-lacking background artistry.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation in general remains involved throughout the season, too, lending further credit to its strong execution. This direction is thanks mostly to the constant brawls, reactions, and situations the group normally find themselves in and make for each other.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Aho Girl does not perform as well when it comes to the designs of its characters. While the cast members often just wear their unassuming garb for school, their somewhat same-face looks \u2013 especially when yelling all big mouthed and wide eyed \u2013 reduce variety in their potential depictions the most. It also does not help that their colors and looks in general do not go for anything too striking.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, those fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and noticeable movements keep the anime going strong despite the designs not quite stacking up.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs purely a comedy anime, the characters of Aho Girl focus first and foremost on, well, comedy. They toss aside complexity and say to themselves, \u201cLet\u2019s get the audience smiling with our strangeness.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMany of those smiles come from Yoshiko herself. It cannot be overstated how dumb she is. She has next to zero attention span, has little care for consequences, and has no desire to do anything except what she deems as in-the-moment fun.\\n\\n\r\nThus, she does not pick up on even the most normal of societal cues, leading to her raucous behavior no matter where she is or what she is doing. It may mean running all the way to a farmer\u2019s farm X kilometers away just to tell him that she likes his produce, or it could be the case that she pukes from eating one banana too many after declaring that she cannot eat another. Either way, Yoshiko refuses to follow the norm, and, for this reason, she improves the comedy present without fail.\\n\\n\r\nWhen she isn\u2019t playing dolls a little too realistically with the local kids at the park, she often spouts backwards logic that somehow, someway makes sense in her signature lunacy. Most importantly, Yoshiko desensitizes the audience to and accentuates the strange traits of the other cast members. Akutsu\u2019s standoffish personality. Iinchou\u2019s stalking tendencies. Yoshie\u2019s psychotic mindset (like mother, like daughter). If nothing else, Dog is literally smarter than her, giving his scenes an actual basis besides just being more aware than usual as a pet animal.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, Yoshiko\u2019s relationships create even more comedic opportunities. Ruri is sadly an idiot like Yoshiko on certain levels, so Yoshiko tries to bond with her fellow moron whenever she can. Ryuuichi looks up to her as his boss, going from a delinquent to a dude who just wants to hang out with some friends. And Sayaka, the most regular person of the whole group, offsets Yoshiko\u2019s overbearing asides, but even she breaks down on occasion around her friend, the contrast inviting another round of funnies.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters are simple. But that fits Aho Girl perfectly. And, at the end of the day, they follow through on what they had in mind. Which means that it\u2019s tough to ask for much more out of them.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe anime packs in as much fun into its audio design as it can.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Aho Girl wouldn\u2019t be Aho Girl without its, well, \u201caho\u201d girl. To this end, Aoi Yuuki as Yoshiko deserves a ton of props for her lead role as the twin-tailed weirdo. If she isn\u2019t passed out on the floor after taking a punch to the face, she\u2019s yelling as much as possible, creating an annoying yet hilarious voice for the star that doesn\u2019t let up for the show\u2019s whole (and short) run.\\n\\n\r\nTomokazu Sugita as Akutsu also dishes out hilarity with his scathing hatred for his less-than-ideal neighbor, but the opening track \u201cZenryoku\u2606Summer!\u201d brings even more smiles into this sound space. During its one-minute timeframe, it goes all over the place while still following a clear path. Quick lyrical deliveries, differing vocal tones, bongos, the distinct noise of a metal bat hitting a baseball. Combined with the occasional chimes and goofier background sound-effects, the OP forms as a silly, catchy tune that sets the comedic tone for the series without any effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the music, however, doesn\u2019t reach those same hits-a-funny-bone heights. The ending track \u201cOdore! Kyu-kyoku Tetsugaku\u201d is pretty much an afterthought, playing underneath the outro scenes of Aho Girl as a mediocre poppy song. And the original soundtrack \u2013 even with its different meandering, guitar, and classical pieces \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly push forward with a ton of intrigue. It at least doesn\u2019t take anything away from the show, though.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with hilarious VA performances and a just-as-funny OP to back them up, the music and sound for Aho Girl partly accomplishes arguably its most important goal: bringing a sizeable chunk of fun.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a while since I laughed so consistently while watching one specific anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I burst out laughing so much so that it would be unfair of me to list any scenes since they all got me smiling or chuckling. Of course, as a show defined by how funny its characters manage to be, they were the cornerstone to my laughter.\\n\\n\r\nThinking back on the show, I liked all of them. Yoshiko somehow one-upping herself in stupidity constantly. Her mom Yoshie doing everything in her power to only allow Akutsu to hook up with her daughter to secure her future retirement. Dog being a good puppy. Akutsu\u2019s little sister Ruri cutely struggling with life. Iinchou\u2019s flashbacks and flashforwards. Sayaka crying as she barely keeps up with their collective antics. Their teacher Atsuko in the classic Christmas Cake role. The gyaru girls introducing a new angle. Ryuuichi just trying to be buddies with Akutsu. Sure, some are better than others, but they each still got me to laugh a lot all the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found that the anime was the right length for its content. It had some \u201cromance\u201d too which, while leading nowhere tangible, got a thumbs-up from me. And it also hardly ever strayed away from its comedy roots, remaining straightforward and sure of itself. Truth be told, this anime isn\u2019t exactly clever let alone unique \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want it to be any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl no doubt embraces the first half of its title. It\u2019s short. It\u2019s quick. It\u2019s funny. A three-way combo that ensures an entertaining time. While not the banana of this medium, it peels ahead regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, loudness, slapstick, and of course idiocy keep the laughs of this multipart comedy streaming without ever showing any signs of stopping\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and nice actual animation give the visuals strength even if the character designs do not\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Yoshiko is an unintentionally funny girl thanks to her \u201caho\u201d nature, highlighting the strangeness of the other cast members and holding distinct relationships with all of them\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, boisterous VA performances and a silly-sounding OP rise above a mediocre ED and a passable OST\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, have not laughed so much and so consistently in a long while\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

I decided to watch this one day as I was browsing idly for new anime. Boy, I discovered a gold mine!\r\nIt's fun to watch in every episode so far and I've never failed to laugh in every one of them (the episode on Power Rangers was brilliant!). It's silly to the point it's genius like Mr. Bean.\r\nSJWs might find this distasteful as Akuru always hit Yoshiko whenever she pisses him off (most were quiet and find it funny when a female tsunderehits a guy, though). I find this rather refreshing since it's rare to see such reverse. Not that I condone violence against any of the TWO genders, but hey, it's a comedy anime with exaggerated humour.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've always mentioned in my other reviews, I'm very generous when it comes to graphics and artwork but this anime has both beautiful animation and humour. It's a complete package for me and I hope you'd be tempted to watch it too if you haven't.",

            "content": "\"Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.\"\r\n      - Robert A. Heinlein\r\nTake that quote, put it in anime form, and crank the \"stupidity\" up to 100. Then multiply that with the most fun you've had in a long time. That's how Aho-Girl was created (literally, the title is exactly what it is). \r\nMany have written this anime off because of the countless number of memes and clips you've seen of it on the internet make it seem like a joke. None of them have given it a fair chance. They don't know what they're missing out on.\r\nStory: 7\r\nOnce upon a time,humanity was cursed by the gods and suffered a terrible fate. That fate was Hanabatake Yoshiko. She and her intricate tactics to overthrow humanity were bound to reign down on the mere mortals below in due time. Thus, it was up to Akutsu Akuru, humanity's knight in shining armor, to put a stop to this.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, that was the dramatic version. In reality, this show is simply about a girl's stupidity and what kind of situations it puts herself and others in. While there is no overarching plot of speak of (except one man's struggle to stop her terror), each episode contains a few small, generally self-contained stories, that provide a stage for all the wacky antics we see our characters get themselves into. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAt first glance, the artwork and animation are quite basic. However, as the series progresses and the situations become more wild, the art becomes more distinct and expressive. If a character is mad, they look furious. If a character is shocked, they look distraught. The animation conveys every action and emotion with such fluidity and precision. \\n\r\nIn addition, there a few segments where the animators either change the style of the show completely, or change the kind of animation itself. At one point, a segment turns into a manga-like high-speed chase scene on a highway. Another time, it transforms into a shounen-like battle scene. In general, you're always in for a treat, even if there are a few noticeable mistakes and mishaps sprinkled throughout.\\n\r\nAlso, the opening for every episode changes. For a show that you'd think would have a low-budget, this is quite unique and deserves praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nEvery time music plays, it fits the scene it accompanies well. In addition, the opening and ending themes are nice to listen. As for the opening in particular, it displays the show's playful and upbeat nature perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI'll go ahead and say this now, there is very minimal character development to be found. Yet, the show dances around this roadblock with grace. Each character has great chemistry with every other character they interact with. The characters are what sold this anime to me. Every funny moment is because of the characters. While the characters could technically be defined as one-note, each individual personality is so strong that you won't care in the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'd be lying if this wasn't one of the funniest anime I've seen. The anime is bold in nature and constantly strives to defy one's expectations of what comes next. Every trope that it could possibly be subjected to, is turned on it's head. Every episode was like a roller coaster, except the ride only ever went down when it was finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime is not meant to be judged critically. By those standards, the show is quite poor. However, if you are willing to turn off your brain for 12 minutes at a time, you will love this anime for what it is. If you legitimately give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nI decided to begin my summer anime crusade on something that I thought wasn't going to be that good, but surprisingly enough for an anime that is only 12 minutes per episode was actually entertaining.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story is about Yoshiko Hanabatake a girl so stupid she gets zero's on every test and has a fascination with Banana's, the only person who can keep her stupidity in check is her friend Akuru Akutsu.\r\nNow the story is the weakest aspect of the show mainly because there isn't really a story at all though considering it was developed from a 4-Koma Manga it's going to bedifficult to make a full show from this and because of this there isn't really an end goal for the show instead it mainly has Yoshiko getting either herself, Akuru or even her friends into stupid or bad situations and everyone suffers for it in the end although it is very funny how they get into these messes.\\n\r\nThe final episode is what you think either as the final episode decides to be an origin story of how Yoshiko and Akuru met which was actually pretty good, but other than that there isn't much to say about the story hence why the score isn't that high.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were definitely a ball of fun especially Yoshiko who out of all the characters surprised me the most.\\n\r\nYoshiko is the female MC and is probably the most stupid character I have ever encountered, but much like Kintarou from Golden Boy this is a good stupid which is a stupid that will make you feel weird, but you will be laughing at the same time although it did surprise me how Yoshiko was very smart in one aspect and that was the art of love because somehow she made a teacher feel better about herself which is probably the only good thing she did in the show which also reminds that she is surprisingly contagious like her methods may be stupid, but they make people happy and overtime she actually starts making more and more friends from her actions which either felt like dumb luck or everyone is stupid too.\\n\r\nAkuru the male MC is a rare site for me which is the male Tsundere and boy does he take the Tsundere troupe seriously yet you understand the suffering he has gone through with his relationship with Yoshiko since he has to deal with her stupidity 24/7  and this guy feels no remorse for her as he is happy to whack her in the face whenever she steps out of line, but he isn't always an angry looking guy because whenever he interacts with his sister or with Dog (yes that's the name of the dog) he actually seems like a kind guy yet somehow since his sister is suffering from whatever Yoshiko is he always ends up hurting her feelings.\\n\r\nSayaka is Yoshiko's best friend and is pretty much the most normal character of the show since she is the cute and innocent type however that doesn't stop her from blowing a gasket whenever Yoshiko or any of the other characters go a little too far like when Yoshiko and Iinchou snuck into Akuru's room.\\n\r\nIinchou is another female character who is the Disciplinary Committee President so she hates the stuff Yoshiko does, but she ends up having a crush on Akuru when he helps her out during one of Yoshiko's moments however her view of love is of the stalker type though not to the point of being a Yandere and whenever she tries to get close to him he just sees her moves as weird which always put's her down.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle wasn't amazing it felt very samey compared to other anime's that I have seen or just not impressive, but for some reason the fact that Yoshiko always had this ridiculous smile on her face reminded me of the smile Saitama would make in OPM in fact everyone's facial expressions were actually really funny which is pretty much the reason why the art gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI know this is going to sound stupid, but that intro was actually very catchy because at first it seemed weird or stupid however the more I listened to it the more enjoyable it got which actually surprised me because the intro's from the spring period were actually very lackluster apart from a few and it's funny how the first intro I watch of the summer period is actually alright and I also liked how the intro had something different going on in the background.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is the icing on the cake for this show because despite how stupid it was the comedy felt fresh in some way even when they were using cliched looking moments or scenes they didn't feel like rehashes of stuff we've seen countless times in other anime's so I applaud this short series for managing to make something funny feel fresh for once.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance part of the show is probably the most confusing one because you don't really know who to support because Yoshiko is stupid as hell, Akuru is a very violent and short-tempered person and Iinchou is a stalker leaving Sayaka as the only character who seems appealing yet she never gets any action which is funny yet sad at the same time so yeah a show like this having Romance just didn't feel right although it is strange how Yoshiko is actually a master at knowing the feeling of love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall despite the length of the show it was a surprisingly entertaining show and a pretty good start to the summer 2017 anime's so if anyone's looking for something short that can give you a good laugh then try this one.",

            "content": "It is said that humans are the most intelligent creatures on the planet.\u00a0 Who said it?\u00a0 Why humans of course.\u00a0 And as much our species loves to boast about its dominance over dear mother earth despite the logical fallacy, there're always gonna be a couple...less than stellar members of the bunch.\r\nStory: With a title that literally translates to 'Idiot Girl', Aho Girl follows the comedic school romp of an idiotic girl named Yoshiko and her childhood 'friend' Akuru filled with fast comedic misunderstandings, leaps in logic, and some vaguely illegal things, ultimately creating a show that when you put it into perspective...makes absolutely no sense.\r\nIna word, Aho Girl is pure nonsense.\u00a0 Based on a 4-koma manga of the same name, the entire runtime of Aho Girl spans roughly six full length episodes (or twelve, twelve minute long episodes) purely about pure insanity about a high school girl with a head so empty you'll wonder how she ever got to high school, and if she even has a functioning brain stem.\\n\\n\r\nThe show primarily uses a double act style of comedy, where someone (usually Yoshiko) begins a chain of misunderstandings and high energy moments only to be counteracted by the few members of the cast who act as the straight man for a resolution to the whole thing and bring the energy back down to earth after it's spiraled out of control to astronomical proportions.\u00a0 You'd think the show would be tiring after using this routine in basically every scene, but each episode manages to bring out different situations with different members of the side cast to really create a...unique viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nI think the best part about Aho Girl is the fact that the jokes don't overstay their welcome.\u00a0 We get the setup, the buildup, a little more buildup, the payoff, end.\u00a0 It's quick, it's snappy, and it makes just enough impact for the viewer to know what's going on and potentially want to continue watching just to see what kind of shit Yoshiko's gonna bring the rest of the cast into.\u00a0 So as a result, the show feels refreshing and is honestly quite amusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Quick, snappy comedy\\n\r\n+ Jokes don't overstay their welcome\\n\r\n+/- Comedy is subjective\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Hanabatake Yoshiko, the Aho Girl herself, is no doubt the show's biggest selling point as not only is she the titular character, but her character is so devoid of intelligent or rational thoughts that it's a wonder how a character like this hasn't really been advertised like her.\u00a0 A simple creature with an extreme fondness for bananas, Yoshiko spends the entire series dragging in practically every member of the cast into her brainless schemes, usually dramatizing everything up to the payoff for the sake of comedy.\u00a0 As expected her character both doesn't change and is incapable of change, but has a nice healthy dose of comeuppance to counteract the crazy shit and splintering headaches that she gives to those around her who have even half of a working brain.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Aktsu Akuru, the show's primary straight man and childhood friend to Yoshiko.\u00a0 As a man who primarily focuses his time on studying, Akuru is a character who is completely out of fucks to give, easily giving into his temperament when it comes to what Yoshiko does in order to try and involve him with things.\u00a0 So I guess he's kinda stupid for falling for that so many times...\u00a0 Which actually brings up a very good point.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show does follow the style of a double act, everyone in this show has a few screws loose, and the straight men as a result have problems maintaining their position given the state of the situation spiraling out of at hand.\u00a0 Each member of the side cast brings their own brand of insanity from stalker, to lonely and needy housewife, an intelligent dog, to even comedically branded learning disabled children (poor Ruri), mixing around who is involved in what situation so we get to see how some of these characters react with others, and wait and see to witness what in the hell we're about to see in front of us.\u00a0 They're wacky, they're nonsensical, and quite honestly, that's what makes them at the very least fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Strange yet fun cast\\n\r\n-\u00a0 No one is safe from stupidity.\u00a0 NO ONE!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Diomedia, the art for Aho Girl really isn't that noteworthy.\u00a0 It's of decent quality and has enough to it so that you're aware with what's going on, but the nitty gritty of it has very few interesting things to tell.\u00a0 This is most likely because the characters are so animated and bounce all over the place that any additional effort on the quality of the art would increase the amount of work needed to produce the show.\u00a0 Really though, it's not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show has only one track to show for itself.\u00a0 Its OP named \"Zenryoku\u2606Summer!\" is a sporadic, nonsensical, fast piece that...for some reason sounds like it veers into like three different genres of music.\u00a0 It's such a weird piece that I can't help but call it memorable simply for that reason alone.\u00a0 It's not actually that bad either, and it's very fitting.\u00a0 It's just...I don't have words to make of it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: As someone who read and enjoyed its source material, Aho Girl is a very faithful replication of the 4-koma with the right amount of insanity added in to have it make absolutely no sense, yet somehow still be interesting yet fun to watch.\u00a0 I'm a simple person, I like stupid shit, so yes, I did giggle like a schoolgirl watching the sheer lack of brain cells and logic leaps that these failures as human beings showcased in their daily lives.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 My favorite parts involve the disciplinary committee chairwoman.\u00a0 I find it amusing seeing a character fall from grace all because of one person and the kind of depravity they fall into without knowing the full extent of their descent from the moral high ground.\u00a0 Also the dog.\u00a0 The dog is great.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nYoshiko.\u00a0 To be fair, I believe you're supposed to hate her because she's the epitome of 'dumb' but still acts all high and mighty sometimes to an almost annoying degree only to get comeuppance later by Akuru later so she can't bask in her self-satisfaction.\u00a0 Or something.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nIf you want some quick and stupid comedy, this is a perfect fit.\u00a0 It definitely is a 'turn off your brain' show, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\u00a0 The show was made purely for entertainment reasons, so watching something dumb for the sake of getting a good chuckle is good enough in my book.\u00a0 Plus, you'll probably never find this many characters with this much lacking thinking power in one place again.\u00a0 So that's something.",

            "content": "Aho girl is, well, literally what the name implies. It's about a very, VERY stupid girl who sort of causes misery to everyone around her. \r\nNow, I only started watching this anime the other day, expectations sort of low, and was very surprised by how funny this anime actually is. The humor can be random, but it's a hilarious sort of random. I legitimately had to pause a few times because I was laughing too hard. Each episode is only 12 minutes long, with 3-4 separate segments and they're nearly all winners every episode. \r\nThere's Yoshiko, our main character, who's unsurprisingly, well, stupid. She's blunt,hyper, and at moments, obnoxious in a good way. Then, we have her childhood friend, Akutsu, who I would've called a 'tsundere' but he genuinely seems to loathe Yoshiko with a passion so that wouldn't quite fit. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI honestly dunno if 'romance' really fits this anime, given how uninterested he seems. But then again, I haven't read the manga so maybe he starts to develop feelings for her later. Another thing is, nearly everyone in this show seems to wanna get in his pants, including Yoshiko's newfound delinquent bro ;). \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character would HAVE to be Yoshiko's mom. She's...something else. I can't say much without spoiling, but she's so utterly scummy and I adore her so much. \\n\\n\r\n(Also, heavy props to Yoshiko's voice actress, because holy shit. Sometimes just the way she delivers a line makes a joke 100% funnier.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for something with no plot, an idiot for a main character, and all-around hilarity, then Aho girl is definitely for you! \\n",

            "content": "Aho-girl is a series I nearly gave up on after the first two episodes - it's a 4-koma adaptation with short episodes and very random, sometimes outright dumb humour. The titular character, \"idiot girl\" named Yoshiko, is often more annoying than funny and her writing only at rare occasions reaches the witty and surprising qualities I would expect from a series in this formula. However, the more action focuses on the supporting cast and the protagonist Akkun, the more compelling it becomes. After five episodes, I have to admit that I had some decent laughs and even enjoyed re-watching earlier episodes while knowing a bitmore context to the story and roles certain characters would take on later.\\n\\n\r\nSome reviews here points to Akkuns \"violence\" against Yoshiko (and rarely other women) and interprets the show as misogynist - I think it's an obvious misreading, as all those scenes are in the formula of slapstick comedy and shouldn't be taken literally. There's also a bit of sexual humour, with Yoshiko trying to \"seduce\" Akkun in various, absurd ways, but I find it all less questionable than typical fanservice in many comedy anime titles (and here it's always part of the gag rather than actual fanservice). Parts of the humour might be off-putting to some, but I think it would be unfair to reject the whole series based on those fragments and I personally didn't mind them, outside of the somewhat-gross last episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I was very much sceptical about this series when I first encountered it, but I think that later in the season it really starts working well as a quick, absurd comedy it's ought to be. It's not for everyone and I was still sometimes disappointed by the quality of the writing, but it was also able to positively surprise me with some more creative gags. It might not be a must-watch, but still worth giving it a try, at least to find whether its kind of over-the-top absurdity appeals to you.",

            "content": "Aho Girl is a VERY good at dumb jokes. It is willing to split your sides open if you are in the mood for its particular type of humor. It is VERY bad at anything else.\r\nIf you don't laugh at fart jokes, then this show will be less entertaining than turning your monitor off for 12 minutes at a time.\r\nOn the assumption you are on the mood for Tom and Jerry, but from Japan, I would rate it as follows:\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nNot only are the characters a fitting type of absurd, but they work together amazingly, giving the show the perfect pieces to use for anyjoke it wants to make. Motivations are slowly provided to make sure that its maniacs and basket cases feel much more believable than plenty of story-focus anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThe writing, direction, and timing of each sketch are quite good, and most of the gags are endearing. It is almost a master of joke length that a stand-up comedian would use, with the ability to use much more visuals to sell the details. It is, however, very vulnerable to saturation, and watching only 1-2 episodes at a time is strongly recommended to prevent viewer burnout.\\n\\n\r\nIts central problem is that it requires at least a young adult's patience, but a juvenile sense of humor, along with a tolerance for panty shots, but also readiness for none of its echi to be at all attractive.\\n\\n\r\nIf have managed to be eager for a show with all 4 of those things, this show will be a solid 10 for you. Its problem is that anyone without those incredibly specific preferences will enjoy the show a lot less, and that it thus has nothing to offer most viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound design does a good job of supporting the jokes, and doesn't pretend it is good to punctuate a punchline with a sound. Unfortunately, the sound track never breaks away to carry a segment. The closest it comes to \"greatness\" when Aoi Yuuki flexes on the haters in the OP, and the 2-3 times she shifts her voice for more than a few sentences.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe visuals match the tone of the show, and the animators clearly knew what show kind of show they were making. They competently portray and support the jokes, but don't strike out to reinvent the wheel or present any highly fluid animation or amazing backgrounds. Bog standard modern anime style.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nThe plot synopsis: Characters do thing, and meet new character. Audience laughs.\\n\r\nIt's never more deep than that. The progression is enough to verify that they are presented in the right order, but nothing more than that. There is no great overarching narrative or deeper meaning to the conglomeration of ~5 minute sketches that this anime is made of.",

            "content": "AHO GARU!!!!!!Well, it's exactly what it is, a girl who lacks the proper IQ, but then again , It's GOOD!!!!!! Cu'z it did deliver the laughs, not bad for an anime that only runs half the time of that of regular anime, let's git er don as Larry the Cable Guy would say:\r\nStory, Poor 3.\r\nOk, so it was funny, it was entertaining, when we see Yoshiko Hanabatake, get punched, kicked, lambasted and all kinds of violence against women that one can imagine by her childhood sweetheart , Akun, frankly the concept is a feminist's worse nightmare and when they watched this, there is no doubtthat they would be coming to Japan , to hunt down this original creator, Hiroyuki to give him the same kind of violence that women experiences on a daily basis and I kinda agree, since it was kinda shallow to use it as it's shallow plot and quite frankly, them feminist would kinda brand the creator as a chauvinist, since the main character, Yoshiko was presented as a lowly animal who has all kinds of appalling traits, where it's ok for her take all the abuse that she get's form Akin and the worse part was, she likes it. Not a very good thing for an anime/manga to rely on.  \\n\\n\r\nArt, Poor 3. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so the school uniform for girls is hot, there is the quintessential Zettai Ryoki on Sayaka Sumino, panty hose on Fuki Incho and her boobs, there is the bikini fanservice, where Yoshiko wore it good, but WTF, why is the shinpantsu only limited to Yoshiko  and no shinpantsu on Sayaka, Fuuka Incho and those 3 gayru bitches, also those 3 gayru bitches don't look like a bunch of gyarus, in fact why the fuck were they even call that when they don't dress the part? Main reason for the score.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nOk so the seiyus who did Yosiko and Sayaka's voice were ok, but it kinda makes them sound like a retard, also the seiyu's who did Akun's voice sounded too manly, Fuuka on the other hand was just too mature , however seiyu Hikasa Yoko's voiced did played well for being Yoshiko's mom, since she does have that mature voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk so Yoshiko often get's the full blunt of Akun's ire, but ya know what, she maybe a victim of his violence, but the again she can make him cry uncle if she wants to, that's is if she wants to, since she just too stupid to even realized it and just too manly in love that she just become's sooo masochistic, but ya know you gotta hand it to her, what she lack s in the IQ department, she makes it up with guts, high tolerance for pain, unwavering confidence, spunk, thinking way tooo ridiculous outside of the box, and being friendly even thought she gets a lotta flak from those 3 gyaru bitches. Akun or Akutsu Akuru, is every feminist's nightmare, he is a typical guy who is presented as an achiever but an epitome of a spouse abuser, however he just wanna be left alone, since we did see on the last episode that he never actually likes her and prefer to be a herbivore, which is a ridicules  Jap term for a guy who prefers to be single for life, but much to his chargin , Yosihiko basically is giving him a life outside of the monotony that he prefers, too bad as the quintessential oblivious guy she doesn't realize that. as for Sayaka Sumino, too bad she has to be this wife material for Akun who probably will never happen, cu'z Akun is just too serious about being an achiever and there is Yoshiko's mom who is around to keep anybody else from being Akun's wife. Also, about the stalker girl Fuuka Iincho, it was kinda funny that she has to deal with Yoshiko's mom, but that as good as her role gets.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it is what the title said it would be, it was  funny to say the laest, especially when Yoshiko was able to get around certain thing were she can make anybody (except for Akun) turn tables on them, so....\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all GOOD!!!!!! Season 2????Why Not.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl OUT!!!!!          \\n",

            "content": "Just a reminder that i had no intentions in watching Aho girl in the first place as just reading the title alone already made me thinks that its one of those shows that are not worth my time at all. The reason i made a decision to watch it is because a friend of mine always telling me to give it a try because apparently  its one of the funniest commedy anime to date. Well guess what? i was absolutely disappointed from the begining until the end and right now im going to write a review according to what i think about Aho Girlaka Stupid Girl\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nwhat story? since this is a comedy anime there is no story at all. if i actually want to give a brief explanation on what you are going to expect, its about an absurd and remarkably stupid girl (hence the title of the show) named Yoshiko who has an IQ less than the emoji movie's rotten tomatoes ratings that apparently suffers mental disorders. The reason why i mentioned this is because she is really that stupid always makes dumb decisions which could left the viewers disgusted. the entire show revolves around her insane daily lives with her friends who also had absurd personalities which i will cover later in the characters section. and thats about it. each episode is relatively short which lasts for about 10 minutes in total and is divided into specific sketch sections and they are all the same. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing much to be said here since the artstyle is just plain to look at. i do kinda like the character's designs though especially the girls. They looked really great most of the times. Overall, its your standard animated artstyle that you had already seen several times in dozens of anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIm going to start with the openings and endings. As for the former, well you could say that its the only good thing from the show. I do appreciate the animators who creating a distinctive version for each of the episodes meaning that the sequence animations of the OP will change from 1 episode to the next but the song still remains the same. The ending song on the other hand  basicially just merges with the ending sequences in every episode. Voice acting is pretty standard for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThis is like one of a few comedy anime that i found the characters loathful and had no substance at all. Especially the queen of idiots, Yoshiko aka the monkey who cant think wisely than a 6 year old child because basically she is a teenager with mind of a child heck even some children are far more intelligent than her. She is the childhood friend of Akutsu ( A-kun for short) also one of the main character who dont have any friends because the grim expression that he always potray which makes others to stay away from him and seemed to keeps continuing abusing yoshiko whenever she did something idiotic. Now many people would think that its unjustified for him to always hit her whenever he can but if you think about it,no matter what you say to her, it will always comes out from her ears so hitting her might be the only way to shut her up. HOWEVER, he does not need to act rude to his other friends for no reason especially Sumino, the only normal person out of the cast. While she is a kind girl and always wanted to sort problems out i found her quite unnecessary to the show as everything that she did always ended up with a failure. The other side characters are just there without contributing anything to the show at all. The only characters that i like are A- kun's little sister and the dog. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI do admit that i chuckled a bit in the first early episodes but thats about it. There is almost nothing in this show that is universally funny. when i said universal im talking about slapstick comedy which majority of the people will find it hilarious but the usage of it in this show is absolutely very low effort to the point it becomes irritating and extremely repetitive. Yeah we get it that the monkey likes to eat bananas. yeah we get it that the monkey loves to show her panties to A-kun like heck. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nSo far this is by far one of the worse comedy anime ive ever watched and that is saying something as i found the anime Cells at Work even funnier than this unpolished turd. I'll rate it a 5/10",

It follows the life of a mentally disabled girl who tries to get through life (mainly with bananas) and shows us in great detail her triumphs and failures. \r\nYoshiko (god bless her) is a sweet and loving character despite her mentally challenged mind, however most people in this series find her repugnant and unbearable to be around. Nevertheless, she has Akutsu to look out for her in his own tsundere ways and she even has a friend suprisingly. If you want to be taken on a deep emotional train ride then I recommend youwatch this series and experience this sad tale yourself.",

It can be, but there's a fine line between dumb fun and just plain dumb. Aho Girl is definitely the latter. This anime is the sitcom of comedy anime. I almost feel like there should be a laugh track played after everytime Yoshiko gets punched, flashes her panties, wants a banana, etc. The comedy in this show is really obsessed with telling the audience \"this is the funny part, laugh please.\" \r\nEven the \"level-headed\" character (Akutsu) is pretty stupid/annoying in his own right.Somehow I feel like he's more retarded than the main girl. He really doesn't offer much besides beating the ever living shit out of Yoshiko and then apologizing occasionally so we can pretend that there's actually some progression. This anime is pretty unfunny and mind numbing. You'll probably enjoy it if you're into minion-tier slap stick humor and need more seasonal anime crammed down your throat but this isn't for me.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

And I like it (in some way), but, if take this serious, it's absurd.\r\nYou can judge yourself: the plot is almost missing, all situations are cliche, characters are flat and show no progress at all, lame animation and sound. No pros at all (this is not true), but still I am glad that I watch it.\r\nBecause you can have fun, all the situations in which our heroes take part are absurd, our heroes are absurd (nothing new for anime) and ... and something else is absurd too. All at the screenare unrealistic, exaggerating and chaotic. And it's the main thing that makes you watch it, you can not possibly predict what will happen next moment, even if you had some crazy way of thinking. The anime did not afraid to do controversial things, but at the same time, they are not overly lewd. This is not ecchi, even if we have here some kind of harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is all about our aho-girl - Yoshiko, really stupid girl. But she is energetic, positive, enduring and ... dumb. And all the energy she wastes is her \"great\" ideas and is trying to get to A-kun's heart. Yoshiko is the main engine of the show, but there is also a perverted head of the school board, a really nice girl (only one normal) and a set of other plain but fun-delivering characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnime consists of short episodes with even shorter skits. They are all fun because we all love to watch some stupid people and hear primitive jokes. But it is better to have a mood for this. So stop taking staff seriously and try to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to say if you like it, because, well, it's a stupid anime, even if it is intentionally.",

Needless to say, it's funny as hell.\r\nThe story for Aho Girl is... well pretty much nothing. It's just a slice of life about an \"aho girl\". There is a narrative, sort of, but it's more of a way of organizing the madness that ensues in the 12 minute episodes.\r\nThe art is amazing. It provides hilarious visual comedy and mocks/parodies other anime, especially JoJo. Not to mention, on the accidental and rare occurrence of me seeing part of the intro,I actually had a good time. The intros are funny too!\\n\\n\r\nThe \"aho girl\" is annoying. This is to be expected though, so I don't think it's all bad. \\n\\n\r\nI like the characters. They're all well thought out. The hyperbolic, explosive behaviors of the main duo work wondrously together. The side characters are funny too. The 'booby president' becomes a good source of comedy while best-girl Sayaka is the most sane person in the entire series. She's also soft spoken, so believe me, she doesn't do much to stop the main duo.\\n\\n\r\nI had a great time watching this anime. Unlike some other comedy anime, this one knows its place. Something as wacky as this is SUPPOSED to be shorter than 24 minutes. If you drag an anime like this on for the length of a plot-driven anime, it will quickly become as boring as a box of flaccid dicks. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 10 and 12 are really great watches even if you don't plan to tune in to the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Well, this was certainly a strange one. I can't really put it into words, but I have to since I decided to make a review of it. I will have to do my best to describe characters without spoiling too much, but as soon as certain characters are introduced, you're already pretty familiar with them, so there's not much to spoil for an anime like this.\r\nAho-Girl is one of the most peculiar anime I have seen in a while. It follows the blatantly bizarre adventures of Yoshiko as she attempts to make the life of her childhood friend, Akutsu, a living hell. And it seemsto take a liking to latching onto common mental illnesses or idiosyncrasies that are found in certain humans; of which, Yoshiko exploits quite frequently, often inadvertently, as she often does so well she's expressing her curiosities on certain matters.\\n\\n\r\nYoshiko has one friend at school, Sayaka, who seems to have a strange attachment to Yoshiko where she will tolerate everything she puts her through just to see if it makes her a better person, despite how much it bemoans her. And she is willing to even shatter the mentality of the few sane people in the anime, such as Akutsu, whom she was willing to call a sadistic and rude person for not going on a trip with her to the beach, being completely oblivious to the hell Yoshiko puts him through everyday. I am uncertain how her character complements the anime, but as I go on, it's hard to really grasp how they use character archetypes at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe last significant character in the anime who regularly appears in Yoshiko's group is Fuuki, whose obsession with Akutsu results in her completely losing her common sense and doing absurd things on the whim of Yoshiko. She is very visibly tsundere, but is also mildly insane. At one instance, Sayaka had an intervention with her and nearly shattered her mentality by telling her that everything she was doing to Akutsu was wrong. She then said \"just kidding\" and immediately reverted Fuuki back to her ludicrous nature.\\n\\n\r\nBesides those three girls, other characters are often swept up into the mix and their mental problems, too, are often obvious and out in the open. It's really an anime where, as you continue watching, you go \"who will Yoshiko mess up next\" and the result is almost always the same. She meets someone, they come off as a pretty normal person and Yoshiko, through the sheer willpower of her curiosity, manages to break them. Even her own mother has some messed up things about her, though you would expect that due to the nature of Yoshiko herself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even poor Akutsu is not alone. Probably the most sane out of the entire cast, his problem is that he became a sadist thanks to Yoshiko not enduring any of his punishments and him believing there's genuinely no hope for her. His is the only one you can't really get mad at since he was driven to it out of the overbearing nature of Yoshiko taking advantage of his generally weak physique and literally abducting him to go play. And at one point, even physically raping him by making out with him for a quarter of a minute, well they were both still children. The worst part is that, even after stressing his body to its absolute limits to get stronger than her, he wound up getting sick and was unable to achieve his goal until he got much older, where the mental wounds had already begun to lie dormant.\\n\\n\r\nI still am unsure if I can even recommend this anime to anyone, but one thing is for sure, you should avoid recommending it to anyone who is still new to anime or else they may or may not be ruined by Aho-Girl since it could either make someone fall in love with the stuff or hate it. Truly, even after writing all of this, I am at a loss of words and can not properly describe what the anime's goal is. It's just Yoshiko having fun and messing people up. But, I can't deny you will laugh a ton well watching it.",

It has a lot of potential... I could not f**king sleep because i wanted more story ... And that the reason why igive it only 7. It is funny, it has good jokes, but I got feeling that it is not pure comedy show as intended, but comedy show with good story premise which was wasted.",

            "content": "Comedy comes in many forms, from witty satire to slapstick, sitcom and more.  Some of these subgenres produce shows which you can enjoy proudly or openly without fear of judgement. Aho Girl is not one of those shows. In fact, it might be the dumbest and most immature anime I\u2019ve seen since Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan, which is saying a lot. That probably sounds like a bad thing, but I found this show hilarious.\r\nAs the title suggests, the show is about a girl, Yoshiko, who\u2019s somewhat of a moron, frequently scoring 0s on tests and being pretty much incapable of functioning like a normal humanbeing. But what what she lacks in conventional intelligence, she more than makes up for with her boundless energy and enthusiasm and her absurd, yet often profound reasoning that frequently criticises and questions the nature of accepted social norms, albeit completely unintentionally on her part.  This is a girl who I might describe as being a cross between Mako Mankanshoku and Karl Pilkington, and the chaos she creates is a thing of beauty to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018other\u2019 main character is Akutsu, the unwitting and unfortunate object of Yoshiko\u2019s affection, who is otherwise an intelligent, if socially inept high school student. If you\u2019ve ever seen The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, you\u2019ll be familiar with the dynamic between him and Yoshiko, as it\u2019s in many ways similar to Kyon and Haruhi, and it\u2019s a formula that I feel works very well.  There\u2019s also a fair number of supporting characters whose interactions with Yoshiko and Akutsu fuel some of the funnier gags throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nBeing an adaptation of a 4-koma manga, Aho Girl is very much a gag comedy, featuring a sequence of shorter sketches over the course of each 12-minute episode with only minimal continuity between them. Some of these sketches have their own, unique style independent from the rest of the show, particularly when parodying another show, something Aho Girl does a number of times to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you enjoy Aho Girl likely depends on whether you like absurd, over-the-top slapstick humour. As a fan of that, I think this is great.  If I had any criticisms, it\u2019d be that while many of the gags are hilarious, some of them got a bit repetitive or weren\u2019t that great to begin with, but overall I\u2019d say this is very much worth the watch.",

            "content": "Aho Girl combines original jokes with a strong visual presentation, well executed comedic timing and a spotless soundtrack to create one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen.\r\nYour enjoyment of this series hinges upon whether you love or hate Yoshiko, the idiot girl. Yoshiko is a genuine self-proclaimed idiot with a ridiculous sense of pride and confidence. The other MC, Akuru, is her childhood \"friend\", and plays quite the perfect fold to her. We are shortly introduced to a few more high-school aged characters, Yoshiko's mom and Akuru's little sister, and even though all of their personalities and chemistries mix and match perfectly tocreate interesting comedic angles and combinatios, the most important character dynamic is between Yoshiko and Akuru.\\n\\n\r\nAkuru has had to suffer from Yoshiko's idiocy, invasion of privacy and sexual harassment from a very young age, which has turned him into a cold and cynical person with a short temper. Yoshiko on the other hand hasn't matured at all, but her sincere enthusiasm makes her very good at manipulating the people around her. Many jokes start with Yoshiko planting her idiotic plans and ideas into other people's heads, people following through with Yoshiko's ideas, and having Akuru (or one of the few other sane characters) put a stop to all the idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is also perfect, with a somewhat even split between absurd caricature-like characters and their more sane counterparts. Akuru's little sister is a perfectly absurd character. Despite putting a lot of effort into her studies, and obviously having a good home environment, she is as bad at studies as Yoshiko, despite acting a like a straight character. Her contempt for idiocy makes her despise Yoshiko, but her self-loathing makes her hate her brother as well. The \"Boob President\" is another hilarious example, but I wouldn't want to explain all the jokes to you.\\n\\n\r\nIn general this series' style of comedy is best described as absurdist. Each episode is full of explosive humour and equally explosive visuals. All of the running jokes evolve perfectly and feel fresh throughout the entire season. Despite the show's short running time, it introduces quite a large cast of equally funny characters, and they are always put into new and interesting situations.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl has great writing, great direction style and motifs. It has absurd and perfectly timed jokes about bananas, pants, boobs, and failing at life. I can't imagine a more perfect comedy.",

This anime have a Weird connection(the dumb girl love the smartest guy).\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is normal i like the details and i dont have much more too say\r\nSound:\r\nThe Opening is bad for my opinion because it only shows aho girl title and then every episode a diferent thing happen (EX: Yoshikowith a A-Kun pillow and he grab her and then Fuuki Iinchou appear and have a nose bleed because the other side of the pillow is A-Kun almost naked.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI love Fuuki Iinchou because she has calm as the president of the council and then when she look at A-kun (A-kun is Akutsu, Akuru by the way) and then fell in love for him. She next to that day she turns in a Stalker and Obsessive (not yandare). \\n\\n\r\nYoshiko is dumb but likes banana and his love with A-kun is cool too but for my opinion i prefer Fuuki with A-kun.She is a dum girl that win a race riding a giant dog.\\n\\n\r\nAkuru is super smart but i dont like very well hes \"Anti-Social\" and \"Rage\" Personality.I like that he likes the Yoshiko dog and they both have a connection because the dog is the only \"Thing\" that understands Akuru.\\n\\n\r\nSumino, Sayaka is calm and cool and i dont know why but i think its almost the same as lucy heartfilia (Fairy Tail) with the diferent that Sayaka doesnt have Boobs. Sayaka is the calm that always are in the middle of stupid moments and she gets drunk so easily (by the smell of alcholol).\\n\\n\r\nHanabatake, Yoshie just want 1 things: that is dumb daughter marry with a-kun and she fights against everyone that is against that wish (example the love of fuuki.)\\n\\n\r\nAkutsu, Ruri is sister of A-kun but isnt smart as him but still smartest as Yoshiko.\\n\\n\r\nKurosaki, Ryuuichi is just nobody that want to be A-kun friend and sees Yoshiko and a Fellow companion to obey.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI have see a Anime that had a lot of deaths and i was sad because of that but then i had see Aho Girl and i had stop thinking about that and I like very much soo i recomend to people who had watch a sad anime and want to see a comedy one to \"Relax\"\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Akuru is the male lead of the anime and he is a friend to Yoshiko but he does end up hitting her and stuff because of her stupidity he is a pretty much a study person at heart so doesn't have that or any friends expect for her otherwise hes a pretty nice character. Fuuki is a supporting character and is part of a committee of the school she also falls in love with Akuru to the point of stalking him and such shes a pretty nice character though. Sayaka is another supporting character and she is a pretty nice and pretty shy (in my eyes) character nothing really else to say about her.

Each episode only runs 12 minutes, which is a plus if you're low on free time. \r\nFirstly, let's talk about Yoshiko. Our lovable protagonist is a teenage girl with an IQ about half her age. Or does she? Most likely. In spite of this she's more dynamic than her gag of having ahead running on empty (anime review!) While I'm dissuaded from mentioning spoilers on here, I will say that there are several segments in the second half of the series where Yoshiko shows off her witty side. The fact that she possesses such moments makes the show more engaging for me. Still I wouldn't really describe her or any of the other characters as deep, but they perform their respective roles well.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Akuru Akutsu, better known as A-kun. I have mixed feelings towards this character. Being the straight man in this comedy, he's a good foil to Yoshiko's wild and thoughtless behavior. Although later episodes shed light on his hostile behavior towards Yoshiko, I find it rather off-putting. This is an issue I have with many anime, especially when it's played for comedic purposes. I have little interest in seeing a character getting punched or kicked multiple times in an episode simply for having a goofy attitude. That's not to say there aren't times when I can understand A-kun's pent up frustration. I quite like Yoshiko, but she definitely lacks boundaries. Still A-kun is overly stiff and has weak emotional intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are alright albeit less memorable for me. A-kun's sister also shows a nice contrast with Yoshiko. Though she has similarities with our Aho protagonist, I like the her more serious, perhaps more mature outlook on life. Sayaka, who appears to be a fan favorite is probably the only character in the show with whom I'd feel comfortable going to have dinner. She's level headed and maintains decorum most of the characters lack. And to round out this not so subtle harem around A-kun is Iinchou, the class rep. Honestly I don't have much to say about her. She's okay. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters (that matter) are Yoshiko's mother, a delinquent named Ryuuichi, and a large white dog. Yoshiko's mom is something of a gold-digging psycho. Ryuuichi has a sweet side, which is nice, but he lacked screen-time. If I had to pick an overall favorite character it would probably be Dog. Yes, that's the name of the big white dog (it was named by Yoshiko, go figure). Despite being an animal, Dog is shown to be a kind, brave, and thoughtful individual.  \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song has a fitting goofiness to it, which I found enjoyable. The animation quality is fairly standard for the current year. Characters are well differentiated but likability is hit and miss. The jokes are mostly good, although the violence, especially early on is a bit needless, but still somewhat better handled than your usual punch a character at the drop of a hat behavior so common in comedy based anime. \\n\\n\r\nAho girl is a good show. It's dumb, but not sloppy. If you're looking for some laughs maybe this will hit the spot? So grab a banana and settle in for the evening. Just don't put off studying for any upcoming multiple choice tests, unless you're competing with Yoshiko in the aho world cup. \\n\\n\r\n....... are you still reading this? Why? Look! A flying banana!",

            "content": "Aho Girl: short review.\r\nPositives:\r\nHad funny moments - Some scenes did make me laugh, but humour is a subjective thing.\r\nShort episodes - about 10 mins excluding opening, so makes it easier to watch or to fit into people's busy lives if they want to watch the show. Or to make your MAL bigger without as much commitment as a normal show, if you are one of those people.\r\nMakes some good gifs - You can basically watch all the best parts of the show in different gifs that you'll see around the internet, if you don't have time to watch the show.\r\nNegatives\r\nMain female character (Yoshiko) - Canbe overly annoying instead of funny, and the anime will be based a lot around her so if you can't handle her, its best to stop as you'll only see her more.\\n\\n\r\nNo story - You don't always get a lot of story with comedy animes but with Aho Girl there really is no story apart from Yoshiko does something stupid and here's the outcome of that. \\n\\n\r\nNot positive or negative:\\n\\n\r\nOther characters - Other characters are easier to handle than Yoshiko and not as annoying, but also won't be as memorable as her.\\n\\n\r\nArt style - A subjective thing but to me there is nothing wrong/outdated with. Probably a style that most people will be just fine with.\\n\\n\r\nOpening song - A silly song, but not one that is so bad that you'll have to skip it everytime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: Proceed with Caution.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl isn't an anime I can just say \"I can recommend it\" or \"I can't recommend it\". Some people will just hate Yoshiko and that will be the end of the series for them. My advice will be give the first episode a shot and if you think that you can't handle Yoshiko for all 12 episodes, then drop the show and move on. Personally, there is a lot of \"just okay\" things about the show. That are just fine and that is enough for this particular show. I don't think this is a comedy show that would make it into a top 10 funniest or best comedy anime list for most people. There are other shows that are not just comedy based that do comedy better in my opinion. But for what its worth, I found the show to be fine and that was enough for me.",

            "content": "It's a very simple comedy with a simple premise, there's nothing particularly outstanding about it.\r\nBut that's what makes Aho Girl one of the funnest shows to keep up with of the Summer 2017 season. Its joke structure while not always funny is flashy enough to keep the viewer interested visually that it doesn't really matter whether you find the actual show funny. The show itself works in skits (think Nichijou or Lucky Star), making sure that if you don't find a premise entertaining that it's probably gonna be over in 2 minutes anyway.\r\nThe premise of the actual show is essentially that Yoshiko Hanabatake is anidiot. She's a weirdo who's only passions in life are the male lead (i'll get to him in a second) and bananas. She gets other weirdos like herself involved in her idiocy, and hilarity ensues. The covers call all the bases you'd expect in typical fashion of a show like this. The male lead (Akuru Akatsu) is a 'no-nonsense' boy who goes to the same school as Yoshiko only because the more prestigious school he wanted to go to was too far away for him to make a daily commute. Yoshiko thinks he's madly in love with him. Yoshiko's mom wants him to madly in love with her. I think saying anymore would be spoiling it for you, but I don't think you'll find a character archetype you want missing from the show. \\n\\n\r\nEverything about it is for the sake of fun, for the sake of enjoying the viewer. That's great! You can definitely take my word for it that Aho Girl is worth checking out this season if you need a new comedy anime to check out.",

            "content": "This is a comedy anime that focuses on a guy who has to constantly deal with the stupid shenanigans of his friend, a stupid girl who loves bananas. The thing that stands out about this is that instead of the guy being hit, it's actually the male MC hitting the girl. That does seem wrong when you hear it the first time around, but it's actually pretty funny once you get to watch it.\r\nTo begin, there's not much of a story. It goes along the lines of the main heroine doing something stupid that makes male MC hit her because he's annoyed. There's different situationslike when she acts childish, gropes someones big breasts, says something stupid, but they all lead to the same outcome. A big punch to the face.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like that kind of stuff then this is for you. There's also gags and jokes involving the other characters and that's equally funny.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they're all likable in a way. You can pity Akutsu kun (male MC) for having to deal with a stupid girl every day, laugh at what the banana loving girl does (heroine), it doesn't matter. There's always that one trait you'll like about the character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound on the other hand, are plain and simple. The OP seems like it's trying hard to be funny, and the art is kind of meh when compared to other anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, you should watch this anime if you just want to relax and have a good time. I mean, the episodes are only 12 minutes long, so it doesn't really leave a dent in your spare time. Just be aware that the comedy does get repetitive, at least for me, but I think that's just my own bias because I read some of the comments and people said they enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you like ridiculous comedy, guys hitting girls for once (not as bad as it sounds), and an overall decent time, then Aho Girl will definitely satisfy you.",

Each episode is split into several, disconnected episodes with simple plots to drive the humour. The story is mediocre at best and characters are archetypes to a fault. \r\nUltimately, the portrayal of genders is one of my main gripes. The main character, the only male in more than four or five \"mini episodes\", is seen as rational, intelligent, cold, and uncaring of anything that isn't academics. Almost every female (with one notable exception) in this show comes across as incredibly stupid, boy crazy, or manipulative. I can't help hatingthe show a bit for that. Additionally, the main girl's voice will probably grate on your ears within an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said, I couldn't refrain from smiling through the episodes. This anime falls under the \"so bad it's actually good\" category of entertainment. If you like watching bad shows for laughs and can handle cringe, this show may be enjoyable to you.",

            "content": "If you're like me, you just saw some of the YouTube clips of Akun destroying thots and decided to jump in from there. It was mostly in between the Spring and Summer 2018 anime season for me, so I was looking for something fun and lighthearted to watch to fill the gap I have in simulcasts before Overlord or Attack on Titan S3 come out. Honestly, I'm not sure what the fuck I just watched.\r\nThe story revolves around Yoshino, a dumb girl, and her childhood friend Akun. While Akun is a major part, moreso, Yoshino actually seems to be the central character for the show.I wasn't expecting each episode to be so short, but with the simplicity of the show and it's continuous gags it actually works in the show's favor.\\n\\n\r\nIn the spirit of such a short show, I will also keep a short review and actually go by the categories for once:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Virtually nonexistent, but that's not to it's detriment. There's no real \"progress\" in the show other than better understanding Akun and Yoshino's relationship, and the introduction to new characters. This feels more like an introduction to the manga, although now that all the set piecing is done, I'd heartily welcome a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I actually have a friend who refuses to watch this due to the the animations seeming \"uncanny,\" however I never felt this. Actually, I think some animation are overdone for how simple of an anime it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music, while simple, was actually done pretty well to set the mood. Some \"battle scenes\" seemed ripped straight from shounen, while the idle background songs sounded like they were out of Persona 5 occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Pretty stereotypical. There's a nice girl, a pervert girl, a dumb girl, a dumb guy, and then the Akun whose a prick. Actually, the children characters that Yoshino interacts with and the dog are actually more developed than you'd expect them to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really liked this anime, but I can completely tell it's because it \"hit the spot\" for what I was looking for. It's nothing special, but it really was a fun and lighthearted show when I was looking for just that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: You're not getting the Shakespeare of anime here, but it's a lighthearted comedy, with some good situational comedy that comes off higher than a regular sitcom, but not quite the same as a quirky dramedy. I'd give it a recommendation if you're just looking for an anime to fill your time with quickly.",

            "content": "Oh man, where do I begin with this review because honestly, I do not know. Aho girl is something. Like I watched it because I was just curious about it. I mean an anime where the girl is stupid like EXTREMELY stupid and a childhood friend who has to deal with her. Sounds interesting at least. You can picture some crazy antics happening.  \r\nI would have to say that this anime is mediocre at best. It is a comedy anime but the comedy it exhibits, are like one-liners and mainly has to do with something about love or sex. Or heck its both atthe same time. I guess it is okay to use those things a couple of times but to me, after a while, it got kind of old and cringey. I don't remember if I actually laughed a lot while watching this anime (mainly because I had to put off finishing this anime for a while because I was busy with school. Like I started during the summer but didn't actually finish it until December.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nWell, the whole premise of the story is that it is about a girl who is a complete and utter idiot and her childhood friend that has to deal with her. They are in high school and they meet other people and all that. \\n\r\nSo because of a premise like that, you would imagine that there would be some weird antics that they get into. Well the antics they get into are in fact weird but they surpass weird. Like for me, it got cringey. Again tying with the fact that they used one-liners and jokes about sex and love. Another thing is that the anime relies a lot on intense movements (I guess that is how I can describe it) And at times it can be in your face. I don't know how to really describe it. \\n\\n\r\nThat is all I got to say. The story is meh. I mean every episode is divided into four parts and each part is dedicated to a different type of story so yeah...\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nOh boy... Okay, I would have to say, the characters that I liked were Akuru (the childhood friend), Ruri (Akutsu's little sister), Sayaka (their classmate) and Dog. My ultimate favorite being Dog. Everyone else I thought was okay or I just didn't like them as much. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Yoshiko, I will say right now, I did not like her that much. I mean okay she is a complete idiot (I mean the title is called Aho girl so yeah...). Actually, she surpasses the level of complete idiot. She makes complete idiots look smarter. Like she is so stupid, I am so surprised at how she is able to live for so long. Like how in the world did you get into high school??\\n\\n\r\nLike I know she is supposed to be the gag character. The character that makes the jokes. She is designed to be the stupid character so that she can administer the jokes. But the things that she says and does, at first are like completely outrageous (well they are always outrageous) but it just gets to the point where I am cringing. I am just cringing at everything that she does.\\n\\n\r\nI will give it to her that at some points that she makes a point. Like about how there is a limit to how pure a person can be in a relationship. I would have to admit she had a point. At some point, you have to do things like hold hands and kiss. Those \"unpure\" things. But other than that... honestly, I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nAnd can I just say, am I the only one that feels very bad for Akuru? I mean he had to deal with Yoshiko's shizz for the longest time. I just felt bad for him to be honest. And I liked it whenever he punched or hurt Yoshiko. Because honestly if I had to deal with someone like that, I would probably do what he did. Like seriously. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nArt was okay. Nothing really special to be honest. Character designs were generic in my opinion. Nothing really stood out from the characters visually. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNothing really special about it. The score was eh. It was okay. Not bad but not that great either. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime? At some parts I did but others not really. Majority of the time I was either cringing, or I was just like meh. Just meh. \\n\\n\r\nThat is basically how I can describe my enjoyment. Meh. This anime was meh. To be honest, I was like pushing through to finish the last few episodes. And now I can say I have watched Aho girl. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I never related to A-kun so much. You have no idea how many times I wanted to pop into the show and beat the heck out her. \r\nThe art could have been better, but it was alright to me. Not over-whelming and not belowaverage. Sound was pretty decent in their own way I guess. Character wise, anyone besides Aho-Girl is good. Although I did like the backstory on how she began to like A-kun and how his hate for her started. (Pretty sure I wanted to hop into the show and smack her). Enjoyment was alright, but I'll give it a 5 because I was just super close to smacking my face on my pc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6. I mean it's alright if you want a light-hearted show?

            "content": "Huh, this was interesting. \r\nWell, if you've read anything about this show, it's pretty obvious that the show is about an idiot girl and her adventures. I'll get right into the review.\r\nStory: I don't really know what you'd expect from this kind of show when it comes to story, seeing how it's Nichijou-esque. However, this show did have somewhat of a story for some of the episodes, which did surprise me. This \"story\" showed up by influencing the characters and their actions, instead of doing what most animes like this would have done (which is to \"reset\" to a certain point in time to makedifferent stories). Overall, story was a nice little addition to the anime, but not really developed as the anime's genre didn't allow it to be too developed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: At first glance, art in this anime seems to be generic, without anything extremely eye-catching. Well, it's like this until you get to when A-kun punching Yoshiko. When that happens, everything changes as if it's an intense fight. It's a nice part of the anime especially when you see those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I just want to say that I think sound was the 2nd best part of this anime, other than character. The voice acting was on point, and A-kun being voiced by the man who did Gintoki was one of the best choices ever. Yoshiko was also done well, getting the smug and idiotic parts of her brought out really well. I especially like the episode where Yoshiko went out to beat up all the dudes from (wait for it) Dick High School. She changed from idiot to edgy in less than a millisecond. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: So, character. Being a 12 episode anime with episodes half the length of a normal one, I found the characters to have much more depth to them than I would have initially thought. Yoshiko not only is an idiot who likes bananas, but her backstory reveals that she has infinite energy, will fight you if you talk trash about bananas, and is hard to persuade when it comes to doing a task (which is usually playing games). A-kun also shows that he basically was just a weaker and shorter version of himself in the past, since his need to study has never changed. But the best part of the anime was when the Morality President went from someone who was respectable to a stalking closet pervert. Other honorable mentions is Sayaka, who can get drunk off of fumes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime was extremely enjoyable, full of references (but not as much as Nyaruko), and scenes that make absolutely no sense. It felt like a mix between Gintama and a regular school anime. This is seen in episode 9, during the part when Yoshiko explains that women want to remember a kiss, and men want to remember a fondle. But, once you watch episode 10 and 11, you see how much the anime is inspired by other ones. Episode 10 makes fun of racing anime, using Yoshiko and the dog, and episode 11 uses a fight scene full of banana filled revenge in order to make fun of animes with intense fight scenes like JoJo and One Punch Man. \\n\\n\r\nWell, overall, this anime was a nice break from the animes that I've been watching right now. It had scenes that were self-aware at times, and had characters that all fit a cliche. In the end, all the categories combine into one really strange, but entertaining anime.",

All I can tell you this involves random moments with a girl that lives life to the fullest and emphasizes on her love for bananas.\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nYoshiko: Not very intelligent (sorry not sorry), weird, loves bananas and is very caring.\r\nAkuru: Yoshiko's neighbour and friend, very intelligent and is usually seen with Yoshiko (unfortunately this guy has limited options).\r\nOverall: It's easy to watch (each episode is only for a few minutes), it's very funny... butit can get really annoying up to a point where Yoshiko doesn't get it and it be very cringe worthy... There's is no story and character development!! But if you guys enjoy the weird and randomness that this random brings... then feel free to watch it! (because there are some moments where it does become interesting).",

There are few things I can't accept to though the anime is quite good.\r\n[Story] : 6\r\nThe length of each episode's quite good with just 12 minutes per eps. Beside, a lot of stories can be told because of 3 mins/part, and I'm sure that's fit with this anime. In each part, I never stop being surprised about how the problems would be solved. A lot of crazy things happened in short time can bring you into a rollercoaster. But sometimes, they were overhyped and quite boring. Although the ecchi scenes was fair in overall, some of them were unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art]: 8\\n\r\nCharacter designs are good and fit. Nothing much special about the art, but I like the backgrounds. I wish they made the ecchi scenes better but this is a comedy anime so it doesn't bother me at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: 7\\n\r\nThe sound is not bad, and A-kun's voice is very unique. Soundtracks are fit well with all the crazy things happen. It's fun to hear the OP/ED but I don't think I can hear it everyday. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: 8\\n\r\nYou can easily understand them through the first appearance because of simple characteristic. They all have their own sense of humor which make us laugh a lot\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: 7\\n\r\nA good film to watch after a sad movie, also can make you relax after a stressful day.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those anime that you watch solely for the LOLs. You expect to laugh and Aho girl definitely delivers. The purpose of these characters is made for your chuckling pleasure. Living up to its title, here is a psychologist's point of view on the comedic anime.\r\n\u203b Strength \u203b\r\n- Funny. Whether or not, Aho girl definitely has funny elements attached to it. Because the purpose of the girl MC is to make the viewer laugh. We laugh at her ridiculousness and stupidity. We laugh at her incapability to understand. If you want a good laugh, you are in for a treat.\r\n- Violence. Thisis a double-edged sword and it definitely worked out for me. I found it hilarious to see characters getting beaten up overdramatically as of course, it's ultimate purpose is to deliver the comedic effect and exaggerate it to the point of impossibility.\\n\r\n- Intriguing. The plot storyline and events keep Aho girl spicy as we are repeatedly exposed to the same amount of setting. It's not just the same thing happen over and over again. But the same thing happening in different ways in different settings. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b Weakness \u203b\\n\r\n- Lack of development. One of the biggest downfall about this anime is the lack of progression. Whether it may be character or the story plot itself, one can assume from each episode to remain overall similar in the big picture. This anime had the potential to deliver some quality character development by bringing extra characters in and making it more vivid and complex but it apparently miss that chance.\\n\r\n- Illogical. Sometimes I wonder the validity of the realism in this anime. I see various tiny but noticeable attempts in some seriousness but then it was slowly canceled out by illogical and inconsistent actions and behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nWas this a fun anime? Seems like it.\\n\r\nHow did I like it? Definitely gave me a good LOLing.\\n\r\nRewatch? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl had ultimately served its purpose: to make the audience laugh but if I were to rewatch again, would it give the same similar initial feeling I had when I first watched it? It was definitely a ride worth experiencing but ultimately, it's nothing more than a comedy anime that is forgettable like all the others. Perhaps years later, I'll give it another try. But for now, thanks for the good times, Miss Aho Girl!",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Aho Girl. This show was fun. Pure and simple its a fun show. It doesn't try to be anything, and yet encompasses many things which we find enjoyable from other shows.\r\nThe story revolves around Yoshiko who is the stupid girl. She is an idiot without equal. Her childhood friend and neighbor Akuru is an intelligent guy without any friends. Together they live their lives with Yoshiko doing stupid things and Akuru trying to reign her in.\r\nThe art was pretty good and the soundtrack was catchy. \r\nThe characters are pretty fun. As mentioned above Yoshiko is the idiot.Akuru is the straight man. Sayaka is the other \"primary\" character, and her role is the innocent girl who bridges the gap between all the characters. The other characters are fun, like the Yoshiko's mother who tries to keep other girls away from Akuru. Or the discipline committee president who is turns into a stalker. However they most of the show is Yoshiko and Akuru.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime a lot. I think it knew what show it was and knew what it could do. The characters all intermingle really well, Yoshiko is  a caustic character and without the other characters to cut in it might have become tedious to watch. The 11 minutes also allowed for enough of the show to progress without feeling overwhelming. The comedy also has different angles. It isn't like other shows with a caustic character where its a one trick pony. Yes the theme is around a stupid girl doing stupid things but you see if from several viewpoints. It's not a gem, it's not a classic, it's a fun break.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: If you like stupid humor this is pretty good. Its a short too, only 11 minutes an episode. Give it a try.\\n\\n\r\n*I wasn't going to review it as its a short and obviously a comedy show, but a review twists things into issues that are not really issues. If your not interested me breaking down some things then you should stop here.*\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all not everyone will like the show, its completely a comedy show revolving around stupidity. Not once does it try to be serious or thought provoking. It has the typical joker and straight man setup. The show almost feels like a spoof, but its not. It walks the line between really well. For example there are a lot of panty shots in this show. However its not fan service. I mean someone somewhere might have gotten into it, but I don't think its meant to be that. At the start of the show Akuru says something to the degree of \"who would be attracted to you\" and its true, Yoshiko is not a sexual character. They do have sexualized characters in Yoshie and Iinchou but neither have more than eluded to sexual themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between our straight man and joker is abusive in the most obvious sense. Yoshiko does stupid thing and gets punched. However this is pretty typical. The three stooges, Laurel and Hardy, and the Groucho brothers are all famous for physical humor. That's to name a few, there are many many more examples. In this anime the worst that happens is a punch to the face and a shot with her on the floor with the white eyes. Anime does stuff like this all the time to literally add a punch line to the comedy. I'm not exactly sure why this is so terrible we need to clam up and act like what we are watching is something terrible that needs to be censored. A good equivalent to their relationship is the pairing of Sousuke and Kaname from Full Metal Panic.\\n\\n\r\nNow some more character specific things. Akuru is not a self insert character. In fact he is almost the equivalent of a side character. He studies, and is smart. He has other personality points but none of them make you want to be in his shoes. On the other hand he has enough personality that he isn't just an empty vessel. He is what Yoshiko has made of him. He explodes because who wouldn't. The nicest guy on earth would not be able to deal with what Yoshiko puts him through. Why should he change? The other character cliche's are again a homage of sorts. Why reinvent the wheel when the show doesn't try to be anything other than a stupid comedy? Akuru doesn't have a sister complex. Loving your family member is different than wanting to screw them. \\n\\n\r\nAgain the show has its flaws but don't pass up a show you might like because someone wants to make mountains out of mole hills. It's easy to be taken in by well written reviews. However try and experience things for yourself.",

            "content": "It's very easy for short form anime to fall flat on it's face. Fortunately for Aho Girl, it's not one of those. Aho Girl takes the absurdity of many of the situations and cranks it all the way to one hundred. The result is a very entertaining and hilarious comedy that is able to take advantage of the fact that it's only twelve minutes long.\r\nThe story revolves around Yoshiko Hanabatake and it is her idiocy that sets the standard for the dumb fun that the show contains. The isn't any centralizing plot but instead the anime focuses it's efforts completely on skit humor and relieson the interactions between the amazing cast of characters to carry the show. I don't think there was a single character in the anime I didn't end up liking. The art and animation aren't anything special but gets the job done. One drawback I can come up with is that even with the short duration of the anime, some of the jokes may outlive it's welcome if it's not the type of comedy that you enjoy to watch.\\n\r\nEven then, Aho Girl is probably going to be one of the first shows that will pop into my mind if I had to recommend a short form show to someone. It's also one of the better comedies I have watched in recent memory.",

            "content": "So far I have watched 7 episodes of Aho-Girl that are currently available to us the viewers. In this brief review, i shall share my thoughts on this anime with whomever is interested in watching this anime.\r\nFirst i'd like to address the genre's of the anime and if i see them as appropriate for the shows description. The genres listed in the bio for the anime are;  Comedy, Romance, School, Shounen.\r\nComedy~ I feel like this genre is very fitting for this anime since it is mainly about a girl who is very stupid therefore the 'aho' in the title of the anime which isanother word for idiot/dumbass. Each episode is filled with jokes towards Yoshiko's intelligence (or lack there of) or good old sexual harrassment from Yoshiko and Iinchou towards Akuru who seems to be sick to the bone of them both. The shows comedy also comes to light when Akuru is around Yoshiko because more often than not she tries to flash him her 'pantsu' or annoys him with continus flirting and breaking into his home. This show is filled with silly humor and light hearted plot. This genre fits the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nRomance~ Well so far in the anime there hasn't been any romance between two people but there has been- what seems to be- a one sided love from Yoshiko to Akuru and with Iinchou towards Akuru. If anything i feel like this anime could-in some manner- fit with an ecchi genre since there is quite a bit of fan service in a humor sort of fashion. But all in all, perhaps by the end of the anime it will be more evident who Akuru choses are his partner so i guess this genre suits well.\\n\\n\r\nSchool~ This genre is suited since most of the other characters apart from Yoshiko and Akuru have become friends inside the school and many of the events happen at the school, such as Yoshiko failing her exams and their teacher feeling lonely and hopeless due to never finding love and not being able to help Yoshiko understand her lessons. This genre is suited.\\n\\n\r\nShounen~ is a genre aimed at a young male audience, anywhere from the ages 8-19. Personally i don't see how this genre applies... Although it is clear that the anime is about a stupid girl and the guy she is in love with, it still seems odd to add this genre to the mix. I admit the fanservice is mainly- if not primerly- directed towards the male population it still raises the question as to why this genre is included? Akuru isn't the main character in every episode while Yoshiko is the main character and usually if there is an issue that is in the anime it is mainly revolved around her. But then again that might be my nitpicking tendency. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all the genre's are pretty accurate to its anime and serve it justice. Every episode is around 12 minutes long which are split into mini episodes. \\n\r\nNext i'd like to comment and give my opinion on Story, Art, Sound,Characters, Enjoyment and Overall.\\n\\n\r\nStory~ 6/10. The story is about a stupid girl Yoshiko in love with her childhood friend Akuru who happens to be really smart but hot headed. The story is a bit unclear as to where everything is going but i think that by the time the series ends Yoshiko and Akuru will end up together. So far the story is easy enough to follow and is touching in some parts and quite funny in others. The story isn't the best but it isn't the worse. I wouldn't say i love it or that i am overly enthusiastic  about the show, but it is a good way to just sit back and enjoy a silly series without a hardcore plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt~ 5/10. The artwork is nothing spectacular and in my opinion it's pretty bland and unimpressive. It's not the worse artwork i've ever seen but its by far not the best. At the very best it's better than boku no Pico. \\n\\n\r\nSound~ 5/10. The opening is pretty catchy and upbeat and throughout the anime the background music is pleasant. The voice acting can be pretty annoying with some characters voices being way too high pitched for my liking, but other than that the sound was enjoyable enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~ 6/10. The characters are pretty cliche in the parts that the main male character has a little sister which he adores. There is a cute shy girl, Sayaka which has become the norm for every anime to include. The mother is quite the interesting character and Yoshiko is pretty original with her love for bananas. Most charaters are pretty likable but i can't help but notice that many are cliched.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~ 7/10. The anime itself is enjoyable to watch since it isn't too long and doesn't require much thought since everything is pretty obvious and with no hidden meaning. It is an anime you should watch after having your brians fucked by an anime that was either, too confusing or too annoying. I enjoy the silly humor and even the fan service in some points. Some characters are refreshing and interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall~ 6/10. The anime- as i've said before- is pretty ejoyable, lighhearted, entertaining and funny. It by far isn't a masterpiece but it isnt the worste thing to be served to us the hopeless Otaku's who just want to be on top of seasonal anime. I would recommend this anime if you want something short and sweet just as an extra 'watched' on your list.\\n\\n\r\nThat concludes my review and i hope i didn't bore any of you out of your minds.",

            "content": "To sum up the show in as few words as possible: Delightfully stupid.\r\nAho Girl is such a refresher for this season specifically as it does exactly what it is meant to do in the exact fashion it ought to be done. The show is a comedy all the way through and accomplishes it in, quite honestly, a stereotypical way but done right.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThere really isn't much story to be had. It's a random act comedy that follows the daily shenanigans of our idiot MC. You get glimpses of flashbacks and memories but even those are often just comedic in nature as well.\r\nArt: 6\r\nThe art issolid and consistent. You can tell that they are actually very aware of the budget they have but do quite well with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe ED is forgettable to me but the OP is actually fairly catchy. The VA is solid, a little over the top at times but I feel that's what they aimed for. I can't recall any background music but the occasional sound effects for the actions of characters is also spot on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAlbeit being stereotypical the characters are almost so far down the line that they actually become likable again. The idiot, free spirit MC, her smart, stoic childhood friend, the all around slightly above average friend, the pervert morals committee member, etc...They have all the typical roles filled but, as I said, they take that extra leap further and actually make them funny and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI finished the first episode and had one of those \"Ahh...Wtf did I just watch?\" moments. However it was not in the bad range of those emotions at all. I knew that I had found a nice little treat because I had laughed the entire way through and it had ended before I realized it. Having shortened episodes is a bummer but it suits the series very well. I'm happy the comedy has continued episode to episode as well. A very nice show to pass the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nFor what it is, Aho Girl is great. The type of comedy that actually makes you laugh loudly in your room at 3 A.M without feeling any sense of guilt for those around you. The comedy itself is great but you can never ascertain as to whether that is from them trying too hard or just saying eff it and not trying at all. Either way it works and so does this show.",

            "content": "Hmmm this anime short brings to mind a certain phrase from Danganronpa: The Animation's ED \"Zetsubousei: Hero Chiryouyaku\" to Aho-Girl...\r\n\"Sorry, but medicine can't cure stupidity (LOL)\"\r\nAlso when did Hibiki Tachibana start being obsessed with banana's?\r\nWitty segway..\r\nAho Girl was an odd entity for LA for Summer 2017, as Aho Girl falls into the category of a crude humor, unbashedly crossing the line SEVERAL times for the sake of comedy and yet...this is one of LA's guiltiest pleasure animes for Summer 2017...yeah LA knows right?.\r\nWell to be accurate, the majority of the early episodes put LA off cept for the vast slapstick humor this anime had, butthis anime got MUCH better once Aho-Girl's cast were interacting with the titular Aho-Girl Yoshiko Hanabatake voiced by Aoi Yuuki.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, it's pretty divisive how LA thought about each character as it's usually Yoshiko that is the catalyst to the comedy in this anime. Akuru Akutsu voiced by Tomokazu Sugita is Yoshiko's minder and a studious character and will physically attack Yoshiko whenever she starts pissing him off and to be honest...LA doesn't blame him. However where it crosses the line for him for LA was when he \"accidentally\" tried to attack his little sister Ruri voiced by Sayaka Senbongi. Fuuki Iinchou voiced by Sumire Uesaka, the student morals president was LA's favourite character...at the time, however she became OBSESSED with Akuru to the point of a stalker yandere and she crossed the line under the temptation and  stupidity of Yoshiko pushing her to her limits made LA look elsewhere for a favourite character. If you thought LA would choose Sayaka Sumino voiced by Sayaka Harada, then no but close, as she is the most normal character in this series in an anime filled with crazy, stupid and violent characters but she became plain at best and a target for small breast jokes (in comparison to Fuuki's big breast groping by Yoshiko). If you think Yoshiko is a worse character in this anime short, then look no further than Yoshiko's mother Yoshie voiced by Yoko Hikasa who REALLY crosses the line in this anime as she tries anything to get Yoshiko off her back by forcing marriage on Akuru in any way possible and becomes a rival to Fuuki just for this reasoning. SO LA's favourite characters...well those go to the characters who appear later in the anime short, the gyaru girls Akane Eimura voiced by M.A.O, Kii Hiiragi voiced by Rena Maeda and Tadashi voiced by Yuka Iguchi, as their reactions to the situation Yoshiko gets them through were well timed and had great chemistry with Yoshiko, plus as much as they are gyaru girls, they are mostly innocent and moe at times and best of all, they're situations are tamer in comparison to to how Yoshiko gets the main cast into.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime is also varied like it's divisive characters, it's one part crude humor to groanworthy panty shots fanservice, one part quick witted lines and finally one part stupidity and this combination as much as LA HATED this anime short early on, Aho-Girl definitely got better over time.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by diomedea is consistent for the most part and the character designs are typical of them, but the animation is probably the least interesting part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting however...from Yoko Hikasa, Aoi Yuuki, Sumire Uesaka and Tomokazu Sugita hamming it up was GLORIOUS, especially from Aoi Yuuki pretty much shouting all her lines out in the crazy comedic accent she has...it's pretty much if Hibiki Tachibana was in a comedy hey it went full circle!, anyways...Aoi Yuuki essentially SAVED this anime short for LA, just how bombastically stupid her vocals were as Yoshiko kept LA from watching more and got Aho-Girl out of the \"so bad it's bad\" territory. Aoi Yuuki might have saved this anime short for LA, but Yoko Hikasa took the best voice actor for LA, sure this isn't the first time LA saw her in a role with crude humor in it *cough* Seitokai Yakuindomo *cough* but Yoko Hikasa just goes all out with her role and deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nAho Girl is stupid, crude, obnoxiously loud, comedic, fanserviced to hell, crosses the line multiple times, moe, crazy, slapsticky and stupid and that's ok because you can never cure stupidity, so if you can't beat him...JOIN THEM.\\n\\n",

But the more I invest my time with the series, it gets overall boring. I have no predicament against the protagonist as it portrays of how the title of the anime should be \"Aho means: Stupid\". However, every  woman in this series is being discriminated. Not to mention \"Monkey\"and \"Banana\" is represented in every episode. I know that I am out of context but if I recollect it in a history lesson. \"Black people\" are being treated as lazy, discriminated or a bunch of idiots\" in this case.

            "content": "This anime is about the life of a girl, who is known as an idiot by her close ones, this anime in particular is a comedy without any logical sense, the main objective of this animes is to make laugh the audience. As I said before, the main character is the girl, followed by her childhood friend, who somehow takes care of her, in a violent way we can say. If we have to remark a secondary character, I will choose the mother of the girl, who wants to trick the guy and then gavehim her daughter, because she knows that her daughter will notbe able to live the live alone, but she will have to fight with a girl from the same school as her daughter, who is in love with the guy.\\n\r\nThis anime is quite good, is very funny also. I personally like it, because it's quite entertaining and it's a must watch if you wanna laugh till your stomach aches.",
