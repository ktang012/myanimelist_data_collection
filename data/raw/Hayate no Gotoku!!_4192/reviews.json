            "content": "Hayate no Gotoku! (or Hayate the Combat Butler if you prefer) is a manga created by Kenjiro Hata which is currently still ongoing. It has already received an anime adaptation by SynergySP which ran for an impressive full year with 52 episodes. A year later, and under a new animation studio, Hayate no Gotoku!! is the sequel to the popular parody-comedy, romance series.\r\nStory:\r\n+ As a parody-comedy there isnt really much of a plot, however this season is a near perfect adaptation from the original manga.\r\n+ Completely ignores the filler material from season 1 and starts off from where last season derailred. (Ep 25 season 1)\r\n+More focus on characters development and their relationships (if you really liked the character this is a plus)\\n\\n\r\n- Without the fillers of season 1, the amount of anime/manga references presented in season 2 has dropped significantly. Those who watched the series mainly because of those might feel disappointed.\\n\r\n- Not AS funny as the first season (But still hilarious on its own right)\\n\r\n- Too short (my inner fanboy crying ;__;)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Highly superior color palette compared to the first series.\\n\r\n+ JC Staff knows how to make characters look cute, and this show is testament of that.\\n\r\n+ More details in the backgrounds, and did I already mention the amazing color palette?\\n\\n\r\n- Although better looking, the animation quality can get iffy at times.\\n\r\n- In terms of consistensy, season 1 was better.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ The OPs and EDs for this show are really good and catchy too :D\\n\r\n+ The voice cast for this show is so fantastic, everyone plays their role amazingly well.\\n\r\n+ The Background Music for certain scenes are great to listen to and really make some scenes waaaay better.\\n\\n\r\n- Not enough Wakamoto Norio narration XD (but thats just me)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (By far the best aspect of this series)\\n\r\n+ Hinagiku, Hinagiku, Hinagiku and a lot of it too! :D\\n\r\n+ Characters that didn't shine much first time around get to show their characters more, and they are all great!\\n\r\n+ A lot of character development in this season really makes some characters grow as we learn more about them and their past.\\n\\n\r\n- Hinagiku, Hinagiku, Hinagiku, maybe a bit too much that other characters lose screentime -__-\\n\r\n- Much like other forgotten characters finally get their time in the light, a few other characters take a back seat for a big chunk of the series. (ie. Klaus, Tama, and to an extend even Maria)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nLOVE IT!! This season was IMO so much more enjoyable than last time due to the fantastic interaction between characters, and also for introducing (or mentioning) characters and events that will later on in the story be important. I have to admit im sad this was only 25 episodes seeing how the manga is almost 100 chapters ahead and there is soooo much more material left to cover. Also the last episode might have given us a small taste at things to come in the future (season 3 should be a given) JC STAFF YOU BETTER DELIVER!.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end regadless on what it is that made you enjoy the first series, Hayate no Gotoku!! is a fantastic sequel and also a fantastic adaptation. It still has high quality humour, fantastic and very likeable characters, and most importantly...its just fun to watch. If you have never read the manga it is required to have watched the first season (the first half at least) in order to start this season, however I am confident that there will be more seasons to come and if JC Staff can keep up this level of quality, I know that in the future there will be more laughter and entertainment to come from this series.",

            "content": "Hayate no Gotoku - you've been a long road for me: 75 episodes is no easy task for a 12 to 24-episode convert. (76 including the 30 minute OVA.) \r\nDown to brass tax: the story has, outright, abandoned the \"Hayate owes 150 million yen\" arch. True, it keeps him as the butler to Nagi, but, compared to the first season, it's not the driving factor - the relationships are now. \r\nIf you saw the prequel to the second season, the OVA, you would have been slightly shocked with, not only with the art style, but with the more relationship-oriented season that is to come. Forexample, Hayate makes only one reference the entire OVA to the fact that he owes 150 million yen, this translates rather proportionally to the amount of the \"debt story arch\" you'll be receiving in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you came to see the conclusion of Hayate's triumphant victory over his insurmountable debt, stay at the door. If you came to have fun with the relationships, triangles, and awkwardness, I saved you a seat. The majority of the episodes are geared towards one of Hayate's female suitors (if we're calling this a harem). Now, I say most are, some episodes are rather needless and, frankly, there are a few I could care less about, but the longest \"new\" story arch that you will see will last for approximately 2 episodes in length. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art here is solid; much more luminous and light. I for one, enjoyed the switch to the new art style, but if you saw the OVA's and were hoping that it had changed, sorry, it stays for the remainder of the 25 episodes. 9/10. (Better than the first season.)\\n\\n\r\nOhhhh, boy. The second best part of the series was the sound. I liked the theme, and every time I sensed myself getting a little fed up with the current theme, it was like they read my mind and it was changed the next episode. Every opening/closing was fresh and upbeat - much like the show is.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, voice acting. You can't get much better than the two voice actors of Maria and Hayate. No, sir. You cannot. Maria, as we know is rather reserved and pensive and her voice reflects that as clear as undisturbed water. Hayate's voice in full of ignorance and apprehension, but it also full of innocent power. Great job to especially these voice actors, but to all who participated in the show. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nHINAGIKU ASSAULT. Be ready for it. Trust me. Huge character development on the part of Hinagiku would be an understatement. Albeit she is given a FAIR SHARE of screen time and another crucial development takes place which I'm sure you saw prefaced in the OVA, possibly even in the first season as well. \\n\\n\r\nAyumu is the only other standout character with her development and role that she takes on in the second season: more mature and, I found her, very profound and insightful. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the other characters remain vastly the same. Hey, if ain't broke, don't fix it. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment partially played into the fact that the show gave me what I was looking for after the first season: an identity. In this season, we saw that it had settled into a romantic comedy identity and spruced it up with a few action bits, but not as much as the first season. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this was a wise decision. You can't have an anime that's solely based on comedy and have all these extremely powerful personalities behind it, because the characters will seem like they're forcing it and being too fake. Thankfully, the romantic comedy aspect was brought to bear, and the \"strong personalities\" were satiated, tamed, and, most importantly, and garnered success.\\n\\n\r\nThe show still maintains its comedy and it's the length of the second season has been halved to 25 episodes, but the affect the storytelling leaves on you is as substantial as the first: it's very funny, makes impossible-to-get-every-single-reference references, good characters, a reasonable plot, good sound, and as entertaining as any other anime out there. 8/10.",

            "content": "Hayate no Gotoku!! is a unique parody and slice of life series that mainly focuses on the relationships between characters. It features some of the funniest and most ridiculous characters that one could find, which is the primary reason it is so entertaining.\r\nI for one am very proud of J.C. Staff for sticking to the source material. While at times an episode could seem rigid and have poor flow from the first half to the next,  seeing chapters from the manga coming to be animated brings a feeling of joy. \r\nThe art however leaves something to be desired. The change of color and designsof the characters from the first season and is not welcome. The backgrounds are fine but Nagi's hair looks like it was drawn with a piss yellow crayon, and Hina's and Ayumu's hair just screams QUALITY. But this is to be expected from a studio such as J.C. Staff, and it doesn't help that Japan's economy isn't so hot at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound enriches the episodes, and is the reason why this anime is worth watching if one already currently reads the manga. The seiyuu are all outstanding at their roles and the background music fits in perfectly with each scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely witty and endearing. The sheer amount of them and the developments between them is what makes Hayate so entertaining to watch.",

            "content": "Having recently gone from having an interest in animes to an obsession , I can safely say that this is the funniest product to ever come out of Japan. Hayate the Combat Butler, is the story of unlucky teenager Hayate Ayasaki,who after being sold to the Yakuza(Mafia) and inheriting a debt of 156,804,000 Yen, decides to kidnap a girl named Nagi Sanzenin. Unfortunately, the idiot(Hayate), botches up the plan, and due to poor empathy, makes Nagi believe that Hayate is in love with her. After saving her from another kidnapping plot, Hayate then becomes Nagi\u2019s butler, where he must use all means necessary to protecther, completely unaware that Nagi is in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nIt was in 2004 that Kenjiro Hata released this hilarious manga (which eventually turned into an anime) which featured funny characters, outrageous humor, many references to popular culture, parodies of pop-culture, and the craziest situations created. Whether it be walking to the grocery store only to end up getting attacked by thousands of bodyguards with swords, to attempting to sneak into a school, only to be met by a crazy alcoholic history teacher that really wants to kill someone, the situations simply from crazy to ludicrously demented. The reason for most of these \u201cincidents\u201d(If you can call them that.) is due to the fact that Hayate is the unluckiest 16 year old I have ever seen in my life. While he is skilled in combat, martial arts, stealth, weapon use, painting forging, assassinations, cleaning, door to door salesmanship, etc\u2026.(How he learns all these skills are beyond me), he just seems to always be at the wrong place at the wrong time. One other factor could also be that his weakness, girls added to what seems to be the poorest empathy I\u2019ve seen from 16 year old, simply makes Hayate\u2019s life a living nightmare. Whether it be that every single girl in Tokyo is insane, or the fact Hayate still hasn\u2019t figured out (After two season and 20 volumes), that most of the girl\u2019s that he meet are in love him, usually results in Hayate being in a lot of mental and physical pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe format of the show is basically scenario after scenario, a basic format that really doesn\u2019t distinguish it from other animes/mangas. However, it is not format but the scenarios that it get right, for every scenario usually involves a lot of parodies, breaking of the wall, truly insane action, and lots of freaking misunderstandings. Whether it be misuse of the word \u201cplay\u201d, or accidently killing off a character for really no reason what-so-ever, the series revolves around the idea of world where everybody takes everything too seriously, resulting many casualties caused by a war that ends many innocent lives. (Moment of Silence Please) However, all of these scenarios are hilarious, as for they rely on outrageous humor, a ridiculous amount of sexual innuendo, and amusing character abuse scenes. Even the normal scenarios are hilarious, for they range from attempting to get into one of the greatest school in Japan (An obvious parody to Love Hina), to trying to escape a gay person who loves Hayate, instantly turns into a fight to the death situation.\\n\\n\r\nIf their one flaw with this series (I don\u2019t find it a flaw, but many people do), it\u2019s the fact it leans VERY closely to Harem. For those of you who don\u2019t know, Harem is usually an anime with the situation in that one guy is involved with two or more girls. This isn\u2019t bad, in my opinion, but it usually leads to girls being made into sex symbols. (Still have no problem with that) Meaning if you are a woman, you may be turned off by this series. however, if you are willingly to overlook this and just laugh at what you on screen, then you will really enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf what I said make\u2019s Hayate the Combat Butler a mindless comedy, then you are wrong, This series can be very touching at times, as for before Hayate became a butler, he was dirt poor kid that had to support two lazy parents that sold him to the mafia, even going to the extent of giving him the . After seeing the first episode, you really feel the problem that Hayate is going through, as for everyone has abandoned him. Heck I\u2019m not afraid to say that I even shed a tear. Hayate the Combat Butler is the story of survival. Hayate, being a butler, has to constantly serve the most spoiled child I have ever seen (Nagi) and no matter how angry she gets at Hayate, Hayate always seems to do everything willingly, even feeling guilty when he isn\u2019t working or taking a day off. Basically it\u2019s the story of Hayate wanting to be accepted, but due to bad luck, has a very hard time doing it. Since the series is still running, I can\u2019t come to any conclusions if Hayate is going to actually end up being happy, so I am hoping that the conclusion is really well done, as for death shall come to Kotoko if they do release a crappy final episode.\\n\\n\r\nHayate the Combat Butler is simply hilarious and touching. While the slight harem feel may stop girls from reading/watching this, most of the population will simply enjoy this great manga/anime series.",

            "content": "\"Hayate no Gotoku\", season two is definitely a graphical improvement on the first. I'm not saying that the animation from season 1 is bad, I'm just saying that the new animation is an upgrade from the original. \r\n...Anyhow, the second season is more of the hilarious fun that we know and love. All the characters have returned with full force, bringing with them more aspects of their personalities which were seen in the manga version. A definite plus in my opinion.\r\nThis time the focus isn't set as much on Hayate's debt as it is the slight romace that goes on between the characters (though Hayatestill isn't able to tell if a girl is hitting on him. Good ol' ignorant Hayate.) One of the characters that the season seems to focus on most is Hinagiku, and how she realizes a new fact about herself.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this season does NOT pick up after episode 52 of season one. No, this season takes place right after episode 25, helping keep a stronger closeness to the manga.\\n\r\n(A.K.A. Null ALMOST all the episodes that take place after episode 25 of season one)\\n\\n\r\nThis series is one that I recommend to people young and old alike. If you like comedy, want a romance show, or just plain ol' want to watch something different yet familiar, this is a show for you.",

            "content": "Hayate no gotoku, second season. I should start off by saying, this season is completely different compared to the first season. The writers take a different approach in animating the series. While the first season focused more on the comedy and gags, the second season focuses a lot more on the characters and the romance between them. Of course, im not saying they threw the comedy out the window, there is still a nice amount of comedy thrown into the series, making it in my opinion, far better than the first season. As far as the story goes, it's your typical romcom story, nothingnew. The art and sound are better than the first season, but it isnt really anything to brag about. What impressed me was the characters of the series. The character development and the romance is one of the best i've seen yet in a series. The plot of 150,000,000 debt is still referenced but is not really used in the series. Characters such as Hinagiku and Ayumu, who did not have much character develpment in the first series receive a huge boost in this one. Once again, the romance is one of the best part of the series. This is just my opinion, but it's on par(arguebly better) with that of Toradora!, one of the best romcom animes i know. The characters are all likable and you'll want to keep watching to find out who the main character ends up with.\\n\r\n The enjoyment of the series has to receive a 10 for me, once again, a lot different from season 1. While i did kind of enjoy the first season, the second season was far better in my opinion. Id give the story a 7, art and sound an 8.5, character and enjoyment a 10, giving it an overall score of 9",

            "content": "I was excited to find out that Hayate no Gotoku had a second season to follow the first. The first season's story, humor, character, and art caught my attention greatly. The original plot of Hayate no Gotoku had to do with a young (and cursed with bad luck) boy who ends up on the streets after his parents sold him to \"generous\" people but is luckily taken in by a rich girl, Nagi. He, in gratitude, risks everything for her and protects her as her butler. The first season followed that plot and was very enjoyable.\r\n    What happenedthen? The second season of Hayate no Gotoku started off great. For the first 8 episodes, I was entertained. Then, it ran off track. For the rest of the season, we no longer focused on the butler who would protect his mistress due to gratitude. It felt as if the original plot was laid aside as a supporting idea. Instead of focusing on the life of the butler and his mistress, the anime focused on the normal life of an unlucky boy who everybody falls for. Nagi rarely appeared in the episodes and instead, Hinagiku replaced her. The plot had been sidetracked, turning it into a melodramatic love story between two teenagers. I didn't like how the plot jumped around, there for earning itself a 5. \\n\r\n    There is not much I can say about the art. The characters are all drawn well. However, I do believe that the colors are to dark; too dull. Perhaps, the colors should be lighter. Spoiler: That is not much of a problem since it is resolved in the third season of Hayate no Gotoku. The sounds, too, are okay. \\n\r\n    For each character, they have a specific personality. Nobody has the exact same personality and this anime shows that. A major problem with many anime these days is that their characters all have similar traits. Hayate no Gotoku made each person unique and I like that. However, at times, the lines are repeated too much.\\n\r\n    I can't say I didn't enjoy the second season. I laughed, I felt pity, I was sympathetic towards the characters, and most of all: I had fun. Hayate no Gotoku makes you feel as if the characters are real and are by your side. I felt that some things in the anime didn't belong, but otherwise, I really enjoyed it. Despite the poor story, I believe that the second season was really worth watching.",

            "content": "[May contain spoilers, awareness, or upcoming events]\r\nHayate no Gotoku Season 2, was completely unexpected. The storyline, as the previous episodes were always random, something completely new that comes to Nagi's mind. However, it really comes down to Hayate and everyone liking him, which is the funniest part of the story, and how Nagi gets jealous, of course. The art in this anime is rather perfect for it's year it was made, also, I was quite to surprise that Hayate no Gotoku is a good starter-anime for those who are starting to watch anime's. This really is educational for kids and adults alike who want tolearn what goes on in Japan, just like the Director of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The character plotting in Hayate was a good development, despite the fact that Hayate is a \"chick-magnet\" when he tries not to be one. Overall enjoyment of this anime as well as a whole, this anime is a good anime for those of all ages, and I highly recommend to whoever chooses to watch this. (I just started to watch the next season, and the art of it isn't really well put despite the fact the author of the story decided to \"take control\" of the anime.)\\n\\n\r\n[Supoir\u0101, ishiki, matawa kongo no ibento ga fukuma rete iru kamo shirenai] \\n\\n\r\nHayatenogotoku no nai sh\u012bzun 2 wa, kanzen ni yos\u014d-gaidatta.

( Double ! because its the second season XD ) I will not make this review too complicated mostly because I dont have time =S (Also this review was made when I finished watching the 4th episode )\r\nStory: There isnt much of a story. The anime is pretty much about a butler-in-debt serving his mistress to repay his debt.\r\nArt: The art from the first season is a little different. The art is still pretty good. \r\nSound: The opening song and the ending song are enjoyable. Both of the songs are worth watching.\r\nCharacters:The characters are funny and if u didnt like Hinagiku well you will start to like her while u watch the anime \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yes, you will enjoy this anime. (Why? Cuz its funny >:O plus it refers to other anime and kind of makes fun of them )\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 This anime is my second in my top 10 list and this anime is a \"MUST WATCH\" anime.

Especially when it comes to the romance of Hayate and his master. Hayate can obviously be considered very funny and that is what makes up for all the other lacking of the anime. The art is good but well it doesn't have the wow in it, it doesn't help in visualizing any of the personalities. The characters are not at all great. They don't have an individuality and that kills the art automatically. But each character very clearlyhas this feeling enthusiasm which covers it up. And the enjoyment is obviously high quality because of the jokes and enormous amounts of comedy but to some the comedy might seem illogical. I would recommend this anime to someone who like to watch something which has the essence of reality and logicality.",

            "content": "Hayate no Gotoku! (or Hayate the Combat Butler if you prefer) is a manga created by Kenjiro Hata which is currently still ongoing. It has already received an anime adaptation by SynergySP which ran for an impressive full year with 52 episodes. A year later, and under a new animation studio, Hayate no Gotoku!! is the sequel to the popular parody-comedy, romance series.\r\nStory:\r\n+ As a parody-comedy there isnt really much of a plot, however this season is a near perfect adaptation from the original manga.\r\n+ Completely ignores the filler material from season 1 and starts off from where last season derailred. (Ep 25 season 1)\r\n+More focus on characters development and their relationships (if you really liked the character this is a plus)\\n\\n\r\n- Without the fillers of season 1, the amount of anime/manga references presented in season 2 has dropped significantly. Those who watched the series mainly because of those might feel disappointed.\\n\r\n- Not AS funny as the first season (But still hilarious on its own right)\\n\r\n- Too short (my inner fanboy crying ;__;)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Highly superior color palette compared to the first series.\\n\r\n+ JC Staff knows how to make characters look cute, and this show is testament of that.\\n\r\n+ More details in the backgrounds, and did I already mention the amazing color palette?\\n\\n\r\n- Although better looking, the animation quality can get iffy at times.\\n\r\n- In terms of consistensy, season 1 was better.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ The OPs and EDs for this show are really good and catchy too :D\\n\r\n+ The voice cast for this show is so fantastic, everyone plays their role amazingly well.\\n\r\n+ The Background Music for certain scenes are great to listen to and really make some scenes waaaay better.\\n\\n\r\n- Not enough Wakamoto Norio narration XD (but thats just me)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (By far the best aspect of this series)\\n\r\n+ Hinagiku, Hinagiku, Hinagiku and a lot of it too! :D\\n\r\n+ Characters that didn't shine much first time around get to show their characters more, and they are all great!\\n\r\n+ A lot of character development in this season really makes some characters grow as we learn more about them and their past.\\n\\n\r\n- Hinagiku, Hinagiku, Hinagiku, maybe a bit too much that other characters lose screentime -__-\\n\r\n- Much like other forgotten characters finally get their time in the light, a few other characters take a back seat for a big chunk of the series. (ie. Klaus, Tama, and to an extend even Maria)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nLOVE IT!! This season was IMO so much more enjoyable than last time due to the fantastic interaction between characters, and also for introducing (or mentioning) characters and events that will later on in the story be important. I have to admit im sad this was only 25 episodes seeing how the manga is almost 100 chapters ahead and there is soooo much more material left to cover. Also the last episode might have given us a small taste at things to come in the future (season 3 should be a given) JC STAFF YOU BETTER DELIVER!.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end regadless on what it is that made you enjoy the first series, Hayate no Gotoku!! is a fantastic sequel and also a fantastic adaptation. It still has high quality humour, fantastic and very likeable characters, and most importantly...its just fun to watch. If you have never read the manga it is required to have watched the first season (the first half at least) in order to start this season, however I am confident that there will be more seasons to come and if JC Staff can keep up this level of quality, I know that in the future there will be more laughter and entertainment to come from this series.",

            "content": "Hayate no Gotoku - you've been a long road for me: 75 episodes is no easy task for a 12 to 24-episode convert. (76 including the 30 minute OVA.) \r\nDown to brass tax: the story has, outright, abandoned the \"Hayate owes 150 million yen\" arch. True, it keeps him as the butler to Nagi, but, compared to the first season, it's not the driving factor - the relationships are now. \r\nIf you saw the prequel to the second season, the OVA, you would have been slightly shocked with, not only with the art style, but with the more relationship-oriented season that is to come. Forexample, Hayate makes only one reference the entire OVA to the fact that he owes 150 million yen, this translates rather proportionally to the amount of the \"debt story arch\" you'll be receiving in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you came to see the conclusion of Hayate's triumphant victory over his insurmountable debt, stay at the door. If you came to have fun with the relationships, triangles, and awkwardness, I saved you a seat. The majority of the episodes are geared towards one of Hayate's female suitors (if we're calling this a harem). Now, I say most are, some episodes are rather needless and, frankly, there are a few I could care less about, but the longest \"new\" story arch that you will see will last for approximately 2 episodes in length. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art here is solid; much more luminous and light. I for one, enjoyed the switch to the new art style, but if you saw the OVA's and were hoping that it had changed, sorry, it stays for the remainder of the 25 episodes. 9/10. (Better than the first season.)\\n\\n\r\nOhhhh, boy. The second best part of the series was the sound. I liked the theme, and every time I sensed myself getting a little fed up with the current theme, it was like they read my mind and it was changed the next episode. Every opening/closing was fresh and upbeat - much like the show is.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, voice acting. You can't get much better than the two voice actors of Maria and Hayate. No, sir. You cannot. Maria, as we know is rather reserved and pensive and her voice reflects that as clear as undisturbed water. Hayate's voice in full of ignorance and apprehension, but it also full of innocent power. Great job to especially these voice actors, but to all who participated in the show. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nHINAGIKU ASSAULT. Be ready for it. Trust me. Huge character development on the part of Hinagiku would be an understatement. Albeit she is given a FAIR SHARE of screen time and another crucial development takes place which I'm sure you saw prefaced in the OVA, possibly even in the first season as well. \\n\\n\r\nAyumu is the only other standout character with her development and role that she takes on in the second season: more mature and, I found her, very profound and insightful. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the other characters remain vastly the same. Hey, if ain't broke, don't fix it. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment partially played into the fact that the show gave me what I was looking for after the first season: an identity. In this season, we saw that it had settled into a romantic comedy identity and spruced it up with a few action bits, but not as much as the first season. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this was a wise decision. You can't have an anime that's solely based on comedy and have all these extremely powerful personalities behind it, because the characters will seem like they're forcing it and being too fake. Thankfully, the romantic comedy aspect was brought to bear, and the \"strong personalities\" were satiated, tamed, and, most importantly, and garnered success.\\n\\n\r\nThe show still maintains its comedy and it's the length of the second season has been halved to 25 episodes, but the affect the storytelling leaves on you is as substantial as the first: it's very funny, makes impossible-to-get-every-single-reference references, good characters, a reasonable plot, good sound, and as entertaining as any other anime out there. 8/10.",

            "content": "Hayate no Gotoku!! is a unique parody and slice of life series that mainly focuses on the relationships between characters. It features some of the funniest and most ridiculous characters that one could find, which is the primary reason it is so entertaining.\r\nI for one am very proud of J.C. Staff for sticking to the source material. While at times an episode could seem rigid and have poor flow from the first half to the next,  seeing chapters from the manga coming to be animated brings a feeling of joy. \r\nThe art however leaves something to be desired. The change of color and designsof the characters from the first season and is not welcome. The backgrounds are fine but Nagi's hair looks like it was drawn with a piss yellow crayon, and Hina's and Ayumu's hair just screams QUALITY. But this is to be expected from a studio such as J.C. Staff, and it doesn't help that Japan's economy isn't so hot at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound enriches the episodes, and is the reason why this anime is worth watching if one already currently reads the manga. The seiyuu are all outstanding at their roles and the background music fits in perfectly with each scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely witty and endearing. The sheer amount of them and the developments between them is what makes Hayate so entertaining to watch.",

            "content": "Having recently gone from having an interest in animes to an obsession , I can safely say that this is the funniest product to ever come out of Japan. Hayate the Combat Butler, is the story of unlucky teenager Hayate Ayasaki,who after being sold to the Yakuza(Mafia) and inheriting a debt of 156,804,000 Yen, decides to kidnap a girl named Nagi Sanzenin. Unfortunately, the idiot(Hayate), botches up the plan, and due to poor empathy, makes Nagi believe that Hayate is in love with her. After saving her from another kidnapping plot, Hayate then becomes Nagi\u2019s butler, where he must use all means necessary to protecther, completely unaware that Nagi is in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nIt was in 2004 that Kenjiro Hata released this hilarious manga (which eventually turned into an anime) which featured funny characters, outrageous humor, many references to popular culture, parodies of pop-culture, and the craziest situations created. Whether it be walking to the grocery store only to end up getting attacked by thousands of bodyguards with swords, to attempting to sneak into a school, only to be met by a crazy alcoholic history teacher that really wants to kill someone, the situations simply from crazy to ludicrously demented. The reason for most of these \u201cincidents\u201d(If you can call them that.) is due to the fact that Hayate is the unluckiest 16 year old I have ever seen in my life. While he is skilled in combat, martial arts, stealth, weapon use, painting forging, assassinations, cleaning, door to door salesmanship, etc\u2026.(How he learns all these skills are beyond me), he just seems to always be at the wrong place at the wrong time. One other factor could also be that his weakness, girls added to what seems to be the poorest empathy I\u2019ve seen from 16 year old, simply makes Hayate\u2019s life a living nightmare. Whether it be that every single girl in Tokyo is insane, or the fact Hayate still hasn\u2019t figured out (After two season and 20 volumes), that most of the girl\u2019s that he meet are in love him, usually results in Hayate being in a lot of mental and physical pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe format of the show is basically scenario after scenario, a basic format that really doesn\u2019t distinguish it from other animes/mangas. However, it is not format but the scenarios that it get right, for every scenario usually involves a lot of parodies, breaking of the wall, truly insane action, and lots of freaking misunderstandings. Whether it be misuse of the word \u201cplay\u201d, or accidently killing off a character for really no reason what-so-ever, the series revolves around the idea of world where everybody takes everything too seriously, resulting many casualties caused by a war that ends many innocent lives. (Moment of Silence Please) However, all of these scenarios are hilarious, as for they rely on outrageous humor, a ridiculous amount of sexual innuendo, and amusing character abuse scenes. Even the normal scenarios are hilarious, for they range from attempting to get into one of the greatest school in Japan (An obvious parody to Love Hina), to trying to escape a gay person who loves Hayate, instantly turns into a fight to the death situation.\\n\\n\r\nIf their one flaw with this series (I don\u2019t find it a flaw, but many people do), it\u2019s the fact it leans VERY closely to Harem. For those of you who don\u2019t know, Harem is usually an anime with the situation in that one guy is involved with two or more girls. This isn\u2019t bad, in my opinion, but it usually leads to girls being made into sex symbols. (Still have no problem with that) Meaning if you are a woman, you may be turned off by this series. however, if you are willingly to overlook this and just laugh at what you on screen, then you will really enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf what I said make\u2019s Hayate the Combat Butler a mindless comedy, then you are wrong, This series can be very touching at times, as for before Hayate became a butler, he was dirt poor kid that had to support two lazy parents that sold him to the mafia, even going to the extent of giving him the . After seeing the first episode, you really feel the problem that Hayate is going through, as for everyone has abandoned him. Heck I\u2019m not afraid to say that I even shed a tear. Hayate the Combat Butler is the story of survival. Hayate, being a butler, has to constantly serve the most spoiled child I have ever seen (Nagi) and no matter how angry she gets at Hayate, Hayate always seems to do everything willingly, even feeling guilty when he isn\u2019t working or taking a day off. Basically it\u2019s the story of Hayate wanting to be accepted, but due to bad luck, has a very hard time doing it. Since the series is still running, I can\u2019t come to any conclusions if Hayate is going to actually end up being happy, so I am hoping that the conclusion is really well done, as for death shall come to Kotoko if they do release a crappy final episode.\\n\\n\r\nHayate the Combat Butler is simply hilarious and touching. While the slight harem feel may stop girls from reading/watching this, most of the population will simply enjoy this great manga/anime series.",

            "content": "\"Hayate no Gotoku\", season two is definitely a graphical improvement on the first. I'm not saying that the animation from season 1 is bad, I'm just saying that the new animation is an upgrade from the original. \r\n...Anyhow, the second season is more of the hilarious fun that we know and love. All the characters have returned with full force, bringing with them more aspects of their personalities which were seen in the manga version. A definite plus in my opinion.\r\nThis time the focus isn't set as much on Hayate's debt as it is the slight romace that goes on between the characters (though Hayatestill isn't able to tell if a girl is hitting on him. Good ol' ignorant Hayate.) One of the characters that the season seems to focus on most is Hinagiku, and how she realizes a new fact about herself.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this season does NOT pick up after episode 52 of season one. No, this season takes place right after episode 25, helping keep a stronger closeness to the manga.\\n\r\n(A.K.A. Null ALMOST all the episodes that take place after episode 25 of season one)\\n\\n\r\nThis series is one that I recommend to people young and old alike. If you like comedy, want a romance show, or just plain ol' want to watch something different yet familiar, this is a show for you.",

            "content": "Hayate no gotoku, second season. I should start off by saying, this season is completely different compared to the first season. The writers take a different approach in animating the series. While the first season focused more on the comedy and gags, the second season focuses a lot more on the characters and the romance between them. Of course, im not saying they threw the comedy out the window, there is still a nice amount of comedy thrown into the series, making it in my opinion, far better than the first season. As far as the story goes, it's your typical romcom story, nothingnew. The art and sound are better than the first season, but it isnt really anything to brag about. What impressed me was the characters of the series. The character development and the romance is one of the best i've seen yet in a series. The plot of 150,000,000 debt is still referenced but is not really used in the series. Characters such as Hinagiku and Ayumu, who did not have much character develpment in the first series receive a huge boost in this one. Once again, the romance is one of the best part of the series. This is just my opinion, but it's on par(arguebly better) with that of Toradora!, one of the best romcom animes i know. The characters are all likable and you'll want to keep watching to find out who the main character ends up with.\\n\r\n The enjoyment of the series has to receive a 10 for me, once again, a lot different from season 1. While i did kind of enjoy the first season, the second season was far better in my opinion. Id give the story a 7, art and sound an 8.5, character and enjoyment a 10, giving it an overall score of 9",

            "content": "I was excited to find out that Hayate no Gotoku had a second season to follow the first. The first season's story, humor, character, and art caught my attention greatly. The original plot of Hayate no Gotoku had to do with a young (and cursed with bad luck) boy who ends up on the streets after his parents sold him to \"generous\" people but is luckily taken in by a rich girl, Nagi. He, in gratitude, risks everything for her and protects her as her butler. The first season followed that plot and was very enjoyable.\r\n    What happenedthen? The second season of Hayate no Gotoku started off great. For the first 8 episodes, I was entertained. Then, it ran off track. For the rest of the season, we no longer focused on the butler who would protect his mistress due to gratitude. It felt as if the original plot was laid aside as a supporting idea. Instead of focusing on the life of the butler and his mistress, the anime focused on the normal life of an unlucky boy who everybody falls for. Nagi rarely appeared in the episodes and instead, Hinagiku replaced her. The plot had been sidetracked, turning it into a melodramatic love story between two teenagers. I didn't like how the plot jumped around, there for earning itself a 5. \\n\r\n    There is not much I can say about the art. The characters are all drawn well. However, I do believe that the colors are to dark; too dull. Perhaps, the colors should be lighter. Spoiler: That is not much of a problem since it is resolved in the third season of Hayate no Gotoku. The sounds, too, are okay. \\n\r\n    For each character, they have a specific personality. Nobody has the exact same personality and this anime shows that. A major problem with many anime these days is that their characters all have similar traits. Hayate no Gotoku made each person unique and I like that. However, at times, the lines are repeated too much.\\n\r\n    I can't say I didn't enjoy the second season. I laughed, I felt pity, I was sympathetic towards the characters, and most of all: I had fun. Hayate no Gotoku makes you feel as if the characters are real and are by your side. I felt that some things in the anime didn't belong, but otherwise, I really enjoyed it. Despite the poor story, I believe that the second season was really worth watching.",

            "content": "[May contain spoilers, awareness, or upcoming events]\r\nHayate no Gotoku Season 2, was completely unexpected. The storyline, as the previous episodes were always random, something completely new that comes to Nagi's mind. However, it really comes down to Hayate and everyone liking him, which is the funniest part of the story, and how Nagi gets jealous, of course. The art in this anime is rather perfect for it's year it was made, also, I was quite to surprise that Hayate no Gotoku is a good starter-anime for those who are starting to watch anime's. This really is educational for kids and adults alike who want tolearn what goes on in Japan, just like the Director of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The character plotting in Hayate was a good development, despite the fact that Hayate is a \"chick-magnet\" when he tries not to be one. Overall enjoyment of this anime as well as a whole, this anime is a good anime for those of all ages, and I highly recommend to whoever chooses to watch this. (I just started to watch the next season, and the art of it isn't really well put despite the fact the author of the story decided to \"take control\" of the anime.)\\n\\n\r\n[Supoir\u0101, ishiki, matawa kongo no ibento ga fukuma rete iru kamo shirenai] \\n\\n\r\nHayatenogotoku no nai sh\u012bzun 2 wa, kanzen ni yos\u014d-gaidatta.

( Double ! because its the second season XD ) I will not make this review too complicated mostly because I dont have time =S (Also this review was made when I finished watching the 4th episode )\r\nStory: There isnt much of a story. The anime is pretty much about a butler-in-debt serving his mistress to repay his debt.\r\nArt: The art from the first season is a little different. The art is still pretty good. \r\nSound: The opening song and the ending song are enjoyable. Both of the songs are worth watching.\r\nCharacters:The characters are funny and if u didnt like Hinagiku well you will start to like her while u watch the anime \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yes, you will enjoy this anime. (Why? Cuz its funny >:O plus it refers to other anime and kind of makes fun of them )\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 This anime is my second in my top 10 list and this anime is a \"MUST WATCH\" anime.

Especially when it comes to the romance of Hayate and his master. Hayate can obviously be considered very funny and that is what makes up for all the other lacking of the anime. The art is good but well it doesn't have the wow in it, it doesn't help in visualizing any of the personalities. The characters are not at all great. They don't have an individuality and that kills the art automatically. But each character very clearlyhas this feeling enthusiasm which covers it up. And the enjoyment is obviously high quality because of the jokes and enormous amounts of comedy but to some the comedy might seem illogical. I would recommend this anime to someone who like to watch something which has the essence of reality and logicality.",
