            "content": "I found myself stuck in the puddle of mediocrity that is 2014 summer season. Akame ga Kill, Tokyo Ghoul, Aldnoah.Zero and SAO II. I was slowly losing my faith in anime and on several occasions I thought that I should try to go outside my room and socialize with other Homo Sapiens. It was that bad.\r\nThen...\r\nThen I saw a pillar.\r\nA pillar of hope.\r\nA pillar of testosterone and manlyness.\r\nA pillar of Jojo.\r\nStory: 10 pillars of hope/10 pillars of hope\r\n\"This makes my plays look like Mars of Destruction in comparison\" -William Shakespeare\r\nWhere do I begin? At the start most likely. It starts with  our hero JotaroKujo (This parts Jojo) sitting in a prison cell. You will be asking yourself: \"How can such a man, who is the manfistation of coolness and manlyness be stuck in prison?\" Then you find out he has put himself in a cell to protect people from the \"evil spirit\" that is possessing him. Now something will happen to you, but don't worry. It's just your body reacting to the heroic and noble sacrifice done by our protagonist. Ejaculations and sudden hysterical crying is normal.\\n\\n\r\nThen he finds out that this \"evil spirit\" is something called a stand. A stand is a supernatural power that curtain individuals can use and each stand has different powers and different strenghts. Therefore to defeat different stands different strategies is needed. Jojo will bring Sun Tzu to shame with it's genius tactics and strategies.\\n\\n\r\nDue to certain events Jotaro's mother gets infected by a stand and is dying. The only way to save her is by defeating the evil Dio (WARNING: wear swimming trousers each time he apears, because your panties will be wet after each time Dio has an appearance)  who has haunted the Joestar family for years. So our hero goes on a journey like no other to defeat Dio and save his mother. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is full of plot twists and asks alot of philosophical questions and answers them as well. The plot is complex like no other and is so well written I found myself suddenly crying because of how good and intriguing it was. After having watched Jojo I see the world in a different light and my IQ has been raised by 8 points. It's that deep and philosphical.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 18 reroreros/ 4,8 reroreros\\n\\n\r\n\"If only my art was this good\"- Pablo Picasso\\n\\n\r\nYour eyes are not decieving you. The art is truly this manly and fabulous. Currently in 18 nations around the planet Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is banned because the art is so good it counts as a drug. The art is so good and testorene filled that it's addictive. Yes. It is that good.\\n\\n\r\nOn several occasions I found myself drooling on the fantastisc artwork and character designs. Normally one would wonder why people are wearing school uniforms during a journey to the other side of the world, but not in Jojo, because it looks so good on them. Studios such as Ufotable, Shaft and Madhouse has a few things to learn here when it comes to amazing artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 389 Oraora's/ 217,82 Oraora's\\n\\n\r\n\"Now that I have heard the voice acting and ost of Jojo i can die happy\" -Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\n\\n\r\nI never thought perfection existed in this world. That was until I watched Jojo. Your ears will bleed of pure ecstacy while watching Jojo. Everytime I heard a \"Oh No\" or \"Oh my god\" coming from Joseph I had a ejaculation and nothing can prepare your body for \"rerorero\". \"Rerorero\" made all the citizens of a small village in Siberia cut off their own ears, because they knew they would never hear anything that good aver again.\\n\\n\r\nMy earphones exploded on several occasions, because it could't handle Jojo's voice acting. I'm now on my 23rd headphones. The voices fit the characters so good you will be thinking: \"Were the voice actors born just to play these roles?\" Yes they were. In several interviews the voice actors have confirmed that they have since birth feeled that they were born to be voice actors for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5 wet panties/5 wet panties\\n\\n\r\n\"God, I wish I was as cool and smooth as Jotaro\" -Immanuel Kant\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Stardust Crusaders is the best part. You might think: \"They can't possibly be that good?\" and let me tell you this: they're not. THEY ARE BETTER!\\n\\n\r\nFirst our lead Jotaro who is the embodiment of coolness. Jotaro is noble and manly like few other. Every episode you will scream out in despar: \"How can Jotaro get out of this?\" And each time Jotaro will use his manlyness and godlike intellegence and win against all odds. Side effects of this is you standing up screaming: \"F*CK YEAH!\" on several occasions. You will find yourself striving to be like Jotaro for the rest of your life after having seen him in action.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also superb. They all bring their own distinct personalities, ideals and struggles to the story. You will find yourself drowning in different ideoligies and moralities. You will also start questioning your own morality and ideals thanks to this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also fleshed out and gets development. When you are finished with this show you it will feel like you have known these characters for years, no, DECADES. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is also full of grey morality. The villains are fleshed out like no other and even brins Legend of the Galactic Heroes to shame with it's grey morality. You will feel for both the protagonists and the antagonists throughout this adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoment/Overall: 10 manly tears/10 manly tears\\n\\n\r\n\"If I had to only watch one anime in my life, it would be Jojo\" -Aristotle\\n\\n\r\nI shed manly tears. I laughed. I was moved emotionally and I will never be the same man again.\\n\\n\r\n This show is the show that saved anime summer season 2014 for me( it's not even a part of the summer season.) \\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is not only an anime. It is a piece of art. Words cannot even begin to describe it's manlyness and fabulousness. I can only describe a small part of all the testosterone. \\n\\n\r\nYou should all watch Jojo over all the other mediocries that is currently airing and to help you understand that I have written this review. There is no need to thank me. Thank Jojo for being so amazing. Now, go! Go and watch Jojo!  \\n\\n",

            "content": "A new season of manliness, a new season of awesomeness, a new season of crazy onomatopoeias, impossible poses and clich\u00e9d phrases which are so awesome that will make you forget that they are really clich\u00e9. Here it is, a new season of JoJo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures and it will be this Cat\u00b4s pleasure to review it.\r\nWelcome to The Neko\u00b4s review of JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders.\r\nAs we know, JoJo is divided into several parts, each with it\u00b4s own character, own plot but with similar style. Stardust Crusaders is the third part of the whole Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures franchise and works as asequel to the first season of Jojo, which included parts 1 and 2, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency.\\n\r\nThe series starts with the revelation of DIO\u00b4s comeback to the series, who is after the remaining Joestars heads, and the journey of the new Jojo, Jotaro Kujo, and his companions in order to exterminate DIO once and for all.\\n\r\nThis time the series took a more episodic nature and replaced the Hamon by new powers called Stands, a manifestation of psychic powers that takes the form of any given character\u00b4s Alter Ego. I can only imagine all the Jojo fans, when this was published in the manga, going \"Awww my GAWD, that is soooooooo AWESOME\", because even if now it\u00b4s not THAT original, when the manga was first published it was a kinda big deal. Now we have things like Persona that do things like that, but Jojo is different in the aspect that here Stands can take ANY form, ranging from an enormous ship to a little insect, each with its own abilities and weaknesses. So this episodic nature that the series took this time is shown in a \u2018Stand User of the week\u2019 format. Bad guy appears, Jojo and his friends have to deal with him, they have trouble at first, then they find a way to beat him and then they win in the most awesome way possible...most of the times. While there are some really fun, filled with action and comedy episodes, there are also a lot of episodes that end up being either boring or completely irrelevant, such as The Sun episode. This happens because the author of the manga thought that it would be cool to have the Stands named after Tarot cards, the thing is that then he had to use them all leading to some really unnecessary episodes here and there. The episodic nature of the show can also be bothersome to some people since Part 1 and 2 had a more over arching story. Also, this season is only the first half of Stardust Crusaders with more to come in 2015, so its ending really doesn\u00b4t conclude anything, nothing to worry about since its continuation is already announced.\\n\r\nBut of course, this is still Jojo so we still have the things that make Jojo what it is, bizarre comedy, lots of action and cool phrases, so if you liked season 1 then you will most likely enjoy this season anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Season one wasn\u00b4t the best there is because of the short budget, but they still compensated with filters and colour changing to make it look cool enough despite the short budget. This time they have more money and it shows, the animation is more fluid, colours are more vivid and backgrounds are more detailed but they still keep all the things that made the first season\u00b4s animation so cool, all the change of colours, all the onomatopoeias, all the style is still here and it looks better than ever. The character designs are still Jojo too, lots of muscles and the cool hairstyles are still here. Jotaro\u00b4s design is the one I liked the most, it served its purposed which is to make him look like a badass.\\n\\n\r\nIn this part we have a new set of main characters starring the new JoJo, Jotaro Kujo and his friends, Mohammed Avdol, Jean Pierre Polnareff, Kakyoin Noriaki and the old version of Battle Tendency\u00b4s Jojo, the fabulous Joseph Joestar, Jotaro\u00b4s grandfather. Sadly, Jotaro didn\u00b4t live up to my expectations as a protagonist, he was to much of a badass protagonist than anything else, and is a kind of bland character. It seemed as if he was too forced into being a badass and that had it\u00b4s consequences. He lacked a lot of the charisma that the previous JoJo, Joseph, had. Still, he isn\u00b4t by any means a dislikeable character, but he is far from being one of my favourites.\\n\r\nSpeaking of Joseph, he is back as an old version of himself this season, and boy did he make me worry at first. In the first couple of episode he was presented as a mature old man, almost completely different to the original Joseph Joestar, and I was \"But...is this really the Joseph that we all know and love?\" and it wasn\u00b4t until he starred in one episode that this series said \"FUCK YES HE IS!\" leading to one of the best episodes in the series where we get to hear his old phrases such as \"OOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOO\" and \"Your next line will be...\", so yeah, Joseph is still awesome.\\n\r\nOn the other hand we got Avdol and Kakyoin as supporting characters who had some moments to shine here and there but there is nothing that stands out that much, they are nice characters, but I wouldn\u00b4t say they are amazing. Polnareff on the other hand was the source of most of the usual bizarre comedy and with his joyful personality (most of the time) he ended up being one of the more likeable characters of Stardust Crusaders, at least until now.\\n\r\nSadly even if DIO came back we still don\u00b4t get to see much of him and his fabulousness on screen, he does have a couple of scenes, but for now he doesn\u00b4t do much, since he is to cool to go out and kill all the Joestars by himself. We have secondary villains every episode, but the only ones that stand out are Hol Horse and Enyaba, with other less important villains such as The Empress, which are more funny that any other thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this part is composed Yugo Kanno who, as redundant as it may sound, isn\u00b4t Taku \"God\" Iwasaki, the composer of Battle Tendency. As such the only track that really stood out was the Main Theme, Stardust Crusaders, with the rest of the soundtrack being kinda forgettable. In the other hand the voice acting is still great for the most part, every seiyuu did a grat job with it\u00b4s character, the only complain I have is with Jotaro, voiced by Daisuke Ono, since his voiced lacked some emotion, even in moments where Jotaro gets hit, it\u00b4s not really his fault but is still weird see Jotaro getting damaged and still not showing any sign of emotion, not even in his voice.\\n\r\nThis season features only one Opening and one Ending, the opening being \"Stand Proud\" by Jin Hashimoto, a song that, as always, captures almost perfectly the essence of the Part, is a hit-or-miss song, but for me it was a really cool theme. The ending is of course an 80's song, \"Walk like an Egyptian\" by the Bangles, is a nice song, but I still prefer the opening one.\\n\\n\r\nAs always Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures is still a really enjoyable instalment of the franchise, with some boring episodes here and there, sure, but enjoyable indeed. If you liked season one then there\u00b4s probably no reason why you shouldn\u00b4t watch this one, because even if it\u00b4s not as good as the first one in my honest opinion, at least not yet, it still has most of the things that made Season one so great.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed? Maybe a little since I was hearing so much things about this being the best part of Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures, and I still prefer Battle Tendency over this one, but this still provided me with lots of fun every week, more than what can be said about other series this season, and it is still Jojo, with its poses, its phrases, its over the top action and its bizarre comedy it will surely be enough to satisfy anyone who is looking for some MANLINESS this year. Now the second half is coming out on Winter of 2015 and I am not planning to miss it.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been The Neko and I wish you have a nice day/night.",

I wanted it to be as good as Battle Tendency, but I don't think this anime measures up to it's predecessor.  It's full of plot holes, and later on around episode 16 it really started to feel like every episode was just filler.  None of the main characters have really changed at all throughout the season too.  Along with the season finale (if you could really call it that), where almost nothing gets resolved.  This is a 25 episode anime but I feel like it couldbe cut down to 12 if they really tried.  My advice would be to watch episode 3 then stop and wait for the next season.  Not much of a point watching the rest of this show.",

            "content": "I saw various clips from Stardust Crusaders before I was even familiar with the whole JoJo scene. so I did the obvious, I started watching the 2012 version of the Bizarre Adventure and work my way up to watching Stardust Crusaders. But in all honesty the prequel was clearly better.\r\nThe typical trope in any shonen-type show is a character starting off with a very low amount of skill, but an incredible amount of potential. this is what invests you into watching a show like this, you wish to see the characters evolve, improve themselves, learn new ability's etc.\r\nDespite the flaws the original bizarre adventure had,I was invested in Jonothan and Joseph Joestar because they kept showing me new things, and interesting way's to use their powers. however In this series we get introduced to \"The Stands\" spiritual manifestations which reside in our main cast members and do the fights for them. a very fresh concept, compared to the \"Hamon\" from the prequel. however the stands never evolve or learn in any way. And up to episode 12 every single fight seemed more like a filler that was just there to slow down the plot. normally these fights are present to make our protagonist stronger so they are ultimately ready to face the end villain of the show. but our protagonist Jotaro does not get stronger. not until he actually battle's Dio in the final match of the show. which means I can watch the first 2 episodes of this show, and the last 2 episodes. and I would have missed NOTHING. that is a such a major flaw I can simply not overlook.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to a more positive note.\\n\r\nunlike the prequel Stardust crusaders clearly consists of a team.\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of shows like DBZ (especially it's movies) is that the fights center around 1 brickhouse of a character and the rest of the cast are just water melons waiting to be splattered open by a hammer. Aside from Joesph Joestar the protagonist of the last series our main casts importance is very well devided. despite Jotaro being our Hero, he is not alway's the hero of each episode. and I approve of this a lot!\\n\\n\r\nAlso I have to address that the Exposition level has GREATLY decreased from the original show. And while this had a comedic aspect Stardust Crusaders feels at least a bit more mature then it's predecessor. But that does not mean it's by any means better. Stardust Crusaders just doesn't intrigue me as much as the original no matter how much I'm looking forward to Jotaro and Dio duking it out with Star Platinum and The World.",

            "content": "(I've read parts 1-8 & seen everything JoJo anime related)\r\nStardust Crusaders is the third part of the JoJo series so please watch parts 1 & 2 first. After the events of Phantom Blood & Battle Tendency, Jotaro Kujo makes his debut as this arc's Joestar who discovers his new STAND power & his visited by his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, warning him of the danger that is DIO Brando. After Jotaro's mom, Holly Joestar, is taken ill by DIO's curse, Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff & Iggy embark on a road trip to Egypt to put an end to this family feud of The Joestars &The Brandos.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3 is the most hyped arc of the series but new fans should be prepared for certain changes. The RIPPLE martial art is no longer in use & is replaced with the series iconic STAND which later inspired Persona. Stardust Crusaders takes advantage of this road trip setting as it pays homages to several horror elements found throughout films & novels, yet this is also its weak point.\\n\\n\r\nAs great as the main cast is, the enemies are perhaps too many for this arc. What is to be expected of part 3 are ongoing fights & villain of the week almost on a constant basis with DIO as the final boss. There are a few villains who leave an impression such as Vanilla Ice & The Darby Bros, but as a whole the villains aren't Pillar Men level in terms of character. While the future parts of JoJo also follow this formula, it's more noticeable & repetitive in Part 3.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the charm of Stardust Crusaders are the stands & the heroes themselves as this is the most iconic & arguably the best roster of any JoJo part. While fans may have different opinions on JoJo as a whole, there will undeniably be a favorite character to be found within the group.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation of JoJo has achieved greater animation than its previous animes & managed to contain a cinematic & suspenseful tone just like the previous OVAs. Time will tell how Stardust Crusaders will be received within the anime community, but until then dive into JoJo's Bizarre Adventure where manly shonen heroes battle against the horrors found within Araki's creative mind. Stardust Crusaders became the main style of later JoJo parts & offers a grand conclusion to its long lasting nemesis & puts the Joestar family curse to rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy Part 3 & look forward to Part 4 Diamond Is Unbreakable as it may be the last of a masculine artstyle before things get FABULOUS!!",

            "content": "Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures: Stardust Crusaders is more than just a classic adventure filled with bizarreness. Taking a journey into this show is an experience like no other when it comes to creativity. It\u2019ll be like riding a roller coaster that will leave you with the impression of giddiness and \u201coh what the bloody hell\u201d. But if you think that now, just wait until you find out what our heroes has to blaze through. It\u2019s more than just hell as they become crusaders in this adventure to fulfill their destiny.\r\nContinuing from where Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure (2012) left off, Stardust Crusaders adapts Araki Hirohiko\u2019s manga of thesame name. The series takes place in the year of 1989 where we meet Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of Joseph Joestar. After discovering that he is possessed by a mysterious psychic force, Jotaro comes to realize that this manifestation is dubbed as \u201cStands\u201d. The story gets more complex as Jotaro\u2019s own mother, Holly develops a Stand of her own (due to family origins) that threatens her very own existence. Realizing that Dio Brando is responsible for such development, Jotaro starts the crusade to rid of his influence.\\n\\n\r\nAn important element to take notice from Stardust Crusaders is the introduction of Stands. The concept becomes a prominent device for progress as we witness how they function and adapt to present a credible story. Essentially, Araki experimented with the idea of these Stands as manifestations. The first Stand we see in the series, the Star Platinum, becomes a pivotal figure. What originally seemed like a mad idea becomes enveloped with creativity as witness the diversity of the Stands presented throughout the series. Characters who develop Stands utilize them for a variety of purposes. But what\u2019s more important is that some of them even reflect a side of their persona. The show succeeds with this concept by connecting the idea of Stands with its characters and story to bring about a Jojo pantheon. It does seem like a gamble at first but the risk pays off. The show colorfully depicts Stands through their powers and inspirations that are thought provoking. No Stand looks alike and all of them possess a different power. It creates a thrilling atmosphere of eccentricity as it will make you curious. It will make you wonder and evoke a process to dissect what Araki does with his idea. And honestly, this idea is pure genius.\\n\\n\r\nLike the previous series, Stardust Crusaders also follows the adventure of Jojo and his experiences. Joining him includes Joseph Joestar from its prequel as well as new characters. What\u2019s important about these new characters is that they all have their own Stand. But even more so is the way they develop over as the story progresses. Nothing is really complex about their persona and is fairly straightforward. Perhaps it could be even colored bizarre such as some of the habits of our main characters such as Kakyoin or Polnareff. The show also offer a fair chance for each of the main characters to get their spotlight. This is justified by some of the reasons why these characters join Jotaro on his journey. For instance, Polnareff brings himself along in order to deliver vengeance against a man that took the life of his dear sister. The show intertwines sub-plots during the journey to provide a closure to various story driven plots. \\n\\n\r\nLike its main character cast, the antagonists of the series offer a complex mixture. It\u2019s like a theatrical showdown every time as our heroes deal with threats throughout their journey. They meet antagonists with diverse personalities, some with definite purpose while others treats our crusaders like a game. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the hunters become the hunted. Furthermore, the man pulling the strings behind the scenes (Dio) is often portrayed as a mastermind. And as a man of complex nature, the show crafts its story carefully as Dio\u2019s arsenal of militias goes to work at the most strangest of places. The antagonists\u2019 Stands are also named after tarot cards with some incredible powers to really push the limits of our heroes. Their unique nature and complexity of their powers bring about Araki\u2019s creativity. His ideas comes to crucial play here as each Stand find their niche in this adventure. It expands more than just inventiveness though as some of the Stands also provoke laughter and emotions. For what it\u2019s worth, the Stands and antagonists are like a pair of column that holds the story in place. They not only test the wits of the crusaders where they must think outside the box to prevail but also stimulate emotions. As the story progresses, we find out more about the true nature of some of the main characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nStarring protagonist Jotaro remains the most prominent cast member of the crusaders. Even to this date, he is perhaps the most well-known Jojo from the franchise. On the surface, he may be seen as a cold figure with an indifferent outlook on life while displaying his delinquent-like personality. Yet deep down, he truly does care about his friends and family. This is clearly shown throughout the journey with his words and action with characters such as Ann. Similarly, other main characters show their selfless nature. While some shows it differently than others, it\u2019s evident that they truly care about their comrades. It becomes a highlight reel once you stay with the focus involving the main characters because of their personalities. Each of them may come from different backgrounds but their union together as crusaders is like a brotherhood. It has the feelings, bonding, and is amazing to realize that a journey can bring some strangers together in full circle.\\n\\n\r\nWith its adventurous mood, the show also explores a variety of territories featuring all sorts of terrain. The show covers a decent amount of ground in the first half as they journey towards Egypt to stop Dio. Throughout this journey, the wonders of the adventure can be felt with what characters discover involving different cultures. And despite its supernatural conventions, the show also has bits of realism and can even be relatable when it comes to culture. It can be easily indulged to fulfill elements of creativity through Araki\u2019s concepts. Although the story itself sometimes may feel like a \u201cMonster of the Week\u201d formula with limited development, it\u2019s also important realize the experiment that the author is bringing into his work. In retrospect though, the series isn\u2019t very well written when it comes to explaining certain points. The series has many plot holes that perhaps will never be explained and is left to the imaginative minds of the viewers. While this may seem like a backstabber at first, the show instead cleverly delivers its dynamics and entertaining factors. With or without the bizarreness, Jojo SC\u2019s plot isn\u2019t one that strives to achieve logic. It aims to achieve its purpose to deliver bizarreness. This might come as a mixed bag for some people as the oddball humor could get out of control. The \u2018monster of the week\u2019 formulation might not also be suitable for some viewers through its context.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Jojo SC is formidable when it comes to visual presentation. Character designs reflects the classic style of the franchise while retaining its purpose. Every Stand in the show looks different with emphasis on their design and the bizarreness. The fights are also well coordinated that explodes onto the screen with energy. To add to the flavor are humorous gimmicks and dialogues coming from the heart of our characters. And similar to the previous season, trademark phrases such as \u2018ORA ORA ORA\u2019 are timed fabulously to grab a viewer\u2019s attention. As discussed before, the show\u2019s settings have a variety of backgrounds and each of them convey it well when it comes to delivery. Ranging from mountainous terrain, to foggy ghost towns, or even aboard an aircraft, the show achieves its adventurous tone. David Production surely deserves some praise for their superior animation quality here.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, soundtrack plays a strong role throughout the show. The OP song \"STAND PROUD\" by Jin Hashimoto envelops itself with a fast paced coordination with decorative montages of the main characters with hints of foreshadowing. On the other hand, the ED song \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" delivers its theme of Egypt to the core. OST is also impressive especially during climatic scenarios. Even when the mood seems to be calm, the OST creates a feeling of thrilling experience to show that our heroes are always in danger during their journey. Characters voices are impressive to say the least on most parts whether it\u2019s Jotaro\u2019s stoic mannerisms, Kakyoin\u2019s outgoing personality, or Joseph\u2019s wisdom. Oh and of course, don\u2019t forget that ORA ORA ORA on the door to the way out.\\n\\n\r\nAn epic journey is perhaps what Jojo Stardust Crusaders should be essentially known for. But it expands more than that with the characters, gimmicks, and overall clever writing. While it\u2019s not one of the smartest adventure tale with the history books, Jojo SC is a blockbuster with its exceptional creativity. I\u2019m not just referring to the Stands or characters but also the humor it strives to deliver. It doesn\u2019t go diehard mode with its comedy but instead scales the performance of the characters to bring them at their best during the journey. Perhaps the story plot holes can be a bit frustrating to deal with at times. However, mincing it down is silly when a show with this amount of bizarreness. If for some reason that you decide to go full Sherlock Holmes and try to find these plot holes, then the experience of this show would not suit you well. You\u2019ll be missing out the entertainment as Stardust Crusaders elevates bizarreness in a fashionable way like never before.  \\n",

Jojos Bazaar Adventures: Stardust Crusaders will surprise you right from the start because it doesn't take place in a store or in space like youd be thinking from the name! Nope, this show is all about tongue in exploding chiek action and adventure! \r\nThe story hooks you at the start, with our protogonist getting in trouble and having to get saved by his grandpa, but he's not on a creepy school principle's lap. He's in jail trying to control a demon! Except it's not a creepy school principle demon, either, it's a Stand! No,not like a creepy school principle stand he does when you're on your knees, this Stand is an invincible fighting guardian! His grandpa reveals that the stand must be used to defeat an ancient evil from their family's past, else they'll never be free, and so a grand adventure begins, and let me teel you, they go everywhere:\\n\\n\r\nIndia, Japan, Chinese, Ocean, Singerpore, boy you will learn a lot, and have fun doing it because the action is great, the characters are funny, and it never takes itself too serious like a show such as Attack on Tits. This show moves fast, and throws surprises at you faster than a creepy gym teacher. I can't wait for the episodes where they finally go to space!\\n\\n\r\nEvery Stand fights different, and there's even one that shines like a rainbow as the characters pose; gay equality for everyone. That's not to say the drama isn't good, it's as sharp as our sharpley dressed as our heroes straight out of The Village Peoples music grupe!\\n\\n\r\nYou will be guessing who is a good guy and who is a bad guy constantly and stands are such an interesting concept since they came out long before Pokeman I am told so. When the guy dies, the stand dies, too, so it adds suspense! It seems like they could almost make a prequel to this show there is so much to explore with it! I wish they did, because we need more shows that have a good one episode man on man.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like colors? Of course we all love them unless we don't love colors. Well, this show has colors, and it looks like a comic brought to beutiful life! All the characters look like they work out constantly. I was always how to feel in a scene as the music and art are both so fabulous that they made me want to buy leather chaps.\\n\\n\r\nOver all, what more can I say, if you like a good, short show that lets it all hang out with stile then go for it, but you have to appreciate that it's a paredy of itself.\\n",

            "content": "JOJO'S STARDUST MEISLY CRUSADERS REVIEWED:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nNo utter doubt that this is simply a downgrade in comparison with the first season, and that one was just awesome! So be prepared for a more lack luster plot and worser characters. But is it a mediocrity or dog shat? No!\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nThe Joestar family have been fighting the mythical vampire known as \u201cDio Brando\u201d and soon enough, after he's death from hundreds of years in wait inside a special box, he somehow manages to finally get out when the box he was trapped was suddenly discovered. We now take place in Japan, after four generations of Joestars from that faithful daywhen the first one met Dio, now to carry out the legacy and for the good of the world, Jotaro, the newest member of the Joestar bloodline now has to go thorough a long journey to find where Dio is, and kill him to stop the mayhem of he's actions. He and he's grandfather Joeseph coupled with other masculine men, are working together for the same goal.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nAdimitively, I do actually miss the Hamon thing, the whole show now treats it as if it was some sort of back drop to be abandoned or barely used at all. It was cool to see the new Stand powers, but its not cool to overshadow Hamon completely. And would it not be cool if they used both Hamon and Stands simultaneously?\\n\\n\r\nInstead of having this easy to follow, yet well executed plot, the biggest difference between Stardust and the first, is mainly that Stardust just loses so much of its appeal on what made it more than just \u201cPure Action\u201d it aims for this more episodic approach, as each one or two episode mini arcs is basically the enemy first gaining the upper hand, then the gang defeats the enemy after that episode, then they are one step closer to finding Dio, as he is making he's own stands for people to fight for him as pawns. \\n\\n\r\nFor what Stardust Crusader was worth, it really is just \u201cPure Action\u201d sure its quite silly at times, and it still has that same JoJo like vibe that we all love with men screaming at the top of there lungs going \u201cOOOHH MY GOOOOD\u201d in one of the funniest engrish I've seen since JoJo was the only one who did that whole Engrish thing right! (and maybe Golden Time)\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, its not doing anything particularly wrong for its own merit, the plot is very simplistic and straight forward for You to get the gist of it and follow, and it just seems to fit right in for being just \u201cPure Action\u201d and I really feel that this is how all the  tension of the battles eventually fade away, You no longer feel the fact that JoJo and the team are really in danger, its like hey, these guys will eventually make it out alive with the bad guy(s) already killed, because we just want action, not tension or all of the crying Drama BS.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are simply fun to be around with, sure there are characters like Polnareff with he's Sister complex being all corny and that, and sure, You definitly do not want to f**k with any of these guys! When I do like to maticulosly judge the characters held persona, what I really see is a bunch of two dimensional fighters. We have Jotaro, the silent type and cool type, Avodol the mentor who teaches all stand users under him, Joseph is no longer that fun, sarcastic, cheeky and feisty man who has the brains of 10 war tacticians, but a much more serious and calm man who is more focused than smiling and screams some Engrish from time to time, and whoever voiced Joeseph's Engrish, deserves a bronze medal for not actually making it tolerable, but soooo cringe worthy every time I see it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters lose what little bit of development they have, nor do they feel like there powers are ever devloping, and its like they can just come up to Dio after Jotaro's entire gang of super muscular men are all here. Yes, it does get quite repetitive at times and it is not something that I'm a fan off, but again, its not really doing anything wrong if that is what the show initially wanted to accomplish in the first place. However, both action shows are both self-aware on what they are doing and do not fail at it either. Its just that they changed the formats to quite a big difference and one seems better than the other.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I don't like about Stardust, is that the characters just seem to magically loose there respect to there opponents when they are defeated, like how this stand was defeated and 2 of the group found the stand user was hiding underground breathing on a blow stick then they happily took a wee in it, or how this stand was defeated and one of them found out that the stand user was a baby, when he fed him baby food, he first took his sh*t and mixed it with the food, forcing the baby to eat it. I know, this is supposed to be funny, but I really do not like how Stardust just completely disregards the respect of its death to death battles of the enemy. I would be p!ssed if the first season did that.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Stardust Crusaders is still \u201cJoJo\u201d the characters may not be as complex or as memorable, but they still somehow manage to fit the whole JoJo-like vibe. The plot might as well be backdrop, but hey, the first season had battles as its most memorable moments ever. The pacing has slowed down since Stardust has been reduced to just \u201cFighting\u201d but at least it was very self-aware and was never afraid to give You its entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nDavid's getting quite a hit ever since they decided to adapt JoJo into one of the best 80's remakes ever! (and was approved by Roriconfan for it being better than the original) the newly improved animation just captures the style, self-awareness and the masculinity of the show. Character designs are still JoJo, and I really like the whole super macho men idea fighting to the death. (makes me want to make my own manga about that...) Backgrounds are pretty good all throughout, and the budget remains very consistent and not a dingle moment when I was rather annoyed that it dropped. The action scenes look cool, but there does seem to lack an emphasise on great choreography for the first one, and it sometimes felt that there was not as much thought put in on making these scenes look as cool as I wanted them to be.... Though it is beyond sufficient. The shift into random colours are a nice touch when its used correctly, but nothing worthy for bonus points because its really to stylise the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is far from bad, it is one of those great variety soundtracks that plays with all sorts of different sounds to create better immersion for each different situation. Of course, I am no music critic, so take these skills into a grain of salt. The sound effects do feel like that excact same thing from the Original, and they seem to fit quite well, but it does'nt have so much impact. (And this is probably the only show that made Engrish sound funny)\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nTo a great tale of spoofing the 80's fighting shounen, has now been reduced to just \u201cTama want Battle!\u201d is really all what JoJo is now... but if such direction has been decided to really reduce it to that minimalistic state, is it a bad action show? Hell No!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6/10 - Plot has been reduced to just \u201cFighting\u201d but at the same time, its not doing anything particularly wrong. \\n\r\n5.5/10 -The characters are less complex, and are quite corny. However, they are still sufficient for being fairly entertaining.\\n\r\n7.5/10 \u2013 Consistent animation from David, with great character designs. The action scenes tend to lack great choreography but its still better than average.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 Large variety of music... I'm no music critic, but go take a listen to the OST Yourself. Sorry :/\\n\r\n6/10 - Since it is only entertaining for the action.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 6/10 \u2013 FOR ME TO PREDICT THE ENTIRE EPISODIC PLOT.",

            "content": "Finally more Jojo!!! Another season of manliness, awesome characters and ridiculous plot. That was what I thought about Stardust Crusaders. Unfortunately the results kinda disappointed me. Let's start with the story. The plot is certainly ridiculous like the first season but it didn't have a big progress. Aside from the two first episodes which were very interesting  when the journey starts there isn't something really unique. It consists by the same structure. Ridiculous situations and the fight of the day that the good guys always win. It was still interesting to see how they would get through every ridiculous situation but  for apoint on it became kind off predictable. In the art section the results were godlike. I swear 10 is not even close to describe it. The only thing that I had a problem with was the ridiculous censorship. Yeah there was censorship and that''s the only reason that I put a 9 in the art. The opening was really awesome almost as manly as the one from the first season and the ending very catchy too. The part that I had a real problem was the characters. In a Jojo adventure I don't expect character development but the characters here  were disappointing. First of all Kujo was a little bit boring protagonist . But he was still fun. The thing that frustrated me was how Joseph appeared in this anime. Ok I know it takes place 50 years after ''Battle tendency'' and Joseph wouldn't be as awesome as he used to be but still it was really disappointing to see the ingenious Joseph we knew and love turned into a comic relief. At  least we had some Dio moments but were very few I hope they show him to us more in the next season. Overall I would say that I enjoyed JBA but not nearly as much as the first season. But it was still a fun ride and I can't wait for more.",

            "content": "I was so disappointed in this sequel to the first couple arcs I felt compelled to write a review.  It would have gotten a few more points if it wasn't totally overshadowed by it's predecessor.  So let's go make a list of reasons why this is a total disappointment.\r\nReason 1:  Concept.  For some reason, they went in a totally different direction of the established universe and decided to make it some kind of manly Digimon-type anime.  Not as cool as it sounds.  Remember those cool martial arts fights with Ripple energy?  Yeah, that's essentially gone.\r\nReason 2:  Thecharacters.  No depth at all.  And you might be thinking, \"but it's one of those manly type animes, they don't have to be deep.\"  Watch some Fist of the North Star.  Hell, watch the prequel to this piece of crap again.  There might of been two or three scenes in an entire 24 episodes that gave me some kind of investment or feeling towards the characters.  Additionally, Joseph Joestar.  While I thought he wasn't as cool as Jonathan, he was pretty damn cool and actually had a personality.  Not to mention he had wile and guile in spades enough so to defeat nearly omniscient beings that had lived for over a millennia.   He makes a return as a grandpappy in this season and apparently old age has addled his brains because he's more often that not a liability the whole show.  The only thing I ever had to look forward to from Joseph was his comic relief shticks of screaming \"OH NO,\" \"OH SHIT,\" and \"OH MY GOD,\" in English which is probably the most enjoyable part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nReason 3:  Length.  They drag this shit out so far.  Let's compare.  Prequel, they essentially go through two story arcs and 2 generations of Joestars in the same number of episodes.  This show, they got to Egypt.  IT'S HALF A FUCKING STORY ARC.  I was so hopeful.  I enjoyed the prequel so much that I struggled to get through this.  I'm like, \"it's okay, this happens.  I'll just get through this and next season will be better, I'm sure of it.\"  Imagine my growing sense of dread as I come to realize that the next season is more of this.  But you know what, I'm going to watch it anyway because I liked the first installment so much.  I'm really going to try and see where this goes.\\n\\n\r\nI could keep going but those are my main complaints without going off on tangents about every little thing.  Plus my disappointment has drained me so I'm going to get ready to steel myself and begin the next half of this travesty.  Good luck to us all.",

            "content": "Stardust Crusaders\r\nThe third arc Stardust Crusaders was not what i expected, i thought it was going to be as perfect as Battle Tendecy, i even enjoyed more Phantom Blood, i think what i liked was the Hamon ability, i mean the Stand is a good concept but it is repetitive; I was always thinking in Battle Tendency ''there's no way JoJo can overcome this situation and somebody will help him'' but he did because he was smart a trickster, that's what i liked, not knowing what was next, here in Stardust Crusaders everything was obvious at least 90% of the time i knew what wasgoing to happen at the end of the eps. and some eps. were boring. I will refer to Joseph as JoJo and Jotaro just as Jotaro.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFirst of all the story starts with a BIG plot hole, Dio is alive but this is a little plot hole, the BIG one is that it's explained that Dio saved himself in the coffin he was brought at the end of Phantom Blood, but the thing is that Erina used the coffin to save herself and the babie, no one else, just them and besides it was shown how he exploded with the Ship and how could Jonathan's body survive? i couldn't take out this questions out of my head and the explanations didn't make sense. Well moving on from that, the story continues with a new protagonist Jotaro Kuujo (who was outshadowed by everyone because he was bland and didn't talk, only talking when he wanted to make JoJo look like a fool) a rebell who is in jail because he has a spirit inside him, JoJo arrives and shows him that the spirit is a Stand (which are a mistery) a spirit that's linked to the user in which only another Stand  can fight him back, but every hit made is a hit to the user, if the Stand is killed the user dies in the same way, now that we know about the stands, JoJo tells Jotaro that Dio is alive and it's their destiny to kill him and reveals more things, Holly the mother of Jotaro is a Joestar so she has a Stand but she can't handle the stand and the adventure to kill Dio in 50 days starts with a total of 5 protagonist being Polnareff and Jojo the ones who had more protagonism Kakyouin the 3rd with Jotaro being the 4th and Avdol the 5th. Following a formula of the enemy of the week in which they become repetitive and sometimes boring, and that's how it is from the beginning to the end. I like the Stands but i prefer the Hamon concept. The story is good but i wanted to see the manly usage of the Hamon.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation is a little off for some reason, it has some 3D angles at times, just like in the game, and i thought it was weird and i didn't like that but everything else was great, i like the art style but is a little less manga-ish than before and there were little poses, where are my manly poses? but it was great.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was less enjoyable than in the JoJo 2012, the OP was ok and the ED is not my favorite and i have never been crazy for that song but it was ok considering they are heading to Egypt and the VA was the best and saved the sound but overall it's very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI think the characters were not that great, they weren't what i expected.\\n\r\n-Jotaro the new... protagonist is a bland character with a Stand that looks like Bruford (a character from P.B.) and he acts like a badass who almost never speaks and is smarter for some reason than JoJo, how is it possible to be smarter than the trickster who defeated harder enemies and a god with his trickery and cleverness? and now he is made a fool by Jotaro, give me a break.\\n\r\n-Joseph ''JoJo'' Joestar is older but wait, didn't the fact of being a user of the Hamon makes him look younger? but anyways he's somehow the new SpeedWagon in the sense of explaining everything and using SpeedWagon's company to help in the adventure, he still is a little funny but not as great than before, he's what i enjoyed the most, i didn't like at all that he was made almost useless with an almost useless Stand, i can't imagine this arc without him.\\n\r\n-Avdol is the companion that JoJo brought to Jail to show Jotaro his abilities, and is more like the mature of the group but his personality will change a little after...\\n\r\n-Kakyouin is a little boring just like with Jotaro, but at times he was useful and not that boring.\\n\r\n-Polnareff is another goof and the last they encounter, he has a weird personality, he always wants to flirt with girls, he's the only one that makes the manly poses and he's always involved with toilets.\\n\r\nThe enemies, most of them aren't interesting but they aren't bad, overall the characters were good personally for old JoJo and for Polnareff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was very good, i laughed a lot with Polnareff and JoJo, i liked the concept of the Stands but i felt they didn't do the work like a Hamon user would do, i prefer the Hamon concept just like i stated, the animation is something that i liked a lot, Joseph best JoJo, Jotaro bland ''JoJo''.",

            "content": "If Gurren Lagann put hair on my lip, Jojo put hair on my chest, turned me into The Arnold (ca 1986), and made me sound like James Earl Jones. \r\nIf you want to become a real man, this shouty shonen is the one for you. \r\nOverview: \r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventures: Stardust Crusaders (from now on referred to as Jojo) is part 3 in the over the top, super macho tale of ultra-burly men of the Joestar family who all go by the moniker Jojo. They battle the supernatural forces of darkness, sent by the fabulously evil DIO, and chaotic action, weirdness, and hilarity ensue. Hamon hasbeen ditched in favor of these new superpowers called \"Stands\" which are based on tarot cards. The user has powers which 'suggest' an association with a card, and are named thusly. The powers range from human to animal transformation, combat spectres, fog, dream eaters, and even the sun, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nTha Basics:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThat signature Jojo comic-book-come-to-life style art is once again put to excellent use in Stardust Crusaders, as it was in the previous iteration of Jojo. Combining trippy psychedelic still frame and pans complete with a swirling miasma of neon yellow, blue, green, and purple lights, flowers, zigzags, polka dots, inverted colors, and other filters takes you on a visual Trip At The Brain. This Jojo goes through a variety of settings, as part of the theme is travelling around the world. Consistently drawn characters, well animated fight scenes, and some gruesome blood and gore effects made it a blast to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (5 for OP/ED/BGM, 4 for VA)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a high octane made-for-Jojo track called \"Stand Proud\" by Jin Hashimoto. A good song to get pumped up for the GARness to come. Man, this series could have made use of some Suicidal Tendencies, but I'll take The Bangles and \"Walk Like An Egyptian\" for the ending. A fitting song, given all the 80s pop and rock references that makes this show so fun, not to mention the whole \"Journey to Egypt\" plot.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting is very good. Joseph Joestar and Polnareff are the most interesting and animated characters. Full of great one liners and engrish cursing, they're always good for a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 (Can i give this a 10 just for Joseph Joestar?)(8.8 Joseph Joestar, 0.2 everyone else, haha)\\n\\n\r\nWe've got 5 mains in this show: Old man Joseph Joestar, our hero from the previous installment of Jojo, Battle Tendency, once again takes up the reins as a 67 year old to once again lead his merry band of burly men on a hunt for the nefarious DIO, and picks up a couple friends along the way. He really gets a chance to shine in this series, with his \"OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH\" and \"OH NOOOO\" one liners, along with some classic Joseph \"and now you'll ....\" and the famous Joestar family secret technique. While providing a lot of the wacky humor the show is known for, he doesn't take a back seat just because he's old. He is still able to kick a lot of ass, and does it with style.\\n\\n\r\nAvdol, an Egyptian fortune teller and magician friend of Joseph's. Not a whole lot to say about him; he's typically the most moderate and cool headed voice of reason in the group. He provides a lot of information about and names the Stands that the group has, along with those of their enemies.\\n\\n\r\nJotaro Kujo is the new Jojo for part 3. Jotaro, despite his steely and cold straight man demeanor (and penchant for extreme violence, which leads to some awesome payoffs later in the show) actually has a little depth to his character. I feel like he'll be fleshed out a lot more in Stardust Crusaders 2, but I have to go on what I've seen here: He's kind of boring. He's extremely stoic, unshakable, and generally exudes the air of \"don't f** with me\". They try to give him a little more characterization though asides of his family members speaking about his personality, but these don't shine through very often in the show. However, this isn't really what the show is about, that intense characterization.. it's about KICKING ASS! and Jotaro delivers with gusto! ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA\\n\\n\r\nKakyoin is next up: a schoolmate of Jotaro's and fellow stand user. He's typically calm and reserved, but knows to step up when necessary. Level headed and a strategist, Kakyoin is a solid member of the team. He also typically serves as a foil to our last guy--\\n\\n\r\n--Polnareff. A fabulous Frenchman with a wild flat top and a body that'd make Broly jealous. Impulsive, goofy, and hot tempered, Polnareff serves as the comedic relief most of the time, his temper getting him into a lot of very compromising situations, including one riotously funny one involving a bathroom. He gets a lot of heavy characterization in the latter half of the show, and we find out about his past, his inner demons, and what he's fighting for. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 (Mediocre by MAL rating)\\n\\n\r\nThis is my main problem with Stardust Crusaders: the new pace. I'm all for taking some time and slowing a plot down when there's a lot that's got to be covered. Some other shows could have benefited from more than a 23-26 episode arc instead of 12 or 13, but whatever. The previous Jojo parts were 9 and 17 episodes each (Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency respectively), or essentially each a 1 cour show, and now Stardust Crusaders is getting FOUR whole seasons to itself.. \\n\r\nThe plot, \"benefiting\" from this extended length essentially boils down into an episodic \"bad guy of the week\" format (a la Pokemon) for the first 14 episodes, and then a bad guy every two weeks from then on. Beyond episode 16, it was much improved, with more interesting villains and funnier situations, but the middle run of it almost turned into a bit of a chore to watch. They stretched what would have been about 10 episodes of content into two seasons, basically.\\n\r\nIt could have been cleared up much quicker with a montage or quick, funny two to four minute blurb about how they defeated all these useless villains. This would have enabled a more significant plot arc to develop, and a chance for DIO to be worked into the show. For such a great villain, he barely gets any on screen time, which is a shame for a show that prides itself on having over the top craziness onscreen 90% of the time. Some may counter this rating by saying that it focuses on the characters more by slowing it down, but I feel that for as much characterization as we got, it would have have to have been a literary analysis level study of in depth, emotional complexities and motivations to get much deeper. Jojo isn't about that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (80s bands references 4, brutal shonen action 1, characters 2)\\n\\n\r\nJojo has been growing on me. I didn't want to like the 2012 iteration, but Joseph redeemed it for me during Part 2. Stardust Crusaders gave me more of what I wanted from Jojo: over the top, mature shonen action with the signature flair for the dramatic and 80s pop and classic rock references. It got bogged down in the middle with the baddie of the week setup, but the last few episodes were great. The anticlimactic battle with the Empress, the dreamland battle with Death, and the strangely introspective Judgement episode was also a standout. A stocked second half, and more Joseph.. that's what made the season great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to rate this show higher, because it improved on some parts of Jojo 2012, kept me entertained, and gave me something fun to watch. At the same time though, it left me hanging on actually accomplishing what the show set out to do, and that's why I can't give it an 8. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\n+wacky, goofy, laugh out loud moments\\n\r\n+Joseph Joestar\\n\r\n+brutal action (despite censors)\\n\r\n+80s jokes\\n\r\n+good animation\\n\\n\r\n+/- slower pacing\\n\r\n+/- little character development\\n\\n\r\n- more villains than ever before, now with less significance! \\n\r\n- middle segment is a little boring\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\r\nIf you like Jojo, it's exactly what you're expecting, and more of what you want. If you're looking to get into Jojo, start with the 2012 reboot and decide from there. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a truly unique show. It's one of those rare shows that defines its own standard and redraws boundaries of what should and should not be done with aesthetics and fight scenes. The clothes are fabulous, the action is ridiculous, the voice-acting exudes energy, the poses are awe-inspiring, and the soundtrack is a treat for the ears.\r\nWhen speaking of other anime you can usually use comparisons to pigeonhole that show into a category, but JoJo is pretty much a category in and of itself. No other show has dialogue like JoJo, a story like JoJo, art style like JoJo, characters like JoJo,or fight scenes like JoJo. Myanimelist lists the show as \"shounen\", but JoJo only fits that description in a loose sense.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is the embodiment of Kitsch and Camp; a sort of over-the-top silliness that pokes fun at the wider action conventions while simultaneously making fun of itself. It is so ridiculous that instead of eliciting face-palms it instead puts the audience in a state of euphoric enjoyment and delight. This is a show that realizes the inherent lunacy of cultural \"manliness\", and then puts it on full display in its comedic glory. \\n\\n\r\nIf JoJo must be categorized then it is the following in descending order: Action + Adventure + Comedy + Fantasy + Horror + Supernatural + Drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Stardust Crusaders is very much the beginning of the journey. The core gang of Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, and later Polnareff team up together to reach Egypt in order to stop Dio, an old nemesis from the first season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This first part of Stardust is simply put, a long build-up. It ramps up the stakes and the action over the course of the entire season, introducing new Stands and letting the audience get comfortable with the idea of Stands, their limitations (or lack thereof), and building an attachment to the core group of adventurers. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace is significantly slower than the first season of JJBA, much to the rejoicing of manga readers. However, I feel this is a weakness and not a strength. Many minor fights, which serve no consequence, are thrown into the middle arcs of the show. These are nothing more than filler, and can be summed up as: our heroes suspect a stand user, they discover the limitations of the enemy stand, the heroes beat up the stand user, and continue on their journey. It is an effective formula nonetheless, and is a classic one that has been a staple of Asian storytelling since the novel \"Journey to the West\". \\n\\n\r\nThe story could have used a bit trimming, however. By staying so true to the manga the story suffers from a bit of unnecessary fluff. Many of the fights are disjointed single-episode throwaways, where the bad guy of the week is beaten to a pulp and nothing of significance or consequence happens. This is the largest problem with Stardust Crusaders in comparison to the first season of JoJo, where filler was nowhere to be seen and every fight served a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest addition this season is Stands, which replaces Hamon, as the principal method of combat. Stands are essentially mystical/magical powers that are manifestation of the users' spiritual energy. Their forms are diverse and their application is wildly imaginative and wonderfully realized on screen. \\n\\n\r\nIt is, ultimately, a great adaptation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is the absolute embodiment of the camp aesthetic. Inspired by Fist of the North Star, 80s fashion, glamrock, and psychedelic rock, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a synthesis of color and imagination. The author of JoJo, HIrohiko, once said in an interview that he didn't think much for realism when he colored, but instead focused on what would look interesting. No other show shares the same color palette as this show. The bright teals and purples are very much an attempt to replicate the coloring of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is immediately clear to any newcomers is the outfits and costuming of this show. While it might be too strange to handle for some, the elaborate and excessive fashion for JoJo only helps to elevate the humor and highlight the oddness of their situation. For such an over-the-top show about magical powers and manly contests of strength, it would be a disservice if their clothing were not over-the-top.\\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight of JoJo is the weirdness of the opponents, the excessive oddness of the Stand powers, and the horror elements. It's the kind of vibrant entertainment that filled the old pulp sci-fi magazines of the early 20th century.\\n\\n\r\nI refrain from rating a perfect 10 because JoJo, for all its beauty, has a few moments of choppy animation. It is, after all, difficult to translate such a manga-specific art style to a state of motion. Many characters and fights also lose a bit of detail in transition from the manga, as Araki is known for his laborious and fabulous use of line to accentuate his action scenes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9.9/10\\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders has a near flawless soundtrack that complements the show perfectly. From the opening ballad to the throwback \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" ED, to the energizing guitar/saxophone combo that shows up every time Jotaro is in a moment of triumph, the OST has it all. Of special note are the perfectly suited  It is by far the best thing about the adaptation that elevates the story to a new level. \\n\\n\r\nMany adaptations suffer from a problem where they don't add anything of value to the original manga. They leave the question, \"why would I watch this when I could read the manga?\" For JoJo I can confidently say that the music is one of the main reasons the show might surpass the source material for some fans. Some tracks such as \"Virtuous Pope\" and \"Stardust Crusaders\" will have fans fist-pumping and shouting at their screens with joy\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice actors have done an absolutely incredible job. Every character sounds perfect, and is brought to life in the same bombastic fashion as the first season. Of special note are Jotaro's \"ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA\" and Joseph's english \"HOLY SHIIIIIITTT!!!\" outbursts. As with any great voice work, these voices have now become inseparable from the characters. You can tell the voice actors are having a ton of fun voicing fun material, and their joy is evident in the energy flowing through the entire sound production of this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are definitely enjoyable, I feel they have yet to spread their wings. There is character development, but it is slow, as it takes a backseat to the fight scenes and other aspects the show has to offer. Jotaro, for better or for worse, is a stoic straight-man who is self-aware of his own coolness. Like many other teens he consciously attempts to be cool, and largely succeeds due to his Stand allowing him to beat the crap out of people while keeping his hands in his pockets. Kakyoin is quirky but hasn't received too much attention in terms of development, and Avdol is missing for half the season. Polnareff is definitely the standout amongst the new characters, and his demeanor and carefree ways are a delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar has changed considerably from the previous season. Being saddled with the weakest Stand, he is a great deal less useful in fights. While this is understandable as the focus shifts from Joseph to Jotaro, the difference in Joseph's personality can be felt for people who loved young Joseph in the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to Dio yet, as he's received a maximum of 15 minutes of screen time all season, and his goons are usually one-note cannon fodder for the heroes to chew through. Almost all of the villains are annoying and irredeemable scumbags, for better or for worse. The show adheres to a classic good vs. evil narrative, without spending time dealing with the grays.\\n\\n\r\nWhat has not changed from the first season is the sheer delight in the dialogue. Araki has really found a way to make even the most mundane of conversations into something interesting, infusing quirk and wit into every interaction. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of those rare shows that can be enjoyable if you removed all the action and plot and just let these funny characters hang out in a room together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy watching magical powers the likes of which you've never seen go up against each other? \\n\\n\r\nDo you like creepy dolls try to murder a 7 foot tall jacked Frenchman with a towering hairdo? \\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy cherries being rolled around in overly athletic tongues?\\n\\n\r\nDo you like watching heaps of people be murdered in the strangest ways possible?\\n\\n\r\nDo you love watching manly men do manly things?\\n\\n\r\nDo you want to watch the scum of the earth receive justice by a million punches?\\n\\n\r\nDo you like a journey that spans multiple countries, and gives you travel advice?\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy being consistently surprised every single week by a situation you've literally never seen in any fiction before?\\n\\n\r\nI've never been so entertained.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI do a lot of criticizing because I LOVE this show so much. It is my wish that the next season includes more engaging multi-episode fights with consequence (rather than lame single-episode filler fights), as well as a bit more character development. The slower pace is regrettable, since I had enjoyed the relatively speedy pace of the first season. However, it is not so slow as to detract too much from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Stardust Crusaders is a ride to remember and the most fabulous anime to ever grace the screen. It is a unique prismatic gem amongst a sea of dull rocks.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8.8/10",

            "content": "We're gonna talk about the most important aspect of the anime, the character designs. The character designs are nothing special, we got the characters in different nationalities, a stereotypical indian/egyptian/whatever, some retired indiana jones wannabe, and a main character that ripped off assets from kenshiro with an edgy twist, everything is in dark bleak and bland colors like we need anymore of those outside of blockbuster puke. Now let's get to the main point. Right off the bat we are introduced with the characters, and what the series is best known for. For every character whom for some reason gets no explanation whatsoever, they happento be able to wield super powers! What they basically do is use spirits out of their bodies to fight enemies in their stead and they are called \"stands\", hmm where have I seen this before? Oh right, THE FRIGGIN PERSONA SERIES?\\n\\n\r\nJesus christ I was facefdesking the desk so hard right when I saw the main character whom have the worst name to exist in a shounen series ever, when he tried too hard trying to be cool and edgy copying the persona 3 characters by shooting a gun in their head, except persona actually have cool characters. Not only that but he curb-stomps every enemy in the anime like they are nothing. Where is the fun in that? Some fight scenes were neat to be fair, ones that actually used strategies rather than pure powerlevel, like that ugh... Jo-J-J-Gaaaaah! I would've had like this show better if that awful character didn't exist since I did not mind the other characters at all despite have almost no substance save for 1 character.\\n\\n\r\nJust when you thought they couldn't have ripped off persona even further, all the enemies here have tarot card motifs. WHAT. Yes, it goes all the way from magician to the world cards but here in doesn't work because the supposed \"stands\" don't even have anything to do with the corresponding tarots while in persona, the tarot cards are used to reflect the character's personality. Might as well use constellation names if they're going to be relevant if at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn some episodes, we get to see the big bad's supposed \"all according to evil plan\" scene, but all he does is sit his ass all day while he dispatches the bad guys to do the dirty work for him, I keep thinking I'm watching a Saturday morning cartoon for some reason! So yes, the whole show is also an episodic one at that and the only plot line is them getting to the big bad, that's it.\\n\\n\r\n\"But AzuriteMal\", Stardust Crusaders came out in 1989 while the first persona came out in 1996\". Oh that is simple, let me educate you my dear boy. You see, Persona is part of the megaten series, and megaten came out in 1987, megaten = persona, therefore persona = megaten. What year is that? *gasp* no way, now you know?\\n\\n\r\nI did kinda like how the title stays true to its name with having a real sense of adventure since they travel from Japan to Egypt and such. Most of the setting are like what I'd imagine them to be so that's a plus. Music started good like they keep up the tense of the scene, but it got repetitive hearing the same thing over and over again like a JRPG battle theme. Someone said that there will be an epic fight scene in the 2nd season but I'm not holding my breath since I'm not a fan of episodic anime. I got better things to catch up to.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations\\n\r\n- Persona series: both are very similar, very dark, better characters, makes you think.\\n\r\n- Berserk: It's still darker and more gar than this.",

After Part 1's great world building and character presentation along with Part 2's storyline, battles and characters, you'd expect that Part 3 would be even better or at least mantain the same level of quality.\r\n  What met expectations was some of the worst characters ever seen in entertainment. They had potential too; between Joseph's Hamon doing almost nothing and Jotaro's annoying blandiness + shitty lines, you get the feeling that the main characters just didn't have any effort put into them.\r\n  I gave the story a 4. And by story Imean the Stands, because they were actually creative and enjoyable to watch. The ACTUAL story (Jotaro and his butt boys travel to egypt using the slowest methods available while defeating enemy stands) is hot garbage and doesn't deserve the pity of MAL's rating system of not allowing you to rate it 0.\\n\r\n  The art and sound is a tiny bit worse than Parts 1 and 2 but it's still nice to look at and hear. No complaints there.\\n\r\n  The enjoyment isn't completely ruined by the show's objective flaws, which honestly surprised me. The usual bizarre shit is still there, only better. Seeing Jotaro punching dickheads is pretty cool. The fights are a lot worse but if you don't overthink them you can enjoy them. It's JoJo, and it doesn't let you forget that.\\n\r\n  Fucking sucks dick though.",

            "content": "As of this review, I am 18 episodes in. And I must say, Stardust Crusaders exceeded many of my expectations. The art style has a subtle, yet noticeable change in color palette and tone, opting for a more horror inspired look. This art style is also the closest to the manga by far, so many long time JoJo fans will be very happy with that. \r\nAnd as if that wasn't enough to be happy about, Stardust Crusaders boasts an excellent soundtrack. The opening theme, \"Stand Proud,\" is not my personal favorite JoJo theme (\"Bloody Stream\" is the clear winner there), but it definitely fits thecontext of JoJo very well, and I've grown to like it very much. The ending theme is an older song by The Bangles, \"Walk Like An Egyptian,\" which I haven't heard since I was a kid! That song was a bit jarring as an ending song, but hey, everything about JoJo is bizarre, so I'll take it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nStory wise, without saying too much, an old foe of the Joestar family is back and wants revenge. This series is the first in the JoJo timeline to slowly abandon its Hamon powers and opts for a new ability called Stands: spiritual manifestations of its users that have special powers. Little did I know, the Stands are actually a big influence on anime culture (see series like Persona), and to my surprise, their usage in the series makes for some unpredictable and unforgettable combat scenes. \\n\\n\r\nBefore, we had three main characters to go around, but this time, we have five! Our new protagonist, Jotaro Kujo, works alongside with last season's protagonist, his grandfather Joseph Joestar. They eventually butt heads, but form friendships and alliances with Mohammad Avdol, Jean Pierre Polnareff (the inspiration to King of Fighter's Benimaru, to my surprise), and Kakyoin. I'm sure there are pop culture and musical references to all of them, but I'm too lazy to look it up. All of them have great chemistry together, and their interactions are just as entertaining as the crazy shit they have to face. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you either love or hate JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. If you like yourself some campy manliness, outrageously over-the-top action, a great soundtrack, and a series that's a very faithful adaptation (and then some!) from the manga, you honestly can't do much better than Stardust Crusaders.",

            "content": "I'll start this review for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders by saying i have not seen the other Jojo seasons or read the manga volumes ether and had absolute zero clue what it was going to be about, I know that's stupid of me but i still enjoyed it.\r\nthis review may contain spoilers but i'll try my best not to spoil too much.\r\nStory  8/10\r\nThe story centers around Jotaro Kujo, a badass 17 year old delinquent (who look like he's a 23 year old) who is possessed by an 'evil spirit' so he keeps himself imprisoned to avoid any casualties, he is then visited byhis mother and grandfather, Joseph Joestar (who looks like everything Indiana Jones should of been) and Joseph's good friend Avdol. Joseph explains that the 'evil spirit' is called a 'Stand', monsters that can take any form (such as a flaming bird, a knight in armor or even a micro sized parasite) who give their masters a big boost in power, anyway Jotaro's mother suddenly gains a Stand but causes her to get severely ill and the cause of this is the awakening of Dio (the antagonist) who i believe was on the previous Jojo season i really don't know much about him sorry. The gang set out for Egypt to find and defeat Dio, they meet friends on the way and fight really BIZARRE people also this is only part 1 it stops as soon as they get to Egypt so the ending is pretty ... meh ...\\n\\n\r\nArt  9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art style to this anime its very comicy.. if thats a style... or a word..  it was unique and brand new to me i've never seen any other with a similar art style like it and was perfect for the anime. (Almost)\\n\\n\r\nSound  7/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what to review for the sound, the sound was.. just... yeah.. but the opening ost was good to listen to and i couldn't help but laugh at the song 'Walk like an Egyptian' which is the ending ost. Seriously the last song i thought they would play for a japanese anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe seasons group Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin and Polnareff were... interesting each with unique personalities. This anime doesn't show much development like training to gain more strength it was just \"I'm a villain here to kill you\" a fight starts then Jotaro repeatedly punches their face into submission or something along those lines. You only see Dio a few times forever alone in his playboy mansion sending freaks to kill Jotaro and others and thats about the only air time for Dio. Poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Stardust Crusaders the fight scenes were good to watch some were more like ass whippings than fights and of course the out of it comedy were good for a laugh or two.\\n\r\nBut there were scenes i was confused about like how the characters are harmed (Stabbed, shot or even have their ankle sliced off or half-way through getting eaten alive) they just dust themselves off and move on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i thought this was a very good anime to watch, basic story, great art, good op and ed osts to listen to, the character development may need work, enjoyable battle scenes. I would recommend this to people who love shounen or battle anime or just an anime with muscular men fighting.",

            "content": "Stardust Crusaders is a good choice for you if you're a JoJo fan or looking for some interesting action matchups, but it is terrible if you want anything more or different to that.\r\n\u2022 Foreword for those interested in Stardust Crusaders with no knowledge of the JoJo universe\r\nJoJo's parts can be consumed in any order you would choose to do so, as every part has a self concluding story that can be understood without the need of the previous parts, but each part will spoil the former so the chronological order is adviced if you're interested in the whole JoJo experience. However, Stardust Crusaders was thestarting part for a bunch of people in the west, as that's the only way they could've gotten it around here, since there was an OVA that released a bunch of its more interesting episodes and the manga wasn't really available due to a lot of complications, mostly concerning the names of the characters being after bands and other copyrighted stuff in the west.\\n\\n\r\nAnd these people enjoyed it for what it was. But personally, I advice against using Stardust Crusaders as a starting point. I'd say Part 3, Stardust Crusaders, was the most experimental of all of the JoJo parts, as not only did it almost completely drop its main power and changed it with something else, it also backed down hard on a character moment that lead to the story feeling stilted and non-existent and the setting of everything being mostly an excuse for characters to fight. You would have the same understanding of the story if you start from the first few episodes and then watch the last few as there's very little actual significant events or character moments that actually bring anything of value to the actual story. This wasn't a problem in JoJo up to this point and it didn't seem to show up anywhere as far as I've gotten into it so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe powers, mostly of the main characters, are basic and don't feel unique, since the concept was just introduced and was somewhat experimental, but mostly their opponents are those that do the heavy lifting in terms of uniqueness. Personality wise there's not a whole of distinctive traits, outside of the overall design of the characters. They mostly have basic to very little personality. The only thing I'd say it succeeds in is the action and since it's an action series, that's the only thing that keeps it from being outright bad. Unless you plan on watching an action series without having much investment into the story and just because the fights seem interesting, I advice checking out literally any other part. However, if the fights are all you care about, you can start from here, since here's when the concept of stands is introduced, and while the shenanigans with the former power are entertaining in the second part, these feel way more like actual real matchups but the lack of progression in the story and how it might feel dragged out because of that might eventually wear down anyone. Personally I'd advice checking out the next part if you wanna get introduced to the concept of stands since by that point it has found its footing and it actually has a setting that makes up for a dragged out story since everything happens in a small town rather than a chase around the globe, where the ball gets tossed from side to side rather than nothing ever changing in the story ever.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Differences between previous parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important difference is the pretext of the powers and what they are. We get a switch off from a power called Ripple that is basically an energy that can harm vampires and other vile creatures and has some other nifty uses such as walking on water or imbuing into this to send an object flying and so on and so on. Instead the current powers are replaced by stands, which are simple as a concept, they're basically a representation of the spirit of the user and have powers which they use to fight. Some can launch fire. Some can punch stuff. Sounds boring? Yeah, because those are the main characters and it was needed to introduce them as simple for everyone to understand them. But as the story progresses the stands get weirder and more complicated. Like a character that can attack you and exists only inside spaces where light is reflected. Or a stand that can take your soul but only if you feel the frustration of loss. It gets really wacky progressively.\\n\\n\r\nBut this moves me on to my next point, which is unlike the first and second part, the third part feels a lot like an experiment and like its only point is to see if the writer can keep his audience engaged only with really good action. And he can, he definitely got me, but he reintroduces a character called Dio and does very little effort to expose the vile things he did as a villain, villain whom was this vile vampire who used to glue people's heads on dogs and make mothers eat their own babies. It's that bad that when the OVA was adapted, no real prior knowledge of JoJo was given and a lot of people had this question about Stardust Crusaders. WHAT DID THE VILLAIN EVEN DO??? MAYBE HE'S INNOCENT? THIS MAKES NO SENSE! You couldn't give the guy who makes mothers eat their own babies one moment in the third part to represent how vile he is until they reached the final fight? Really? \\n\\n\r\nThe situation at hand in the story, the fights, is what gets the attention, and the characters, while there are attempts and some moments where they get their glory, they mostly tread water. While it may be due to how the studio summarized the previous two parts that I feel this way, that JoJo never really had pointless fights, almost every fight in this part is completely pointless and doesn't bring anything except entertainment value to its story, which never seemed it was ever gonna be an issue before. It's very much like the beginning of cartoons, where the characters had no real inner world logic and did things to please the viewers, rather than have their own motivations. I think this describes Stardust Crusaders perfectly and explains what is different about its other parts. And I'll spell it out once again. It doesn't really try to go anywhere. The former parts do. Just because it pretends it's not as I've just described doesn't mean it doesn't walk the walk.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, since most of the previous parts were summarized, there's a lot of fights in JoJo just for the sake of fighting typically. So if you felt that most fights progressed in a fashion that always lead the story forward, there's a lot of villain of the week from this point onwards that you'll have to get through. While I do give a lot of criticism to Stardust Crusaders, it is the skeleton upon the future parts will be built, since if you can handle this part's rhythm, you should have no problem enjoying anything that JoJo has to offer from this point onwards. If you'll watch this part and you will think it is bad, just know that it will never be as bad as it is at this point.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, there is one positive difference here. And that is that the fights feel a lot more organic than they did previously. The fights aren't gonna be either Part 1's I'm Stronk And Honorable I Win or Part 2's admittedly very entertaining but still very kindergarden pretense fighting. What do I mean by that? \"Oh you're gonna blast me with a laser beam, but I already knew you were gonna do that, so I have a super laser beam shield. Now I'll shoot a super super laser beam at you.\" \\n\\n\r\nEvery fighter now has strengths, weaknesses and matchups with enemies with again, their own strengths and weaknesses which they have to find out and do their best to outmatch each other. It is executed well, the fights are organic and often well thought out. They are entertaining in their own right because they don't rely on any gimmick, they instead create their own based on the situation at hand. While most powers for the main characters are rather basic, it is enjoyable for what it is.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Essentially what you should expect from the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo what you need to know about Stardust Crusaders is the following. It focuses purely on fighting and how to enhance the entertainment factor of that. The characters will throw one liners, bizarre lines, do silly shit, create ridiculous situations, all while having some very interesting matchups. The matchups consist of different super powers having specific gimmicks. So x fights y trying to figure out y's power and then defeats them, in a way that exploits a weakness of the power of y. It follows a villain of the week pattern so that's what you should look forward to if you're getting into this.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much from the story, since the main focus is fighting, the secondary is fighting. Can you guess the tertiary? How about the one after that? And after that? Yeah. The story can be digested easily by watching a few of the first episodes and then skipping to like the last ones where they fight the villain. I'd advice you to temper your expectations in regards when you might watch it and something that might have interesting implications for the story. It will always be run back. To which degree that is I'll leave it up to your interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nDue to that matter, you can figure out that again, the characters are gonna be represented like old cartoons, with their motivation not really being there and what they do is completely service for the viewer, rather than thinking for themselves. Stardust Crusaders just pretends it doesn't do that and does a bad job at it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I can say about this part and its future parts always is this:\\n\\n\r\n\"The action of the series is generally over the top and bizarre, just like you'd expect from the title, with some (censored) gore and pretty unusual situations. Although the series if presented out of context could look quite ridiculous, in the context of the world, it can easily be taken seriously as far as the action goes and the fights are always well thought-out and very well planned strategically, featuring powers that prove more worthwhile the more witty and creative you are. For those looking for the type of action I've described, it's very unlikely that you will not enjoy JoJo a lot for this reason alone as I can hardly think of anything that can match it in this department.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou are likely to enjoy Stardust Crusaders if you enjoyed JoJo or any action series so far solely for their action factor. But if you need a compelling story on the side, don't. Stardust Crusaders is terrible in that department. Watch it if you enjoy fighting or you want to watch JoJo as a whole. But don't decide out of thin air, I heard this show that has fights in is really good. I wonder what amazingly memorable characters and what compelling story is gonna bring to the table. They're like WWE wrestler gimmicks. They only matter as long as you enjoy wrestling, otherwise they sound stupid.",

            "content": "I've  talked about the JoJo franchise before. Kimyou na Bouken was fairly absurd and over the top, but it was also enjoyable and entertaining. In that series, we watched the first of the titular JoJo sacrifice his life to stop the villainous Dio Brando. We also saw his grandson Joseph, also  called Jojo, take on a group of ancient warriors.  Ending with his confrontation with the strongest of them all, Kars. Let's take a look  at the follow up with JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series I and see if David Production kept the series going strong. \r\nStory:\r\nWe openwith Joutarou, the grandson of Joseph from the last series. He's being released from prison after being taken in for fighting. Joutarou, however, refuses to leave. He claims to have been possessed by an evil spirit and doesn't want to lose control and hurt people. His mother, Holly, contacts her father. Joseph goes to Japan and reveals that Joutarou's evil spirit is actually a power called a Stand. The Joestar  family has recently developed these powers coinciding with the return of Dio. After being defeated and decapitated by Jonathan Joestar, he managed to steal Jonathan's dead body and survive underwater  until he was pulled up by a boat. Thanks to his new found connection with the Joestar family, they've all developed Stands. Unfortunately, Holly isn't strong enough to handle hers and it's killing her. Joseph and Jotaro leave her in the hands of the Speedwagon foundation and, along with some companions, undertake the journey to defeat Dio in order to save Holly's life. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is just that it can get repetitive. There are several points where the dialogue consists of characters repeating information. The series also uses a very formulaic pattern where the group progresses to a new area, encounters a Stand user who's working for Dio and they have to develop a strategy to beat them. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series still excels at providing over the top, enjoyable action sequences that are, honestly, pretty creative. I also appreciate that there are major stakes for our heroes and they have to race against time. Heroes having to face major odds while racing against time might be nothing new, but it works well for a series like this that gets its appeal from being absurdly, entertainingly over the top.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters remain pretty archetypical. Joutarou is the bad boy with a good heart. Joseph has gone from the cunning protagonist to the elder mentor figure. Dio is still very much an evil for the evils character. We've still got a bunch of characters named after old musical artists  like Devo, J Geil & Midler. That being said, I actually like the cast in this. They're not complex, but they're entertaining. They actually remind me of a silver age super hero team, in a positive way. JoJo & his amazing friends. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork suits the series well. It's full of machismo. Almost every major male character we see is huge and powerfully muscled. We also get added over the top effects and stopping to pose during fights is still a factor. I do love the action sequences in this though. The series takes this idea of Stands and their mysterious powers and uses them really creatively with a lot of different types, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Which makes for some really creative battles, including one that's fought in the world of dreams and one that starts aboard a submarine. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal performances continue to be really exaggerated. Ishizuka Unshou in particular has a lot of lines where he just yells exclamations. That being said, the exaggerated delivery does work given the aesthetic that the series has. I also like that the ending theme tune is Walk Like an Egyptian. It really fits both in terms of being kind of ridiculous and in terms of the whole, really fond of classic rock, naming convention. Kanno Yugo's original music is pretty good. There is a nice soundtrack to this. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any ho-yay in this series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is ridiculous, over the top, full of machismo and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. While not complex, it is an entertaining series with solid action and some really creative fights. If you're in the mood for something that's deliberately absurd, consider checking it out. If you want a complex narrative with deep characters, it's  not going to do it for you.  For me, my final rating is going to be an 8/10. Maybe I'll look at the second Stardust Crusaders series at a later point but next week is Komori-san wa Kotowarenai because I was looking for something short to review betwixt this and Brain Powerd and picked it randomly.",

            "content": "I found myself stuck in the puddle of mediocrity that is 2014 summer season. Akame ga Kill, Tokyo Ghoul, Aldnoah.Zero and SAO II. I was slowly losing my faith in anime and on several occasions I thought that I should try to go outside my room and socialize with other Homo Sapiens. It was that bad.\r\nThen...\r\nThen I saw a pillar.\r\nA pillar of hope.\r\nA pillar of testosterone and manlyness.\r\nA pillar of Jojo.\r\nStory: 10 pillars of hope/10 pillars of hope\r\n\"This makes my plays look like Mars of Destruction in comparison\" -William Shakespeare\r\nWhere do I begin? At the start most likely. It starts with  our hero JotaroKujo (This parts Jojo) sitting in a prison cell. You will be asking yourself: \"How can such a man, who is the manfistation of coolness and manlyness be stuck in prison?\" Then you find out he has put himself in a cell to protect people from the \"evil spirit\" that is possessing him. Now something will happen to you, but don't worry. It's just your body reacting to the heroic and noble sacrifice done by our protagonist. Ejaculations and sudden hysterical crying is normal.\\n\\n\r\nThen he finds out that this \"evil spirit\" is something called a stand. A stand is a supernatural power that curtain individuals can use and each stand has different powers and different strenghts. Therefore to defeat different stands different strategies is needed. Jojo will bring Sun Tzu to shame with it's genius tactics and strategies.\\n\\n\r\nDue to certain events Jotaro's mother gets infected by a stand and is dying. The only way to save her is by defeating the evil Dio (WARNING: wear swimming trousers each time he apears, because your panties will be wet after each time Dio has an appearance)  who has haunted the Joestar family for years. So our hero goes on a journey like no other to defeat Dio and save his mother. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is full of plot twists and asks alot of philosophical questions and answers them as well. The plot is complex like no other and is so well written I found myself suddenly crying because of how good and intriguing it was. After having watched Jojo I see the world in a different light and my IQ has been raised by 8 points. It's that deep and philosphical.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 18 reroreros/ 4,8 reroreros\\n\\n\r\n\"If only my art was this good\"- Pablo Picasso\\n\\n\r\nYour eyes are not decieving you. The art is truly this manly and fabulous. Currently in 18 nations around the planet Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is banned because the art is so good it counts as a drug. The art is so good and testorene filled that it's addictive. Yes. It is that good.\\n\\n\r\nOn several occasions I found myself drooling on the fantastisc artwork and character designs. Normally one would wonder why people are wearing school uniforms during a journey to the other side of the world, but not in Jojo, because it looks so good on them. Studios such as Ufotable, Shaft and Madhouse has a few things to learn here when it comes to amazing artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 389 Oraora's/ 217,82 Oraora's\\n\\n\r\n\"Now that I have heard the voice acting and ost of Jojo i can die happy\" -Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\n\\n\r\nI never thought perfection existed in this world. That was until I watched Jojo. Your ears will bleed of pure ecstacy while watching Jojo. Everytime I heard a \"Oh No\" or \"Oh my god\" coming from Joseph I had a ejaculation and nothing can prepare your body for \"rerorero\". \"Rerorero\" made all the citizens of a small village in Siberia cut off their own ears, because they knew they would never hear anything that good aver again.\\n\\n\r\nMy earphones exploded on several occasions, because it could't handle Jojo's voice acting. I'm now on my 23rd headphones. The voices fit the characters so good you will be thinking: \"Were the voice actors born just to play these roles?\" Yes they were. In several interviews the voice actors have confirmed that they have since birth feeled that they were born to be voice actors for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5 wet panties/5 wet panties\\n\\n\r\n\"God, I wish I was as cool and smooth as Jotaro\" -Immanuel Kant\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Stardust Crusaders is the best part. You might think: \"They can't possibly be that good?\" and let me tell you this: they're not. THEY ARE BETTER!\\n\\n\r\nFirst our lead Jotaro who is the embodiment of coolness. Jotaro is noble and manly like few other. Every episode you will scream out in despar: \"How can Jotaro get out of this?\" And each time Jotaro will use his manlyness and godlike intellegence and win against all odds. Side effects of this is you standing up screaming: \"F*CK YEAH!\" on several occasions. You will find yourself striving to be like Jotaro for the rest of your life after having seen him in action.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also superb. They all bring their own distinct personalities, ideals and struggles to the story. You will find yourself drowning in different ideoligies and moralities. You will also start questioning your own morality and ideals thanks to this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also fleshed out and gets development. When you are finished with this show you it will feel like you have known these characters for years, no, DECADES. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is also full of grey morality. The villains are fleshed out like no other and even brins Legend of the Galactic Heroes to shame with it's grey morality. You will feel for both the protagonists and the antagonists throughout this adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoment/Overall: 10 manly tears/10 manly tears\\n\\n\r\n\"If I had to only watch one anime in my life, it would be Jojo\" -Aristotle\\n\\n\r\nI shed manly tears. I laughed. I was moved emotionally and I will never be the same man again.\\n\\n\r\n This show is the show that saved anime summer season 2014 for me( it's not even a part of the summer season.) \\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is not only an anime. It is a piece of art. Words cannot even begin to describe it's manlyness and fabulousness. I can only describe a small part of all the testosterone. \\n\\n\r\nYou should all watch Jojo over all the other mediocries that is currently airing and to help you understand that I have written this review. There is no need to thank me. Thank Jojo for being so amazing. Now, go! Go and watch Jojo!  \\n\\n",

            "content": "A new season of manliness, a new season of awesomeness, a new season of crazy onomatopoeias, impossible poses and clich\u00e9d phrases which are so awesome that will make you forget that they are really clich\u00e9. Here it is, a new season of JoJo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures and it will be this Cat\u00b4s pleasure to review it.\r\nWelcome to The Neko\u00b4s review of JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders.\r\nAs we know, JoJo is divided into several parts, each with it\u00b4s own character, own plot but with similar style. Stardust Crusaders is the third part of the whole Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures franchise and works as asequel to the first season of Jojo, which included parts 1 and 2, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency.\\n\r\nThe series starts with the revelation of DIO\u00b4s comeback to the series, who is after the remaining Joestars heads, and the journey of the new Jojo, Jotaro Kujo, and his companions in order to exterminate DIO once and for all.\\n\r\nThis time the series took a more episodic nature and replaced the Hamon by new powers called Stands, a manifestation of psychic powers that takes the form of any given character\u00b4s Alter Ego. I can only imagine all the Jojo fans, when this was published in the manga, going \"Awww my GAWD, that is soooooooo AWESOME\", because even if now it\u00b4s not THAT original, when the manga was first published it was a kinda big deal. Now we have things like Persona that do things like that, but Jojo is different in the aspect that here Stands can take ANY form, ranging from an enormous ship to a little insect, each with its own abilities and weaknesses. So this episodic nature that the series took this time is shown in a \u2018Stand User of the week\u2019 format. Bad guy appears, Jojo and his friends have to deal with him, they have trouble at first, then they find a way to beat him and then they win in the most awesome way possible...most of the times. While there are some really fun, filled with action and comedy episodes, there are also a lot of episodes that end up being either boring or completely irrelevant, such as The Sun episode. This happens because the author of the manga thought that it would be cool to have the Stands named after Tarot cards, the thing is that then he had to use them all leading to some really unnecessary episodes here and there. The episodic nature of the show can also be bothersome to some people since Part 1 and 2 had a more over arching story. Also, this season is only the first half of Stardust Crusaders with more to come in 2015, so its ending really doesn\u00b4t conclude anything, nothing to worry about since its continuation is already announced.\\n\r\nBut of course, this is still Jojo so we still have the things that make Jojo what it is, bizarre comedy, lots of action and cool phrases, so if you liked season 1 then you will most likely enjoy this season anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Season one wasn\u00b4t the best there is because of the short budget, but they still compensated with filters and colour changing to make it look cool enough despite the short budget. This time they have more money and it shows, the animation is more fluid, colours are more vivid and backgrounds are more detailed but they still keep all the things that made the first season\u00b4s animation so cool, all the change of colours, all the onomatopoeias, all the style is still here and it looks better than ever. The character designs are still Jojo too, lots of muscles and the cool hairstyles are still here. Jotaro\u00b4s design is the one I liked the most, it served its purposed which is to make him look like a badass.\\n\\n\r\nIn this part we have a new set of main characters starring the new JoJo, Jotaro Kujo and his friends, Mohammed Avdol, Jean Pierre Polnareff, Kakyoin Noriaki and the old version of Battle Tendency\u00b4s Jojo, the fabulous Joseph Joestar, Jotaro\u00b4s grandfather. Sadly, Jotaro didn\u00b4t live up to my expectations as a protagonist, he was to much of a badass protagonist than anything else, and is a kind of bland character. It seemed as if he was too forced into being a badass and that had it\u00b4s consequences. He lacked a lot of the charisma that the previous JoJo, Joseph, had. Still, he isn\u00b4t by any means a dislikeable character, but he is far from being one of my favourites.\\n\r\nSpeaking of Joseph, he is back as an old version of himself this season, and boy did he make me worry at first. In the first couple of episode he was presented as a mature old man, almost completely different to the original Joseph Joestar, and I was \"But...is this really the Joseph that we all know and love?\" and it wasn\u00b4t until he starred in one episode that this series said \"FUCK YES HE IS!\" leading to one of the best episodes in the series where we get to hear his old phrases such as \"OOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOO\" and \"Your next line will be...\", so yeah, Joseph is still awesome.\\n\r\nOn the other hand we got Avdol and Kakyoin as supporting characters who had some moments to shine here and there but there is nothing that stands out that much, they are nice characters, but I wouldn\u00b4t say they are amazing. Polnareff on the other hand was the source of most of the usual bizarre comedy and with his joyful personality (most of the time) he ended up being one of the more likeable characters of Stardust Crusaders, at least until now.\\n\r\nSadly even if DIO came back we still don\u00b4t get to see much of him and his fabulousness on screen, he does have a couple of scenes, but for now he doesn\u00b4t do much, since he is to cool to go out and kill all the Joestars by himself. We have secondary villains every episode, but the only ones that stand out are Hol Horse and Enyaba, with other less important villains such as The Empress, which are more funny that any other thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this part is composed Yugo Kanno who, as redundant as it may sound, isn\u00b4t Taku \"God\" Iwasaki, the composer of Battle Tendency. As such the only track that really stood out was the Main Theme, Stardust Crusaders, with the rest of the soundtrack being kinda forgettable. In the other hand the voice acting is still great for the most part, every seiyuu did a grat job with it\u00b4s character, the only complain I have is with Jotaro, voiced by Daisuke Ono, since his voiced lacked some emotion, even in moments where Jotaro gets hit, it\u00b4s not really his fault but is still weird see Jotaro getting damaged and still not showing any sign of emotion, not even in his voice.\\n\r\nThis season features only one Opening and one Ending, the opening being \"Stand Proud\" by Jin Hashimoto, a song that, as always, captures almost perfectly the essence of the Part, is a hit-or-miss song, but for me it was a really cool theme. The ending is of course an 80's song, \"Walk like an Egyptian\" by the Bangles, is a nice song, but I still prefer the opening one.\\n\\n\r\nAs always Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures is still a really enjoyable instalment of the franchise, with some boring episodes here and there, sure, but enjoyable indeed. If you liked season one then there\u00b4s probably no reason why you shouldn\u00b4t watch this one, because even if it\u00b4s not as good as the first one in my honest opinion, at least not yet, it still has most of the things that made Season one so great.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed? Maybe a little since I was hearing so much things about this being the best part of Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventures, and I still prefer Battle Tendency over this one, but this still provided me with lots of fun every week, more than what can be said about other series this season, and it is still Jojo, with its poses, its phrases, its over the top action and its bizarre comedy it will surely be enough to satisfy anyone who is looking for some MANLINESS this year. Now the second half is coming out on Winter of 2015 and I am not planning to miss it.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been The Neko and I wish you have a nice day/night.",

I wanted it to be as good as Battle Tendency, but I don't think this anime measures up to it's predecessor.  It's full of plot holes, and later on around episode 16 it really started to feel like every episode was just filler.  None of the main characters have really changed at all throughout the season too.  Along with the season finale (if you could really call it that), where almost nothing gets resolved.  This is a 25 episode anime but I feel like it couldbe cut down to 12 if they really tried.  My advice would be to watch episode 3 then stop and wait for the next season.  Not much of a point watching the rest of this show.",

            "content": "I saw various clips from Stardust Crusaders before I was even familiar with the whole JoJo scene. so I did the obvious, I started watching the 2012 version of the Bizarre Adventure and work my way up to watching Stardust Crusaders. But in all honesty the prequel was clearly better.\r\nThe typical trope in any shonen-type show is a character starting off with a very low amount of skill, but an incredible amount of potential. this is what invests you into watching a show like this, you wish to see the characters evolve, improve themselves, learn new ability's etc.\r\nDespite the flaws the original bizarre adventure had,I was invested in Jonothan and Joseph Joestar because they kept showing me new things, and interesting way's to use their powers. however In this series we get introduced to \"The Stands\" spiritual manifestations which reside in our main cast members and do the fights for them. a very fresh concept, compared to the \"Hamon\" from the prequel. however the stands never evolve or learn in any way. And up to episode 12 every single fight seemed more like a filler that was just there to slow down the plot. normally these fights are present to make our protagonist stronger so they are ultimately ready to face the end villain of the show. but our protagonist Jotaro does not get stronger. not until he actually battle's Dio in the final match of the show. which means I can watch the first 2 episodes of this show, and the last 2 episodes. and I would have missed NOTHING. that is a such a major flaw I can simply not overlook.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to a more positive note.\\n\r\nunlike the prequel Stardust crusaders clearly consists of a team.\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of shows like DBZ (especially it's movies) is that the fights center around 1 brickhouse of a character and the rest of the cast are just water melons waiting to be splattered open by a hammer. Aside from Joesph Joestar the protagonist of the last series our main casts importance is very well devided. despite Jotaro being our Hero, he is not alway's the hero of each episode. and I approve of this a lot!\\n\\n\r\nAlso I have to address that the Exposition level has GREATLY decreased from the original show. And while this had a comedic aspect Stardust Crusaders feels at least a bit more mature then it's predecessor. But that does not mean it's by any means better. Stardust Crusaders just doesn't intrigue me as much as the original no matter how much I'm looking forward to Jotaro and Dio duking it out with Star Platinum and The World.",

            "content": "(I've read parts 1-8 & seen everything JoJo anime related)\r\nStardust Crusaders is the third part of the JoJo series so please watch parts 1 & 2 first. After the events of Phantom Blood & Battle Tendency, Jotaro Kujo makes his debut as this arc's Joestar who discovers his new STAND power & his visited by his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, warning him of the danger that is DIO Brando. After Jotaro's mom, Holly Joestar, is taken ill by DIO's curse, Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff & Iggy embark on a road trip to Egypt to put an end to this family feud of The Joestars &The Brandos.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3 is the most hyped arc of the series but new fans should be prepared for certain changes. The RIPPLE martial art is no longer in use & is replaced with the series iconic STAND which later inspired Persona. Stardust Crusaders takes advantage of this road trip setting as it pays homages to several horror elements found throughout films & novels, yet this is also its weak point.\\n\\n\r\nAs great as the main cast is, the enemies are perhaps too many for this arc. What is to be expected of part 3 are ongoing fights & villain of the week almost on a constant basis with DIO as the final boss. There are a few villains who leave an impression such as Vanilla Ice & The Darby Bros, but as a whole the villains aren't Pillar Men level in terms of character. While the future parts of JoJo also follow this formula, it's more noticeable & repetitive in Part 3.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the charm of Stardust Crusaders are the stands & the heroes themselves as this is the most iconic & arguably the best roster of any JoJo part. While fans may have different opinions on JoJo as a whole, there will undeniably be a favorite character to be found within the group.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation of JoJo has achieved greater animation than its previous animes & managed to contain a cinematic & suspenseful tone just like the previous OVAs. Time will tell how Stardust Crusaders will be received within the anime community, but until then dive into JoJo's Bizarre Adventure where manly shonen heroes battle against the horrors found within Araki's creative mind. Stardust Crusaders became the main style of later JoJo parts & offers a grand conclusion to its long lasting nemesis & puts the Joestar family curse to rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy Part 3 & look forward to Part 4 Diamond Is Unbreakable as it may be the last of a masculine artstyle before things get FABULOUS!!",

            "content": "Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures: Stardust Crusaders is more than just a classic adventure filled with bizarreness. Taking a journey into this show is an experience like no other when it comes to creativity. It\u2019ll be like riding a roller coaster that will leave you with the impression of giddiness and \u201coh what the bloody hell\u201d. But if you think that now, just wait until you find out what our heroes has to blaze through. It\u2019s more than just hell as they become crusaders in this adventure to fulfill their destiny.\r\nContinuing from where Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure (2012) left off, Stardust Crusaders adapts Araki Hirohiko\u2019s manga of thesame name. The series takes place in the year of 1989 where we meet Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of Joseph Joestar. After discovering that he is possessed by a mysterious psychic force, Jotaro comes to realize that this manifestation is dubbed as \u201cStands\u201d. The story gets more complex as Jotaro\u2019s own mother, Holly develops a Stand of her own (due to family origins) that threatens her very own existence. Realizing that Dio Brando is responsible for such development, Jotaro starts the crusade to rid of his influence.\\n\\n\r\nAn important element to take notice from Stardust Crusaders is the introduction of Stands. The concept becomes a prominent device for progress as we witness how they function and adapt to present a credible story. Essentially, Araki experimented with the idea of these Stands as manifestations. The first Stand we see in the series, the Star Platinum, becomes a pivotal figure. What originally seemed like a mad idea becomes enveloped with creativity as witness the diversity of the Stands presented throughout the series. Characters who develop Stands utilize them for a variety of purposes. But what\u2019s more important is that some of them even reflect a side of their persona. The show succeeds with this concept by connecting the idea of Stands with its characters and story to bring about a Jojo pantheon. It does seem like a gamble at first but the risk pays off. The show colorfully depicts Stands through their powers and inspirations that are thought provoking. No Stand looks alike and all of them possess a different power. It creates a thrilling atmosphere of eccentricity as it will make you curious. It will make you wonder and evoke a process to dissect what Araki does with his idea. And honestly, this idea is pure genius.\\n\\n\r\nLike the previous series, Stardust Crusaders also follows the adventure of Jojo and his experiences. Joining him includes Joseph Joestar from its prequel as well as new characters. What\u2019s important about these new characters is that they all have their own Stand. But even more so is the way they develop over as the story progresses. Nothing is really complex about their persona and is fairly straightforward. Perhaps it could be even colored bizarre such as some of the habits of our main characters such as Kakyoin or Polnareff. The show also offer a fair chance for each of the main characters to get their spotlight. This is justified by some of the reasons why these characters join Jotaro on his journey. For instance, Polnareff brings himself along in order to deliver vengeance against a man that took the life of his dear sister. The show intertwines sub-plots during the journey to provide a closure to various story driven plots. \\n\\n\r\nLike its main character cast, the antagonists of the series offer a complex mixture. It\u2019s like a theatrical showdown every time as our heroes deal with threats throughout their journey. They meet antagonists with diverse personalities, some with definite purpose while others treats our crusaders like a game. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the hunters become the hunted. Furthermore, the man pulling the strings behind the scenes (Dio) is often portrayed as a mastermind. And as a man of complex nature, the show crafts its story carefully as Dio\u2019s arsenal of militias goes to work at the most strangest of places. The antagonists\u2019 Stands are also named after tarot cards with some incredible powers to really push the limits of our heroes. Their unique nature and complexity of their powers bring about Araki\u2019s creativity. His ideas comes to crucial play here as each Stand find their niche in this adventure. It expands more than just inventiveness though as some of the Stands also provoke laughter and emotions. For what it\u2019s worth, the Stands and antagonists are like a pair of column that holds the story in place. They not only test the wits of the crusaders where they must think outside the box to prevail but also stimulate emotions. As the story progresses, we find out more about the true nature of some of the main characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nStarring protagonist Jotaro remains the most prominent cast member of the crusaders. Even to this date, he is perhaps the most well-known Jojo from the franchise. On the surface, he may be seen as a cold figure with an indifferent outlook on life while displaying his delinquent-like personality. Yet deep down, he truly does care about his friends and family. This is clearly shown throughout the journey with his words and action with characters such as Ann. Similarly, other main characters show their selfless nature. While some shows it differently than others, it\u2019s evident that they truly care about their comrades. It becomes a highlight reel once you stay with the focus involving the main characters because of their personalities. Each of them may come from different backgrounds but their union together as crusaders is like a brotherhood. It has the feelings, bonding, and is amazing to realize that a journey can bring some strangers together in full circle.\\n\\n\r\nWith its adventurous mood, the show also explores a variety of territories featuring all sorts of terrain. The show covers a decent amount of ground in the first half as they journey towards Egypt to stop Dio. Throughout this journey, the wonders of the adventure can be felt with what characters discover involving different cultures. And despite its supernatural conventions, the show also has bits of realism and can even be relatable when it comes to culture. It can be easily indulged to fulfill elements of creativity through Araki\u2019s concepts. Although the story itself sometimes may feel like a \u201cMonster of the Week\u201d formula with limited development, it\u2019s also important realize the experiment that the author is bringing into his work. In retrospect though, the series isn\u2019t very well written when it comes to explaining certain points. The series has many plot holes that perhaps will never be explained and is left to the imaginative minds of the viewers. While this may seem like a backstabber at first, the show instead cleverly delivers its dynamics and entertaining factors. With or without the bizarreness, Jojo SC\u2019s plot isn\u2019t one that strives to achieve logic. It aims to achieve its purpose to deliver bizarreness. This might come as a mixed bag for some people as the oddball humor could get out of control. The \u2018monster of the week\u2019 formulation might not also be suitable for some viewers through its context.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Jojo SC is formidable when it comes to visual presentation. Character designs reflects the classic style of the franchise while retaining its purpose. Every Stand in the show looks different with emphasis on their design and the bizarreness. The fights are also well coordinated that explodes onto the screen with energy. To add to the flavor are humorous gimmicks and dialogues coming from the heart of our characters. And similar to the previous season, trademark phrases such as \u2018ORA ORA ORA\u2019 are timed fabulously to grab a viewer\u2019s attention. As discussed before, the show\u2019s settings have a variety of backgrounds and each of them convey it well when it comes to delivery. Ranging from mountainous terrain, to foggy ghost towns, or even aboard an aircraft, the show achieves its adventurous tone. David Production surely deserves some praise for their superior animation quality here.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, soundtrack plays a strong role throughout the show. The OP song \"STAND PROUD\" by Jin Hashimoto envelops itself with a fast paced coordination with decorative montages of the main characters with hints of foreshadowing. On the other hand, the ED song \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" delivers its theme of Egypt to the core. OST is also impressive especially during climatic scenarios. Even when the mood seems to be calm, the OST creates a feeling of thrilling experience to show that our heroes are always in danger during their journey. Characters voices are impressive to say the least on most parts whether it\u2019s Jotaro\u2019s stoic mannerisms, Kakyoin\u2019s outgoing personality, or Joseph\u2019s wisdom. Oh and of course, don\u2019t forget that ORA ORA ORA on the door to the way out.\\n\\n\r\nAn epic journey is perhaps what Jojo Stardust Crusaders should be essentially known for. But it expands more than that with the characters, gimmicks, and overall clever writing. While it\u2019s not one of the smartest adventure tale with the history books, Jojo SC is a blockbuster with its exceptional creativity. I\u2019m not just referring to the Stands or characters but also the humor it strives to deliver. It doesn\u2019t go diehard mode with its comedy but instead scales the performance of the characters to bring them at their best during the journey. Perhaps the story plot holes can be a bit frustrating to deal with at times. However, mincing it down is silly when a show with this amount of bizarreness. If for some reason that you decide to go full Sherlock Holmes and try to find these plot holes, then the experience of this show would not suit you well. You\u2019ll be missing out the entertainment as Stardust Crusaders elevates bizarreness in a fashionable way like never before.  \\n",

Jojos Bazaar Adventures: Stardust Crusaders will surprise you right from the start because it doesn't take place in a store or in space like youd be thinking from the name! Nope, this show is all about tongue in exploding chiek action and adventure! \r\nThe story hooks you at the start, with our protogonist getting in trouble and having to get saved by his grandpa, but he's not on a creepy school principle's lap. He's in jail trying to control a demon! Except it's not a creepy school principle demon, either, it's a Stand! No,not like a creepy school principle stand he does when you're on your knees, this Stand is an invincible fighting guardian! His grandpa reveals that the stand must be used to defeat an ancient evil from their family's past, else they'll never be free, and so a grand adventure begins, and let me teel you, they go everywhere:\\n\\n\r\nIndia, Japan, Chinese, Ocean, Singerpore, boy you will learn a lot, and have fun doing it because the action is great, the characters are funny, and it never takes itself too serious like a show such as Attack on Tits. This show moves fast, and throws surprises at you faster than a creepy gym teacher. I can't wait for the episodes where they finally go to space!\\n\\n\r\nEvery Stand fights different, and there's even one that shines like a rainbow as the characters pose; gay equality for everyone. That's not to say the drama isn't good, it's as sharp as our sharpley dressed as our heroes straight out of The Village Peoples music grupe!\\n\\n\r\nYou will be guessing who is a good guy and who is a bad guy constantly and stands are such an interesting concept since they came out long before Pokeman I am told so. When the guy dies, the stand dies, too, so it adds suspense! It seems like they could almost make a prequel to this show there is so much to explore with it! I wish they did, because we need more shows that have a good one episode man on man.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like colors? Of course we all love them unless we don't love colors. Well, this show has colors, and it looks like a comic brought to beutiful life! All the characters look like they work out constantly. I was always how to feel in a scene as the music and art are both so fabulous that they made me want to buy leather chaps.\\n\\n\r\nOver all, what more can I say, if you like a good, short show that lets it all hang out with stile then go for it, but you have to appreciate that it's a paredy of itself.\\n",

            "content": "JOJO'S STARDUST MEISLY CRUSADERS REVIEWED:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nNo utter doubt that this is simply a downgrade in comparison with the first season, and that one was just awesome! So be prepared for a more lack luster plot and worser characters. But is it a mediocrity or dog shat? No!\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nThe Joestar family have been fighting the mythical vampire known as \u201cDio Brando\u201d and soon enough, after he's death from hundreds of years in wait inside a special box, he somehow manages to finally get out when the box he was trapped was suddenly discovered. We now take place in Japan, after four generations of Joestars from that faithful daywhen the first one met Dio, now to carry out the legacy and for the good of the world, Jotaro, the newest member of the Joestar bloodline now has to go thorough a long journey to find where Dio is, and kill him to stop the mayhem of he's actions. He and he's grandfather Joeseph coupled with other masculine men, are working together for the same goal.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nAdimitively, I do actually miss the Hamon thing, the whole show now treats it as if it was some sort of back drop to be abandoned or barely used at all. It was cool to see the new Stand powers, but its not cool to overshadow Hamon completely. And would it not be cool if they used both Hamon and Stands simultaneously?\\n\\n\r\nInstead of having this easy to follow, yet well executed plot, the biggest difference between Stardust and the first, is mainly that Stardust just loses so much of its appeal on what made it more than just \u201cPure Action\u201d it aims for this more episodic approach, as each one or two episode mini arcs is basically the enemy first gaining the upper hand, then the gang defeats the enemy after that episode, then they are one step closer to finding Dio, as he is making he's own stands for people to fight for him as pawns. \\n\\n\r\nFor what Stardust Crusader was worth, it really is just \u201cPure Action\u201d sure its quite silly at times, and it still has that same JoJo like vibe that we all love with men screaming at the top of there lungs going \u201cOOOHH MY GOOOOD\u201d in one of the funniest engrish I've seen since JoJo was the only one who did that whole Engrish thing right! (and maybe Golden Time)\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, its not doing anything particularly wrong for its own merit, the plot is very simplistic and straight forward for You to get the gist of it and follow, and it just seems to fit right in for being just \u201cPure Action\u201d and I really feel that this is how all the  tension of the battles eventually fade away, You no longer feel the fact that JoJo and the team are really in danger, its like hey, these guys will eventually make it out alive with the bad guy(s) already killed, because we just want action, not tension or all of the crying Drama BS.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are simply fun to be around with, sure there are characters like Polnareff with he's Sister complex being all corny and that, and sure, You definitly do not want to f**k with any of these guys! When I do like to maticulosly judge the characters held persona, what I really see is a bunch of two dimensional fighters. We have Jotaro, the silent type and cool type, Avodol the mentor who teaches all stand users under him, Joseph is no longer that fun, sarcastic, cheeky and feisty man who has the brains of 10 war tacticians, but a much more serious and calm man who is more focused than smiling and screams some Engrish from time to time, and whoever voiced Joeseph's Engrish, deserves a bronze medal for not actually making it tolerable, but soooo cringe worthy every time I see it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters lose what little bit of development they have, nor do they feel like there powers are ever devloping, and its like they can just come up to Dio after Jotaro's entire gang of super muscular men are all here. Yes, it does get quite repetitive at times and it is not something that I'm a fan off, but again, its not really doing anything wrong if that is what the show initially wanted to accomplish in the first place. However, both action shows are both self-aware on what they are doing and do not fail at it either. Its just that they changed the formats to quite a big difference and one seems better than the other.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I don't like about Stardust, is that the characters just seem to magically loose there respect to there opponents when they are defeated, like how this stand was defeated and 2 of the group found the stand user was hiding underground breathing on a blow stick then they happily took a wee in it, or how this stand was defeated and one of them found out that the stand user was a baby, when he fed him baby food, he first took his sh*t and mixed it with the food, forcing the baby to eat it. I know, this is supposed to be funny, but I really do not like how Stardust just completely disregards the respect of its death to death battles of the enemy. I would be p!ssed if the first season did that.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Stardust Crusaders is still \u201cJoJo\u201d the characters may not be as complex or as memorable, but they still somehow manage to fit the whole JoJo-like vibe. The plot might as well be backdrop, but hey, the first season had battles as its most memorable moments ever. The pacing has slowed down since Stardust has been reduced to just \u201cFighting\u201d but at least it was very self-aware and was never afraid to give You its entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nDavid's getting quite a hit ever since they decided to adapt JoJo into one of the best 80's remakes ever! (and was approved by Roriconfan for it being better than the original) the newly improved animation just captures the style, self-awareness and the masculinity of the show. Character designs are still JoJo, and I really like the whole super macho men idea fighting to the death. (makes me want to make my own manga about that...) Backgrounds are pretty good all throughout, and the budget remains very consistent and not a dingle moment when I was rather annoyed that it dropped. The action scenes look cool, but there does seem to lack an emphasise on great choreography for the first one, and it sometimes felt that there was not as much thought put in on making these scenes look as cool as I wanted them to be.... Though it is beyond sufficient. The shift into random colours are a nice touch when its used correctly, but nothing worthy for bonus points because its really to stylise the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is far from bad, it is one of those great variety soundtracks that plays with all sorts of different sounds to create better immersion for each different situation. Of course, I am no music critic, so take these skills into a grain of salt. The sound effects do feel like that excact same thing from the Original, and they seem to fit quite well, but it does'nt have so much impact. (And this is probably the only show that made Engrish sound funny)\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nTo a great tale of spoofing the 80's fighting shounen, has now been reduced to just \u201cTama want Battle!\u201d is really all what JoJo is now... but if such direction has been decided to really reduce it to that minimalistic state, is it a bad action show? Hell No!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6/10 - Plot has been reduced to just \u201cFighting\u201d but at the same time, its not doing anything particularly wrong. \\n\r\n5.5/10 -The characters are less complex, and are quite corny. However, they are still sufficient for being fairly entertaining.\\n\r\n7.5/10 \u2013 Consistent animation from David, with great character designs. The action scenes tend to lack great choreography but its still better than average.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 Large variety of music... I'm no music critic, but go take a listen to the OST Yourself. Sorry :/\\n\r\n6/10 - Since it is only entertaining for the action.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 6/10 \u2013 FOR ME TO PREDICT THE ENTIRE EPISODIC PLOT.",

            "content": "Finally more Jojo!!! Another season of manliness, awesome characters and ridiculous plot. That was what I thought about Stardust Crusaders. Unfortunately the results kinda disappointed me. Let's start with the story. The plot is certainly ridiculous like the first season but it didn't have a big progress. Aside from the two first episodes which were very interesting  when the journey starts there isn't something really unique. It consists by the same structure. Ridiculous situations and the fight of the day that the good guys always win. It was still interesting to see how they would get through every ridiculous situation but  for apoint on it became kind off predictable. In the art section the results were godlike. I swear 10 is not even close to describe it. The only thing that I had a problem with was the ridiculous censorship. Yeah there was censorship and that''s the only reason that I put a 9 in the art. The opening was really awesome almost as manly as the one from the first season and the ending very catchy too. The part that I had a real problem was the characters. In a Jojo adventure I don't expect character development but the characters here  were disappointing. First of all Kujo was a little bit boring protagonist . But he was still fun. The thing that frustrated me was how Joseph appeared in this anime. Ok I know it takes place 50 years after ''Battle tendency'' and Joseph wouldn't be as awesome as he used to be but still it was really disappointing to see the ingenious Joseph we knew and love turned into a comic relief. At  least we had some Dio moments but were very few I hope they show him to us more in the next season. Overall I would say that I enjoyed JBA but not nearly as much as the first season. But it was still a fun ride and I can't wait for more.",

            "content": "I was so disappointed in this sequel to the first couple arcs I felt compelled to write a review.  It would have gotten a few more points if it wasn't totally overshadowed by it's predecessor.  So let's go make a list of reasons why this is a total disappointment.\r\nReason 1:  Concept.  For some reason, they went in a totally different direction of the established universe and decided to make it some kind of manly Digimon-type anime.  Not as cool as it sounds.  Remember those cool martial arts fights with Ripple energy?  Yeah, that's essentially gone.\r\nReason 2:  Thecharacters.  No depth at all.  And you might be thinking, \"but it's one of those manly type animes, they don't have to be deep.\"  Watch some Fist of the North Star.  Hell, watch the prequel to this piece of crap again.  There might of been two or three scenes in an entire 24 episodes that gave me some kind of investment or feeling towards the characters.  Additionally, Joseph Joestar.  While I thought he wasn't as cool as Jonathan, he was pretty damn cool and actually had a personality.  Not to mention he had wile and guile in spades enough so to defeat nearly omniscient beings that had lived for over a millennia.   He makes a return as a grandpappy in this season and apparently old age has addled his brains because he's more often that not a liability the whole show.  The only thing I ever had to look forward to from Joseph was his comic relief shticks of screaming \"OH NO,\" \"OH SHIT,\" and \"OH MY GOD,\" in English which is probably the most enjoyable part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nReason 3:  Length.  They drag this shit out so far.  Let's compare.  Prequel, they essentially go through two story arcs and 2 generations of Joestars in the same number of episodes.  This show, they got to Egypt.  IT'S HALF A FUCKING STORY ARC.  I was so hopeful.  I enjoyed the prequel so much that I struggled to get through this.  I'm like, \"it's okay, this happens.  I'll just get through this and next season will be better, I'm sure of it.\"  Imagine my growing sense of dread as I come to realize that the next season is more of this.  But you know what, I'm going to watch it anyway because I liked the first installment so much.  I'm really going to try and see where this goes.\\n\\n\r\nI could keep going but those are my main complaints without going off on tangents about every little thing.  Plus my disappointment has drained me so I'm going to get ready to steel myself and begin the next half of this travesty.  Good luck to us all.",

            "content": "Stardust Crusaders\r\nThe third arc Stardust Crusaders was not what i expected, i thought it was going to be as perfect as Battle Tendecy, i even enjoyed more Phantom Blood, i think what i liked was the Hamon ability, i mean the Stand is a good concept but it is repetitive; I was always thinking in Battle Tendency ''there's no way JoJo can overcome this situation and somebody will help him'' but he did because he was smart a trickster, that's what i liked, not knowing what was next, here in Stardust Crusaders everything was obvious at least 90% of the time i knew what wasgoing to happen at the end of the eps. and some eps. were boring. I will refer to Joseph as JoJo and Jotaro just as Jotaro.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFirst of all the story starts with a BIG plot hole, Dio is alive but this is a little plot hole, the BIG one is that it's explained that Dio saved himself in the coffin he was brought at the end of Phantom Blood, but the thing is that Erina used the coffin to save herself and the babie, no one else, just them and besides it was shown how he exploded with the Ship and how could Jonathan's body survive? i couldn't take out this questions out of my head and the explanations didn't make sense. Well moving on from that, the story continues with a new protagonist Jotaro Kuujo (who was outshadowed by everyone because he was bland and didn't talk, only talking when he wanted to make JoJo look like a fool) a rebell who is in jail because he has a spirit inside him, JoJo arrives and shows him that the spirit is a Stand (which are a mistery) a spirit that's linked to the user in which only another Stand  can fight him back, but every hit made is a hit to the user, if the Stand is killed the user dies in the same way, now that we know about the stands, JoJo tells Jotaro that Dio is alive and it's their destiny to kill him and reveals more things, Holly the mother of Jotaro is a Joestar so she has a Stand but she can't handle the stand and the adventure to kill Dio in 50 days starts with a total of 5 protagonist being Polnareff and Jojo the ones who had more protagonism Kakyouin the 3rd with Jotaro being the 4th and Avdol the 5th. Following a formula of the enemy of the week in which they become repetitive and sometimes boring, and that's how it is from the beginning to the end. I like the Stands but i prefer the Hamon concept. The story is good but i wanted to see the manly usage of the Hamon.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation is a little off for some reason, it has some 3D angles at times, just like in the game, and i thought it was weird and i didn't like that but everything else was great, i like the art style but is a little less manga-ish than before and there were little poses, where are my manly poses? but it was great.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was less enjoyable than in the JoJo 2012, the OP was ok and the ED is not my favorite and i have never been crazy for that song but it was ok considering they are heading to Egypt and the VA was the best and saved the sound but overall it's very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI think the characters were not that great, they weren't what i expected.\\n\r\n-Jotaro the new... protagonist is a bland character with a Stand that looks like Bruford (a character from P.B.) and he acts like a badass who almost never speaks and is smarter for some reason than JoJo, how is it possible to be smarter than the trickster who defeated harder enemies and a god with his trickery and cleverness? and now he is made a fool by Jotaro, give me a break.\\n\r\n-Joseph ''JoJo'' Joestar is older but wait, didn't the fact of being a user of the Hamon makes him look younger? but anyways he's somehow the new SpeedWagon in the sense of explaining everything and using SpeedWagon's company to help in the adventure, he still is a little funny but not as great than before, he's what i enjoyed the most, i didn't like at all that he was made almost useless with an almost useless Stand, i can't imagine this arc without him.\\n\r\n-Avdol is the companion that JoJo brought to Jail to show Jotaro his abilities, and is more like the mature of the group but his personality will change a little after...\\n\r\n-Kakyouin is a little boring just like with Jotaro, but at times he was useful and not that boring.\\n\r\n-Polnareff is another goof and the last they encounter, he has a weird personality, he always wants to flirt with girls, he's the only one that makes the manly poses and he's always involved with toilets.\\n\r\nThe enemies, most of them aren't interesting but they aren't bad, overall the characters were good personally for old JoJo and for Polnareff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was very good, i laughed a lot with Polnareff and JoJo, i liked the concept of the Stands but i felt they didn't do the work like a Hamon user would do, i prefer the Hamon concept just like i stated, the animation is something that i liked a lot, Joseph best JoJo, Jotaro bland ''JoJo''.",

            "content": "If Gurren Lagann put hair on my lip, Jojo put hair on my chest, turned me into The Arnold (ca 1986), and made me sound like James Earl Jones. \r\nIf you want to become a real man, this shouty shonen is the one for you. \r\nOverview: \r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventures: Stardust Crusaders (from now on referred to as Jojo) is part 3 in the over the top, super macho tale of ultra-burly men of the Joestar family who all go by the moniker Jojo. They battle the supernatural forces of darkness, sent by the fabulously evil DIO, and chaotic action, weirdness, and hilarity ensue. Hamon hasbeen ditched in favor of these new superpowers called \"Stands\" which are based on tarot cards. The user has powers which 'suggest' an association with a card, and are named thusly. The powers range from human to animal transformation, combat spectres, fog, dream eaters, and even the sun, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nTha Basics:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThat signature Jojo comic-book-come-to-life style art is once again put to excellent use in Stardust Crusaders, as it was in the previous iteration of Jojo. Combining trippy psychedelic still frame and pans complete with a swirling miasma of neon yellow, blue, green, and purple lights, flowers, zigzags, polka dots, inverted colors, and other filters takes you on a visual Trip At The Brain. This Jojo goes through a variety of settings, as part of the theme is travelling around the world. Consistently drawn characters, well animated fight scenes, and some gruesome blood and gore effects made it a blast to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (5 for OP/ED/BGM, 4 for VA)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a high octane made-for-Jojo track called \"Stand Proud\" by Jin Hashimoto. A good song to get pumped up for the GARness to come. Man, this series could have made use of some Suicidal Tendencies, but I'll take The Bangles and \"Walk Like An Egyptian\" for the ending. A fitting song, given all the 80s pop and rock references that makes this show so fun, not to mention the whole \"Journey to Egypt\" plot.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting is very good. Joseph Joestar and Polnareff are the most interesting and animated characters. Full of great one liners and engrish cursing, they're always good for a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 (Can i give this a 10 just for Joseph Joestar?)(8.8 Joseph Joestar, 0.2 everyone else, haha)\\n\\n\r\nWe've got 5 mains in this show: Old man Joseph Joestar, our hero from the previous installment of Jojo, Battle Tendency, once again takes up the reins as a 67 year old to once again lead his merry band of burly men on a hunt for the nefarious DIO, and picks up a couple friends along the way. He really gets a chance to shine in this series, with his \"OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH\" and \"OH NOOOO\" one liners, along with some classic Joseph \"and now you'll ....\" and the famous Joestar family secret technique. While providing a lot of the wacky humor the show is known for, he doesn't take a back seat just because he's old. He is still able to kick a lot of ass, and does it with style.\\n\\n\r\nAvdol, an Egyptian fortune teller and magician friend of Joseph's. Not a whole lot to say about him; he's typically the most moderate and cool headed voice of reason in the group. He provides a lot of information about and names the Stands that the group has, along with those of their enemies.\\n\\n\r\nJotaro Kujo is the new Jojo for part 3. Jotaro, despite his steely and cold straight man demeanor (and penchant for extreme violence, which leads to some awesome payoffs later in the show) actually has a little depth to his character. I feel like he'll be fleshed out a lot more in Stardust Crusaders 2, but I have to go on what I've seen here: He's kind of boring. He's extremely stoic, unshakable, and generally exudes the air of \"don't f** with me\". They try to give him a little more characterization though asides of his family members speaking about his personality, but these don't shine through very often in the show. However, this isn't really what the show is about, that intense characterization.. it's about KICKING ASS! and Jotaro delivers with gusto! ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA\\n\\n\r\nKakyoin is next up: a schoolmate of Jotaro's and fellow stand user. He's typically calm and reserved, but knows to step up when necessary. Level headed and a strategist, Kakyoin is a solid member of the team. He also typically serves as a foil to our last guy--\\n\\n\r\n--Polnareff. A fabulous Frenchman with a wild flat top and a body that'd make Broly jealous. Impulsive, goofy, and hot tempered, Polnareff serves as the comedic relief most of the time, his temper getting him into a lot of very compromising situations, including one riotously funny one involving a bathroom. He gets a lot of heavy characterization in the latter half of the show, and we find out about his past, his inner demons, and what he's fighting for. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 (Mediocre by MAL rating)\\n\\n\r\nThis is my main problem with Stardust Crusaders: the new pace. I'm all for taking some time and slowing a plot down when there's a lot that's got to be covered. Some other shows could have benefited from more than a 23-26 episode arc instead of 12 or 13, but whatever. The previous Jojo parts were 9 and 17 episodes each (Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency respectively), or essentially each a 1 cour show, and now Stardust Crusaders is getting FOUR whole seasons to itself.. \\n\r\nThe plot, \"benefiting\" from this extended length essentially boils down into an episodic \"bad guy of the week\" format (a la Pokemon) for the first 14 episodes, and then a bad guy every two weeks from then on. Beyond episode 16, it was much improved, with more interesting villains and funnier situations, but the middle run of it almost turned into a bit of a chore to watch. They stretched what would have been about 10 episodes of content into two seasons, basically.\\n\r\nIt could have been cleared up much quicker with a montage or quick, funny two to four minute blurb about how they defeated all these useless villains. This would have enabled a more significant plot arc to develop, and a chance for DIO to be worked into the show. For such a great villain, he barely gets any on screen time, which is a shame for a show that prides itself on having over the top craziness onscreen 90% of the time. Some may counter this rating by saying that it focuses on the characters more by slowing it down, but I feel that for as much characterization as we got, it would have have to have been a literary analysis level study of in depth, emotional complexities and motivations to get much deeper. Jojo isn't about that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (80s bands references 4, brutal shonen action 1, characters 2)\\n\\n\r\nJojo has been growing on me. I didn't want to like the 2012 iteration, but Joseph redeemed it for me during Part 2. Stardust Crusaders gave me more of what I wanted from Jojo: over the top, mature shonen action with the signature flair for the dramatic and 80s pop and classic rock references. It got bogged down in the middle with the baddie of the week setup, but the last few episodes were great. The anticlimactic battle with the Empress, the dreamland battle with Death, and the strangely introspective Judgement episode was also a standout. A stocked second half, and more Joseph.. that's what made the season great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to rate this show higher, because it improved on some parts of Jojo 2012, kept me entertained, and gave me something fun to watch. At the same time though, it left me hanging on actually accomplishing what the show set out to do, and that's why I can't give it an 8. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\n+wacky, goofy, laugh out loud moments\\n\r\n+Joseph Joestar\\n\r\n+brutal action (despite censors)\\n\r\n+80s jokes\\n\r\n+good animation\\n\\n\r\n+/- slower pacing\\n\r\n+/- little character development\\n\\n\r\n- more villains than ever before, now with less significance! \\n\r\n- middle segment is a little boring\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\r\nIf you like Jojo, it's exactly what you're expecting, and more of what you want. If you're looking to get into Jojo, start with the 2012 reboot and decide from there. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a truly unique show. It's one of those rare shows that defines its own standard and redraws boundaries of what should and should not be done with aesthetics and fight scenes. The clothes are fabulous, the action is ridiculous, the voice-acting exudes energy, the poses are awe-inspiring, and the soundtrack is a treat for the ears.\r\nWhen speaking of other anime you can usually use comparisons to pigeonhole that show into a category, but JoJo is pretty much a category in and of itself. No other show has dialogue like JoJo, a story like JoJo, art style like JoJo, characters like JoJo,or fight scenes like JoJo. Myanimelist lists the show as \"shounen\", but JoJo only fits that description in a loose sense.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is the embodiment of Kitsch and Camp; a sort of over-the-top silliness that pokes fun at the wider action conventions while simultaneously making fun of itself. It is so ridiculous that instead of eliciting face-palms it instead puts the audience in a state of euphoric enjoyment and delight. This is a show that realizes the inherent lunacy of cultural \"manliness\", and then puts it on full display in its comedic glory. \\n\\n\r\nIf JoJo must be categorized then it is the following in descending order: Action + Adventure + Comedy + Fantasy + Horror + Supernatural + Drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Stardust Crusaders is very much the beginning of the journey. The core gang of Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, and later Polnareff team up together to reach Egypt in order to stop Dio, an old nemesis from the first season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This first part of Stardust is simply put, a long build-up. It ramps up the stakes and the action over the course of the entire season, introducing new Stands and letting the audience get comfortable with the idea of Stands, their limitations (or lack thereof), and building an attachment to the core group of adventurers. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace is significantly slower than the first season of JJBA, much to the rejoicing of manga readers. However, I feel this is a weakness and not a strength. Many minor fights, which serve no consequence, are thrown into the middle arcs of the show. These are nothing more than filler, and can be summed up as: our heroes suspect a stand user, they discover the limitations of the enemy stand, the heroes beat up the stand user, and continue on their journey. It is an effective formula nonetheless, and is a classic one that has been a staple of Asian storytelling since the novel \"Journey to the West\". \\n\\n\r\nThe story could have used a bit trimming, however. By staying so true to the manga the story suffers from a bit of unnecessary fluff. Many of the fights are disjointed single-episode throwaways, where the bad guy of the week is beaten to a pulp and nothing of significance or consequence happens. This is the largest problem with Stardust Crusaders in comparison to the first season of JoJo, where filler was nowhere to be seen and every fight served a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest addition this season is Stands, which replaces Hamon, as the principal method of combat. Stands are essentially mystical/magical powers that are manifestation of the users' spiritual energy. Their forms are diverse and their application is wildly imaginative and wonderfully realized on screen. \\n\\n\r\nIt is, ultimately, a great adaptation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is the absolute embodiment of the camp aesthetic. Inspired by Fist of the North Star, 80s fashion, glamrock, and psychedelic rock, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a synthesis of color and imagination. The author of JoJo, HIrohiko, once said in an interview that he didn't think much for realism when he colored, but instead focused on what would look interesting. No other show shares the same color palette as this show. The bright teals and purples are very much an attempt to replicate the coloring of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is immediately clear to any newcomers is the outfits and costuming of this show. While it might be too strange to handle for some, the elaborate and excessive fashion for JoJo only helps to elevate the humor and highlight the oddness of their situation. For such an over-the-top show about magical powers and manly contests of strength, it would be a disservice if their clothing were not over-the-top.\\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight of JoJo is the weirdness of the opponents, the excessive oddness of the Stand powers, and the horror elements. It's the kind of vibrant entertainment that filled the old pulp sci-fi magazines of the early 20th century.\\n\\n\r\nI refrain from rating a perfect 10 because JoJo, for all its beauty, has a few moments of choppy animation. It is, after all, difficult to translate such a manga-specific art style to a state of motion. Many characters and fights also lose a bit of detail in transition from the manga, as Araki is known for his laborious and fabulous use of line to accentuate his action scenes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9.9/10\\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders has a near flawless soundtrack that complements the show perfectly. From the opening ballad to the throwback \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" ED, to the energizing guitar/saxophone combo that shows up every time Jotaro is in a moment of triumph, the OST has it all. Of special note are the perfectly suited  It is by far the best thing about the adaptation that elevates the story to a new level. \\n\\n\r\nMany adaptations suffer from a problem where they don't add anything of value to the original manga. They leave the question, \"why would I watch this when I could read the manga?\" For JoJo I can confidently say that the music is one of the main reasons the show might surpass the source material for some fans. Some tracks such as \"Virtuous Pope\" and \"Stardust Crusaders\" will have fans fist-pumping and shouting at their screens with joy\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice actors have done an absolutely incredible job. Every character sounds perfect, and is brought to life in the same bombastic fashion as the first season. Of special note are Jotaro's \"ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA\" and Joseph's english \"HOLY SHIIIIIITTT!!!\" outbursts. As with any great voice work, these voices have now become inseparable from the characters. You can tell the voice actors are having a ton of fun voicing fun material, and their joy is evident in the energy flowing through the entire sound production of this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are definitely enjoyable, I feel they have yet to spread their wings. There is character development, but it is slow, as it takes a backseat to the fight scenes and other aspects the show has to offer. Jotaro, for better or for worse, is a stoic straight-man who is self-aware of his own coolness. Like many other teens he consciously attempts to be cool, and largely succeeds due to his Stand allowing him to beat the crap out of people while keeping his hands in his pockets. Kakyoin is quirky but hasn't received too much attention in terms of development, and Avdol is missing for half the season. Polnareff is definitely the standout amongst the new characters, and his demeanor and carefree ways are a delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar has changed considerably from the previous season. Being saddled with the weakest Stand, he is a great deal less useful in fights. While this is understandable as the focus shifts from Joseph to Jotaro, the difference in Joseph's personality can be felt for people who loved young Joseph in the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to Dio yet, as he's received a maximum of 15 minutes of screen time all season, and his goons are usually one-note cannon fodder for the heroes to chew through. Almost all of the villains are annoying and irredeemable scumbags, for better or for worse. The show adheres to a classic good vs. evil narrative, without spending time dealing with the grays.\\n\\n\r\nWhat has not changed from the first season is the sheer delight in the dialogue. Araki has really found a way to make even the most mundane of conversations into something interesting, infusing quirk and wit into every interaction. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of those rare shows that can be enjoyable if you removed all the action and plot and just let these funny characters hang out in a room together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy watching magical powers the likes of which you've never seen go up against each other? \\n\\n\r\nDo you like creepy dolls try to murder a 7 foot tall jacked Frenchman with a towering hairdo? \\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy cherries being rolled around in overly athletic tongues?\\n\\n\r\nDo you like watching heaps of people be murdered in the strangest ways possible?\\n\\n\r\nDo you love watching manly men do manly things?\\n\\n\r\nDo you want to watch the scum of the earth receive justice by a million punches?\\n\\n\r\nDo you like a journey that spans multiple countries, and gives you travel advice?\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy being consistently surprised every single week by a situation you've literally never seen in any fiction before?\\n\\n\r\nI've never been so entertained.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI do a lot of criticizing because I LOVE this show so much. It is my wish that the next season includes more engaging multi-episode fights with consequence (rather than lame single-episode filler fights), as well as a bit more character development. The slower pace is regrettable, since I had enjoyed the relatively speedy pace of the first season. However, it is not so slow as to detract too much from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Stardust Crusaders is a ride to remember and the most fabulous anime to ever grace the screen. It is a unique prismatic gem amongst a sea of dull rocks.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8.8/10",

            "content": "We're gonna talk about the most important aspect of the anime, the character designs. The character designs are nothing special, we got the characters in different nationalities, a stereotypical indian/egyptian/whatever, some retired indiana jones wannabe, and a main character that ripped off assets from kenshiro with an edgy twist, everything is in dark bleak and bland colors like we need anymore of those outside of blockbuster puke. Now let's get to the main point. Right off the bat we are introduced with the characters, and what the series is best known for. For every character whom for some reason gets no explanation whatsoever, they happento be able to wield super powers! What they basically do is use spirits out of their bodies to fight enemies in their stead and they are called \"stands\", hmm where have I seen this before? Oh right, THE FRIGGIN PERSONA SERIES?\\n\\n\r\nJesus christ I was facefdesking the desk so hard right when I saw the main character whom have the worst name to exist in a shounen series ever, when he tried too hard trying to be cool and edgy copying the persona 3 characters by shooting a gun in their head, except persona actually have cool characters. Not only that but he curb-stomps every enemy in the anime like they are nothing. Where is the fun in that? Some fight scenes were neat to be fair, ones that actually used strategies rather than pure powerlevel, like that ugh... Jo-J-J-Gaaaaah! I would've had like this show better if that awful character didn't exist since I did not mind the other characters at all despite have almost no substance save for 1 character.\\n\\n\r\nJust when you thought they couldn't have ripped off persona even further, all the enemies here have tarot card motifs. WHAT. Yes, it goes all the way from magician to the world cards but here in doesn't work because the supposed \"stands\" don't even have anything to do with the corresponding tarots while in persona, the tarot cards are used to reflect the character's personality. Might as well use constellation names if they're going to be relevant if at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn some episodes, we get to see the big bad's supposed \"all according to evil plan\" scene, but all he does is sit his ass all day while he dispatches the bad guys to do the dirty work for him, I keep thinking I'm watching a Saturday morning cartoon for some reason! So yes, the whole show is also an episodic one at that and the only plot line is them getting to the big bad, that's it.\\n\\n\r\n\"But AzuriteMal\", Stardust Crusaders came out in 1989 while the first persona came out in 1996\". Oh that is simple, let me educate you my dear boy. You see, Persona is part of the megaten series, and megaten came out in 1987, megaten = persona, therefore persona = megaten. What year is that? *gasp* no way, now you know?\\n\\n\r\nI did kinda like how the title stays true to its name with having a real sense of adventure since they travel from Japan to Egypt and such. Most of the setting are like what I'd imagine them to be so that's a plus. Music started good like they keep up the tense of the scene, but it got repetitive hearing the same thing over and over again like a JRPG battle theme. Someone said that there will be an epic fight scene in the 2nd season but I'm not holding my breath since I'm not a fan of episodic anime. I got better things to catch up to.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations\\n\r\n- Persona series: both are very similar, very dark, better characters, makes you think.\\n\r\n- Berserk: It's still darker and more gar than this.",

After Part 1's great world building and character presentation along with Part 2's storyline, battles and characters, you'd expect that Part 3 would be even better or at least mantain the same level of quality.\r\n  What met expectations was some of the worst characters ever seen in entertainment. They had potential too; between Joseph's Hamon doing almost nothing and Jotaro's annoying blandiness + shitty lines, you get the feeling that the main characters just didn't have any effort put into them.\r\n  I gave the story a 4. And by story Imean the Stands, because they were actually creative and enjoyable to watch. The ACTUAL story (Jotaro and his butt boys travel to egypt using the slowest methods available while defeating enemy stands) is hot garbage and doesn't deserve the pity of MAL's rating system of not allowing you to rate it 0.\\n\r\n  The art and sound is a tiny bit worse than Parts 1 and 2 but it's still nice to look at and hear. No complaints there.\\n\r\n  The enjoyment isn't completely ruined by the show's objective flaws, which honestly surprised me. The usual bizarre shit is still there, only better. Seeing Jotaro punching dickheads is pretty cool. The fights are a lot worse but if you don't overthink them you can enjoy them. It's JoJo, and it doesn't let you forget that.\\n\r\n  Fucking sucks dick though.",

            "content": "As of this review, I am 18 episodes in. And I must say, Stardust Crusaders exceeded many of my expectations. The art style has a subtle, yet noticeable change in color palette and tone, opting for a more horror inspired look. This art style is also the closest to the manga by far, so many long time JoJo fans will be very happy with that. \r\nAnd as if that wasn't enough to be happy about, Stardust Crusaders boasts an excellent soundtrack. The opening theme, \"Stand Proud,\" is not my personal favorite JoJo theme (\"Bloody Stream\" is the clear winner there), but it definitely fits thecontext of JoJo very well, and I've grown to like it very much. The ending theme is an older song by The Bangles, \"Walk Like An Egyptian,\" which I haven't heard since I was a kid! That song was a bit jarring as an ending song, but hey, everything about JoJo is bizarre, so I'll take it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nStory wise, without saying too much, an old foe of the Joestar family is back and wants revenge. This series is the first in the JoJo timeline to slowly abandon its Hamon powers and opts for a new ability called Stands: spiritual manifestations of its users that have special powers. Little did I know, the Stands are actually a big influence on anime culture (see series like Persona), and to my surprise, their usage in the series makes for some unpredictable and unforgettable combat scenes. \\n\\n\r\nBefore, we had three main characters to go around, but this time, we have five! Our new protagonist, Jotaro Kujo, works alongside with last season's protagonist, his grandfather Joseph Joestar. They eventually butt heads, but form friendships and alliances with Mohammad Avdol, Jean Pierre Polnareff (the inspiration to King of Fighter's Benimaru, to my surprise), and Kakyoin. I'm sure there are pop culture and musical references to all of them, but I'm too lazy to look it up. All of them have great chemistry together, and their interactions are just as entertaining as the crazy shit they have to face. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you either love or hate JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. If you like yourself some campy manliness, outrageously over-the-top action, a great soundtrack, and a series that's a very faithful adaptation (and then some!) from the manga, you honestly can't do much better than Stardust Crusaders.",

Joseph explains that the 'evil spirit' is called a 'Stand', monsters that can take any form (such as a flaming bird, a knight in armor or even a micro sized parasite) who give their masters a big boost in power, anyway Jotaro's mother suddenly gains a Stand but causes her to get severely ill and the cause of this is the awakening of Dio (the antagonist) who i believe was on the previous Jojo season i really don't know much about him sorry. The gang set out for Egypt to find and defeat Dio, they meet friends on the way and fight really BIZARRE people also this is only part 1 it stops as soon as they get to Egypt so the ending is pretty ... meh ...\\n\\n\r\nArt  9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art style to this anime its very comicy.. if thats a style... or a word..  it was unique and brand new to me i've never seen any other with a similar art style like it and was perfect for the anime. (Almost)\\n\\n\r\nSound  7/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what to review for the sound, the sound was.. just... yeah.. but the opening ost was good to listen to and i couldn't help but laugh at the song 'Walk like an Egyptian' which is the ending ost. Seriously the last song i thought they would play for a japanese anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe seasons group Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin and Polnareff were... interesting each with unique personalities. This anime doesn't show much development like training to gain more strength it was just \"I'm a villain here to kill you\" a fight starts then Jotaro repeatedly punches their face into submission or something along those lines. You only see Dio a few times forever alone in his playboy mansion sending freaks to kill Jotaro and others and thats about the only air time for Dio. Poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Stardust Crusaders the fight scenes were good to watch some were more like ass whippings than fights and of course the out of it comedy were good for a laugh or two.\\n\r\nBut there were scenes i was confused about like how the characters are harmed (Stabbed, shot or even have their ankle sliced off or half-way through getting eaten alive) they just dust themselves off and move on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i thought this was a very good anime to watch, basic story, great art, good op and ed osts to listen to, the character development may need work, enjoyable battle scenes. I would recommend this to people who love shounen or battle anime or just an anime with muscular men fighting.",

            "content": "Stardust Crusaders is a good choice for you if you're a JoJo fan or looking for some interesting action matchups, but it is terrible if you want anything more or different to that.\r\n\u2022 Foreword for those interested in Stardust Crusaders with no knowledge of the JoJo universe\r\nJoJo's parts can be consumed in any order you would choose to do so, as every part has a self concluding story that can be understood without the need of the previous parts, but each part will spoil the former so the chronological order is adviced if you're interested in the whole JoJo experience. However, Stardust Crusaders was thestarting part for a bunch of people in the west, as that's the only way they could've gotten it around here, since there was an OVA that released a bunch of its more interesting episodes and the manga wasn't really available due to a lot of complications, mostly concerning the names of the characters being after bands and other copyrighted stuff in the west.\\n\\n\r\nAnd these people enjoyed it for what it was. But personally, I advice against using Stardust Crusaders as a starting point. I'd say Part 3, Stardust Crusaders, was the most experimental of all of the JoJo parts, as not only did it almost completely drop its main power and changed it with something else, it also backed down hard on a character moment that lead to the story feeling stilted and non-existent and the setting of everything being mostly an excuse for characters to fight. You would have the same understanding of the story if you start from the first few episodes and then watch the last few as there's very little actual significant events or character moments that actually bring anything of value to the actual story. This wasn't a problem in JoJo up to this point and it didn't seem to show up anywhere as far as I've gotten into it so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe powers, mostly of the main characters, are basic and don't feel unique, since the concept was just introduced and was somewhat experimental, but mostly their opponents are those that do the heavy lifting in terms of uniqueness. Personality wise there's not a whole of distinctive traits, outside of the overall design of the characters. They mostly have basic to very little personality. The only thing I'd say it succeeds in is the action and since it's an action series, that's the only thing that keeps it from being outright bad. Unless you plan on watching an action series without having much investment into the story and just because the fights seem interesting, I advice checking out literally any other part. However, if the fights are all you care about, you can start from here, since here's when the concept of stands is introduced, and while the shenanigans with the former power are entertaining in the second part, these feel way more like actual real matchups but the lack of progression in the story and how it might feel dragged out because of that might eventually wear down anyone. Personally I'd advice checking out the next part if you wanna get introduced to the concept of stands since by that point it has found its footing and it actually has a setting that makes up for a dragged out story since everything happens in a small town rather than a chase around the globe, where the ball gets tossed from side to side rather than nothing ever changing in the story ever.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Differences between previous parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important difference is the pretext of the powers and what they are. We get a switch off from a power called Ripple that is basically an energy that can harm vampires and other vile creatures and has some other nifty uses such as walking on water or imbuing into this to send an object flying and so on and so on. Instead the current powers are replaced by stands, which are simple as a concept, they're basically a representation of the spirit of the user and have powers which they use to fight. Some can launch fire. Some can punch stuff. Sounds boring? Yeah, because those are the main characters and it was needed to introduce them as simple for everyone to understand them. But as the story progresses the stands get weirder and more complicated. Like a character that can attack you and exists only inside spaces where light is reflected. Or a stand that can take your soul but only if you feel the frustration of loss. It gets really wacky progressively.\\n\\n\r\nBut this moves me on to my next point, which is unlike the first and second part, the third part feels a lot like an experiment and like its only point is to see if the writer can keep his audience engaged only with really good action. And he can, he definitely got me, but he reintroduces a character called Dio and does very little effort to expose the vile things he did as a villain, villain whom was this vile vampire who used to glue people's heads on dogs and make mothers eat their own babies. It's that bad that when the OVA was adapted, no real prior knowledge of JoJo was given and a lot of people had this question about Stardust Crusaders. WHAT DID THE VILLAIN EVEN DO??? MAYBE HE'S INNOCENT? THIS MAKES NO SENSE! You couldn't give the guy who makes mothers eat their own babies one moment in the third part to represent how vile he is until they reached the final fight? Really? \\n\\n\r\nThe situation at hand in the story, the fights, is what gets the attention, and the characters, while there are attempts and some moments where they get their glory, they mostly tread water. While it may be due to how the studio summarized the previous two parts that I feel this way, that JoJo never really had pointless fights, almost every fight in this part is completely pointless and doesn't bring anything except entertainment value to its story, which never seemed it was ever gonna be an issue before. It's very much like the beginning of cartoons, where the characters had no real inner world logic and did things to please the viewers, rather than have their own motivations. I think this describes Stardust Crusaders perfectly and explains what is different about its other parts. And I'll spell it out once again. It doesn't really try to go anywhere. The former parts do. Just because it pretends it's not as I've just described doesn't mean it doesn't walk the walk.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, since most of the previous parts were summarized, there's a lot of fights in JoJo just for the sake of fighting typically. So if you felt that most fights progressed in a fashion that always lead the story forward, there's a lot of villain of the week from this point onwards that you'll have to get through. While I do give a lot of criticism to Stardust Crusaders, it is the skeleton upon the future parts will be built, since if you can handle this part's rhythm, you should have no problem enjoying anything that JoJo has to offer from this point onwards. If you'll watch this part and you will think it is bad, just know that it will never be as bad as it is at this point.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, there is one positive difference here. And that is that the fights feel a lot more organic than they did previously. The fights aren't gonna be either Part 1's I'm Stronk And Honorable I Win or Part 2's admittedly very entertaining but still very kindergarden pretense fighting. What do I mean by that? \"Oh you're gonna blast me with a laser beam, but I already knew you were gonna do that, so I have a super laser beam shield. Now I'll shoot a super super laser beam at you.\" \\n\\n\r\nEvery fighter now has strengths, weaknesses and matchups with enemies with again, their own strengths and weaknesses which they have to find out and do their best to outmatch each other. It is executed well, the fights are organic and often well thought out. They are entertaining in their own right because they don't rely on any gimmick, they instead create their own based on the situation at hand. While most powers for the main characters are rather basic, it is enjoyable for what it is.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Essentially what you should expect from the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo what you need to know about Stardust Crusaders is the following. It focuses purely on fighting and how to enhance the entertainment factor of that. The characters will throw one liners, bizarre lines, do silly shit, create ridiculous situations, all while having some very interesting matchups. The matchups consist of different super powers having specific gimmicks. So x fights y trying to figure out y's power and then defeats them, in a way that exploits a weakness of the power of y. It follows a villain of the week pattern so that's what you should look forward to if you're getting into this.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much from the story, since the main focus is fighting, the secondary is fighting. Can you guess the tertiary? How about the one after that? And after that? Yeah. The story can be digested easily by watching a few of the first episodes and then skipping to like the last ones where they fight the villain. I'd advice you to temper your expectations in regards when you might watch it and something that might have interesting implications for the story. It will always be run back. To which degree that is I'll leave it up to your interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nDue to that matter, you can figure out that again, the characters are gonna be represented like old cartoons, with their motivation not really being there and what they do is completely service for the viewer, rather than thinking for themselves. Stardust Crusaders just pretends it doesn't do that and does a bad job at it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I can say about this part and its future parts always is this:\\n\\n\r\n\"The action of the series is generally over the top and bizarre, just like you'd expect from the title, with some (censored) gore and pretty unusual situations. Although the series if presented out of context could look quite ridiculous, in the context of the world, it can easily be taken seriously as far as the action goes and the fights are always well thought-out and very well planned strategically, featuring powers that prove more worthwhile the more witty and creative you are. For those looking for the type of action I've described, it's very unlikely that you will not enjoy JoJo a lot for this reason alone as I can hardly think of anything that can match it in this department.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou are likely to enjoy Stardust Crusaders if you enjoyed JoJo or any action series so far solely for their action factor. But if you need a compelling story on the side, don't. Stardust Crusaders is terrible in that department. Watch it if you enjoy fighting or you want to watch JoJo as a whole. But don't decide out of thin air, I heard this show that has fights in is really good. I wonder what amazingly memorable characters and what compelling story is gonna bring to the table. They're like WWE wrestler gimmicks. They only matter as long as you enjoy wrestling, otherwise they sound stupid.",

            "content": "I've  talked about the JoJo franchise before. Kimyou na Bouken was fairly absurd and over the top, but it was also enjoyable and entertaining. In that series, we watched the first of the titular JoJo sacrifice his life to stop the villainous Dio Brando. We also saw his grandson Joseph, also  called Jojo, take on a group of ancient warriors.  Ending with his confrontation with the strongest of them all, Kars. Let's take a look  at the follow up with JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series I and see if David Production kept the series going strong. \r\nStory:\r\nWe openwith Joutarou, the grandson of Joseph from the last series. He's being released from prison after being taken in for fighting. Joutarou, however, refuses to leave. He claims to have been possessed by an evil spirit and doesn't want to lose control and hurt people. His mother, Holly, contacts her father. Joseph goes to Japan and reveals that Joutarou's evil spirit is actually a power called a Stand. The Joestar  family has recently developed these powers coinciding with the return of Dio. After being defeated and decapitated by Jonathan Joestar, he managed to steal Jonathan's dead body and survive underwater  until he was pulled up by a boat. Thanks to his new found connection with the Joestar family, they've all developed Stands. Unfortunately, Holly isn't strong enough to handle hers and it's killing her. Joseph and Jotaro leave her in the hands of the Speedwagon foundation and, along with some companions, undertake the journey to defeat Dio in order to save Holly's life. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is just that it can get repetitive. There are several points where the dialogue consists of characters repeating information. The series also uses a very formulaic pattern where the group progresses to a new area, encounters a Stand user who's working for Dio and they have to develop a strategy to beat them. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series still excels at providing over the top, enjoyable action sequences that are, honestly, pretty creative. I also appreciate that there are major stakes for our heroes and they have to race against time. Heroes having to face major odds while racing against time might be nothing new, but it works well for a series like this that gets its appeal from being absurdly, entertainingly over the top.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters remain pretty archetypical. Joutarou is the bad boy with a good heart. Joseph has gone from the cunning protagonist to the elder mentor figure. Dio is still very much an evil for the evils character. We've still got a bunch of characters named after old musical artists  like Devo, J Geil & Midler. That being said, I actually like the cast in this. They're not complex, but they're entertaining. They actually remind me of a silver age super hero team, in a positive way. JoJo & his amazing friends. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork suits the series well. It's full of machismo. Almost every major male character we see is huge and powerfully muscled. We also get added over the top effects and stopping to pose during fights is still a factor. I do love the action sequences in this though. The series takes this idea of Stands and their mysterious powers and uses them really creatively with a lot of different types, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Which makes for some really creative battles, including one that's fought in the world of dreams and one that starts aboard a submarine. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal performances continue to be really exaggerated. Ishizuka Unshou in particular has a lot of lines where he just yells exclamations. That being said, the exaggerated delivery does work given the aesthetic that the series has. I also like that the ending theme tune is Walk Like an Egyptian. It really fits both in terms of being kind of ridiculous and in terms of the whole, really fond of classic rock, naming convention. Kanno Yugo's original music is pretty good. There is a nice soundtrack to this. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any ho-yay in this series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is ridiculous, over the top, full of machismo and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. While not complex, it is an entertaining series with solid action and some really creative fights. If you're in the mood for something that's deliberately absurd, consider checking it out. If you want a complex narrative with deep characters, it's  not going to do it for you.  For me, my final rating is going to be an 8/10. Maybe I'll look at the second Stardust Crusaders series at a later point but next week is Komori-san wa Kotowarenai because I was looking for something short to review betwixt this and Brain Powerd and picked it randomly.",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders takes place after Battle Tendancy\r\nFor me, Stardust crusaders is a bit odd. There was a lot I enjoyed in this part. I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the story, and I really enjoyed the introduction of stands. But I just had a hard time really enjoying this part.\r\nI think the biggest problem I had was just the length. I was enjoying this part at the start, and I was enjoying it at the ending once they finally made it to Cairo. But there was just a large part in the middle that didn't differentiate itself as much.It was just battle after battle and I was losing my attention. It wasn't until we hit D'Arby the Gambler and had a fight that was nothing like we had seen previously that I really got back into the show.\\n\\n\r\nI also have issue with the humor in this season. There was a lot of fart, poop, and pee jokes in this part and I personally don't really go for that kind of humor so it was a huge turnoff throughout the part.\\n\\n\r\nMy final complaint is the girl that was traveling with the party throughout a fair part of the show. She was completely worthless. She kept showing up like she was going to be a big deal or something but ultimately nothing happened with her. I can't even be bothered to remember her name.\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, after they got to Cairo that fights got more diverse and interesting again and the entire final fight was wonderful. I just feel there was a lot in the middle that could be cut out.\\n\\n\r\nOne small complaint I had as well was Joseph. I loved Joseph in part 2 and I enjoyed him here but he felt very underutilized. I know part of that was that he had the weakest stand, one that wasn't very combat oriented, but I just wished he was used a little more. We also really didn't see that trickster attitude at all anymore. The argument could be said that he has matured beyond that now, but I feel that contradicts something we learn about him next season. I also wish we saw more use of Hamon. I think he only really used his Hamon powers once throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI already watched all of part 4 so I will either post my review later tonight or tomorrow, as well as the next anime I watched. Like I said, I am a little behind on my reviews.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "The glass ceiling shines gloriously bright here. Isn\u2019t the trouble with glass ceilings that they\u2019re invisible? Yet the flaws here are so obvious. The series is no major experiment. Creators who fall to such obvious flaws often can\u2019t get the basics of storytelling. I haven\u2019t seen an anime that gave up so miserably since Sword Art Online. There\u2019s no other way to describe what happens to the series halfway through. You literally see the band members running out of ideas, but the concert is still rocking.\r\nIt\u2019s not a major disaster like Sword Art Online because the nature of giving up is different. That anime hintedat psychological and philosophical insight only to deliver a boring monomyth about an asshole and a helpless princess. Stardust Crusaders simply gives up on pushing its idea further. It\u2019s content with sitting in the same place, offering good variations but never breaking out of the mold. I\u2019m not sure what it says about the creator that they managed to create 10 episodes that barely add anything, yet are still a lot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nvlcsnap-2016-08-30-14h26m24s231\\n\\n\r\nThe improvement over the first installment is that this one lives up to the title of \u2018bizarre\u2019. The previous season gained its energy from pushing archetypes to the extreme. Nothing about it was weird, thought. It was all archetypical, tough guys posing and using battle startergies. Stardust Crusaders throws the same passion for archetypes into bizare-ness.\\n\\n\r\nThere are about 15 villains of the week here, and each of them is a puzzle in its own. Anytime you think they ran out of ideas, something new comes up. No villain is truly like the other. The creators use this to play with genres and story types. You get the dream narrative, the killer car, the hostile creepy-looking town and the ghost ship. It\u2019s a prime example of why people who whine about good guys winning miss the point. Of course the good guys will win \u2013 there\u2019s no reason for them to lose unless \u2018the world is unjust\u2019 is something you explore. The fun thing about these stories is how they solve the puzzle. Just like the first series, it\u2019s never about shouting and brute strength. Each villain is a puzzle to solve. In a way, it\u2019s a mish-mash of mystery and battle shounen.\\n\\n\r\nYet this successful formula is exactly what keeps the series down. The series\u2019 ideas never progress. There\u2019s no gradual change in tone or characters. Events happen, but they\u2019re too self-contained. It\u2019s a heroic journey that\u2019s told as a Slice of Life anime. The disconnection between the events lowers their meaning. An anime about a band of heroes fighting a different enemy every time can be fine, but it clashes with what the series is at heart. The result is something that\u2019s stuck in-between. It\u2019s too Slice-of-Life for the journey to feel like it actually progresses, and too journey-like for the episodes to truly deviate from each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the series gives up at some point. What\u2019s worse, sitting comfortably behind your limits or trying fruitlessly to break them? The Stands eventually lose their meaning. They carry Tarot card names but their powers have little to do with it and the creators don\u2019t even try to come up with names. What started off as using Tarot and colors as inspiration for villain was dropped in exchange for weird superpowers. They\u2019re entertaining superpowers, but it only reinforces the disconnection between the events.\\n\\n\r\nThe series stops halfway through the actual arc. You\u2019d think that would be a problem, but the lack of conclusion comes more from the format rather than splitting up the series. It\u2019s these aforementioned flaws that make the last episode feel anticlimatic. All these events and enemies, and in the end nothing changed. Our heroes arrive in Egypt, so what?\\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders is never bad. What\u2019s frustrating is that it always threatens to be way better than its predecessor. The characters are way better \u2013 distinctively quirky and silly. They each contribute something to the group but have enough agency to create as much conflict as they solve. The focus also never locks in on one character. They each have equal screen time. It\u2019s so balanced it\u2019s easy to forget Jotaru is kind of meant to be the main character. Both the enemies and the characters are more bizarre, sillier, more mythic and lifelike than the predecessor. The art is also more colorful and varied. While it doesn\u2019t play so much with colors, the scenery is varied and the characters suffer less from Same Face Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nThe glass ceiling is tough to break. Maybe the series didn\u2019t even try, but chose to sit under a different ceiling. It\u2019s still recommended to anyone who\u2019s into fighting and macho dudes. The genre hardly gets better than this unless you\u2019re going full retard with Kill la Kill. It dodges all the problems long-running shounen shows have \u2013 there\u2019s focus, no babbling, no info dumps and it actually ends. Despite doing pretty much everything right, the result is only a good anime and nothing beyond this.\\n\\n\r\n3 stands out of 5",

            "content": "A few years ago Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, one of the finest manga ever made, was finally given the anime treatment it deserved. The cheesy dialogue, ultra-violence, manly men, and fabulous posing manifested into a hand that grabbed me by the balls, dragged me through a whole season of some of the best action of recent years, and left me begging for more. \r\nStardust Crusaders, to me, is a little more reserved in how manly it is. It still has the posing, ridiculously proportioned men, and ove-the-top shounen dialogue but it doesn\u2019t have the impact the action of the first season had. If you\u2019ve read mydiscussions on Jojo before then you know what I\u2019m talking about. What really drags Stardust Crusaders down is the introduction of Stands. Well, that and the fact it doesn\u2019t do too much to innovate or make itself any more than a show about fighting for fighting\u2019s sake. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the late 1980\u2019s and Jotaro Kujo, grandson of Joseph Joestar, is a high school student. When he manifests a spiritual familiar he locks himself up in a prison cell until Joseph and an Egyptian fortune teller named Avdol show up and explains to him what is happening. Dio has returned, attaching his decapitated head to Jonathan Joestar\u2019s body, and now every Joestar has manifested a so called \u201cStand\u201d. Jotaro\u2019s mother develops a Stand she is too weak to control and it begins to kill her. Now, with assassins being sent at them left and right, the Jojo\u2019s, Avdol, and a few allies fight their way to Egypt to save her by killing Dio. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the extent of the story. For the entire series. Each episode is a Stand user appearing and trying to kill the good guys and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s not a lot of drama, nor is there as much a reason to stick around as there was for the first season. In that regard, I understand the complaints and I totally don\u2019t mind when people say that Stardust sucks. \\n\\n\r\nBut the episode-to-episode action isn\u2019t my problem. It\u2019s Stands themselves and how lame they are. Something I never got over when reading the manga was how the series established Ripple as the main technique of battle, but then changes it to something that is basically a violent version of Pokemon. Each Stand has unique powers and weaknesses so that you have to really think when fighting a new one. The Stands add a new layer of weird to an already wacky show, but they don\u2019t provide for the same level of action. It doesn\u2019t feel as hard hitting or violent when the guys aren\u2019t using their own fists to beat each other up. There\u2019s something about remotely fighting an enemy that isn\u2019t as manly as using your own fists. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit there are some cool Stands and good ideas coming from them. The fog stand is neat, Kakyoin\u2019s Hierophant Green is interesting, J. Geil\u2019s Stand was really good. But then there are some that are ridiculously stupid. The boat and wish granting ones come to mind. So it\u2019s a mixed bag where some episodes are a lot stupider than others. And sure, this series is supposed to be over-the-top, but there are some points where it crosses a line and gets a bit too much for my taste. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that will be the segue-way to my discussion of the characters. Especially Polnareff. Despite the fact Jotaro should be the main character, a lot more time is given to Polnareff than anyone else for some reason. He\u2019s the lady\u2019s man and giant idiot who provides a lot of humor to the show, though is sometimes one of the worst parts. I guess because he\u2019s the idiot he makes a good punching bag, but there\u2019s something about him I don\u2019t like. Perhaps he\u2019s just not manly enough. He\u2019s not bad by any means, but he doesn\u2019t fit in with the rest. \\n\\n\r\nAvdol and Kakyoin are pretty decent characters and so is Joseph, but Jotaro is kind of bland. He\u2019s quiet, treats people like shit, but he is a genuinely nice guy deep down. Comparing him to Jonathan and Joseph, he\u2019s the weakest lead of the series so far. There\u2019s nothing likeable about him, nor any humor. It\u2019s pretty sad that the guy who should be the lead is being outshined by an idiot who is forced to lick a toilet. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the bad guys, good luck finding a decent one. They\u2019re just obstacles. Some have character, others are just bad guys because they are. There are a couple like Hol Horse and Enyaba who get enough time to take on personalities, but even then they\u2019re not memorable. Dio gets some time onscreen but is more of a menacing off-screen presence than anything else. The first season made me hate the guy, really showing him to be the epitome of evil. This season he\u2019s just the final boss. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nostalgic and hearkens to the source material. It\u2019s not expensive at all, but it gets the job done and takes me back to a time when shounen were about men, not boys. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is just as good as the first season. A very catchy opening, great music during the show, and Walk Like an Egyptian as the finale. The voice actors are all over-the-top (especially Joseph) making it just that much more fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders is good but not great by any means. It has its moments, but, for me, it dragged on a bit too long and Stands took away from what was otherwise a great fighting system. Yet I can\u2019t help but look forward to watching the Egyptian Arc. There\u2019s something about Jojo that is hard to hate, even when it does slip into negative territory. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d give Stardust Crusader\u2019s a hesitant suggestion. It has enough problems to warrant quitting, but it has enough crazy entertainment to keep you glued to your seat. \\n",

            "content": "After you watch that steroid filled first season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, you only have two roads to take. You would either hate it and would want to move in the opposite direction of wherever Jojo is or you would do one of those incredible poses, wear them stylish clothes and next you would say,\"Where is the next season?\". OH!!!\r\nThis anime is only for those who belong to the later group as the anime continued the JoJo philosophy to add the extra oomph to even simplest of action and words.\r\nThe story of Stardust Crusaders follows Joseph Joestar along with his grandson Kujo Jotaro (the newJoJo)  and some friends travel to Egypt to defeat Dio, who has now revived from his deep slumber. Revival of Dio has caused the Joestars to acquire new power called Stands, who are basically spirits like the ones in Shaman King and stuff. All of the Joestars gain the power of stands, including Jotaro's mother, who isn't strong enough to wield a Stand. This makes her sickly and thus Jojo along with his allies look for Dio to beat him up for good. The first season basically chronicles their discovery of their stands and obstacles they face on towards their journey to Egypt. All, I mean all, the episodes deal with the gang facing another stand user who is one of Dio's goons. Thus, the series is episodic; and that honestly can turn off a lot of viewers as there is no pay off at the end. The first season was conceived just as a set up to the season 2, which deals with the heroes finally reaching Egypt and their subsequent battle with him. There is not much of plot per say in this one. To move to the part where the action lies, you can easily skip out on certain episodes which offer nothing and can move on to the ones that matter, though there is a dearth of them here. \\n\r\nThe essence of Jojo lies in the battles, along with certain other things, but battles are a big part. Most of the episodes follow the plot wherein the 20 mins are divided into 4 parts. In the first quarter, the gang jokes around and meets the villain of the week; this is followed by the villain using his/her power on one or the whole of gang depending on his power and the person he is fighting and such a person or the gang gets in a really tight situation. The third quarter follows the villain torturing the hero(es) and the hero struggling to harm the villain. The last quarter deals with the hero suddenly getting a genius idea which the villain does not expect and the hero uses it and wins. Thus, all episodes can be predicted by this formula. Though, fear not it still doesn't get boring. OH NO!!! it doesn't. If you are a fan of battles that are won not by brute force but minds, then this will definitely keep you interested. Unlike anime like Naruto, DBZ, One Piece, etc. in which most heroes rely on the brute strength, endurance and the new techniques, etc. anime like HxH, Jojo , etc. rely on the power of brain. Unlike characters like Shikamaru, Lelouch, etc. who formulate mind blowing strategies and traps to defeat their enemies, characters in JoJo use common sense and that heightened logic. In my entire life I could not imagine defeating a fog enemy by breathing him in. Many writers have fog/smoke enemies, most famous of the lot being Smoker from One Piece. Luffy still can't beat Smoker after 700+ episodes; but all it took JoJo was half an episode to come up with such scheme and by god was I amazed at the creativity. 24 episodes and at least 15 villains later you would still want to watch the schemes the characters come up with to beat their enemy. None the enemies would lose simply cause the opposition was stronger, all of them lost because JoJo and co had such heightened IQ and common sense that it would put  Newton to shame. After watching both the Jojo I can easily say that Hirohiko sensie is easily the smartest writer out there. The techniques that JoJo and co uses to fight the battles are beyond the world and still so darn entertaining. This factor alone makes a overused and dry story so much more interesting and enjoyable. Thus, battle which otherwise is just a secondary element is used to perfection and is as vital to the anime as is the story and pretty much the only reason to rate the anime so highly.\\n\\n\r\nIf the battles make the story interesting then the people who thought of the schemes, executed them and lived trough them are even more exciting. Make no mistake unlike the previous JoJo venture which offered at least minimum character development, this one has none. The characters all behave like they did in episode 1 till the last episode. This anime isn't about character development. Its about manliness and an attempt to celebrate the same. There aren't any female characters and nor there should be in this JoJo. The characters all have a catchphrase. The characters as as tall as the Eiffel Tower. Their chests are shaped like that due to taking extra steroids and mixture of weird drugs and search all you want you would never find more manlier voice than what JoJo has. The testosterone in this anime alone is greater than that of all anime combined. And most important of them all, their pose can make even the best of models wet. All of them are good people who unite for a common cause to defeat Dio and to save Jojo's mother. Despite virtually having no progress and emotional depth as characters, these are some of the most memorable characters anime has to offer. And the reason is pretty simple. Jotaro is to anime what James Bond is to movies. Both have pretty much no depth as characters, they are incredibly popular with lady, they ooze of manliness, both are good looking/drawn, they have plenty of macho/swag/testosterone/balls. This is what draws people to like Jotaro and other protagonists of JoJo series. They don't need any of the ingredients that make other heroes great. What they lack in other substance, they make up for it with that coolness. Jotaro is totally the bad guy who would steal your girl and not bat an eye over it and still would look cool doing it and would still stand out as the hero. Other characters too ooze with the charm and classiness that makes people in JoJo verse great. The  villains in JoJo series are portrayed as classic bad guys. If they are truly evil and not those comedic evil guys; they would totally look like broken television and sound like broken speakers. They all have evil intentions of harming people and, they all have overdosed on them steroids and texts come flying out of the screen when they are shown. \\n\r\nThus, I would never truly understand what makes JoJo characters that great without having any trait of what makes a character great. It might be that charm and ruggedness and the tendency to stand up to evil no matter what the circumstance is as come what may justice is more important. I could honestly say that JoJo characters easily remind me of that fearless heroes of the old westerns and currently would be only cool old school heroes in the action genre. Though, make no mistake they would never stop enticing  you even if the show had 100 more similar episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere can never not be a polarizing discussion on Jojo's art. Those rich visuals combined with those over the top and eye popping characters are honestly a hit or miss. Though they either hit a home run or do whatever is opposite of that is in baseball world. For me Jojo's art is definitely a hit. That art is important to the anime just like the characters are. They are what bring out the characters. This experimental art is what brings forth the characters manliness. They are what makes them larger than life. Those drugged chests are what shows the level of manliness and that height is what separates the great from those by standers. Thus, those hairstyles and chest that the animators have drawn is extremely important to bring forth those characters to the screen. The background is gorgeously drawn and is rich in details even if they get the city wrong sometimes. There is incredible amount of time and detail given to people, clothes, buildings, monuments and even roads and climate changed according to the city; albiet like I stated earlier parts of it was wrong and stereotypical and can offend some people. Though what they get right, they do it better than other guys. Thus, I felt that anime had great art and was nothing to complain about, especially if you liked the art of first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something that is an integral part of JoJo. It did the music right in 2012 and 2 years later, it has done right again. The opening was good but the ending was brilliant. It was walk like Egyptian by the bangles, an English song. It followed its predecessor by including a classic English rock song. That song did not just introduce an essence of nostalgia to the viewers but also stayed true to the theme of manliness as the anime. Also, kept the concept of journey to Egypt relevant even after the episode ended. There is nothing more manly than classic rock in music terms and the makers clearly selected this song in line with the theme of anime and I feel it was master class selection. Hoping that next JoJo too would have a such a song.\\n\\n\r\nThus, this concludes my review of the uber cool Stardust Crusaders. If you were fan of the 2012 anime then this one is write up your ally; albeit in terms of ranking it would be higher than Phantom Blood and lower to Battle Tendency. \\n\\n\r\nYARE YARE DAZE, how much have I rambled on.",

Also, if you've ever seen 1 vs many in kung fu films and thought \"why don't they all jump him at once?\" - it also applies to the villains here.\r\nSo many of the villains are introduced with an advantage over the Stardust Crusaders, and the only way to overcome the villains is with wits, or with simple brute force. Unfortunately, most of the villains are either borderline retarded, or simply cannot resist being cocky even at the risk of their own life - the equivalent of teabagging in the middle of a battlefield.Had any of the villains chosen to go for the kill as soon as they were able, our Stardust Crusaders would never have made it to the final boss, who is no smarter than his henchmen.\\n\\n\r\nThis part just feels like a showcase of the abilities possessed by the protagonists and antagonists. The story is nearly as simple as part 1, and plenty of concepts are forgotten after their introduction. Unfortunately, this part introduces abilities used in all later parts, but if you don't have much time for anime, I'll recommend you skip this part as well.",

Every fight now is just a boring pokemon fight now while the 'trainers' just look on. Goneare the manly melee fights I loved. Gone are the manly poses. Gone are the cunning do or die strategies. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is also kind of meh with some plot holes as well, some things early on seems like a rewrite/retcon of events happening in the first season. Everything feels forced as well.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the main MC Jotaro does not live up to the JoJo name.. he is boring, stereotypical and just plain lifeless compared to his predecessors.. at least where I am at right now. Jonathan and Joseph were such more interesting characters in comparison and really hooked you into the show and made you root for them. They had personalities and felt like people. Jotaro is just some guy to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that really saves this show to me is the JoJo-esque humor... though even the jokes are still kind of hollow compared to the original.\\n\\n\r\nJust watching each new episode of this one is now real slog for me, and I feel like I just want to drop the show... I just feel the badassery that was the first season has been gutted out and what made the first show special is now gone.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I am still in the middle of watching it... and I am trying my best to give the show a chance still.. but yeah.. these are just my feelings right now and its not good... but if it does become better I will revisit this review... that is if I don't drop it entirely beforehand. :(",

It has splendid chemistry between the characters and works well to produce some really hilarious moments. However, it is weighed down by lack of solid antagonists and episodic plot line.

Art and Animation were good with the characteristic flair that David Prod. captured in its first part from the Manga. If you are looking for an adventurous, funny and boisterous action anime that is unlike most shounen's out there don't give you a headache or put you to sleep, then JJBA star crusaders your cup of tea.

            "content": "I find this anime being rated so highly quite bizarre in itself. It lacks in major areas I feel people require universally in any show you watch.\r\nJOJO is an interesting show that has its highs and lows. Immediately you will realize the art and vizuals. The men are very masculine with alot of bulk and there is a variety of colors and quality animations to match. The show offers refreshing change of visuals than what you are used to with anime.\r\nJOJO suffers in weak story and character development. Partly due to the fast pace of the show it moves and provides something going on everyepisode, there is no filler or wasted episodes. This also hinders the show as every episode is the same with a rinse and repeat forumla. The crew goes to new city/area and meet a new bad guy and they fight, bad guy loses and repeat. As a result you don't have much to look forward to in the long run. At best you ahve two part episodes that provide more depth and intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nAlot of things do not get explained in the show or are provided adequate background details to any lore of the anime. People have these mysterious stand powers with no real reason. The show carries the name of the first series JoJo Bizarre adventure but they really are two completely different shows with only a couple of characters that appear in both making them related in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSo this leaves you with an action heavy, plot and character lacking show. Granted the show has bizarre in its name the action provides often loopholes, inconsitencies, and unrealistic tactics.  The pace moves so fast you won't have time to dwell on it either. Typical shounen relies on the \"your tactic didnt work because I planned ahead with ym tactic\". But JOJO takes this to an extreme with anticipated calculated moves that seem to flirt with deus ex machina rather than good writing or battle development.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all if you want something more mindless with a twist of humor and fast pace this is the show for you. Despite it's flaws it still is an entertaining show, just know it is labeled bizaree for a reason which says alot when it needs such a moniker in the anime world.",

            "content": "JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, classical rock enthusiast Hirohiko Araki\u2019s esteemed manga series, exists as one of the most revolutionary and iconic franchises of its genre, a staple for many fans in the West. After the success of the first animated adaptation, the legacy of the Joestar bloodline lives on in Stardust Crusaders, with the new face of Jotaro Kujo, preparing to confront the destiny foretold by his blood for over a century.\r\nThis review contains spoilers for the first two parts of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d and \u201cBattle Tendency\u201d. It is highly recommended that you watch the 2012 animated adaptation of the franchise or read themanga before watching Stardust Crusaders.\\n\\n\r\nWill you like it?\\n\\n\r\nYou may enjoy series title if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- consider yourself a fan of the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure franchise\\n\r\n-- appreciate a \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d approach in regards to character representation\\n\r\n-- thrive in journeys that span a variety of cultural settings\\n\r\n-- love catchphrases, manliness, and general badassery\\n\\n\r\nYou may not enjoy series title if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- find yourself not as invested in the new art of \u201cStands\u201d as compared to Hamon\\n\r\n-- can\u2019t keep up with series that progress at a rapid pace\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders encompasses the third part of the Hirohiko Araki\u2019s JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure manga series. This particular section is split into two parts, and for the sake of this review, any mention of Stardust Crusaders will refer to the first season or twenty-four episodes of the adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMany years have passed since the defeat of Kars, and Joseph Joestar has grown old. His daughter, Holly, moved to Japan and had a son of her own named Jotaro, a strapping young man as tall and brawny as any Joestar before him. One day, Joseph is called to Japan as his grandson Jotaro believes himself to be possessed by an evil spirit and has himself incarcerated to keep from hurting others. The old man knows of this spirit, and upon his arrival,  he informs his grandson that the ethereal force is known as a \u201cStand\u201d, a projection of one\u2019s fighting spirit with a variety of combative features. Their origin spawns from the return of a familiar foe to the Joestar line, Dio Brando, and Joseph requests his grandson\u2019s help in defeating him. Though Jotaro initially declines, a Stand begins to develop within and begin consuming Holly, spurring the young student into action. With their goal set, the two Joestars, accompanied by three comrades with Stands of their own, set off for Egypt to confront their fated enemy in Dio, hoping to put an end to his malicious actions once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nI think of the series as divided into two parts: the prologue (episodes 1-5; the introduction of the characters) and the quest (episodes 6-24; the events after the completion of the group). An episode within the quest sub-arc generally involves the crew travelling to a new locale and encountering one of Dio\u2019s conscripted Stand users, most of which are defeated in a single episode (with a couple, more intricate scenarios taking up two parts). As a result, Stardust Crusaders progresses at a fast pace, with there seemingly being no time for the characters to rest, which is truly fitting for the story all things considered. At times, however, you can feel underwhelmed by how formulaic some episodes appear to be, since almost each one involves X enemy Stand user being defeated by A/B/C/D/E main character. With that in mind, I did find a majority of the foes interesting, with the tarot-based identities fascinating, and the character interactions taking place in-between combat really wrapped everything together in a nice way.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nLoyal to the spirit of its predecessor, Stardust Crusaders retains its manly focus on the art of combat, though in a different way than you\u2019re used to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Hamon has been all but retired within the world of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure in favor a spiritual technique known as \u201cStands\u201d. These projections exist as mirrors of one\u2019s life energy, each based upon a specific tarot card and being unique to their respective owner (save for Dio, who holds control over them all). They function as extensions of one\u2019s physical form that allows them to ascend beyond their mortal limitations in a variety of ways, depending upon the nature of the Stand. In all fairness, they\u2019re a creative way to inspire some diversity beyond the somewhat limited nature of Hamon energy, though personally it\u2019s hard to say which field is preferable. It\u2019s hard to ignore how less physical combat feels when you\u2019re having your Stand do most of your fighting, even if there is a spiritual link to your physical form. It\u2019s a polarizing change that could considerably affect how well enjoy the action in Stardust Crusaders, so it will mostly differ from person to person.\\n\\n\r\nStrategy remains a vital element of the combat in JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, and perhaps even moreso considering the unique characteristics, counters, and intricacies involved through Stand combat. I always like it when fighting is more than just a measure of brute strength, and JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure has never disappointed in this regard, with each character having to use not only their Stands but their brains in order to defeat Dio\u2019s assassins.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual \u201cadventure\u201d, Stardust Crusaders actually performs better than its predecessors. As mentioned before, Jotaro and the party visit a variety of locales that each appeared unique and interesting in their own ways, and the series focused more on the journey itself rather than the conflict at hand. Combining the dangers encountered through the various Stand users and exotic settings, it\u2019s dishonest to say that we didn\u2019t experience the bizarre adventure promised by the title.\\n\\n\r\nThough perhaps not as important to others, I did feel a bit disappointed in how little invoked the esteemed \u201cposes\u201d were in this series, perhaps as a result of the Stand combat. They\u2019re not absent by any means, but much less abundant, and as something that served as one of the most iconic designs of the franchise, poses are something that need to be prevalent.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure title, no matter the specific arc, is always a special treat for any prospective viewer. The strapping male figures, creative use of coloring, visible representation of onomatopoeia, and uniquely designed stands all help contribute to the iconic image of Stardust Crusaders in droves. It does express a pretty niche aesthetic however that will gain your loyalty heavily if you enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHaving a fantastic soundtrack\u201d is as synonymous with JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure as the intense action, and just like the previous two parts, Stardust Crusaders exceeds well in this regard. Hirohiko Araki moves full steam ahead with his litany of classical rock puns, involving a variety of references to well-respected groups such as \u201cSteely Dan\u201d and \u201cThe J. Geils\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu do a great job with their roles as well, though no surprise really. There are even some big names involved too, such as Daisuke Ono, one of the Japanese animation industry\u2019s voice acting greats, voicing the stoic body of Jotaro Kujo. Unshou Ishizuka takes on the great challenge of performing Joseph Joestar, and personally he does it damn well. I enjoyed his various moments of Engrish, particularly. The other main characters were voiced well too, each brimming with distinct personality and careful effort. I did find myself a bit annoyed by some of the Stand performances, but I believe that was an intentional effort by the seiyuu and not a result of poor performance.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening piece is great, as is befitting a series in the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure franchise, though I think it was a noticeable downgrade from the expertly crafted sequences that were \u201cSono Chi no Sadame\u201d and \u201cBloody Stream\u201d. I did enjoy the references to the older JoJo\u2019s, as well as the depictions of the party members with their stands, however. Further, much in Araki\u2019s style, the ending piece is a well animated wrap-up played to the tune of The Bangles\u2019 \u201cWalk Like An Egyptian\u201d, quite apt for the story of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nUnlike \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d or \u201cBattle Tendency\u201d where the main character focused solely on the particular Joestar in question, Stardust Crusaders displays a focus on five main characters in somewhat of a \u201cparty\u201d format, with two Joestars forming the head and three comrades supporting them on their journey to defeat Dio. I honestly enjoyed each of them, with marginal differences in appreciation, and found the familiarity of having Joseph as a member of the crew invaluable. Each had their own time to shine, being the primary combatant or reason for success at different times over the course of the series. In the following few paragraphs, I\u2019ll go over them a bit and discuss a bit in regards to the notable supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nJotaro Kujo (Stand: Star Platinum, an Aztec-inspired projection notable for its shrewd eyesight, powerful punches, and outcries of \u201cORA!\u201d) is a tough, stoic Japanese student, notable for his quick temper, no-nonsense attitude, and utterance of \u201c\u3084\u308c\u3084\u308c (en. Good grief). As Johnathan and Joseph represented honor and charm, respectively, Jotaro embodies that of resiliency. While at first he started off a bit dickish, much like his grandfather Joseph, Jotaro grew a bit over the course of the series as the responsibility of not only saving his mother but coming to face his fate matured the young man quite a bit. Just as his mother Holly swears on her life, Jotaro may have a rough exterior, but on the inside he\u2019s a good man with a big heart.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar (Stand: Hermit Purple, an extension of Joseph in the form of constricting brambles, also granting the ability to create psychic photographs) makes a reappearance as a much older (slightly matured) version of his former self. Still existing as my favorite of the Joestars, Joseph does well to not only guide the group but serve as the source of a great bit of the series\u2019 comedy, whether it be through making a fool out of himself or his outbursts of some of the best Engrish found in anime. My only complaint is that his Stand is, for the most part, a complete let-down compared to the others in the group, but this is likely to set the stage for the newcomer in Jotaro to blossom.\\n\\n\r\nA supporting threesome of Noriaki Kakyoin (Stand: Hierophant Green, a malleable lurker with a devastating Emerald Splash attack), Jean-Pierre Polnareff (Stand: Silver Chariot, a swift master of fencing and deception), and Mohammed Avdol (Stand: Magician\u2019s Red, an anthropomorphic entity with a great affinity towards fire) accompany the two Joestars in their journey to defeat Dio. From the shrewd student in Kakyoin, the suave French idiot of Polnareff, to the serious voice of reason that is Avdol, each of these fine young men serve a purposeful and justified role within the group.\\n\\n\r\nDio Brando (Stand: ???) reprises his role as the series\u2019 main antagonist, having sruvived the explosion that killed Johnathan Joestar a hundred years before. While he exists as the primary threat to Jotaro and the gang, his presence is increasingly limited until the following season, and he mostly serves as the leader from whom these assassins are sent.\\n\\n\r\nA variety of malicious stand users attack the party as they travel towards Egypt, really being the only supporting characters worth note aside from Holly Kujo (Jotaro\u2019s mother and Joseph\u2019s daughter). A few of them were quite memorable, though not all were equally great, especially considering we only got to experience them for a single episode. They were, however, far superior to the vague, vampirical opponents of the past, and the lore of their particular Stand often proved an exploit of its own.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders Stands strong as a thrilling fresh start within the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure timeline. I have to appreciate how there were enough elements of familiarity to justify the arc\u2019s existence within the universe in addition to the new ideas and concepts brought forth to evolve the story. Jotaro and his friends definitely invested me in the story, getting me excited for another, potentially final confrontation with the Joestar line\u2019s greatest enemy. I continue onward, confident that the subsequent arc will remedy a some of the issues plaguing this season, and highly anticipate that which is to be continued\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHey, jackass. Don\u2019t try to act cool at a time like this.\u201d\\n\r\n\u2013 Jotaro Kujo",

            "content": "It looks like someone gave Jojo Bizarre Adventures it's pills to calm it down.  Because while Stardust Crusaders is still very much insane, it's nowhere near as insane as the first season.  For me, that takes a couple of notches off of the anime, which is why I give it a 9 instead of a 10.  The absurdity of the first season of JBA is what made it great.  And while this is still great, it's still vastly calmer than the first installment.  \r\nA lot of the wild posing is gone (although Polnareff doesn't disappoint) and with Speedwagon out ofthe picture, alot of the constant screaming and over-the-top exposition is reduced.  (People yell when they're under attack, not when they're grabbing a bite to eat.)  The gore has also been reduced.  It's still present, but not as gory as the first season.  Although, they really seem to have a problem with animals and want them all to die horrible deaths.  The over-the-top vibe has been toned down.  Not all the way, but somewhat.  That being said: A toned-down Jojo is still 10x crazier than your normal anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, this anime is still fantastic.  I really like the Joestar team, although it took a while for Jotaro to grow on me.  Jotaro is vastly different from Jonathan and Joesph.  While Jonathan was a noble guy, and Joseph was a hilarious wildcard, Jotaro is a very stoic character.  It took a while for his \"cool\" appeal to grow on me, seeing how he had to follow in the footsteps of Joseph as the main protagonist.  Plus, he started in a hole with me, with how he was treating his mother in the earliest episodes.  I didn't care for that.  But, over time, his unflappable demeanor and intelligence grew on me, and now I like him more than I liked Jonathan Joestar.  (But, still not as much as I like Joseph Joestar.).  The rest of the crew is cool, too.  Although Kakoyin is still kind of just \"there\".  His personality doesn't really stand out when next to the Joestars and Polnareff.  Still, the crew as a whole really works well together.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that Stardust Crusaders improves upon is the Stand ability.  Instead of Hamon being the primary form of attack, the enemies and the heroes now have Stands, which are basically avatars that fight for them.  By doing this, it improves the variety of the fights with Dio's army.  Some enemies attack with dreams, others can shape shift, others use firebirds.  It's pretty awesome.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a worthy successor to the original series. It's funny, action packed, is actually more coherent than the first season, has a great cast and a fantastic swerve in the middle.  It's very, very good.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9   \\n\\n",

From a short time Jojo fan who got into the series in the summer of 2015.\r\nI'm gonna be blunt: this part has a strong start, a disappointing middle and a bombastic ending. The monster of the week format might be very off putting for a lot of people who liked the previous season, but the introduction of a new and interesting superpower concept might reel you back if anything but for the curiousity of seeing where it goes. \r\nThis part has amazing productionvalue and serves as pure fanservice for fans who have read the manga a long time ago, especially for people who have read it while it was ongoing back in the 80s (again, this series is a product of it's time).\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is the most quoted and referenced part, your expectations might be through the roof for this one. But because a lot of things have taken inspiration from this, it might seem bland and boring at first glance - but think about it -- back in the 80s there was nothing like this. \\n\\n\r\nIt's revolutionary, but also dissappointing for people who are just getting into the series fresh from the amazingly well done anime adaptation that was Battle Tendency i.e. episodes 10-26 of the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a 6.5 from me for the first season of Stardust Crusaders - it gets better with season two, I promise!",

Everytime I listen to this OP i can't help but sing along with it,the music and ending are also great,not memorable but great.Did I tell the OP is awesome?\r\n-Story:Jotaro Kujo and his grandpa go on an adventure to defeat the person that is the reason both the manga and anime exist.BUT i hate to say that all the episodes took me around 1month to finish for one reason: Repetitive.Yes yes i know some JoJo fans might come hard at me for sayingthis but just look at it yourselves,the heroes meet a new enemy!Oh Wow i bet this is gonna be hard right?NO they end up defeating him one way or another in either 1 or 2 episodes.This is the sole reason it took me so long to watch this anime,although the characters were cool,the stands were creative,I can't help but get sad because of the \"Heroes always win\" cliche.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall grade:if you don't mind the fact enemies are weak and will always die withing 1 or 2 episodes then you will probably enjoy this anime A LOT!However if you're like me but still want to watch JoJo,then good luck and have fun watching it.Remember this is just a review from my point of view,there will always be people who will disagree with others and that's fine \\n\r\nin the end i'm just here to let people know what i thought of this anime.",

Definitely, it's a bad idea to make THAT story in this way, because, you cannot know when, but it will get very sad to notice that the anime just couldn't make good fights as the start sounded like (other failure)...\r\nThe sound (to be specific, the voice) in general isvery good, and combine so much with the characters (have i mentioned that they're very good?), and it activates my \"child part\" to try imitating the Stand names (someday, i will say Za Warudo in a good way)!\\n\r\nWell, you can notice that the guy who made this can only make very-muscular man in some parts,but, well, he make it very well, which is a good point, because that's almost the only thing that it shows, anyway (that's not a spoiler, because there are very other stuff to look at... specially the enemies).\\n\\n\r\nWell...

            "content": "Objectivley, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusader, the third arc of the Jojo saga, is not a perfect anime. Monster of the week format, unusual art, somewhat silly plot. These are not, however, bad points, to one who is willing to accept something like Jojo. However, just like with it's predecessor, Stardust Crusaders is one of the best anime of the year. \r\nPart 3: Stardust Crusaders focuses on Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of Jospeth Joestar, the main character of Part 2: Battle Tendency. Part 3 introduced the concept of stands - kind of like a spirit that fights for you. It is soon discovered that themain villan from part 1 - Dio Brando, now styled himself DIO, has returned, causing the awakening of Jotaro and Josepth's stands. However, Jotaro's mother has had her own Stand awaken, but it is slowly killing her. Jotaro must go on a journey to defeat DIO, in 50 days, before his mother dies.\\n\r\nOverall, the plot of the first half of Stardust Crusaders isn't the most special thing in the world - there a few interesting twists, but the overall plot isn't incredible. It features a Monster of the Week format, which some would likely not enjoy, but I felt it worked fine with the JoJo formula.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show really shines is it's characters, who are both badasses, idiots, and clowns at the same time. Jotaro and Jospeth are joined by Avdol, an Egyption Fortune Teller, Kakyoin, a student at Jotaro's school, and Polanareff, a Frenchman on his own mission. Each of the characters have at least one or two episodes dedicated to them, and each of them have their own moments to shine. In my own opinion, Jospeth is just as funny as his part 2 version, as he occasionally swears loudly in English - to hilarious effect. He easily is the funniest character. Of the newcomers, I enjoy Polenareff the most, probably.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is also very special about this show are the crazy fights that take place every episode - they are all terrible people, but they are invariably all cheesy, funny, or over the top in each of their own special ways. They range from old men with a fast bug Stand, to strangely attractive men like Steely Dan (Dan of Steel in official subs). Personally, my stand out was the Wheel of Fortune fight, as it just amps up the hilarity to 11.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are very...unique. The show looks great, and the fights are animated well, but to a newcomer it might seem all a little insane, as occasionally the whole scene will just be inverted by palette swaps, turning characters green and clothing pink. The soundtrack is also pretty damn good, and this is taking into account the sound effects that are ever-present in the Jojo-Universe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is an absolutely blast of an anime - it's not perfect, but with the sheer amount of enjoyment that can be taken from it, there is no need to pick apart it's short comings. Featuring a cast of insane characters, manly fights, and sheer crazy villains and Stands, this anime is sure to be loved by fans of the battle anime genre.",

            "content": "(Note: this review will cover both seasons of Part 3. You have been warned)\r\nBy the late 80', ultra manly GAR anime started to die down, kinda like what happened in the early 80' in which the Super Robot genre started to die down in favor of more Real Robot Animes. While the MANIME as it has been nicknamed still popped up from time to time, chances are, it was probably just some anime from the mid 80' that still hadn't finished. In that light, you could say that Stardust Crusaders was a bit of a swan song for that kind of animes. And it shows.\r\nStory:\r\nThestory is a bit different from the usual Shounen anime, less so for the actual content of it and more so the way it's presented. Usually Shounen anime either have a bunch of unrelated events with a mini arc here or there, or they'll have a bunch of longer arcs with a clear goal. SC is a bit of a mix of the two. There is a clear goal from the The get Go, but the journey there is what's the focus. In that way, it feels almost like a road trip, and the characters kinda treat it that way.\\n\r\nThis kind of storytelling has its pros and cons. On the negatives side, the plot often feels disjointed, almost feeling like if it's just meandering around. On the positive side, however, it makes every event feel unique. That's one thing I'll give SC, it's extremely memorable, full of quotable lines and scenes.\\n\r\nThat said, it does probably go on for longer than it should. This is moreso prevalent in the anime as every story arc (With one exception) lasts at least two episodes, but even the manga kinda overused it's 5 chapter story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in my review of the first season, the best thing about Jojo has always been its characters. This is were another of the problem of the whole Road Trip format starts to show, though. Due to that format, most of the characters aren't allowed to develop. The only exceptions are Polnareff and Iggy. However, I don't mind this so long as the characters are good enough by themselves, and they are.\\n\r\nJotaro is different from our previous protagonists. He's quiet, rude and is a bit of a dick to everyone and everything. That said, I do feel there's enough depth to his character to make him stand out, plus, he's just badass. Polnareff is the closest thing this show has a deteragonist, having easily the most character development out of the entire cast, which, combined with his quirky yet lovable personality, quickly made him my favorite. Joseph has stepped down from his main character role, and weirdly enough, I don't really find him annoying anymore. His jerkassery and general jokester personality has been toned down, and overall just comes off as a very friendly, lovable guy. Kakyoin and Avdol sadly don't get much to do as they both at some point leave the ground for long periods of time, but they're decent enough characters in their own right so I don't mind. Introduced later on is Iggy, he's a bit of a jerk, but he's fun enough in his own right (Even if the joke of him farting in Polnareff's face got old fast) and he actually does have a bit of character arc, so there's at least that.\\n\r\nThen there's the main villain, DIO (Yes, you actually have to write his name like that, it's how it's spelled even in the Japanese version of the Manga). Compared to how he was in PB, he's definitely mellowed down, being more of a cold, calculating villain compared to the large ham he used to be. He's still pretty hammy, just in a different way. I actually really liked this portray, it made him far more threatening and made for a higher contrast for when he goes totally bat shit insane. The rest of the villains are one shot, so aside from a few like Hol Horse, the D'Arby brothers and Vanilla Ice, they don't stand out too much, but they're decent enough threats so there's at least that.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation has definitely received an upgrade. It goes for the late SC manga art style, which means everyone has screws for shoulders. It's ridiculous, but I love it. The actual animation has also gotten better, with there being a lot more movement and energy in the fights.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the fights, you can't believe how much the introduction of Stands helps. Because of them, every fight feels unique, with my favorites being the Poker Match with the elder D'Arby brother and the fight between Iggy and Polnareff Vs Vanilla Ice, which feels more like the other two trying to stay alive than actually beating him. And of course, how could I not mention the final Jotaro Vs DIO fight. This is one of the longest fights in the whole Manga, yet every bit of it is memorable (I can legitimately quote you many parts of this fight alone)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nContrast to the classical instruments used in the last Season, SC goes for straight up rock, with the classical instruments being used for some of the darker songs. I love it. As for the opening themes, \"Stand Proud\" is a very energetic and is a pure hype machine, but it's got NOTHING on the second opening \"END OF THE WORLD\" which is basically hype and manliness incarnate.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is amazing. Daisuke Ono got into voice acting because of Jojo to begin with, so I'm glad he above anyone else got the role of Jotaro, as he completely earned it. The late great Unsho Ishizuka replaces Tomokazu Sugita as Joseph, and he's amazing, being able to bring so much joy and life into his character. Fuminori Komatsu hasn't had much work aside from Polnareff, which confuses me as he was fantastic in this role. Of course, then there's also Takehito Koyasu as DIO. I just... what can I say about his performance that hasn't been said already? He's perfect, and you can tell he was having fun with the role. The rest are fantastic too, from Ikue Otani, Masaya Onokasa, Daisuke Hirakawa, Kenta Miyake, Reiko Takagi and even Kentaro Ito. But my absolute favorite casting choice has to be Show Hayami as Vanilla Ice, simply because of the fact that this isn't the first time he has played the role. Yeah, same goes for Daisuke Ono, but this is doubly so for Hayami considering that the last time he played Ice was in a PSX/DREAMCAST GAME! That's... that's just insane.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nLike with the last season, Stardust Crusaders isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be. It tells a fun, memorable story that is sure to stick with you. I can definitely see why Japan loves this part so much.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "HOLY SHIIIIIT....this is good.\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is just amazing, taking what the foundations of the first season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and ratchet up the bizarreness and craziness have now having a more refined edge to itself while also adding in past incidents coming into the light all under the initial premise, this first half of Stardust Crusaders anyways as Around the World in 80 Days: Jojo's Edition with Stands as the primary obstacles. What does kickstart this season is Holly Kuujou (Joseph Joestar's daughter) who awakens her Stand and with Dio reawakened, Joseph, his delinquent grandson Jotaro, Mohammed Abdul an acquaintance ofJoseph journeys to Egypt in order to defeat Dio and stop Holly's Stand so that it doesn't kill her.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the first half of Stardust Crusaders, this season just throws most of Dio's servants who are now essentially enemy Stands after the group, some become allies, MOST are generic bad guys with Occult Tarot cards in the Major Arcana as their theming of each Stand (this includes the main cast). The thing with Tarot Cards and by extension the Enemy Stands themselves is of how they perfectly embody their Tarot card they symbolize even to the situation Jotaro and the group and though they are Jobbers meant to show Jotaro and the group's Stand powers, some of them however have more interpersonal rivalry allowing for more character development from the new characters of this season. On speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nThe new cast for this season, aside from Joseph Joestar, are all new but VERY quickly LA loved the cast with all their banter, investment to their beliefs (be it fighting etc.) and just their quirky side that made them REALLY REALLY memorable and they're just badass awesome which is typical at this point in Jojo's. Let's start with Jotaro Joestar voiced by Daisuke Ono, a delinquent but having a heart of gold as much as his stoicism makes it hard for him to show it, though he is one of the more overpowered characters especially with his Stand Star Platinum, thankfully Stardust Crusaders gives lots of limelight to the rest of the main globe trekking group. Joseph Joestar is still Joseph even after soo many years, though he tries to be the instant expert at everything and fails but nonetheless he's integral to the journey even if his powers has diminished, his new Stand Powers helps regardless, he's Joseph through and through and still strong as his teenager years just more in the mental side than his physical side this time. Mohammed Abdul voiced by Kenta Miyake being an acquaintance of Joseph but he's pretty much the \"play by the book\" serious guy but he is generally the character to keep most of the cast in check as it were if Joseph is out of commission. Noriaki Kakyouin voiced by Daisuke Hirakawa, a highschooler and once enslaved by Dio but after he switches sides, he has some shining moments but other than that he is mostly the least developed character in the cast, his default personality becomes indifferent but with some strong sense of loyalty but not much after that, again his shining moments helps but still and finally we have Jean-Pierre Polnareff voiced by Fuminori Komatsu, who like Kakyouin was enslaved by Dio, but once he switches sides, he is usually the buttmonkey of the group BUT having the most development, coming in much later in the season all due his revenge of defeating the person who killed his sister which leads into a huge revenge conga line, Polnareff is the biggest butt monkey of the season to the point that he has an affinity to shit (no seriously) throughout the journey but damn if he became memorable VERY quickly after his heel face turn. If there was LA's favorite character then it would be Joseph Joestar, his Engrish one-liners are just sooo funny and Joseph still being badass even after all these years but LA will also mention Polnareff not only for his development as a character but he's closest to an audience surrogate in a ways by the end of it especially concerning the plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nWhere is Dio in all this?, well he's still in the shadows of Egypt and since Dio is essentially throwing his minions to try and kill the group, the true final boss has not shown himself and to be fair LA will say this makes sense as this season is trying to get to Egypt in the first place thus showing him of what he is capable of now would be meaningless, leave the best til last as it were. \\n\\n\r\nSo in terms of the Stands, the Stands at the start, LA saw the Stands are the upgraded manifestation of the Ripple powers and though it isn't explicitly told that it is, early on it makes it out like that, yes the Stands are by the fact a visual manifestation of the user's talent but nonetheless the Stands themselves are an excellent addition to Jojo's, why?, because the Stand Fights themselves is what shines brightest from the previous season of Jojo's before it, it's the adage of \"expecting the unexpected\" and sure LA and probably the audiences knows that the main characters can't exactly die and they will always find the way of defeating the enemy Stand, but it's not the result of each fight where the satisfaction comes in, it's the circumstances and how Jotaro and the group handles the threat throughout is where it comes from not to mention how each of the fights portray itself, as intense, impactful and while it's expositioning what the enemy Stands or their own Stand powers are like, it's just the visceral craziness that just stands out (pun intended but you get the point) and seriously some fights are just batshit insane and Stardust Crusaders wears this on it's sleave 24/7 and KNOWS how to handle it's own craziness. \\n\\n\r\nLA will say the obvious but every time Star Platinum does his ORA! is like the most beautiful sound all because that impact just makes it soo worth it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the Enemy Stands, LA will say that Death was memorable if only because of showing what Kakyouin is made of outside his normal demeanor as well as Hanged Man due to his connection with Polnareff but more so with Justice. The Lovers just showed what would happen if you crossed Jotaro over and over again and the Empress showed off that Joseph still got it. Hol Horse, The Emperor was probably the longest lasting Enemy Stand but he was killed off too soon oddly enough. The only other Enemy Stand that LA actually found not like the rest of the batshit craziness of Stardust would had been...The Sun. Overall the enemy Stands though they have a mixed reaction overall to LA, they were an integral addition to the journey to Egypt, absolutely. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and sound, well like the first season, David Production has the same flair as it's first season right down to the erratic yet purposeful switching of color palettes to show the mood and atmosphere but considering that Stardust Crusaders is showing the world (well mainly East to Middle Asia to United Arab Emirates), the backgrounding has LOTS of great exotic backgrounding work because of this. The character designs are typically distinct as hell and even the crazy facial reactions of the characters (mostly from Joseph but some of the enemy Stands also stands out in this regard) and thus memorable (mainly main cast of course) but like the first season David Production brings back the iconic \u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4 for the visual sound effects and doesn't hold back to the gorey or more bloody fights uncensored and it is fucking glorious AND add in the great impactful sound effects and timing of the OST's to the fights making every Stand Fight to not make you turn away from the screen, it just heightens the Stand fights even more and with David Production's flair it already gave Jojo's only makes the Stand fights even more awesome. What else can LA say but David Production done it again!\\n\\n\r\nVoice work is damn good, with new cast from Unshou Ishizuka as Joseph Joestar, Daisuke Ono as Jotaro, Fuminori Komatsu as Polnareff, Kenta Miyake as Abdul and hell Rie Kugimiya even played a minor role!. But nonetheless though the main cast has a strong voice cast and they \"know\" their roles, LA will say the voice cast in general is just amazing, considering the craziness of Stardust Crusaders, even the enemy Stand user's voice actors ALSO did a great job. Ohh and considering this is Jojo's we're talking about...yeah...it's FULL ham from the majority of the cast but the good ham.\\n\\n\r\nLA threw lots of praise at Stardust Crusaders, but was there any flaws in this first season, if at all?, well not so much actually, as even though the enemy Stands brings up padding bringing up obstacles for Jotaro and the group, it's for the most part showing off how awesome Jotaro or the character that is fighting the Stand look awesome, the padding allowing the main cast to mingle more and grow their camaraderie together as well as individually when the enemy Stand targets them and heck NOT having enemy Stands that blocks the group from Egypt would just make the journey soo bloody easy that this season wouldn't exist in the first place and they would have been in Egypt by the second episode and that would be no fun at all. The only other thing would be toilet humor but to be honest it's fine, adding a bit of comedy to the proceedings that counterbalances the batshit insanity the journey to Egypt entails. So LA really can't find many strong flaws in Stardust Crusaders as it becomes nitpicking than finding flaws in it, not to mention how LA defends those small flaws...Stardust Crusaders' first season is just that good and we're only looking at the \"journey\" portion to getting to Dio!...heck we haven't even touched the \"finding and defeating\" part yet!.\\n\\n\r\nStardust Crusaders' first season though has a simple premise of trying to get to Egypt but enemy Stands stops Joseph and Jotaro at every turn but at the very least, this first season gets us used to the new cast, develop them and get them acclimated to Jotaro and Joseph's cause as well as budding camaraderie with the main cast through their journey making them vastly memorable through the 24 episodes, the Stands and by extension, the fights, the highlights of the first season makes what is a episodic format of facing off against each Stand user \"looks like padding\" but still make the padding enjoyable and batshit crazy awesome in the process and THAT is a hard feat to do and Stardust Crusaders' first season execution in that was done well. So the journey to Egypt was crazy fun, how about the journey to face off against Dio...well that is something LA just can't wait to see and this first season being buildup wasn't a waste of time, no it was an enjoyable crazily fun experience all the way through, LA can't wait to see Battle for Egypt!!!\\n\\n\r\nORA!!!",

            "content": "This is not a great anime. But it's not a bad anime, and if you're a fan of the Jojo series, you should watch it so you can continue the series. \r\nNow I love the Jojo series and I loved Stardust Crusaders Season 2. But in season 1 of Stardust Crusaders, we were introduced to a protagonist who, for the vast majority of the season, is a complete as$hat (pun intended), and we lose Ripple in favor of Stands, which are basically just Personas (as in from the Shin Megami Tensei series). And it made no sense. I mean, Jojo and Polnaref are literally thetwo buffest guys on the show, to the point that their muscles are literally popping out of their clothes, yet their Stands are (1) a punching Stand, and (2) a fencing Stand. You're telling me that Jotaro couldn't have just learned to punch for himself, and Polnaref couldn't put those abs to good use? But the worst thing about Stardust Crusaders Season 1 was it felt so repetitive. The gang was basically just trudging through Storm Trooper after Storm Trooper for so many episodes, and it didn't help that the main characters were so shallow. Jotaro's entire persona can be summed up with \"I'm a badas$,\" and that\u2019s it. This is right after we were treated to the brilliance of a young and charmingly dorky Joseph Joestar, and his Indiana Jones-like action-adventure. The other characters also did not really develop and become interesting until the second season, especially Polnaref. In Season 1, Polnaref was all about revenge, which is such a cheap plot mechanic. I'm so glad the anime moved away from that plot point in Season 2, where Polnaref, and everybody else, really shined. Season 1 mostly felt like filler episodes compared to Season 2, where the characters become much more interesting, the battles become much more creative, and the story kicks it up a notch. So hang in there!",

            "content": "Jojo's bizarre adventure keeps on getting more bizarre and adventurous, but does it get more Jojo? This is part 3: stardust crusaders, which is split in half between 2 seasons, both of which are 24 episodes long, and both of which I'll be reviewing today.\r\nSTORY 3/10\r\nThe story is the bringer of some of the best and worst aspects of this show. This takes place decades after part 2, and depicts an old joeseph joestar, now married with grandchildren. His wife has a curse put on her by the evil, muscular and (not gonna lie) sexy DIO BRANDO. Jojo, his grandson, jotaro and a diverse groupof other people have to travel the world to meet dio and lift this curse, but with a time limit. This sounds excited, right? It is, about a quarter of the time. To put it bluntly, this show doesn't have to be 48 episodes. All but about 10 of these episodes are them encountering a villain-of-the-week, and a majority of them are completely useless. The villains are often throw always, the characters hardly learn anything, and sometimes the plots are downright cringey. With that said, there is a large handful of great episodes that had me laughing my ass off, kept me captivated, or moved the plot (which doesn't happen too much).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 6/10\\n\r\nOh boy there's a lot of them. The main cast of characters can be boiled down to Jojo and his squad. Joseph, jotaro, Avdol, Polnareff, and Kakyoin. Every one of those characters (except for Jotaro) has a large number of episodes centering around them and their mini, solo adventures. That's how the show works, every episode or 2 follows a different character facing off against a villain, using special strategies and personality traits to their benefit, which is a good thing. I love how all of these characters (except for Jotaro) have almost equal attention put on them, as well as distinct personality traits. Now as for Jotaro, I fell like he has the least amount of attention put in him, despite what the openings would show you. He's only important at the beginning and at the end, not to mention he has one of the weakest and hardest to write for personality traits: the badass who doesnt like talking to people. Seriously, I can only describe Jotaro using 1 word: quiet. \\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the character spectrum is the villains. There's a whole lot of them, almost 1 for every other episode. I said before that most of the villains are lazy throw always whose only purpose is to work for Dio and kill the main characters. That's true to 98% of them. All of the villains except for Hol Horse, Boingo, Enya and Dio himself fall under the under-developed villain of the week category. Not to mention that the villains are sometimes so annoying, I have a hard time watching the next episode. On top of things, the main villain of the story is Dio, even though he only does things in about 5 episodes. I constantly feel like the show wants me to fear Dio, but I can't because all he ever does is stand in shadows and hiring assassins every week. Whenever he is shown doing things it's awesome, but I prefer my villains to directly face and intimidate the main characters instead of being someone working behind the scenes, detached from the central plot. Don't get me wrong the Dio fights are amazing, tho.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nOnce again, Jojo proves to have a super unconventional and distinct art style that I love so much. Part 2 was a lot more psychedelic and colorful, but part 3 has character designs as it's strong point. Looking past the fact that every character is unrealistically muscular, they all have a lot of realism. I can see most of these characters fitting into real life. They'd have really weird hair, but they still look more human than some other anime characters (I'm looking at you, Yu-gi-oh).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\r\nJojo's bizarre adventure: stardust crusaders is quite the mixed bag when watched critically, but once you're able to look past the flaws, appreciate it for what it is, then you'll realize the overall greatness of these seasons. Yes, there are some un-watchable parts, and yes the show gets boring and drags on for too long, but the great episodes are worth it alone, as well as the references that spawn from this. You should totally watch this series, but just keep these things in your mind.",

            "content": "Ah Jojo. The mastermind of anime strikes again, this time in its defining season. What happens in this part will impact the rest of the entire series. Part 3 is probably the most popular part of the anime, at least- let's see how it holds up. There will be light spoilers in this. And is kinda a \"should you watch this?\" review, so just stick with me.\r\n/STORY- 7 OUTTA 10 MEMES\\\r\nAs you may have seen, in the previous review, after I finished Battle Tendacy, (Part 2) I was hooked. I wanted more, and I got it. This is JJBApt3, but part 3 itself is intwo parts. Yes, there is another season of SC, but that review is for another day.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, what's the story? Well, JJBA takes another timeskip (as it does 99% of the time) to another Jojo. But let's get the main part of this thing out of the ways first. STANDS. I have to admit, not to exaggerate, but Stands are one of the best things ever created in media, and their idea and concept is amazing. All of them are named/related to songs/albums/bands/covers, so it provides a unique way to make a self-insert if you want to make your own storyline. And Stands are what defined Jojo, still being used in the current part (8).\\n\\n\r\nRemember DIO from part 1? Well, I don't think this is much of a spoiler, because, you know, he's been in every piece of promotional art for this show, but he has been resurrected. He works his magic, and puts Jotaro (the new jojo) 's mother into a coma. So now he, Joseph (who is older now) and a small gang of stand users into a journey from Japan, to Egypt. On foot. And other vehicles occasionally. If they don't crash.\\n\\n\r\nSo in every episode, a new member of DIO's gang will come at the Stardust Crusaders. Therefore, this is a \"villain of the week story\". And yes, I did make a recommendation to another show on this site because of it. While watching this I couldn't help but see similarities to Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu. If you liked this, or want to watch this, I helighly recommend you watch Stardust Crusaders. And if you have watched Stardust Crusaders and haven't seen that show, watch it. Lots of similarities. Even if you don't follow Jojo, but liked one of these two, do it.\\n\\n\r\nSo did I like the story? Yeah I did. I think it wasn't the best, as I felt Parts 1 and especially 2 (my second favorite) were much quicker paced.  I think I definitely would have enjoyed this more if I had watched it while it was airing, but I didn't discover JJBA until pt4 (which by the way is my favorite part). \\n\\n\r\n/ART- 9 STANDOS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the humans is done in the typical Jojo style- same as part 1. DIO (who looked amazing in this by the way) and Joseph's looks have changed, obviously. I think the characters were brighter too, in this portion of the show. Not much to say here that I didn't say I my initial review.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the art for the Stands. The Stands had the best art out of everything. Like I said, they are very unique and define JJBA. Every design is new and different, and Stands can essentially be anything. Of course, this part had the most basic ones, considering this is the first time the series uses Stands. My favorite?\\n\\n\r\n\u300eSILVER CHARIOT\u300f.\\n\\n\r\n/SOUND- 8 OUTTA 10 EGYPTIANS\\\\n\\n\r\nI'll be the roundab- Wait, wrong part. The OP for Jojo had changed once again- this time to the aptly named, Stand Proud. I think both of the original OPs (I'm referring to Sono chi no Sadame and Bloody Stream) were better, and this was probably my second least favorite theme of the show in general. But it was still great, just wasn't my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ED Walk Like An Egyptian was even better.\\n\\n\r\n/CHARACTER- 8 OUTTA 10 STAND USERS\\\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I want to start this off by saying, Stands have no personality. They are just fighters. So the characters are the humans of the show:\\n\\n\r\nJOTARO KUJO: The new Jojo, and main character. He has another different personality than the other Jojos. Definately not my favorite Jojo, but not the worst. None of them are 'bad' per say, I just thought this was my least favorite out of the anime so far. I think he gets better in Part 4 (plus I like his character design better there too)\\n\\n\r\nJOSEPH JOESTAR: \ud83d\udc4c as usual. I explained him in my other review. He hasn't changed much, just he's older now. And I have to admit, despite being \"weak\" I like Hermit Purple's power.\\n\\n\r\nKAKYOIN: I liked him a lot. Not my favorite from this part, probably my third favorite for original characters. Hierophant Green was a sort of forgettable Stand though.\\n\\n\r\nAVDOL: My second favorite character. He was different, and I liked his design. I felt he stood out from the rest the best. I wasn't crazy about his Stand though either.\\n\\n\r\nPOLERNAFF: Hands down, best, dankest character. Everything about his personality was great, and he was the most overall likeable one. Plus, most badass stand, Silver Chariot.\\n\\n\r\nNote: DIO isn't here because he doesn't show up until the second season. There really aren't any main villains for this part.\\n\\n\r\n/ENJOYMENT: 6 CRASHING AIRPLANES OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did really enjoy Stardust Crusaders, I couldn't help but feel that I had more enjoyment in the first season of this show. I thought some parts were well, sort of boring. Like, Death Note (imo read my review) level boring. Granted, it was only about 5 episodes, and I can't even really put my finger on which episodes they were in particular, but I just wanted to get to the next stand. The best moments of the series were the reveal of new stands, but the middle bit before the Stand got defeated, was just boring for the most part. The latter half, SC: Season 2, I feel is much better in this regard (and overall, but that's for another day). So, this being said, I think this series would have been best to watch airing. I think watching SC episode after SC episode, actually detracts from the viewing experience. So if you're reading this review wonder what you should do, I feel it's best to watch only 1-3 episodes at a time, then taking a break ad doing something else on your computer, then opening the tab again, instead of watching 7 in a row like me.\\n\\n\r\n/OVERALL- 7 OUTTA 10 STAR PLATINUMS\\\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, that was the experience for Stardust Crusaders. Overall, do I think you should watch Stardust Crusaders? Yes, yes I do, especially if you loved JJBA Pt1 & 2. I even think SC is fine to watch even if you have no intention of following Jojo (Like not watching what comes before and after) since the formula is much different from parts 1, 2, and 4. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review!\\n\\n",

So much people says than this is a boring story because there's no plotwist, and yeah, all the Anime is dedicated on development and not in execution. Thisis fine for ONE reason:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nPhantom Blood and Battle Tendency characters sucks compared with those characters. Probably Jotaro is not as good as Joseph, but is SO much better than Jonathan because HIS DEVELOPMENT. Jotaro is probably the first JoJo with develop (this is more clear in Diamond Is Unbreakable) and in the meantime, the other characters are good tho (especially Polnareff, than is my favorite escort of the part and a better character than Jotaro).\\n\\n\r\nNothing too much to say. The art and the sountracks are fine (specially the opening) and i actually ejoy the return of DIO and all the mistery envolved in him. In this moment, Stardust Crusaders 1 and 2 are my favorite parts of JoJo like Anime, let's see how the Manga is.",

            "content": "This season of JoJo did not feel as good as the previous season, i.e., Battle Tendencies. While Battle tendencies spiced itself up with a multitude of jokes and bizarre comments and what not, this season lacked in that. \r\nThe only major story development in this season was of them going all the way from japan to Egypt. The first few episodes start off strong and the initial enjoyment is very high, but overtime, one tends to get bored of the constant repetition of things and ideas. \r\nWe got to discover only a few things about the lead characters; we have almost no history and knowledgeabout the character's pasts and what makes them that way. The reason for coming in of the Stands was not defined well enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were amazing, though they lacked when compared to Battle Tendencies. But one major improvement in this series was the animation and the art. The thought put into it was amazing! The artists managed to keep the overly muscular and animated forms and that vintage feel while ensuring that they actually enhanced their animations and art style! That was a commendable action on their part. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the suspense is real! The creators have to slyly managed to hide Jotaro's power from the audience. The only reference to his power in this season is raw strength, which is a great build up for any possible boosts in the next season. Also Dio's face is never shown so that makes the hype much more!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel that this season had way too many unnecessary parts that did not contribute anything to the story but rather pulled it down. Nevertheless, it sets the stage for season 2 of Stardust Crusaders in a rather decent manner.",

            "content": "Well, this review proceeds as follows: I will speak only of these episodes, not the entire saga. Here I will review only the points of this first part of Stardust in anime, that is, it will not enter criticism to the next part, as villains and etc. My review on Part 2 will get all the rave reviews about the entire bow that was adapted from the manga.\r\nStory: Well, here we have something complicated, one point I would like to put about it, is this: the story is not very rich, it is not a bad story, but, it manages to pass the feeling ofadventure very well. In this part of the anime, we have several scenes where they focus on the geographical locations, this is very good, because for an adventure anime this is necessary. The change of scenery, according to the famous places they go by, is something excellent and well done.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the proposed story, she tackles events from part 1, and intends to end the confrontation Joestars vs. Dio. To summarize: Stardust's story in this first part, does not have many deep moments, does not have much development, but ends up hitting the adventure and environmentalism, that is, it is a very medium and fun story.\\n\r\nArte e som: A arte em anime, \u00e9 muito bem feita, e isso foi um acerto muito grande da DP, pois o manga \u00e9 antigo, e seus tra\u00e7os seriam ruins para um anime atual. O anime ainda mant\u00e9m as caracter\u00edsticas do autor, mas com um tom mais moderno e suavizado. A anima\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 ruim\\n\r\nSom: David Productions \u00e9 uma das melhores produtoras quando se trata de efeitos sonoros. Durante toda a parte, temos uma qualidade imensa nas edi\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1udio. As trilhas sonoras n\u00e3o decepcionam, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o sensacionais ou grandiosas. \\n\r\nHere's the point where I really want to talk.\\n\r\nThe characters are not exactly amazing on technical issues, and half of them follow a template created in that saga, the model of facing a \"villain\", he being defeated, and then begin to help the protagonists.\\n\r\nBasically the motivations are not deep, they are not very complex, but they are fun, they work well inside the anime, and they are not incoherent.\\n\r\nWhat I will say now, I will repeat in my next review, the characters of SC, although they are not the best, are the most striking among ALL parts of Jojo's. Maybe this is not a rule, maybe someone has been more captivated by other characters from other parties, but the majority of them are the most charismatic and captivating, talking about secondary characters who are essentially protagonists.\\n\r\nFinally, I had a great time with this first part. It really was a unique and different experience, especially by the author inserting the stands in the manga universe.\\n\r\nWhat you need to expect from SC in this first part is basically a completely different experience from the previous ones (Phatom Blood and Battle Tendency), enemies with miraculating powers, almost always crazy solutions, to defeat the enemies, and a dose of humor that pleases often.\\n\r\nA very average anime, I can not speak much more, because I must remember that this part is one, but in anime, it was divided by technical issues of the producer.\\n",

I liked our villains a lot. much like every character in JoJo's every character is lively and handled in way that doesn't have our boys finishing every fight the same (having certain members present during fights keeps things fresh)and having them outsmarting the villains they encounter is a great game of how far thinking the other is.",

            "content": "After reading Parts 1 and 2 of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure last year, I was really itching to go onto the next part, Stardust Crusaders. I was leaning towards reading them having read the first two, as I heard the original anime of Part 3 was rather off from the original storyline of the manga. Note that I am basing my rating on this for the genre as a whole, not the entirety of anime.\r\nLuckily, as if by fate, I found out that a new anime was being released of JoJo. I also found out about the first 2 Parts, but not until I started watchingit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with protagonist, Jotaro Kujo, residing in a jail cell, having beaten up a bunch of hooligans using a so-called \"Evil Spirit\". His grandfather, Joseph from Part 2, turns up from America with Egyptian acquaintance Muhammed Avdol.  It soon turns out that they he has an spiritual manifestation known as a 'Stand'. \\n\r\nAt this point, I was excited having found out about the series through it's titular bizarreness, the fabulousity and the Stands. It kind of replaces the 'Hamon' power of the last instalments, but makes up for it with awesomely crazy and creative abilities that the Stands have in their arsenal. My only little niggle with this is that I really would have liked to see Hamon brought back into usage along with Stands for a few more creative fighting styles, but seeing as how the stories have played out, I don't really care all that much as it makes sense. 9/10 for Story.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the graphical apparel this show wears...it is brilliant, it's like i'm using a Stand ability myself that allows me to animate manga (and colour it). That may sound really stupid, but it's not far off from some of the techniques utilized by a lot of them. I haven't even watched it in HD and it still looks crisp and detailed on most, if not all of the important scenes and even ones that don't even matter that much. 10/10 for Art.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs pulled an impressive job in this, especially for Jotaro's no-care attitude and especially Joseph's \"OH MY GAARRD!\". Despite it being engrish, due to the theme of the anime, it really made it that much funnier hearing it. Don't even get me started on the Openings. Some might find them lacking, for a lack of a better term, compared to other anime. They WILL get in your head eventually, even if you fight it. \\n\r\nAlso, expect to hear an \"OraOraOra\" every once and a while, it really makes fight scenes satisfying.  Also \"Rerorerorero\" will get you. 10/10 for Sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast really is a big bunch of misfits, with Jotaro as the guy who seriously doesn't want to take any bull from you, Joseph as the wacky grandpa and Avdol as a rather stern and (ironically) cold individual that will still make you laugh. I would say more about the other protagonists, but that may be spoilers to some people.\\n\r\nAside from the main protagonists and the villains, most people don't really have a say in anything and normally end up dying or being pushed aside as something minor. To be honest, I rather like it as it means the story refrains from dragging on or trying to pull out something interesting and then pushing it aside. It helps you to feel more attached to the main lot, anyway. \\n\r\n9/10 for Character.\\n\\n\r\nI seriously couldn't stop watching it. I learned that going to the toilet in certain parts of the world is a no-go, dogs like coffee-falvoured chewing gum and, hey, even Avdol taught me how to drink Chai properly (SPOILER ALERT!). \\n\r\nThe story really keeps you on your toes as to what kind of stand will appear next. Despite the lack of Hamon, it really shows that it was probably the right choice to have more of the Stands instead. 10/10 for Enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed it. It has the laughs, the cool and even the tears. \\n\r\nAll the while remaining perfectly fabulous.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n",

I hated that hamon seemed to have disappeared all together, only being mentioned a few times. It took a long time for the idea of Stands to grow on me, and even now, I only tolerate them. While I think the villain's stands were interesting, I grew bored very quickly with the maincasts Stands. None of them really left an impression, despite their different qualities.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me was the fact that, despite the show being called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Joturo was more like a background character. I'm glad that Joseph was still a part of the show, but shouldn't the other Joestar also be included in more ways than simply saying \"good grief\" over and over?\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, there were good things about this season. I found all of the main characters likable, the art and music was great as always, and I loved the odd humor.  There were many moments that really put the \"bizarre\" in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This season didn't wrap up very well, but I hope season three is better than this one.",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, probably one of the anime I love/hate, hate to love and love to hate the most. Araki's writing has never quite been the most consistent, but god damn does he deliver. JBA has three parts, with Stardust Crusaders being responsible for the introduction of the concept of Stands, as well as the boom in popularity for the series. Divided into two seasons, this is the first half of it.\r\nStory: 4\r\nAraki's writing is not quite the best, with various cliches and inconsistencies, Stardust Crusaders is structured like a \"fight corridor\", as in it is very episodic, where they meet an opponent during thefirst half of a given episode, defeat it in the other, rinse and repeat until a major villain appears. But it still delivers on interesting encounters, and manages to make good use of the concept of stands, which are the anime's concept of \"special powers\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nJojo's art is probably the most beautiful style you'll see. Practically ignoring the style that is present basically everywhere. Able to be both bright and colorful, as well as dark and grim, its extremely versatile. The characters look great, the stands are unique and creative.\\n\\n\r\nBut Jojo still suffers from araki's \"brain farts\", as in characters randomly follow absurd proportions, the infamous \"17 year old who naturally looks like a top tier bodybuilder\", and other visual inconsistencies.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is amazing, with it's openings being praised by the fanbase, and the outro (for the first season) is the famous Roundabout, by none other than Yes. The SFX is well made, with unique sounds for fights. And the Va...well the VA is good, but it has its moments (aka Joseph's engrish being a turn off for some people).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting, but somewhat bland a lot of times, their motivations range from anywhere from \"I want to save my mother from my bloodline's curse\" to \"Yeah, you're a cool guy, I'm with you\". In Stardust Crusaders, the majority of characters feel more like a means to an end, that end being intense fighting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nNot a lot to say here, I really liked it, its unique, it serves well the \"rule of cool\" without being enslaved by it, of course, some problems become glaring at times, which is why I give it an 8, not a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nIf you want amazing action sequences, unique sound design, art style, and a badass power system, then I greatly recommend watching Stardust Crusaders",

            "content": "Warning:\r\nEl Spoilero Minore\r\nOh look it's the third JoJo, the shit one.\r\nOkay, okay I'm just a teeny weeny completely flustered by the amount of bad parts this JoJo series contains.\r\nI oughta start with story this time around, despite story in JoJo being completely overlooked in favor of characters, cause it contains this run's supernatural punch power thingy. This being Stands. Stands are manifestations of one's life force and have special abilities or in some cases they just punch things. In short think Shaman King or Digimon. The story isn't too complex, albeit a bit too much like part one. A colorful group of humans with supernaturalabilities go on a journey to beat up a vampire named DIO facing his lackeys during their way to DIO's doom fortress. Yep it's pretty much Phantom Bloody with more spirit-life force-things and less Hamon, oh and Joseph's daughter named Holy who's dying because of Dio fever(aren't we all?).\\n\r\nThere are two parts of this anime. Pre-Egypt one and Egypt one. Both come with a huge number of enemies with varying Stand powers. It does soon become like Power Rangers with an enemy-of-the-week style of episodes. Now it wouldn't be a problem if we'd at least get a little bit of background on characters, which is a rarity in pre-Egypt , or some time to actually dislike them but it's rather rare that we get that. I'd say first 11 episodes were pretty nice despite some villains suffering from enemy-of-the-week blandness. However after that most of the pre-Egypt one is spent with boring fights. There are two entertaining ones in the form of Death 13 and Judgment. After that we have Egypt. The enemies there have some more characteristics to their characters and overall create more interesting situations. I'll give story a 6 cause it had good bits but it's overall way too flawed. I did get a bit into characters by talking about enemies so let's go down that path and discuss them some more ,cause therein lies the problem methinks. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the main cast. Jotaro is protagonist of this adventure. He's also an obnoxious git that I loathe more than the guy in the pizza shop who always gives me the smallest slice. He's obviously supposed to be misanthropic arse who doesn't give two squirts bout anything especially being courteous. Now granted Joseph was an asshole on occasions but he didn't feel like a sandpaper ball rubbing your prostate trough your bum. Jotaro also has that ,,too cool for you fool,, feeling to him which doesn't help with getting my sympathy. Overall I didn't found anything endearing about him, like Joseph's wisecracking attitude or Jonathan's extreme macho sweat-dripping manliness. But wait he's got a supporting cast of colorful characters too. First in line being Joseph who probably obtained his attire from a certain archeologist. He's less wisecracky this time around but his engrish catchphrases add some, if a bit bothersome, character to him. There's Tyr-... I mean Avdol who's more of a straight character, and that's pretty much it. There's Polnareff who's much more interesting than our protagonist. Polnareff is the one getting into reaaallly weird *cough* bizarre *cough* situations. He also reacts in a more human manner rather than Jotaro's annoying reaction deprived face. There's Kakyoin who has some trippy trips on his own. He and Polnareff are the stars of pre-Egypt part only rivaled with Joseph and Avdol's brotastic adventures. Egypt however kills even those fun parts, excluding an adventure or two Polnareff had. The dialogue goes down to. Mistar Joustaaaarr, OH MAII GOOUD, We have to find Dio, We have to help Holy, Where's Dio, What's that Stand's power.\\n\r\nPretty much the extent of it. It's funny, or annoying, that heroes and villains characters are inversely proportional. Villain's, well most of them, get more depth and heroes lose 90% of theirs.\\n\r\nHere's a 6 for characters cause I enjoyed some of the interactions early on.\\n\\n\r\nArt follows the same pattern as everything else in here. It fluctuates from good to mediocre trough both parts more so in Egypt part than pre-Egypt. And even more annoying is that characters are even more indistinguishable than before, everybody looking exactly the same with the exception of their hair. I won't stick to animation too much but I do think that it deserves an 8. Even at it's lowest point it's better than most animation, and first OP looks like chocolate pudding stripper with cream bikini(take that comparison however you want).\\n\\n\r\nSound. Sound is still JoJo-y and wonderful. Second opening is a poop but first one is the usual blood boiling macho fest. So here's a 9, I'm prepared to forgives some fall outs.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this part but not as much as others. It was a mixed bag of fun, thrilling fights and meh ones. Some were so meh that I lost interest in writing this paragraph preemptively. Here's a 7 cause 8 was a bit too much considering how often they screwed the pooch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is a 7 as this is the worst installment. Now I'd say the biggest problem are characters. The rest was kept on a mostly high note but the character make everything else fall down like a wall of dominoes. If you've seen part 1 and 2 watch this as it does hold some JoJoiness and you might enjoy it more than me. If you didn't watch part 1 and 2 watch them first. And may fortune be always in your favor.",

D for Dissapointment. \r\nAssuming anyone reading this review watched \"Phantom Blood\" and \"Battle Tendency\" already, I'm going to compare these two to \"Stardust Crusaders\". \r\nSo, after this incredible and bizzare adventure show kinda left you hanging with the ending. And you're coming for more... But I want to stop you there. \r\nStory. \r\nIt changes pace immensely, without any warning. It tries to fool you that many, yes, a lot of filler episodes that there is actually mean something. Amazing journeythat you saw in previous show now turned into Dora the Explorer kinda adventure. Sounds fun? Then get used to rambling and many unnessesary situations.\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\n\"Stands were a mistake\" (c) robozaec, 2017\\n\r\nThere is a lot, a f*ckton of characters, whose existense is justified only for making another mindless filler episode. With that big quantity of characters you'd expect a quality loss. And you're right. There are many irritating ones, that make you feel bad even looking at them a couple seconds. And there are whole episodes dedicated to them. Sometimes even two (aka part one and part two). \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, some characters aren't like that, but that's a minority. \\n\r\nOh, silly me, I forgot to mention the star of the show. And you know why I always forget about him? Because JoJo in \"Stardust Crusaders\" doesn't have character. When in PB and BT it always felt like JoJo did what his heart led him to do, or his muscles maybe, while Jotaro acts like a doll. His \"manliness\" and \"dark nature\" seems forced a lot. It seems like director keeps its audience for idiots, and thinks that it's enough to just say, that \"JoJo always used to be a hooligan\". It doesn't work like that.\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nSo, \"Phantom Blood\" and \"Battle Tendency\" made a huge success, they gathered audience, earned enough money to keep show popping and film \"Stardust Crusaders\". And they made... a freaking downgrade? Why would anyone ever do that? Art style is one of the major reasons why fans like this show. And now all characters look like choppy wooden dolls with rectangular faces, scratch marks all over their bodies and enormous shoulders. Nuff said.\\n\r\nOverall, I do not recommend watching this to anybody who enjoyed PB and BT, because if so, you will be deeply dissapointed. Do not be fooled with \"memes\" and stuff, frow now on, they are false advertisement.",
