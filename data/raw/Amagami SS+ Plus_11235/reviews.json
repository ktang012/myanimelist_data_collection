            "content": "Amagami SS+ Plus is the second season to the show Amagami SS. This review will try to cater to any viewer, whether you watched to first season or not. Therefore, there are no spoilers. Also another thing to note, most of this review was formulated before the show finished airing. Because none of my thoughts have changed since the writing of this review to the very end, I added an extra paragraph at the end of my initial review for any thoughts I figured you guys would want to know, rather than rewrite the whole review.\r\nTo recap, let's briefly jump back to the concept ofthe first season. Amagami SS was a story of a guy named Tachibana Junichi that got stood up by his date on Christmas Eve two years ago. In the present, Junichi is very melancholy about his love life, but is presented with many ways to get the date he was never able to get. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story, which runs in omnibus format, is about a guy named Junichi, who technically dates six or seven girls leading up to Christmas Eve. However the story itself runs, in the best way I can describe it, as if it has parallel universes. So no, he is not dating multiple girls at the same time... technically. Specifically, the story, which is divided in to 4 episode arcs per girl, highlights the different stories that come with Junichi's relationships with each of the six girls to hopefully get the Christmas Eve date he was not able to get beforehand. To specify even more, aftereach arc ends, time resets to a time prior to the days leading up to Christmas Eve and another girl gets to be with him.\\n\\n\r\nSaying all that, Amagami SS+ Plus season/show is run in the same format as the previous but in a 12 episode format - 2 episode arcs for each of the 6 girls (though it seems as if MyAnimeList is not that sure of the episode count). The story, while not necessarily kicking off right where each arc in the first ended, adds on to those stories. That said, because of the unique nature of the show, and because it is a direct sequel, going through the first season is a must to watch SS+ Plus.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anyone (those who have not entered the whole series series included), I'll just say that the story is nothing too major, and personally and quite frankly, with the exception of Sakurai Rihoko's arc and maybe one or two more at best that may show up in the next few weeks (the show is still airing at the moment this review is being made), the story is not anything too mindblowing - I cannot stress this enough in this review. As a whole, because of the unique composition of Amagami SS, the second season sort of suffers in that each arc is only composed of 2 episodes. This is frankly not enough to write up any major developments to add to the stories established in the first season. Actually, to put it simply, these episodes were probably made just for the fans who were literally dying to see more of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some of downsides I see to the show, I do enjoy it, but I don't commit to it as much as the richer experiences from other 12 episode shows. You will find some if not most of the happy and romantic qualities that the first season had. In regards to conflicts, they, again, are not as drawn out as well as in the first season, but are a decent watch to say the least. I give the show credit for what its worth.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who watched the first season and liked it a decent amount, I though SS+ Plus was good at best. It did what I expected it to do - maybe it added a bit more depth to each of the characters here and there, but I honestly did not find it that necessary to watch - again, apart from one or two good arcs. That's not saying you shouldn't watch it. It's just saying don't expect too much out of it. If you enjoyed and had fun watching Amagami SS, then SS+ Plus will most definitely be a good watch as well. If you have not watched watched the first season, all I can say is that you will feel completely alienated if you watch SS+. While there is some substance for new viewers, it would probably make you think worse of the show, which is not that fair. Take note of that first season before you judge.\\n\\n\r\n*Update after show's end: I can honestly say that the show overall was good. However most of my thoughts did not change over the course of the three or four weeks since the making of this review. Additionally, I'd like to add that Haruka's arc was, although predictable, a really fun and satisfying arc overall, although I'm not sure if I can agree with the show ending with Miya's mini-arc. If the show ended with Haruka, that would have been much better than dragging along the season longer than it should. If anything, this should have been a DVD/BD extra, not an extension of the season run - but I digress.",

I get attached to the different plot arcs and each of the girls. I also find myself having a very hard time when any of the arcs endings.\r\nTake this for example. In Amagami SS the ending of Sae, Ai, and Haruka were a bit easier to feel \"accomplished\" or that the story had an end. They each ended with a scene that was pretty definitive that Junichi made a home run. I do not mean for this to sound perverted or that I'm asking for a hentai. Ijust want you to consider how in a rout anime such as this, where each girl has only a fraction of the season for their arcs, need to get you attached and leave you fulfilled within that period. (\u301c\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\u301c\\n\\n\r\nWith how much fanservice is given, it does not feel right to end on more of the same. You need to end an arc with something that takes their relationship to the next level. In your average anime these endings would be satisfying indeed. However they get to third base rather quickly in almost every arc before the final episode. \u0ca0_\u0ca0\\n\\n\r\nWith a second season they are giving two episodes to each heroine to basically put the cherry on top of a wonderful story. Or pop it. Pardon my humor, I simply couldn't resist after that being the main topic of my review.\\n\\n\r\nI had much to look forward to, however with Ayatsuji's arc ending I do not feel satisfied. I did enjoy the episodes very muchly. It is just rather awkward because I feel like I'm getting more of the same. (\u30ce#-_-)\u30ce\\n\r\nAgain, not a bad thing. (\uff61\uff61\u30fe)\\n\\n\r\nFIRST ARC TSUKASA AYATSUJI SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nTheir romantic peek was\\n\r\n\"are you happy with just one kiss?\"\\n\r\n\"Baka~\"\\n\r\nVery hartwarming, but most of this anime is hartwarming. I want to burst with glee and satisfaction that the grand tale has ended. Perhaps burst is not the best way to describe such things to the internet... (\u256f\u00b0\u0414\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35/(.\u25a1 . \\)\\n\\n\r\nI am no professional by any means, but I think there are some small tweaks that could have been done to make a perfect grade.\\n\r\nAt the end of the bath scene before the fade-out:\\n\r\nMove the last line before the fade-out! and then\\n\r\n1.) Junichi turn around and hug her\\n\r\n2.) Tsukasa be a bit forceful and push him over\\n\r\n3.) Tsukasa pull one strap of her swimsuit down over her shoulder (I feel like this might be a bit much though)\\n\r\n~fade-out~\\n\\n\r\n(END OF SPOILER)\\n\\n\r\nSome of you may think \"thats it? All this hoopla for you being butt-hurt wishing for 5 more frames?\" It may not seem like much, but just think about it. If those frames were there. Would it change how you feel about the end? Sometimes the smallest changes can have the largest effect. \uff61\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61\\n\\n\r\nI know I cant change what we can expect from the rest of this series, I just wanted to give you something to consider for rout animes. So let us hope for the best, and look forward to the rest of the story arcs. \u30fd(\u00b4\u25bd`)/\\n\r\nPossibly if needed (or if they already plan to) an Amagami SS++ (\uff9f\u0414\uff9f\")\\n\r\nThough I'm not sure my heart could handle it.

            "content": "\"And they lived happily ever after...\"\r\nOften times, many people wonder what happens afterwards. What exactly is \"happily ever after\"? Amagami SS+, the sequel to the school romance anime, Amagami SS, gives viewers a glimpse of the lives of the six heroines after the conclusion of the first season. Not much has changed in between seasons - artwork, characters, seiy\u016bs and staff all remained more or less the same - so fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this continuation. With that being said, although Plus is a sequel, knowledge of the first season is not necessarily mandatory as the basic premise of the story canbe grasped quickly.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nSimplicity is almost always a good thing. Having clean art with a good amount of detail is generally well-accepted, especially when it comes to a series like Amagami SS in which the art is not focused on too much. I found the character designs to be very normal and plain, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The style is something I see very often but that is what makes it easy for my eyes to digest. Backgrounds that are not too fancy which don't detract my attention from what's happening is very much positive. AIC did a great job with the animation once again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nLet's be honest here, the girls of Amagami SS are far from realistic. Now I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure there are barely any girls in the world who would want someone like Junichi as their boyfriend. The guy, in many ways, is the reincarnation of a human male's inner desires; he doesn't know the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Not only that, but he's also a blatant pervert and idiotic protagonist. Despite all this, he ends up getting the girl at the end, which is a big reason why I think the characters are unrealistic. Nonetheless, the girls do develop during their own arcs. You can easily see that, after they started dating Junichi, their personalities have changed. While I would've preferred Junichi to not have been such an irritable character, I believe his current personality was used on purpose, in order to enable viewers of similar traits to be able to relate to him and to gain hope (i.e. \"if someone like Junichi can get a beautiful girlfriend, then so can I!\").\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nazusa returns for a second season with two more new songs - an OP and an ED - both of which I liked. They also fit their respective positions very well; the OP was high-energy, readying the viewer for the episode to come while the mellow ED wrapped out the episode nicely. BGM was the same as in the first season. Nothing in particular was memorable but it was there and did its job of enhancing scenes without being too obtrusive. No changes in voice acting since all the characters are still the same. Notable seiy\u016bs include It\u014d Shizuka (Morishima Haruka, Katsura Hinagiku [Hayate no Gotoku!]), Yukana (Nanasaki Ai, C.C. [Code Geass]), and Sat\u014d Rina (Tanamachi Kaoru, Misaka Mikoto [To Aru Kagaku no Railgun]). Unfortunately, there were no insert songs unlike in season one.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nThe omnibus format follows from the first season into the second. Each girl gets their own two-episode arc that introduces a problem before solving it. The purpose of these problems is to strengthen each of the girls' relationship with Junichi. It's realistic in a sense because real life relationships always contain ups and downs, even if the couple has just started dating. The different stories evoke a wide variety of emotions and appeal to viewers of diverse preferences. Personally, I thought some of the arcs were too rushed as there were only two episodes available for the problem to be introduced and solved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nAs a fan of Amagami SS, I definitely enjoyed Plus. Seeing my favorite Amagami girls in action again was a real treat. I would've liked for it to be 24 episodes but, alas, you can't have everything go your way. At this point, I think it's safe to say that this is going to be the last of Amagami SS, in terms of TV series. It's been a good 38 episodes and I'm satisfied with how things went. I would recommend this show to those who want to watch a nice, relaxing sh\u014dnen romantic comedy. You won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "I'll be writing a review for this because I absolutely fell in love with this series. \r\nAlso, this review will be for both seasons. \r\nThere will probably be spoilers. \r\nAmagami SS and SS+ Plus is a story about Tachibana, Junichi. A young man who got stood up on a Christmas date, leaving him traumatized and afraid to fall in love. Two years later, he'll encounter a certain woman. A woman who'll bring him back up to his feet and learn to love once again.\r\nAmagami SS is based on a PS2 Dating sim and is viewed in an omnibus format. Basically, there are 4 episodes (Forthe first season) for each of the 6 heroines and those 4 episodes tell what happens if Junichi goes after a specific girl. \\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS+ is the second season and it shows the events that took place after each of the first season's arcs. So I suppose you can say it's basically an epilogue to the first series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty much cliche. But I can't really blame anyone. The series is based off a dating sim. A traumatizing event in the past like that has probably been used before in other dating sim/anime. But I do find each of the story arcs to be romantic, cute and sweet (Except for Rihoko's first season arc. I was quite disappointed they didn't end up with each other. The second season Rihoko arc makes up for it though) The show is pretty light on the heart and it doesn't cause much heart-wrenching feels (Which is good in my case 'cause I have a weak heart)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are enjoyable in their own way. They're pretty unique from each other and each of them has their own charm. Though I have to say Junichi is a tad bit generic. He's the average high-school student. But as each story develops, he does get a bit unique (Depending on which story arc he's in) But I like him. He's childish, supportive, loving, caring, a bit clueless, reckless and he'd go out of his way to make the girl he loves happy. He reminds me of me, sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. Though the quality of the art did drop at certain points like at the start of Nakata, Sae's arc. The animation is pretty smooth. No complaints there. The sound and the voice acting was also very good. I especially loved Morishima, Haruka and Tachibana, Miya's voice acting for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite heroine will have to be either Sakurai, Rihoko or Tanamachi, Kaoru. Rihoko is bubbly cute and adorable. She's innocent and honest and has a big appetite. Kaoru is mischievous but also very hardworking. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a pretty enjoyable anime. Cute romance here and there. Some slight feels, but that makes the romance all the more satisfying. And you'll enjoy each of the heroines arcs because their own stories are pretty unique from one another. \\n",

Alright.\r\nThere's a nice mini-story for each of the girls, which serve to more fully flesh out their relationships with Junichi. Honestly, these episodes should have been stuffed into the first season to make things feel more complete.

Try it out.\r\nThe art still has megoing \"meh.\" The background art is completely fine, but I just straight up dislike the art style for the characters. Meh. Same as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much the same as the first season, but it's nice to see how they get along with Junichi after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the first one. If you really liked Season 1 of Amagami SS, you'll love this season. If you didn't, Season 2 might redeem it for you, but probably not. If Season 1 was Oreos, Season 2 would be the milk. A typical vanilla cake of an anime with cute sprinkles on top gives Amagami SS+ Plus a final score of 7.",

However, the story seems like it will take a differant route from the first season's \"getting the girl and their future\" to a more \"events between getting the girl and their future.  Since we know the series will be only 12 episodes long, it is indicated by the words \"first and second -half\"  in the title of the first episode andpreview that each of the 6 female protagnists will likely be 2 episdes each.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a second season, I feel it would be necessary to watch the first season since it seems like they are futher building on the chracters and teir relationships from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was very well done with the typical boyfriend/girl friend interation and ecchi shenanians between them, but there is an added tension thanks to he addition of side charcters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story tus far is good in that it is conistant with the first season story line with a few more plot twists now that the main storyline isnt about trying to get te girl. The art is pretty much the same as the first season, but still great.  The sound in my opinion is better and the op and ed songs are fitting. The charactes are still as entertaining as ever thus making it fairly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the first espisode really leaves a great impression and makes you want to watch more to see what drama will unfold, thus making it a must see; especially if you were a fan of the first season and and even if you werent you should still give it a shot.",

Each included story, as has been said, details the afterevents some months further along, of the main protagonist's (Tachibana Junichi) choices in selecting each of the first series' heroines. While I found nothing particularly thrilling or disappointing in the stories themselves, I thought it rather confusing that, after being in a close(very, in some cases) relationship with most of the girls for an extended period of time, why they (mostly Junichi) still behave as if they barely know each other? The awkwardness, shyness, nervousness, and general elements of inhibition were typical and expected in the first series, as Junichi got to know each of the girls, but why are these feelings replayed almost exactly the same way again? This is particularly evident with Junichi; in this respect, I found his behavior almost unbelievable, and definitely unrealistic. Perhaps with only two episodes per character, there's just not enough explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I really did like the way that some of the visual novel endings based upon the first series, that did not appear in the anime of said series, found their way into this anime series. With both animes watched a few times, my ideas about the best girl for Junichi haven't changed: Kaoru.",

I mean, come on. who doesnt like to see a MC dating into 6 six different girls and see the lovey dovey talks between them? and absolutely i am the one who lovesto see MC dating into the girl who bump into him. The main point is the story  in this anime is so unique, you wouldn't find an anime like this anymore.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK 10/10\\n\r\nLike i said before, this artwork is the reason why i am watching this anime. the artwork for the people or the scenes is absolutely stunning (especially the girls, lol), The characters are drawn good, it was very interesting to see.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\r\nI really love the opening song from Amagami SS plus, its certainly presents the story, and also the voice for the character is also lovely, its just the seiyuu really putting their feelings in the actor, oh, the background music is also really fit with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nThe character of this anime is the first one i caught. the six different girls with different characters and also the main character guy who is have the same feeling with the real man (like have a naughty thinking), The interesting point is which the feelings that the MC has is like the other us. We, man, always have a dirty thinking if we're alone with the girl. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nI really recommend to all people who loves to see a light love story,without any complex story to see this anime. you didnt have to think too much when you see this anime. you just need to enjoy the show and said \"Wow, Thats very lovely\"\\n",

The plot continues the same but with a continuation that surpasses its predecessor Each part of a heroine speaks of the relationship of a boy with a different girl, type a universe for each type of relation of the protagonist with a heroine. This is cool because this anime does not deal with treason much less than harem. This is a girl with a certain personality to make a pair with him. It still remains as an anime with a light storyline, good moments of laughter and striking endings for each heroine, and maybe better than others.\\n\\n\r\nThose who watch will be able to select their best story and their best plot for themselves, without needing to get into controversial issues of who is the best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS + Plus elevou ainda mais o n\u00edvel de sua premissa. O enredo continua o mesmo por\u00e9m com uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o que supera o seu antecessor Cada parte de uma hero\u00edna fala da rela\u00e7\u00e3o de um rapaz com uma garota diferente, tipo um universo para cada tipo de rela\u00e7\u00e3o do protagonista com uma hero\u00edna. Isso \u00e9 bacana pois este anime n\u00e3o trata de trai\u00e7\u00e3o muito menos de har\u00e9m. Trata-se de uma garota com uma determinada personalidade para fazer um par com ele.

It would have been better if they had done 4 eps per arc again as they did originally as i feel they would have been able to tell more like they did in the original and like i said to me it feels a bit rushed. \r\nAlso it wouldhave been nicer if it was longer and should more of a development in there relationships, because from what i have seen so far even though something like 6 months or so has past, they still seem like they just recently got together.\\n\\n\r\nIt would have been interesting to see there relationships development after the first season as was said was about getting the girl.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I'm saying i wished it was longer and that they put more into the story it is still very good and would recommend watching this and the first season. I can only hope that they make a third season that is more like the first and that this is just a in betweener for that season were they can show them getting further in there relationship and maybe getting past difficult obstacles or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nWell here's hoping. :)",

The fun keeps on coming.\r\n Amagami SS+ plus continues the love story of each of the 6 main girls with a boy named Junichi.

AIC have founda very clever way doing this.\\n\r\nThey just do the same they do in eroge games.

            "content": "It's very surprising to me,when I read the information at MAL that the second season of Amagami SS was planned back then.I mean,well...the story still can be developed remembering the previous season leave us when Tachibana Junichi still at 2nd grade,but it really is still surprising.Why?Cause this anime's storyline goes in a same situation,setting,and time but it kept repeated with the same male character with six different heroine and in several heroine,we can watch a glimpse of their future after the male character conquered their heart.So,will it be wright to make a sequel of it,despite we already watch their future self?The answer is YES.It fulfillmy high expectation.To be honest,the word sequel itself is a bit worry me.We can see many anime quality drop instantly after their sequel was aired and it's often that the previous season quality was much better than the next.Amagami SS first season itself,for me,was quite impressive.Well,it's a bit like playing an automatic visual novel,but it still good.Six girl with a unique and different character from each other,yeah that's what made this show interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo,basically Amagami SS+ is the continuation of the story from the first season.The times set\\n\r\na several month after Tachibana Junichi confess his love to each heroine.I'm a bit confused\\n\r\nabout how to make this review since I'm usually make a review mainly based on the plot.\\n\r\nBut,this one is exceptional cause it has six different plot.So I will review it from the each heroine\\n\r\ncharacter and their development after the previous season.About Tachibana?Well just ignore\\n\r\nhim.His stil as pervert,dull,stupid,and useless as usual.Oh god,what kind of Lady Luck that\\n\r\npossessed this extremely lucky dude?All he's thinking about is how to get a quick and nice\\n\r\nsex with all of the heroine.And what makes me despise him even more,all of the heroine almost\\n\r\nalways agree to his stupid pervy request from time to time like,\"May I sleep on your belly?\",\\n\r\n\"Can I kiss your knee?(in season one)\".What the hell,fuck!Girls,please don't be a slut.\\n\r\nIf they gonna make the third season of Amagami SS,I'm personally request his death.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the action and the development of their relationship come from the heroine.It looks\\n\r\nlike they encouraging Tachibana to take a deeper action cause he's way too dull to be a boyfriend.In this 2nd season the amount of the episode has been reduced to only 13 episode.So each arc have two episode and one addition for a filler in the last episode.Not much different from the previous season actually,eventhough it has a shorter episode,but I do like this one better.The heroines are way more attractive and responsive than in the first season.It make them a lot more appealing.Maybe it's because they already in a phase where they've become a lover so they can talk about their feelings more seriously and honestly than before they date each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's continue to the heroines character.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit change in the second season.The arc got a reverse in their turn to appear at\\n\r\nthe show.So,Tsukasa is the first one and Haruka is the last one.\\n\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa Arc:\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge the book by its cover.I bet you know this phrase already.It suit Tsukasa extremely\\n\r\nwell.On her outer appearance you can see her as a respectable person,nice,perfect,and a hardworker.But after you succeeded to penetrate her heart,you will get a shocking turn around in her attitude.She's a dominant and an oppressor.There's not even a single guy in the world want to be dominated by their girl so badly.And what makes it worse,she elected to become the student council president which make her bossy attitude become worse.She express her love to Tachibana with her cynical behavior.To be honest,I do like her figure.Long black silky  hair,a pair of gorgeous black eye filled with spirit,slim body,and a pretty nice breast eventhough it's not too damn big.\\n\\n\r\nI guess what make this anime rated under 8 point is because of her.She make this show drop\\n\r\nin its content.Want to know why?Here's my three reason:First,she's way too dominant.Second,\\n\r\nshe's a hot girl but she's not cute.Three,her arc is boring.I feel like a de ja vu when I\\n\r\nwatch her arc.Not particularly too different from the first season so it's kinda plain.\\n\r\nShe got a job and position and Tachibana help her with her job,they got into an obstacle,\\n\r\nthey quell it and voila,the ending kiss!I will give this arc approximately a 3 or 4 for the\\n\r\noverall point.Tsukasa did NOT satisfy me.\\n\\n\r\nSakurai Rihoko Arc:\\n\\n\r\nHmm,what will I say about Rihoko.Everytime I look in her eyes I always remember about my dog.Suppose she's not a glutton and have a very strict diet to lose her weight,maybe I will lost\\n\r\nmy interest to her.Her chubbyness is so sexy and it's so appealing.Forget about her breast\\n\r\nfor a moment and you will find an innocent,pure,and cute 10 years old girl.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say that her arc is good but it's not bad either.It's fine.In her arc,you will watch\\n\r\nher act very unadorned and hesitating about how she will deliver her feeling toward Tachibana.\\n\r\nThe ending is too simple and meh meh meh.So I will give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nNanasaki Ai Arc:\\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me about which heroine love Tachibana the most,I will say it's Ai.If I were looking\\n\r\nfor a girlfriend,I'm definitely will searching for someone with her character.Well,isn't it obvious\\n\r\nthat she will give Tachibana a lot of love??Her name itself is Ai (love).A sporty girl,with\\n\r\na tomboyish appearance.But don't be deceived,she's very soft and fragile inside.She's the opposite from Tsukasa.The only thing that bother me about her is why did the creator made her to be the one with the flattest breast?The other heroine seems pretty stuffed,especially Rihoko,Haruka,and Sae.Kaoru and Tsukasa is a mediocre.And Ai is the most pitiful in the boob ratio contest.\\n\\n\r\nIn her arc in Amagami SS+,Ai and Tachibana couldn't meet each other too much cause Tachibana in a busy term to prepare for college.She feels very lonely when Tachibana is not in her side.Oh poor Ai.Eventhough she looks very sad and crying,she's still look pretty and try \\n\r\nto face it rigidly.I like her faithfullness for Tachibana in this arc,so I will give it 8.\\n\\n\r\nTanamachi Kaoru Arc:\\n\\n\r\nI love it!Probably the girl that I like the most,wrapped with the nicest story.Did you realize\\n\r\nthat Kaoru is the only arc where its setting is off from the school?That's what make this\\n\r\narc the greatest.It is an anime with a school as a main setting but it's not a rule to make\\n\r\nthe story always take place in the school right?Kaoru's arc definitely gives a refreshing air\\n\r\nto me.The story feels like going very natural and smooth.It gives you something new.\\n\\n\r\nWell,shortly the couple decide to take a vacation together in order to develop their relationship\\n\r\ntoward something more serious.Because they short in money,finally they decided to take\\n\r\na cheap and fun night touring in a bus.Then,funny and complex thing started one after another.Face it with a love power guys,and you will get a well deserved ending.\\n\\n\r\nTwo things that I love from Kaoru: First,she's very energetic and sometimes a bit bold and\\n\r\ndaring.I like this side of Kaoru.There's not much girl out there like her in this era.\\n\r\nShe can live the situation up anytime,anywhere with her action.Second,she's a talkative girl.\\n\r\nI like talkative chick cause they can talk their heart content honestly and they can be\\n\r\nso pure and it's nice to share our mind with a girl like Kaoru.This is the funkiest arc.She's cute,her attitude is great,her hair is sexy,so I will give Kaoru 10.\\n\\n\r\nNakata Sae Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThis heroine.....an angel I guess.Always positive and always looks adorable and super cute.\\n\r\nNot to mention her bust super size.I will like her if she's act a bit more of her age.\\n\r\nSeriously,she really like a kid.Her gesture,her voice,her hair,and her way to talk.Way too\\n\r\ncute for a highschool student.But that doesn't matter anymore.Her arc is one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nIn this Arc,Nakata Sae will be tested to be a leader.She will handle the founder festival\\n\r\ncommittee.Well,she indeed showing a progress from the previous season.She doesn't see\\n\r\nthe cafeteria lady as a vending machine anymore (lol,I wonder why it have to be a vending \\n\r\nmachine?).But realizing her lack of social interaction in her community,Miya,her best friend,\\n\r\nwhom also Tachibana's little sister,decided to vote her to become the leader of the founder\\n\r\nfestival community.It sure not an easy problem.Her maturity and sense of responsibility really\\n\r\nis developing very well in this arc.We can see from her dedication,she really into this and don't\\n\r\nwanna let everyone down.Tachibana was really useless in this arc.He wasn't help Sae at all.\\n\r\nFor me,he even adding another trouble for Sae.Yeah,he did something unnecessary as the narrator said.I won't say what cause I'm afraid I'll spoil it.Watch the show and you will know that I didn't say anything wrong about Tachibana being so damn useless.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Tachibana's foolishness,this arc is good.But actually,I want more of her breast\\n\r\nexposure.I will give it 8.\\n\\n\r\nMorishima Haruka Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThe hottest girl among the heroine.Ohh,she really is sexy.Look at her beautiful black hair.\\n\r\nIt's very smooth and a bit wavy touch on the tip of it makes it even better.Really an ojou-sama\\n\r\ntype of girl.And her bright blue color of her eyes make her always looks energetic.A british-\\n\r\njapanese mix.What a nice combination wasn't it?\\n\\n\r\nI think that the probability of a guy like Tachibana dating a girl like Haruka in the real\\n\r\nworld is about 0,00000001%,except if you are lucky enough to bump her in front of your class\\n\r\nand \"accidentally\" groping her breast and triggering a flag with her like in a generic\\n\r\nromance anime :p.To be honest,I like this arc second best to Kaoru's.The reason is:\\n\\n\r\n1.Haruka didn't exaggerate and too aggressive in expressing her love to Tachibana.She act\\n\r\nmore of her age and show a calm love plus maturity in facing Tachibana.\\n\\n\r\n2.There is an appearance of girl who claim to be Haruka's relative from England.She really\\n\r\nlooks like Haruka except for her eyes and hair color.It's a british mode of Haruka.That's\\n\r\ndouble kawai,made me enjoy the arc even more.Her Japanese-British accent really cute.\\n\\n\r\n3.Finally,Tachibana got his ball as a man.You will see why at the end of the arc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great arc,so I will give it 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for Amagami SS+ it's 9 for me.Well,it's not actually far better than the first season.\\n\r\nIn fact,you will get a pretty much the same feeling from watching it.I don't even know why I\\n\r\ngive it a 9 :p.But if you are looking for a nicer and clearer ending in each of the arc,this is it for you! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Only 2 series for each heroine is too few to create some intriguing plot, however there are still decent plot twists in some of the arcs. To be honest its difficult to distinguish 2nd season of Amagami as separate anime and not just a few extra episodes to 1st season. In this spotlight you can actually like it, but still it feels more like some extra not the standalone product",

            "content": "A great expansion to the already very well done first season, amagami SS+ takes two more episodes for each character and expands on what happens in their relationship in the year following the first season.\r\nI wasn't expecting a second season that was quite as good as the original, but I was very surprised. Amagami SS+ has everything the first season had going for it, on a more compact scale. It is just as good in terms of art and sound, but due to the mere length story is a bit less deep. It still comes very close to being just as great as the firstseason, which makes it a worthy second season in my books.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8/10 -Once again adopting the GREAT idea of an omnibus format(in harem animes, where the guy has arcs in which it treats it as if he chose a different girl, so every girl has their special romantic scenes), Amagami SS+ keeps that great romantic harem anime feel going. A standout in most recent harem series, anything within the Amagami series is is a must watch for harem anime fans looking for something recent. Amagami is not really a life changer, like some epic animes are, but it really does well at what it is-a realistic story of romance, in which the guy DOES NOT have that stupid stereotype of harem leads that DONT WANT the girls. He wants what any man would want, and often makes deals with the girls like \"I will do this if you kiss me.\" That's a breath of fresh air, because as a guy myself I know I wouldn't shun sexuality like 90% of harem leads stereotypically do. Each story for each girl has its own romantic style, and every couple of episodes you get something different, which makes for a very interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 - In terms of harem anime, this one is up there. It isn't quite as masterful as the works of Key, but it definitely has a high level of animation. Girls are natural in appearance, most are quite imperfect even. Hair colors are realistic (although I have no problem with exotic coloring), and this makes for a lifelike anime that has very down to earth appearances, giving a feeling of \"this really is a type of romance that could happen in real life, awww\". Amagami SS+ tends to have very realistic movements and reactions of the female characters, such that based on their personality, what they do with their face and actions while talking suits it. This is an underappreciated trait many animes don't have, and you can see this trait is in SS+ right away just by watching the opening animation, and seeing how they introduce each girl visually. Each one doesnt even speak a word and you can sense how they act and what their personality is just by their posture, movement, or grace. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 - In my opinion, the music took a slight dip in quality since the first season. The OP and ED are nonetheless fitting, but they aren't something I would download and keep in my library. As well, they did not have a separate ending for each character in the anime during each of the arcs. This is something I really liked about the first season, and it is understandable to not want to make a new ending theme every 2 episodes for this season. Still, in comparison to the first season, the music within SS+ is a little bit lacking because of this, but it still is fitting, which is the most important part of sound. Character voices are supremely fitting. They sound like they should, and articulate as they should. The main character's sister has such a fitting voice, it pretty much blows my mind. They also have their own \"tendencies\", which makes them all the more realistic. For example, Miya (the main char's sister), has this tendency to laugh in an odd way, sounding like \"Ni-shi-shi\". This gives characters an identity that can differentiate them from many other animes just by hearing them, without visuals. Having something like that is rare, and awesome. I know most characters would be confusing to guess if I only heard their voice, but many Amagami voice actors would be recognizable just because the characters have such unique voicing methods.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10 -  This is the very best part of Amagami, for season 1, and season 2, the characters have been the complete drive for me to watch it. They have such realistic personalities, that I don't think I have seen any harem anime with more lifelike female characters within it. If you are a guy, just think of a crush you had in real life, and more than likely, someone within SS+ will be so much like that girl that you will wonder how they came up with each so well. \\n\\n\r\nA personality example would be: girl who is fairly normal in appearance and constantly worried about her weight, is also a childhood friend (honestly, you would NEVER see such a realistic thing as to worry about weight or be imperfect in most animes. She has larger hips than 90% of harem leads, but nonetheless she models a beautiful character based on personality that people are surprised to find themselves lusting after even though she is not a complete bishoujo.) \\n\\n\r\nAnother example would be a student council leader who seems like the standard perfect, sort of strict, and formal girl, at first appearing like the stereotypical Inchou that the main character ignores in most harem animes. As the guy gets to know her, he finds that the girl is very particular and on the inside has a fierce sense of independance. She is in search of love, but does not want that person she falls in love with to think of anyone but her. She has a fiery personality, and this is extremely surprising but somehow seems like it was the way class reps should have been like in every harem anime. Whereas most relationships in harem anime are on a \"say something sexual, get embarrassed\" level, the relationship the guy has with this character is on a more serious level, such that she sometimes says sexual things without even a blush, and the guy might ask her about something sexual and she won't even be phased. This is something you typically don't see at all in this genre. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10 - Despite continuing the story from first season, the short 2 episode arcs will often leave you wanting more. Each arc ends in a pretty fitting way, but even so I found that I wish there could have been a bit more fleshing out of the arc. This is what happens with a shorter set of episodes than the first season, but despite knowing I can't have everything, this will not stop me from wanting it. In comparison to the first season, my enjoyment of the second has been a bit lower, but not by a huge amount. It's still a great show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - Not a complete legend within harem anime, but undoubtedly a defining series in the genre. Never before have characters been modeled in such a real way. It is worth watching just to see the realism of the personalities each character has. After seeing the first season, there is absolutely no reason to ignore the second, as it provides just about everything good in the first, on a smaller scale, while continuing the story.",

            "content": "This review covers Amagami SS+, as well as the first season. It is also spoiler free.\r\nAmagami SS is a series that tries to play romance in a different way using an omnibus format. Unfortunately it fails to deliver engaging, interesting, or otherwise fun stories for the viewers.\r\nDespite the low rating I'm giving this series, I wouldn't say I hate it - I just find it incredibly boring.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThis is a romance anime in an omnibus format. If you are not familiar with that term, it means that there are many girls and many arcs, and each girl gets her own arc. You can think of eacharc as a parallel universe because they have their own endings and there's no continuity between each arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Because of this, it's hard to rate the story as a whole, but we can talk about the arcs on average. Each arc is 4 episodes long in the first season, and the second season has continuations to each arc that are 2 episodes long. Unfortunately none of the arcs are really that interesting. Everything always goes well. They don't really take the time to develop any kind of drama, and if they do, it gets resolved really quickly, failing to justify the length of each arc. The romance is poorly done in each arc - it just isn't interesting. In fact, there's situations when it can actually be creepy and overdone. And one thing that is particularly jarring is that the arcs take place in the same timeframe every time, the main character has the same backstory in all of them, and they always end in the same event, with it just playing differently. You will probably find yourself rolling your eyes each time they repeat what happened to the main character at the beginning of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor falls on its face most of the time. It doesn't come off as natural, and it just follows the typical troupes you would find in a romance comedy anime. There are some exceptions to this, but in general, the humor is not well done.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that can be highlighted from this show is the art. While this part of the review can only be objective, I really enjoyed the character design. The girls just look really cute, and the backdrops are detailed. They didn't slack off in this area.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special. If you have played VNs, you will notice that it has that same \"type\" of music. In the first season, each ending was sung by the main girl of the arc. Sometimes they were OK, sometimes they were average. They were never BAD, but I wouldn't say music was this anime's biggest department.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nSo the character design is nice, but I have mixed feelings regarding their personalities and interactions. I think most of the characters, other than the MC, can actually be pretty likable on their own, but everything falls to the ground when they start interacting with each other, or at least when they interact with the MC. I wish we could see each character do their own thing a bit more often without having to involve the MC so we can get a better idea of what they are like. Many characters have good backgrounds, interesting personalities, and hobbies. But we can never see that because the series doesn't take the time to develop each character. When one of the girls show up, the MC is almost guarantee to be with them, and if they don't they aren't doing or talking about anything important.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, how I rate an anime is mostly decided by how much I enjoyed it. It can have the nicest art in the world or the most bombastic music ever, but if it wasn't enjoyable, it's rating will go down.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Amagami SS fails to deliver any kind of enjoyment. With the comedy failing to deliver, the romance being so poorly done, and the character development being boring and mostly non existent, I found myself checking how much left of each episode was left when I was watching it. This is never a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely find it hard to justify a score bigger than 2. The biggest problem with this anime is how the arcs develop and they always end up being boring. If you want to watch a romcom, rest assured the market is full of them, and only watch this when you have exhausted all your options.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS had a great cast of girls to work with and it always left itself on a high note (well...5/6 times, anyways). Amagami SS+ though....while not bad (I've seen much worse in the harem genre), doesn't quite hit all the sweet spots that it's prequel series did.\r\n(+) The animation was top notch and the character designs look a lot nicer. Even with whatever qualms I have with the stories, seeing the followups on the girls is really nice. I LOVED Haruka's story and it was easily the best one, including that ending. The secondary characters were just as fun as they were before. Andwe totally need more Jessica and Risa. :)\\n\\n\r\n(-) On the whole, I only really enjoyed one out of six scenarios, which is a little sad honestly. Just a quick thought on each of them: by far the worst was Kaoru's, since it seemed to diminish her likability in some ways. Sae's was just too weird and overly cutesy, but not terrible. Ai also lost some likability, but still kept her personality as fun as before. Rihoko got a nice resolution that I think everyone wanted. Finally, Tsukasa's (is a lovely person with nothing to hide, I swear!) was good, but it didn't work her personality into it very well.  \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, while not as charming as the first series, it's still a nice followup to the omnibus Amagami that came before it. :)\\n\\n\r\nAs a little side note, here's a most-to-least favorite list of the girls routes this time around:\\n\\n\r\n#1. Haruka\\n\r\n#2. Tsukasa\\n\r\n#3. Rihoko\\n\r\n#4. Ai\\n\r\n#5. Sae\\n\r\n#6. Kaoru",

            "content": "Amagami SS+ Plus is the sequel of Amagami SS+. The series is more of a side story than continuation of the first season but still gives the excitement that made us want more of Amagami.\r\nStory:\r\nThe set-up of the story is the same as the first season where it is divided into story arcs focusing on one heroine. The sequence is different in the first season whereas the last heroine covered is the first one in this sequel. As I stated before, this more of a side story in which they show different events happening after the end of each arc on the first one. Isay it is more of a side story because there is not much development that may affect the series. But even though it is a side story, it is still good because it shows the lax side of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere is not much difference in the art as the first season. It is still good. The design of the heroines is the one that really stands out in the series which helps in rooting for the one. The backgrounds are also good but you most of the time, you will focus on the heroines instead.\\n\r\nAnd wait, there are also fanservice if you are into that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are both good. They may not be as good as the first season but you can still enjoy it. It is perfect for this series. The soundtracks for the scenes are also good that it helps in taking the emotions out of you. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe set of heroines are good given that there are many of them. They have different personalities that you may love or hate. In terms of character development, there is not much of it. Their traits are almost the same thing that we know in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you watched the first season and you want more, this is a good watch as it extends the story of each heroines. It may not contain a lot of development but it is still enjoyable. The stories may give yo a few laughs and gives an excitement that you want for romantic story.",

            "content": "Amagami SS+ Plus is the second season to the show Amagami SS. This review will try to cater to any viewer, whether you watched to first season or not. Therefore, there are no spoilers. Also another thing to note, most of this review was formulated before the show finished airing. Because none of my thoughts have changed since the writing of this review to the very end, I added an extra paragraph at the end of my initial review for any thoughts I figured you guys would want to know, rather than rewrite the whole review.\r\nTo recap, let's briefly jump back to the concept ofthe first season. Amagami SS was a story of a guy named Tachibana Junichi that got stood up by his date on Christmas Eve two years ago. In the present, Junichi is very melancholy about his love life, but is presented with many ways to get the date he was never able to get. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story, which runs in omnibus format, is about a guy named Junichi, who technically dates six or seven girls leading up to Christmas Eve. However the story itself runs, in the best way I can describe it, as if it has parallel universes. So no, he is not dating multiple girls at the same time... technically. Specifically, the story, which is divided in to 4 episode arcs per girl, highlights the different stories that come with Junichi's relationships with each of the six girls to hopefully get the Christmas Eve date he was not able to get beforehand. To specify even more, aftereach arc ends, time resets to a time prior to the days leading up to Christmas Eve and another girl gets to be with him.\\n\\n\r\nSaying all that, Amagami SS+ Plus season/show is run in the same format as the previous but in a 12 episode format - 2 episode arcs for each of the 6 girls (though it seems as if MyAnimeList is not that sure of the episode count). The story, while not necessarily kicking off right where each arc in the first ended, adds on to those stories. That said, because of the unique nature of the show, and because it is a direct sequel, going through the first season is a must to watch SS+ Plus.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anyone (those who have not entered the whole series series included), I'll just say that the story is nothing too major, and personally and quite frankly, with the exception of Sakurai Rihoko's arc and maybe one or two more at best that may show up in the next few weeks (the show is still airing at the moment this review is being made), the story is not anything too mindblowing - I cannot stress this enough in this review. As a whole, because of the unique composition of Amagami SS, the second season sort of suffers in that each arc is only composed of 2 episodes. This is frankly not enough to write up any major developments to add to the stories established in the first season. Actually, to put it simply, these episodes were probably made just for the fans who were literally dying to see more of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some of downsides I see to the show, I do enjoy it, but I don't commit to it as much as the richer experiences from other 12 episode shows. You will find some if not most of the happy and romantic qualities that the first season had. In regards to conflicts, they, again, are not as drawn out as well as in the first season, but are a decent watch to say the least. I give the show credit for what its worth.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who watched the first season and liked it a decent amount, I though SS+ Plus was good at best. It did what I expected it to do - maybe it added a bit more depth to each of the characters here and there, but I honestly did not find it that necessary to watch - again, apart from one or two good arcs. That's not saying you shouldn't watch it. It's just saying don't expect too much out of it. If you enjoyed and had fun watching Amagami SS, then SS+ Plus will most definitely be a good watch as well. If you have not watched watched the first season, all I can say is that you will feel completely alienated if you watch SS+. While there is some substance for new viewers, it would probably make you think worse of the show, which is not that fair. Take note of that first season before you judge.\\n\\n\r\n*Update after show's end: I can honestly say that the show overall was good. However most of my thoughts did not change over the course of the three or four weeks since the making of this review. Additionally, I'd like to add that Haruka's arc was, although predictable, a really fun and satisfying arc overall, although I'm not sure if I can agree with the show ending with Miya's mini-arc. If the show ended with Haruka, that would have been much better than dragging along the season longer than it should. If anything, this should have been a DVD/BD extra, not an extension of the season run - but I digress.",

I get attached to the different plot arcs and each of the girls. I also find myself having a very hard time when any of the arcs endings.\r\nTake this for example. In Amagami SS the ending of Sae, Ai, and Haruka were a bit easier to feel \"accomplished\" or that the story had an end. They each ended with a scene that was pretty definitive that Junichi made a home run. I do not mean for this to sound perverted or that I'm asking for a hentai. Ijust want you to consider how in a rout anime such as this, where each girl has only a fraction of the season for their arcs, need to get you attached and leave you fulfilled within that period. (\u301c\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\u301c\\n\\n\r\nWith how much fanservice is given, it does not feel right to end on more of the same. You need to end an arc with something that takes their relationship to the next level. In your average anime these endings would be satisfying indeed. However they get to third base rather quickly in almost every arc before the final episode. \u0ca0_\u0ca0\\n\\n\r\nWith a second season they are giving two episodes to each heroine to basically put the cherry on top of a wonderful story. Or pop it. Pardon my humor, I simply couldn't resist after that being the main topic of my review.\\n\\n\r\nI had much to look forward to, however with Ayatsuji's arc ending I do not feel satisfied. I did enjoy the episodes very muchly. It is just rather awkward because I feel like I'm getting more of the same. (\u30ce#-_-)\u30ce\\n\r\nAgain, not a bad thing. (\uff61\uff61\u30fe)\\n\\n\r\nFIRST ARC TSUKASA AYATSUJI SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nTheir romantic peek was\\n\r\n\"are you happy with just one kiss?\"\\n\r\n\"Baka~\"\\n\r\nVery hartwarming, but most of this anime is hartwarming. I want to burst with glee and satisfaction that the grand tale has ended. Perhaps burst is not the best way to describe such things to the internet... (\u256f\u00b0\u0414\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35/(.\u25a1 . \\)\\n\\n\r\nI am no professional by any means, but I think there are some small tweaks that could have been done to make a perfect grade.\\n\r\nAt the end of the bath scene before the fade-out:\\n\r\nMove the last line before the fade-out! and then\\n\r\n1.) Junichi turn around and hug her\\n\r\n2.) Tsukasa be a bit forceful and push him over\\n\r\n3.) Tsukasa pull one strap of her swimsuit down over her shoulder (I feel like this might be a bit much though)\\n\r\n~fade-out~\\n\\n\r\n(END OF SPOILER)\\n\\n\r\nSome of you may think \"thats it? All this hoopla for you being butt-hurt wishing for 5 more frames?\" It may not seem like much, but just think about it. If those frames were there. Would it change how you feel about the end? Sometimes the smallest changes can have the largest effect. \uff61\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61\\n\\n\r\nI know I cant change what we can expect from the rest of this series, I just wanted to give you something to consider for rout animes. So let us hope for the best, and look forward to the rest of the story arcs. \u30fd(\u00b4\u25bd`)/\\n\r\nPossibly if needed (or if they already plan to) an Amagami SS++ (\uff9f\u0414\uff9f\")\\n\r\nThough I'm not sure my heart could handle it.

            "content": "\"And they lived happily ever after...\"\r\nOften times, many people wonder what happens afterwards. What exactly is \"happily ever after\"? Amagami SS+, the sequel to the school romance anime, Amagami SS, gives viewers a glimpse of the lives of the six heroines after the conclusion of the first season. Not much has changed in between seasons - artwork, characters, seiy\u016bs and staff all remained more or less the same - so fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this continuation. With that being said, although Plus is a sequel, knowledge of the first season is not necessarily mandatory as the basic premise of the story canbe grasped quickly.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nSimplicity is almost always a good thing. Having clean art with a good amount of detail is generally well-accepted, especially when it comes to a series like Amagami SS in which the art is not focused on too much. I found the character designs to be very normal and plain, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The style is something I see very often but that is what makes it easy for my eyes to digest. Backgrounds that are not too fancy which don't detract my attention from what's happening is very much positive. AIC did a great job with the animation once again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nLet's be honest here, the girls of Amagami SS are far from realistic. Now I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure there are barely any girls in the world who would want someone like Junichi as their boyfriend. The guy, in many ways, is the reincarnation of a human male's inner desires; he doesn't know the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Not only that, but he's also a blatant pervert and idiotic protagonist. Despite all this, he ends up getting the girl at the end, which is a big reason why I think the characters are unrealistic. Nonetheless, the girls do develop during their own arcs. You can easily see that, after they started dating Junichi, their personalities have changed. While I would've preferred Junichi to not have been such an irritable character, I believe his current personality was used on purpose, in order to enable viewers of similar traits to be able to relate to him and to gain hope (i.e. \"if someone like Junichi can get a beautiful girlfriend, then so can I!\").\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nazusa returns for a second season with two more new songs - an OP and an ED - both of which I liked. They also fit their respective positions very well; the OP was high-energy, readying the viewer for the episode to come while the mellow ED wrapped out the episode nicely. BGM was the same as in the first season. Nothing in particular was memorable but it was there and did its job of enhancing scenes without being too obtrusive. No changes in voice acting since all the characters are still the same. Notable seiy\u016bs include It\u014d Shizuka (Morishima Haruka, Katsura Hinagiku [Hayate no Gotoku!]), Yukana (Nanasaki Ai, C.C. [Code Geass]), and Sat\u014d Rina (Tanamachi Kaoru, Misaka Mikoto [To Aru Kagaku no Railgun]). Unfortunately, there were no insert songs unlike in season one.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nThe omnibus format follows from the first season into the second. Each girl gets their own two-episode arc that introduces a problem before solving it. The purpose of these problems is to strengthen each of the girls' relationship with Junichi. It's realistic in a sense because real life relationships always contain ups and downs, even if the couple has just started dating. The different stories evoke a wide variety of emotions and appeal to viewers of diverse preferences. Personally, I thought some of the arcs were too rushed as there were only two episodes available for the problem to be introduced and solved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nAs a fan of Amagami SS, I definitely enjoyed Plus. Seeing my favorite Amagami girls in action again was a real treat. I would've liked for it to be 24 episodes but, alas, you can't have everything go your way. At this point, I think it's safe to say that this is going to be the last of Amagami SS, in terms of TV series. It's been a good 38 episodes and I'm satisfied with how things went. I would recommend this show to those who want to watch a nice, relaxing sh\u014dnen romantic comedy. You won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "I'll be writing a review for this because I absolutely fell in love with this series. \r\nAlso, this review will be for both seasons. \r\nThere will probably be spoilers. \r\nAmagami SS and SS+ Plus is a story about Tachibana, Junichi. A young man who got stood up on a Christmas date, leaving him traumatized and afraid to fall in love. Two years later, he'll encounter a certain woman. A woman who'll bring him back up to his feet and learn to love once again.\r\nAmagami SS is based on a PS2 Dating sim and is viewed in an omnibus format. Basically, there are 4 episodes (Forthe first season) for each of the 6 heroines and those 4 episodes tell what happens if Junichi goes after a specific girl. \\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS+ is the second season and it shows the events that took place after each of the first season's arcs. So I suppose you can say it's basically an epilogue to the first series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty much cliche. But I can't really blame anyone. The series is based off a dating sim. A traumatizing event in the past like that has probably been used before in other dating sim/anime. But I do find each of the story arcs to be romantic, cute and sweet (Except for Rihoko's first season arc. I was quite disappointed they didn't end up with each other. The second season Rihoko arc makes up for it though) The show is pretty light on the heart and it doesn't cause much heart-wrenching feels (Which is good in my case 'cause I have a weak heart)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are enjoyable in their own way. They're pretty unique from each other and each of them has their own charm. Though I have to say Junichi is a tad bit generic. He's the average high-school student. But as each story develops, he does get a bit unique (Depending on which story arc he's in) But I like him. He's childish, supportive, loving, caring, a bit clueless, reckless and he'd go out of his way to make the girl he loves happy. He reminds me of me, sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. Though the quality of the art did drop at certain points like at the start of Nakata, Sae's arc. The animation is pretty smooth. No complaints there. The sound and the voice acting was also very good. I especially loved Morishima, Haruka and Tachibana, Miya's voice acting for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite heroine will have to be either Sakurai, Rihoko or Tanamachi, Kaoru. Rihoko is bubbly cute and adorable. She's innocent and honest and has a big appetite. Kaoru is mischievous but also very hardworking. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a pretty enjoyable anime. Cute romance here and there. Some slight feels, but that makes the romance all the more satisfying. And you'll enjoy each of the heroines arcs because their own stories are pretty unique from one another. \\n",

Alright.\r\nThere's a nice mini-story for each of the girls, which serve to more fully flesh out their relationships with Junichi. Honestly, these episodes should have been stuffed into the first season to make things feel more complete. If I could go to my past self, I'd tell him to watch the 4-episodes arcs of Season 1 and then the 2-episode arcs of Season 2 for each girl together. Seriously. Try it out.\r\nThe art still has megoing \"meh.\" The background art is completely fine, but I just straight up dislike the art style for the characters. Meh. Same as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much the same as the first season, but it's nice to see how they get along with Junichi after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the first one. If you really liked Season 1 of Amagami SS, you'll love this season. If you didn't, Season 2 might redeem it for you, but probably not. If Season 1 was Oreos, Season 2 would be the milk. A typical vanilla cake of an anime with cute sprinkles on top gives Amagami SS+ Plus a final score of 7.",

Since we know the series will be only 12 episodes long, it is indicated by the words \"first and second -half\"  in the title of the first episode andpreview that each of the 6 female protagnists will likely be 2 episdes each.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a second season, I feel it would be necessary to watch the first season since it seems like they are futher building on the chracters and teir relationships from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was very well done with the typical boyfriend/girl friend interation and ecchi shenanians between them, but there is an added tension thanks to he addition of side charcters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story tus far is good in that it is conistant with the first season story line with a few more plot twists now that the main storyline isnt about trying to get te girl. The art is pretty much the same as the first season, but still great.  The sound in my opinion is better and the op and ed songs are fitting. The charactes are still as entertaining as ever thus making it fairly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the first espisode really leaves a great impression and makes you want to watch more to see what drama will unfold, thus making it a must see; especially if you were a fan of the first season and and even if you werent you should still give it a shot.",

            "content": "The users before me have provided very thorough reviews on this anime series, but I believe there is one area that could use some enlightening. Having watched the first season and enjoying it completely, I found this one lacking somewhat in character progression.\r\nI'll try not to write too much of a spoiler here. Each included story, as has been said, details the afterevents some months further along, of the main protagonist's (Tachibana Junichi) choices in selecting each of the first series' heroines. While I found nothing particularly thrilling or disappointing in the stories themselves, I thought it rather confusing that, after being in a close(very, in some cases) relationship with most of the girls for an extended period of time, why they (mostly Junichi) still behave as if they barely know each other? The awkwardness, shyness, nervousness, and general elements of inhibition were typical and expected in the first series, as Junichi got to know each of the girls, but why are these feelings replayed almost exactly the same way again? This is particularly evident with Junichi; in this respect, I found his behavior almost unbelievable, and definitely unrealistic. Perhaps with only two episodes per character, there's just not enough explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I really did like the way that some of the visual novel endings based upon the first series, that did not appear in the anime of said series, found their way into this anime series. With both animes watched a few times, my ideas about the best girl for Junichi haven't changed: Kaoru.",

I mean, come on. who doesnt like to see a MC dating into 6 six different girls and see the lovey dovey talks between them? and absolutely i am the one who lovesto see MC dating into the girl who bump into him. The main point is the story  in this anime is so unique, you wouldn't find an anime like this anymore.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK 10/10\\n\r\nLike i said before, this artwork is the reason why i am watching this anime. the artwork for the people or the scenes is absolutely stunning (especially the girls, lol), The characters are drawn good, it was very interesting to see.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\r\nI really love the opening song from Amagami SS plus, its certainly presents the story, and also the voice for the character is also lovely, its just the seiyuu really putting their feelings in the actor, oh, the background music is also really fit with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nThe character of this anime is the first one i caught. the six different girls with different characters and also the main character guy who is have the same feeling with the real man (like have a naughty thinking), The interesting point is which the feelings that the MC has is like the other us. We, man, always have a dirty thinking if we're alone with the girl. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nI really recommend to all people who loves to see a light love story,without any complex story to see this anime. you didnt have to think too much when you see this anime. you just need to enjoy the show and said \"Wow, Thats very lovely\"\\n",

The plot continues the same but with a continuation that surpasses its predecessor Each part of a heroine speaks of the relationship of a boy with a different girl, type a universe for each type of relation of the protagonist with a heroine. This is cool because this anime does not deal with treason much less than harem. This is a girl with a certain personality to make a pair with him. It still remains as an anime with a light storyline, good moments of laughter and striking endings for each heroine, and maybe better than others.\\n\\n\r\nThose who watch will be able to select their best story and their best plot for themselves, without needing to get into controversial issues of who is the best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS + Plus elevou ainda mais o n\u00edvel de sua premissa.

It would have been better if they had done 4 eps per arc again as they did originally as i feel they would have been able to tell more like they did in the original and like i said to me it feels a bit rushed. \r\nAlso it wouldhave been nicer if it was longer and should more of a development in there relationships, because from what i have seen so far even though something like 6 months or so has past, they still seem like they just recently got together.\\n\\n\r\nIt would have been interesting to see there relationships development after the first season as was said was about getting the girl.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I'm saying i wished it was longer and that they put more into the story it is still very good and would recommend watching this and the first season. I can only hope that they make a third season that is more like the first and that this is just a in betweener for that season were they can show them getting further in there relationship and maybe getting past difficult obstacles or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nWell here's hoping. :)",

remembering the previous season leave us when Tachibana Junichi still at 2nd grade,but it really is still surprising.Why?Cause this anime's storyline goes in a same situation,setting,and time but it kept repeated with the same male character with six different heroine and in several heroine,we can watch a glimpse of their future after the male character conquered their heart.So,will it be wright to make a sequel of it,despite we already watch their future self?The answer is YES.It fulfillmy high expectation.To be honest,the word sequel itself is a bit worry me.We can see many anime quality drop instantly after their sequel was aired and it's often that the previous season quality was much better than the next.Amagami SS first season itself,for me,was quite impressive.Well,it's a bit like playing an automatic visual novel,but it still good.Six girl with a unique and different character from each other,yeah that's what made this show interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo,basically Amagami SS+ is the continuation of the story from the first season.The times set\\n\r\na several month after Tachibana Junichi confess his love to each heroine.I'm a bit confused\\n\r\nabout how to make this review since I'm usually make a review mainly based on the plot.\\n\r\nBut,this one is exceptional cause it has six different plot.So I will review it from the each heroine\\n\r\ncharacter and their development after the previous season.About Tachibana?Well just ignore\\n\r\nhim.His stil as pervert,dull,stupid,and useless as usual.Oh god,what kind of Lady Luck that\\n\r\npossessed this extremely lucky dude?All he's thinking about is how to get a quick and nice\\n\r\nsex with all of the heroine.And what makes me despise him even more,all of the heroine almost\\n\r\nalways agree to his stupid pervy request from time to time like,\"May I sleep on your belly?\",\\n\r\n\"Can I kiss your knee?(in season one)\".What the hell,fuck!Girls,please don't be a slut.\\n\r\nIf they gonna make the third season of Amagami SS,I'm personally request his death.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the action and the development of their relationship come from the heroine.It looks\\n\r\nlike they encouraging Tachibana to take a deeper action cause he's way too dull to be a boyfriend.In this 2nd season the amount of the episode has been reduced to only 13 episode.So each arc have two episode and one addition for a filler in the last episode.Not much different from the previous season actually,eventhough it has a shorter episode,but I do like this one better.The heroines are way more attractive and responsive than in the first season.It make them a lot more appealing.Maybe it's because they already in a phase where they've become a lover so they can talk about their feelings more seriously and honestly than before they date each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's continue to the heroines character.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit change in the second season.The arc got a reverse in their turn to appear at\\n\r\nthe show.So,Tsukasa is the first one and Haruka is the last one.\\n\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa Arc:\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge the book by its cover.I bet you know this phrase already.It suit Tsukasa extremely\\n\r\nwell.On her outer appearance you can see her as a respectable person,nice,perfect,and a hardworker.But after you succeeded to penetrate her heart,you will get a shocking turn around in her attitude.She's a dominant and an oppressor.There's not even a single guy in the world want to be dominated by their girl so badly.And what makes it worse,she elected to become the student council president which make her bossy attitude become worse.She express her love to Tachibana with her cynical behavior.To be honest,I do like her figure.Long black silky  hair,a pair of gorgeous black eye filled with spirit,slim body,and a pretty nice breast eventhough it's not too damn big.\\n\\n\r\nI guess what make this anime rated under 8 point is because of her.She make this show drop\\n\r\nin its content.Want to know why?Here's my three reason:First,she's way too dominant.Second,\\n\r\nshe's a hot girl but she's not cute.Three,her arc is boring.I feel like a de ja vu when I\\n\r\nwatch her arc.Not particularly too different from the first season so it's kinda plain.\\n\r\nShe got a job and position and Tachibana help her with her job,they got into an obstacle,\\n\r\nthey quell it and voila,the ending kiss!I will give this arc approximately a 3 or 4 for the\\n\r\noverall point.Tsukasa did NOT satisfy me.\\n\\n\r\nSakurai Rihoko Arc:\\n\\n\r\nHmm,what will I say about Rihoko.Everytime I look in her eyes I always remember about my dog.Suppose she's not a glutton and have a very strict diet to lose her weight,maybe I will lost\\n\r\nmy interest to her.Her chubbyness is so sexy and it's so appealing.Forget about her breast\\n\r\nfor a moment and you will find an innocent,pure,and cute 10 years old girl.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say that her arc is good but it's not bad either.It's fine.In her arc,you will watch\\n\r\nher act very unadorned and hesitating about how she will deliver her feeling toward Tachibana.\\n\r\nThe ending is too simple and meh meh meh.So I will give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nNanasaki Ai Arc:\\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me about which heroine love Tachibana the most,I will say it's Ai.If I were looking\\n\r\nfor a girlfriend,I'm definitely will searching for someone with her character.Well,isn't it obvious\\n\r\nthat she will give Tachibana a lot of love??Her name itself is Ai (love).A sporty girl,with\\n\r\na tomboyish appearance.But don't be deceived,she's very soft and fragile inside.She's the opposite from Tsukasa.The only thing that bother me about her is why did the creator made her to be the one with the flattest breast?The other heroine seems pretty stuffed,especially Rihoko,Haruka,and Sae.Kaoru and Tsukasa is a mediocre.And Ai is the most pitiful in the boob ratio contest.\\n\\n\r\nIn her arc in Amagami SS+,Ai and Tachibana couldn't meet each other too much cause Tachibana in a busy term to prepare for college.She feels very lonely when Tachibana is not in her side.Oh poor Ai.Eventhough she looks very sad and crying,she's still look pretty and try \\n\r\nto face it rigidly.I like her faithfullness for Tachibana in this arc,so I will give it 8.\\n\\n\r\nTanamachi Kaoru Arc:\\n\\n\r\nI love it!Probably the girl that I like the most,wrapped with the nicest story.Did you realize\\n\r\nthat Kaoru is the only arc where its setting is off from the school?That's what make this\\n\r\narc the greatest.It is an anime with a school as a main setting but it's not a rule to make\\n\r\nthe story always take place in the school right?Kaoru's arc definitely gives a refreshing air\\n\r\nto me.The story feels like going very natural and smooth.It gives you something new.\\n\\n\r\nWell,shortly the couple decide to take a vacation together in order to develop their relationship\\n\r\ntoward something more serious.Because they short in money,finally they decided to take\\n\r\na cheap and fun night touring in a bus.Then,funny and complex thing started one after another.Face it with a love power guys,and you will get a well deserved ending.\\n\\n\r\nTwo things that I love from Kaoru: First,she's very energetic and sometimes a bit bold and\\n\r\ndaring.I like this side of Kaoru.There's not much girl out there like her in this era.\\n\r\nShe can live the situation up anytime,anywhere with her action.Second,she's a talkative girl.\\n\r\nI like talkative chick cause they can talk their heart content honestly and they can be\\n\r\nso pure and it's nice to share our mind with a girl like Kaoru.This is the funkiest arc.She's cute,her attitude is great,her hair is sexy,so I will give Kaoru 10.\\n\\n\r\nNakata Sae Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThis heroine.....an angel I guess.Always positive and always looks adorable and super cute.\\n\r\nNot to mention her bust super size.I will like her if she's act a bit more of her age.\\n\r\nSeriously,she really like a kid.Her gesture,her voice,her hair,and her way to talk.Way too\\n\r\ncute for a highschool student.But that doesn't matter anymore.Her arc is one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nIn this Arc,Nakata Sae will be tested to be a leader.She will handle the founder festival\\n\r\ncommittee.Well,she indeed showing a progress from the previous season.She doesn't see\\n\r\nthe cafeteria lady as a vending machine anymore (lol,I wonder why it have to be a vending \\n\r\nmachine?).But realizing her lack of social interaction in her community,Miya,her best friend,\\n\r\nwhom also Tachibana's little sister,decided to vote her to become the leader of the founder\\n\r\nfestival community.It sure not an easy problem.Her maturity and sense of responsibility really\\n\r\nis developing very well in this arc.We can see from her dedication,she really into this and don't\\n\r\nwanna let everyone down.Tachibana was really useless in this arc.He wasn't help Sae at all.\\n\r\nFor me,he even adding another trouble for Sae.Yeah,he did something unnecessary as the narrator said.I won't say what cause I'm afraid I'll spoil it.Watch the show and you will know that I didn't say anything wrong about Tachibana being so damn useless.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Tachibana's foolishness,this arc is good.But actually,I want more of her breast\\n\r\nexposure.I will give it 8.\\n\\n\r\nMorishima Haruka Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThe hottest girl among the heroine.Ohh,she really is sexy.Look at her beautiful black hair.\\n\r\nIt's very smooth and a bit wavy touch on the tip of it makes it even better.Really an ojou-sama\\n\r\ntype of girl.And her bright blue color of her eyes make her always looks energetic.A british-\\n\r\njapanese mix.What a nice combination wasn't it?\\n\\n\r\nI think that the probability of a guy like Tachibana dating a girl like Haruka in the real\\n\r\nworld is about 0,00000001%,except if you are lucky enough to bump her in front of your class\\n\r\nand \"accidentally\" groping her breast and triggering a flag with her like in a generic\\n\r\nromance anime :p.To be honest,I like this arc second best to Kaoru's.The reason is:\\n\\n\r\n1.Haruka didn't exaggerate and too aggressive in expressing her love to Tachibana.She act\\n\r\nmore of her age and show a calm love plus maturity in facing Tachibana.\\n\\n\r\n2.There is an appearance of girl who claim to be Haruka's relative from England.She really\\n\r\nlooks like Haruka except for her eyes and hair color.It's a british mode of Haruka.That's\\n\r\ndouble kawai,made me enjoy the arc even more.Her Japanese-British accent really cute.\\n\\n\r\n3.Finally,Tachibana got his ball as a man.You will see why at the end of the arc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great arc,so I will give it 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for Amagami SS+ it's 9 for me.Well,it's not actually far better than the first season.\\n\r\nIn fact,you will get a pretty much the same feeling from watching it.I don't even know why I\\n\r\ngive it a 9 :p.But if you are looking for a nicer and clearer ending in each of the arc,this is it for you! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Only 2 series for each heroine is too few to create some intriguing plot, however there are still decent plot twists in some of the arcs. To be honest its difficult to distinguish 2nd season of Amagami as separate anime and not just a few extra episodes to 1st season. In this spotlight you can actually like it, but still it feels more like some extra not the standalone product",

            "content": "A great expansion to the already very well done first season, amagami SS+ takes two more episodes for each character and expands on what happens in their relationship in the year following the first season.\r\nI wasn't expecting a second season that was quite as good as the original, but I was very surprised. Amagami SS+ has everything the first season had going for it, on a more compact scale. It is just as good in terms of art and sound, but due to the mere length story is a bit less deep. It still comes very close to being just as great as the firstseason, which makes it a worthy second season in my books.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8/10 -Once again adopting the GREAT idea of an omnibus format(in harem animes, where the guy has arcs in which it treats it as if he chose a different girl, so every girl has their special romantic scenes), Amagami SS+ keeps that great romantic harem anime feel going. A standout in most recent harem series, anything within the Amagami series is is a must watch for harem anime fans looking for something recent. Amagami is not really a life changer, like some epic animes are, but it really does well at what it is-a realistic story of romance, in which the guy DOES NOT have that stupid stereotype of harem leads that DONT WANT the girls. He wants what any man would want, and often makes deals with the girls like \"I will do this if you kiss me.\" That's a breath of fresh air, because as a guy myself I know I wouldn't shun sexuality like 90% of harem leads stereotypically do. Each story for each girl has its own romantic style, and every couple of episodes you get something different, which makes for a very interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 - In terms of harem anime, this one is up there. It isn't quite as masterful as the works of Key, but it definitely has a high level of animation. Girls are natural in appearance, most are quite imperfect even. Hair colors are realistic (although I have no problem with exotic coloring), and this makes for a lifelike anime that has very down to earth appearances, giving a feeling of \"this really is a type of romance that could happen in real life, awww\". Amagami SS+ tends to have very realistic movements and reactions of the female characters, such that based on their personality, what they do with their face and actions while talking suits it. This is an underappreciated trait many animes don't have, and you can see this trait is in SS+ right away just by watching the opening animation, and seeing how they introduce each girl visually. Each one doesnt even speak a word and you can sense how they act and what their personality is just by their posture, movement, or grace. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 - In my opinion, the music took a slight dip in quality since the first season. The OP and ED are nonetheless fitting, but they aren't something I would download and keep in my library. As well, they did not have a separate ending for each character in the anime during each of the arcs. This is something I really liked about the first season, and it is understandable to not want to make a new ending theme every 2 episodes for this season. Still, in comparison to the first season, the music within SS+ is a little bit lacking because of this, but it still is fitting, which is the most important part of sound. Character voices are supremely fitting. They sound like they should, and articulate as they should. The main character's sister has such a fitting voice, it pretty much blows my mind. They also have their own \"tendencies\", which makes them all the more realistic. For example, Miya (the main char's sister), has this tendency to laugh in an odd way, sounding like \"Ni-shi-shi\". This gives characters an identity that can differentiate them from many other animes just by hearing them, without visuals. Having something like that is rare, and awesome. I know most characters would be confusing to guess if I only heard their voice, but many Amagami voice actors would be recognizable just because the characters have such unique voicing methods.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10 -  This is the very best part of Amagami, for season 1, and season 2, the characters have been the complete drive for me to watch it. They have such realistic personalities, that I don't think I have seen any harem anime with more lifelike female characters within it. If you are a guy, just think of a crush you had in real life, and more than likely, someone within SS+ will be so much like that girl that you will wonder how they came up with each so well. \\n\\n\r\nA personality example would be: girl who is fairly normal in appearance and constantly worried about her weight, is also a childhood friend (honestly, you would NEVER see such a realistic thing as to worry about weight or be imperfect in most animes. She has larger hips than 90% of harem leads, but nonetheless she models a beautiful character based on personality that people are surprised to find themselves lusting after even though she is not a complete bishoujo.) \\n\\n\r\nAnother example would be a student council leader who seems like the standard perfect, sort of strict, and formal girl, at first appearing like the stereotypical Inchou that the main character ignores in most harem animes. As the guy gets to know her, he finds that the girl is very particular and on the inside has a fierce sense of independance. She is in search of love, but does not want that person she falls in love with to think of anyone but her. She has a fiery personality, and this is extremely surprising but somehow seems like it was the way class reps should have been like in every harem anime. Whereas most relationships in harem anime are on a \"say something sexual, get embarrassed\" level, the relationship the guy has with this character is on a more serious level, such that she sometimes says sexual things without even a blush, and the guy might ask her about something sexual and she won't even be phased. This is something you typically don't see at all in this genre. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10 - Despite continuing the story from first season, the short 2 episode arcs will often leave you wanting more. Each arc ends in a pretty fitting way, but even so I found that I wish there could have been a bit more fleshing out of the arc. This is what happens with a shorter set of episodes than the first season, but despite knowing I can't have everything, this will not stop me from wanting it. In comparison to the first season, my enjoyment of the second has been a bit lower, but not by a huge amount. It's still a great show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - Not a complete legend within harem anime, but undoubtedly a defining series in the genre. Never before have characters been modeled in such a real way. It is worth watching just to see the realism of the personalities each character has. After seeing the first season, there is absolutely no reason to ignore the second, as it provides just about everything good in the first, on a smaller scale, while continuing the story.",

            "content": "This review covers Amagami SS+, as well as the first season. It is also spoiler free.\r\nAmagami SS is a series that tries to play romance in a different way using an omnibus format. Unfortunately it fails to deliver engaging, interesting, or otherwise fun stories for the viewers.\r\nDespite the low rating I'm giving this series, I wouldn't say I hate it - I just find it incredibly boring.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThis is a romance anime in an omnibus format. If you are not familiar with that term, it means that there are many girls and many arcs, and each girl gets her own arc. You can think of eacharc as a parallel universe because they have their own endings and there's no continuity between each arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Because of this, it's hard to rate the story as a whole, but we can talk about the arcs on average. Each arc is 4 episodes long in the first season, and the second season has continuations to each arc that are 2 episodes long. Unfortunately none of the arcs are really that interesting. Everything always goes well. They don't really take the time to develop any kind of drama, and if they do, it gets resolved really quickly, failing to justify the length of each arc. The romance is poorly done in each arc - it just isn't interesting. In fact, there's situations when it can actually be creepy and overdone. And one thing that is particularly jarring is that the arcs take place in the same timeframe every time, the main character has the same backstory in all of them, and they always end in the same event, with it just playing differently. You will probably find yourself rolling your eyes each time they repeat what happened to the main character at the beginning of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor falls on its face most of the time. It doesn't come off as natural, and it just follows the typical troupes you would find in a romance comedy anime. There are some exceptions to this, but in general, the humor is not well done.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that can be highlighted from this show is the art. While this part of the review can only be objective, I really enjoyed the character design. The girls just look really cute, and the backdrops are detailed. They didn't slack off in this area.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special. If you have played VNs, you will notice that it has that same \"type\" of music. In the first season, each ending was sung by the main girl of the arc. Sometimes they were OK, sometimes they were average. They were never BAD, but I wouldn't say music was this anime's biggest department.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nSo the character design is nice, but I have mixed feelings regarding their personalities and interactions. I think most of the characters, other than the MC, can actually be pretty likable on their own, but everything falls to the ground when they start interacting with each other, or at least when they interact with the MC. I wish we could see each character do their own thing a bit more often without having to involve the MC so we can get a better idea of what they are like. Many characters have good backgrounds, interesting personalities, and hobbies. But we can never see that because the series doesn't take the time to develop each character. When one of the girls show up, the MC is almost guarantee to be with them, and if they don't they aren't doing or talking about anything important.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, how I rate an anime is mostly decided by how much I enjoyed it. It can have the nicest art in the world or the most bombastic music ever, but if it wasn't enjoyable, it's rating will go down.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Amagami SS fails to deliver any kind of enjoyment. With the comedy failing to deliver, the romance being so poorly done, and the character development being boring and mostly non existent, I found myself checking how much left of each episode was left when I was watching it. This is never a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely find it hard to justify a score bigger than 2. The biggest problem with this anime is how the arcs develop and they always end up being boring. If you want to watch a romcom, rest assured the market is full of them, and only watch this when you have exhausted all your options.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS had a great cast of girls to work with and it always left itself on a high note (well...5/6 times, anyways). Amagami SS+ though....while not bad (I've seen much worse in the harem genre), doesn't quite hit all the sweet spots that it's prequel series did.\r\n(+) The animation was top notch and the character designs look a lot nicer. Even with whatever qualms I have with the stories, seeing the followups on the girls is really nice. I LOVED Haruka's story and it was easily the best one, including that ending. The secondary characters were just as fun as they were before. Andwe totally need more Jessica and Risa. :)\\n\\n\r\n(-) On the whole, I only really enjoyed one out of six scenarios, which is a little sad honestly. Just a quick thought on each of them: by far the worst was Kaoru's, since it seemed to diminish her likability in some ways. Sae's was just too weird and overly cutesy, but not terrible. Ai also lost some likability, but still kept her personality as fun as before. Rihoko got a nice resolution that I think everyone wanted. Finally, Tsukasa's (is a lovely person with nothing to hide, I swear!) was good, but it didn't work her personality into it very well.  \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, while not as charming as the first series, it's still a nice followup to the omnibus Amagami that came before it. :)\\n\\n\r\nAs a little side note, here's a most-to-least favorite list of the girls routes this time around:\\n\\n\r\n#1. Haruka\\n\r\n#2. Tsukasa\\n\r\n#3. Rihoko\\n\r\n#4. Ai\\n\r\n#5. Sae\\n\r\n#6. Kaoru",

            "content": "Amagami SS+ Plus is the sequel of Amagami SS+. The series is more of a side story than continuation of the first season but still gives the excitement that made us want more of Amagami.\r\nStory:\r\nThe set-up of the story is the same as the first season where it is divided into story arcs focusing on one heroine. The sequence is different in the first season whereas the last heroine covered is the first one in this sequel. As I stated before, this more of a side story in which they show different events happening after the end of each arc on the first one. Isay it is more of a side story because there is not much development that may affect the series. But even though it is a side story, it is still good because it shows the lax side of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere is not much difference in the art as the first season. It is still good. The design of the heroines is the one that really stands out in the series which helps in rooting for the one. The backgrounds are also good but you most of the time, you will focus on the heroines instead.\\n\r\nAnd wait, there are also fanservice if you are into that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are both good. They may not be as good as the first season but you can still enjoy it. It is perfect for this series. The soundtracks for the scenes are also good that it helps in taking the emotions out of you. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe set of heroines are good given that there are many of them. They have different personalities that you may love or hate. In terms of character development, there is not much of it. Their traits are almost the same thing that we know in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you watched the first season and you want more, this is a good watch as it extends the story of each heroines. It may not contain a lot of development but it is still enjoyable. The stories may give yo a few laughs and gives an excitement that you want for romantic story.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is mostly spoiler-free (except for two marked locations), and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\nAdditionally, due to this being the second season of Amagami SS, it should go without saying that you need to watch season 1 of the show before even consideringor understanding this review. My review is based off of my first season review, therefore it would be good to check that out if you want full critiques of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nPositives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- More Daisuki\\n\r\nDid you love Amagami SS? Then Amagami SS+ Plus is a no brainer. It extends the stories of each of the characters for 2 additional episodes each, providing a small conflict + resolution to deepen the relationships depicted in the first season. I consider this less of an independent \"season\", but rather a continuation, addition, or extended epilogue to the series as a whole. Call it a \"love letter\" from the creators of the show to its fans. In any case, it's very welcome from me!\\n\\n\r\n- Added Screen Time\\n\r\nOne of the common complaints about Amagami SS was its relatively short arcs (4 episodes), which initially seems like Amagami SS+ Plus just exacerbates. But instead of being separate instances, the combination of both seasons (ending up with ~6 episodes on each character) helps those doubts melt away, satisfying many small quibbles about the characters of the first season. We get to see more depth to all the characters and their relationship to Junichi, which only serves to make you fall in love with the couplings all over again!\\n\\n\r\n- Excellent Finale\\n\r\nOne of the key strengths of Amagami SS was its ability to flesh out characters even when not in their own respective arcs. While the final (non-arc) episode is heavy on the fan-service due to its setting, it fulfills my final desire to see many of the main cast interact with each other in new and exciting ways. Move aside Junichi, I want a show with just the girls!\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS! SCROLL TO NEGATIVES SECTION TO CONTINUE SPOILER FREE!\\n\\n\r\n- Rihoko's Arc\\n\r\nThe first season's Rihoko arc was a complete tease, and many felt unsatisfied with its ending. I will not give away the ending of Rihoko's continuation this season, but it was handled a lot more satisfyingly this season and rounded out into an excellent 6-episode arc. This was the story that the arc was originally meant to be, and I'm happy we could all see it through.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS HAVE ENDED\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- MC Fatigue Pt. 2\\n\r\nJunichi Tachibana is approximately EXACTLY the same as the first season. As such, there are many positives and negatives to his character, which balance out into a frustrating, but ultimately lovable MC. Some arcs had him be a little less facepalm worthy than others, but don't expect him to suddenly change things up from the first season! Haha.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS! SCROLL TO CONCLUSION TO CONTINUE SPOILER FREE!\\n\\n\r\n- Kaoru's Arc\\n\r\nThis is personal preference, but in my opinion Kaoru's mini arc this season was a huge disappointment. After an incredibly strong showing in Season 1 (tied for 2nd best), her character felt incredibly confused and inconsistent. The first seasons presented a very positive tsundere image, with self denial but ultimately a submission to her feelings. This season felt like she slipped into every single bad tsundere characteristic. On top of that, she had a very legitimate issue to grapple with (how do you effectively transition from being close friends to lovers), which never actually got resolved! They fought a bunch, made up, and suddenly it's like: \"Oh that problem's magically solved too!\". Whaaat?! Sorry Kaoru, I love your character but with such a strong cast of characters, this will affect your standing greatly in my mind. Don't worry though, we always have Season 1 re-watches ;~;\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS HAVE ENDED\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nAmagami SS+ Plus, besides having a classically silly anime name, is more of the same. It continues to flesh out the roles the characters play, and satisfies fans' desires to see more of their favourite characters and relationship dynamics. If you enjoyed the first season, there's no reason why you wouldn't love the second season just as much. It has all of the elements I loved, and the quibbles that nagged at me, all wrapped up in a nice little series of epilogues. Some stories got better, some series got a little bit less good, but most of them stayed consistently fantastic. Even the arcs I \"liked the least\" are solid 8s or 9s, which should tell you about the absurd quality of the girls in this show. I'm tremendously sad that this is the end of my Amagami SS journey, but so happy I got to experience it along the way!\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl/Story Rankings, Season 2!\\n\r\nAi = Haruka > Tsukasa = Rihoko > Sae > Kaoru\\n\r\n(These rankings are only relevant for Season 2; See my Season 1 review for a ranking relating to that season!)\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\".\\n\\n\r\nDue to the sequel nature of this review, plus the fact that this season is more of an \"epilogue\" rather than its own independent thing, I recommend that anyone who has watched Season 1 must watch Season 2, as it is essential to the overall Amagami SS experience!\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched Amagami SS (the first season), go read my review and give it a shot! Hopefully I'll see you back here after you've binged both seasons ;)",

            "content": "Amagami SS was an interesting take on the harem genre, with the main character rotating through different routes spanning two seasons. Amagami SS Plus revisits lucky man Junichi's world with a promise of additional content. However, given that viewers from Amagami already know that Junichi is 6 out of 6 (7 out of 6 if you include OVAs), what can another season's worth of episodes add?\r\nI would actually classify this series as more of an OVA than a regular series, as plot-wise there isn't much to anticipate. As you are basically watching for more cute character interactions, this is primarily for fans of the originalAmagami series. There is minor plot attached to each of the six arcs (in almost reverse order of the original season so you have to really wait for Haruka this time) but for the most part it's only just enough to give reason for the character interactions. If you liked the original and still want more of your favorite gal, this is where you'll find it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty much straight out of the original, granted a few additional backgrounds and such. If you like the mildly-understated character styling of the original then you'll be right at home here. If you liked the romance-based scenes in the original, there are definitely a few more of those here. If you're looking for the ecchi scenes, you'll find a good deal of it in the last episode- somewhat expected from any sento/onsen episode. My only major complaint is that Risa only gets a brief cameo appearance.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nUnlike the original, you get one fixed OP and ED for the entire duration of the series. The OP and ED, both by the same artist, fit fairly well into the general atmosphere of the series, with the OP being a bit more upbeat. The only animation difference you're going to get is during the ED where different heroines mouth the phrase \"Suki dayo\". Otherwise sound is pretty much the same as the original - same BGM and same VA cast. If anything, you get even more Haruka/episode as you essentially have two Morishimas. Her Engrish is actually somewhat superior to quite a few other VAs.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe director here had a tough challenge. How do you fit an entire season's worth of character interactions without boring or confusing the viewer who pretty much already have a fixed idea of the conclusion of most of the arcs? For the most part, I was satisfied with how the stories in each arc went. They didn't go back and rewrite events in the original and they didn't pull a Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien ~ Next Season (drastic personality change). What they did do is present new circumstances under which the character personalities could shine.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc takes off after the events in the first season (minus the flash-forward scenes as in the case of Haruka). In some arcs, you have a continuation of dating (fights, challenges, tension...) and in others you get to finally get to the confession/dating. You even get some more of the flash-forward finality scenes, which I kind of liked. However, you really can't compete with the story in the first season, as it's not possible here to replicate the tension of the early getting to know each other period. Despite this, there's more than enough to keep those who liked the original watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf anything, you learn that Junichi was always a little pervy (Rihoko arc). That aside, the personalities of each girl shows through as they are pushed into new challenges, be it getting lost or getting a rival. In most cases, the interactions are a bit more static, since in most cases Junichi is already dating the girl, but the particular situations make it interesting nonetheless. Again, I'll be rooting for an Amagami SS Plus OVA with more Risa.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is not nearly as must-watch as the original, but the additional content is worth checking out if you liked the prequel. Not all arcs are even as the endings of the first season left more room in some story lines than others. Overall, this does a good job of balancing the progress in the different arcs and giving some more screen time to some nice, familiar faces.",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nWords of advice, if you decide this is an anime you wish to watch, I STRONGLY encourage you watch its first season, Amagami SS first as it will add to the overall enjoyment of this season.\r\nAmagami SS+ is the continuation of last season\u2019s Amagami SS. It is a direct sequel and follows roughly the same episodic format of its predecessor. Each female lead is given a two episode arc that once completed, goes back to the beginning of the timeline and focuses on another female lead. These episodes are meant to provide closure for last season\u2019s episodes as not everyfemale was given a canon ending.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS+ tries very hard to provide appropriate closure to each character\u2019s romance, but some come off too forced due to the restricted two episodes per character. An example is from the ending of Haruka\u2019s arc where Junichi makes a very bold confession that I believe no human would ever attempt. I also found myself reverting to my old preferences of character choice from last season as I still found Haruka way out of Junichi\u2019s league and Sae was still a pill to listen to. There are however some really great moments such as Ai\u2019s ending and Rihoko finally manning (err womaning) up to confess to Junichi. The season does have arcs that outshine others but overall it\u2019s enjoyable across the board.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a step up from last season as the production values have been very kind to the overall visuals of the show. Each character seems more defined and much more attractive to see. Backgrounds are drawn very well and each setting is very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again the voice acting is very well done by the Jap cast. Each female lead is voiced by the same actor as before and retains their individual quirks that made them lovable in the previous season. My gripes still remain with Sae as she is just a pill to listen to for over 40 minutes. The opening song is very catchy and well done. Music during the episodes fit well and provide adequate atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much I can say that has changed in the character department from last season. I still loved all the characters and they act the same as the previous season. I have newfound respect for Rihoko, returning ughness for Sae, and a liking for Haruka\u2019s outgoing personality. Each character\u2019s personality is unique and a joy to watch fold out. The male lead Junichi is also more likeable in this season as he seems more approachable this time around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though I ended up scoring this season with a score lower than a 9.0, I still found myself really enjoying the closure provided for the entire cast. Every arc was fun and enjoyable to watch and I cannot wait to go back and re-watch the first and second season in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",
