            "content": "As a fan of the games, the Persona 4 adaptation is a real shame. It exemplifies everything that can go wrong with video game adaptations. Not only is it poorly done in respect to anime as a whole, but it is poorly done even compared to some other video game adaptations. I fully expect I'll get a lot of hate for this, so please let me explain first. \r\nThe story is pretty typical for what you would find in most JRPGs these days, but one of the unique things about the Persona franchise has been the blend between the dating-sim styled day-to-day activities and theRPG combat. Most of the action takes place in a world hidden by all but a few lucky people granted the power of a Persona, the manifestation of the person's psyche which is used to fight shadows inside of the TV world. While it's fairly generic and comes with its fair share of clich\u00e9s, it works well because the story is self-aware and does not try to take itself too seriously. It's a fairly light-hearted story even in the midst of all the murders, kidnappings, and crazy things going on. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any inherent problem with the story here because it's simply being taken from an already well-written series. The story was fine in the game, and for the most part it's fine here too. What there IS a problem with, however, is the pacing. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing can be likened to teleportation. It's  a disorganized mess of scenes abruptly changing from one to another with a calendar flashing for a few moments. No, the people behind the adaptation don't care about pacing-- instead they use the calendar as a lazy excuse to not deal with coherent pacing. You might have the main character sitting at a table talking with the group for all of around 30 seconds and then the calendar will simply flash on screen, skipping past several days and taking you into a completely different scene with almost no link or correlation with what just happened. Sometimes the days flash by so fast that you don't even know what the hell is happening any more. Sometimes you will have a dungeon given three entire episodes dedicated to it, and another dungeon will have less than half an episode. It makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe calendar system and the day-to-day activities worked fine in the game, but this is not the game. It does not work here and it does not fit. This is an anime, not a video game, and the people behind the anime should at least try and make sure it translates properly into a condensed, strictly visual form. You can't simply take the game and then slap it into an anime. You need to make adjustments, you need to make changes, and you need to make sure it fits the medium that you are adapting it to. The staff behind the Persona 4 adaptation don't understand this important philosophy. It instead feels like they're awkwardly trying to recreate the feel of the game, but failing pretty miserably at it. I felt like I was getting a headache at times trying to follow the constant warping of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you haven't played the games, don't expect to understand much of what is going on. You will probably be lost and confused amidst the pacing, especially when important plot points and characterization is skipped upon and barely explained. There really needed to be two seasons of anime here because it's clear as day how rushed it is. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's not the only problem here. Both the animation and the art style are also poorly done. There is a strange lack of color throughout the entire show, which is odd given how colorful and vibrant the game was. Each character is drawn poorly and colored in with ugly looking gradients, something that you would expect from a high school computer animation class, not a commercial product created for thousands of people. It's all very bland and amateurish. There's also a startling lack of animation here. One character will have their mouth flap while everybody else in the background is static and motionless, often complete with disproportional faces and odd expressions, looking stupefied. For a lack of a better term, it's very 'derp'. Even when there is a decent amount of animation happening on screen it's usually done poorly with glaring mistakes in between movements, usually body parts morphing into strange shapes. Either they were lacking budget or something went horribly wrong in the production of the anime... either way, it has some of the worst art and animation I've seen in a mainstream anime. For all the years it took for the series to get a 'proper' anime adaptation, when it looks as poorly as this, well... was it really worth it?\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the music is very nice and the remixed and new tracks are greatly appreciated. It helps to spice things up a little bit from the game, though there are problems even here since the background songs will abruptly switch from one to another with complete dissonance and shifts in tone. The music itself is good, but the application of the music is not. Instead of awkwardly switching between music all the time, the staff could have opted to just use silence or ambient noise from time to time instead, and save the music only for the scenes where it truly fits in. It should feel natural, and here it just stands out in a really unpleasant way. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, there just isn't much good I can say for the anime. There's a few brief moments of hilarity scattered here and there, and while it's nice to see all the characters fully animated, the entire time I was watching it just made me want to go replay the game instead. A good adaptation wouldn't make you want to do that. The anime is nothing more than  fanservice for people who have played and enjoyed the games, and even as fanservice it fails in some pretty major areas. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe other people will enjoy it more than me, but Persona 4 deserved so much more than this.",

            "content": "\"Bonds of people is the true power\"\r\nPersona 4 is one of the best video games that I have had the chance to play. Despite being highly acclaimed by critics both in Japan and in the West, Persona 4 remains somewhat of a niche title and this more or less transfers to the anime adaptation too. As a result, those who have played the game are the ones best-placed to be able to fully appreciate the anime series, but new fans will also find a very good anime thanks to Aniplex doing a commendable job with the existing game material.\r\nThe opening episodes set the story upquite well with mysterious deaths, the TV world, shadows and personas. The main character, along with another high school student, get involved through various circumstances and then strive to solve the murder cases, meanwhile gaining new friends and abilities. However, it does take a while before huge plot developments start to occur, and these are spread out unevenly over the course of the series. As a result, the pacing is off throughout certain episodes and some important revelations are only lightly touched upon. Social links are a crucial feature in Persona 4; these are several side stories which detail the interactions and bonds that form between the main character and supporting characters. Certain social links are arguably more enjoyable to watch in the anime rather than play in the game, as there's original material which fleshes them out better. Others, however, feel rather rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThe game features several short anime-styled cut scenes, and the anime series is similar in terms of artwork and animation. Character designs, which have been copied from the game, are simple and sharp. This means it's decent, but compared to certain other anime it's probably not as visually striking. In some episodes the animation is quite inconsistent; for example, facial expressions are usually good but sometimes become lifeless. Nevertheless, the battle scenes featuring personas and shadows are mostly excellent and full of action, appropriate BGM and variation. It's also amusing that the anime retains the look and feel of a video game; the main character's stats appearing halfway through each episode, as well as the calendar being displayed when each day passes are just a couple of examples.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, in my opinion, is the best aspect of this anime. Poor music alone can't make-or-break a series, but that is irrelevant anyway when it comes to Persona 4 The Animation. The background music is composed by Shoji Meguro, who also composed the music for the game, and it doesn't disappoint, especially during battle scenes. A lot of the music has been recycled from the game and rightly so; why change something that's already superb? The OP and ED themes are new, but they're done in the same style as the OP: sung in English but still sounding incredible. The Japanese VAs have done a good job (which is expected as they also voiced the characters in the game, and therefore have previous experience), and more often than not they suit the roles well.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several characters in P4, and most seem to have made the transition from game to anime. The main character, Yu Narukami, was previously a silent protagonist but now has a voice and his own personality. The latter is initially quite bland but develops as his stats and social links develop; after a few episodes he becomes central to a fair few hilarious quips and situations. The rest of the main cast are a varied but likeable bunch, and each viewer will probably have their own favourites. This anime series has an interesting method of introducing the main characters and molding their personalities, by which I mean that it's incorporated into the Midnight Channel, one of the major plot points. Aside from Yu Narukami, some members of the main cast start out as plain high school students, but their backgrounds and insecurities are revealed as the anime progresses. As mentioned, the battles are entertaining but rather than just having persona-users as mere spectators, they feel pain when their personas are attacked, which raises the stakes and makes them more involved. Finally, the appearance of two mysterious characters (Igor and Margaret) at the beginning of each episode help to summarize which social links or bonds of friendship were developed by Yu in the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll assume that the majority of Persona 4 veterans will agree that it was a brilliant, or at the very least good, game for the Playstation 2. Therefore, it has two important challenges: to satisfy those who've played the game, and to appeal to those who haven't but are looking to watch a good anime series. The anime is a faithful adaptation, so anyone who liked the game can now enjoy watching it as a TV series. It's vastly entertaining and contains mystery, action and adventure in a high school/small town setting. Admittedly, the story does take a while to get going for those unfamiliar to P4, due to questionable pacing and an initial monster-of-the-week feeling to episodes. However, get past this and you'll find a decent series that's slightly different to others in its genre. \\n\\n\r\nIf the quality found in P4 The Animation becomes the usual standard for anime adapted from games, I'd definitely watch more of them. It complements the game adequately and while it remains quite faithful the anime also includes a lot of new stuff, as well as a heavier use of comedy. These changes allow Persona 4 The Animation to be watched as a standalone series, but at the end of the day existing P4 fans should enjoy the anime more because seeing how it handles the familiar characters and story from the game is great fun; newcomers will probably score the series a bit lower. Video gamers can look forward to more of Persona 4 in future: an updated port of the original game on Playstation Vita, and a spin-off fighting game on PS3/Xbox360.\\n\\n\r\nNote: An unaired episode that adapts the video game's True Ending is scheduled to be released in August 2012.",

            "content": "The majority of people seem to praise Persona 4: The Animation for its faithfulness to the source material, calling it \u201cthe best game-to-anime adaption ever made.\u201d As someone who finished their first playthrough of the game while the series was almost halfway through syndication, I\u2019ll agree, the series is certainly faithful. And game-to-cinema adaptions don\u2019t really have a high standard anyways, so this is probably the best adaption also. However, this is ultimately one of the main reasons why The Animation fails to be as good as the original game. (And since the original game\u2019s story was merely \u201cgood\u201d in my eyes, this causes TheAnimation to sink down into mediocre.)\\n\\n\r\nThere seems to be  misconception that if an adaption is faithful enough to the source material, than it\u2019s garanteed to be good-so long as the source material was good in the first place. This is incorrect because when a story is written for certain medium, it tends to work best in that medium because that\u2019s what the story was designed for. Persona 4 fundamentally works best as a video-game, because that\u2019s what it was written for. You could still make a good television series out of it, but in order for that to happen you have to actually change stuff and play around with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of these problems is the pacing. Persona 4 is a game where you live out the player-protagonist\u2019s highschool life day by day, with trips to the TV world every few weeks. It takes about 60-80 hours to beat, and features a very slow pacing. For a 25 episode television series, they of course would need to compress the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, it\u2019s not until a whole hour into the game until the player-protagonist actually gets to fight some Shadows. Since fighting Shadows is apart of the show\u2019s premise, you of course need to include that in the pilot. Therefor, the writers had to rush through the first hour of the game and compress into a 20-minute episode, which results in an overtly fast pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly is the formulaic structure that comprises the majority of the plot. It roughly goes something like this: \u201cEpisode A: The heroes find out who\u2019s on the Midnight Channel, and try to gather information on them so that they can save them from the TV world \u2013> Episode B: The heroes go into the TV world, and rescues the victim. The victim then joins their party and helps out in the next story arc\u2013> Episode C: Filler episode \u2013> Repeat.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe formula was no problem in the game, since the slow pacing made it so you barely even noticed the formula in the first place. However, since the formula goes through a mere three episodes of the anime, the quicker pacing makes it seem more repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there\u2019s Yu\u2019s ability to summon multiple Persona\u2019s, and acquire  \u201dSocial Links.\u201d In the video-game, these are only briefly explained, but it\u2019s no problem because it makes sense in the context of a video-game. But with The Animation,  they still don\u2019t bother to give an in-depth explanation, and it no longer makes any sense because it doesn\u2019t have the context of a game to back it up. In the game it makes complete sense from a game play mechanic, but in The Animation it serves absolutely no purpose other than to occasionally show off some of the obtainable demons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows where it starts out rather nicely; even though the first few episodes suffered from such overtly-fast pacing, they were otherwise rather enjoyable and of decent quality. After episode 4 however, the series started to steep deeper and deeper into mediocracry, and it wasn\u2019t until episode 21 (near the end of the series) that it finally started to be of exceptional quality. This is partially due to how the series quickly starts to focus less on the mystery aspects of the plot, and more on the formulaic nature of rescuing people from the TV world and forming Social Links. In other words, barely anything interesting actually happened for a large part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen each character is introduced in their respective story-arcs, they are indeed compelling characters with a good amount of depth to them. However, as soon as they face their inner selves and are rescued from the TV world, they quickly degrade into flat one-dimensional characters. They\u2019re all still likable to a certain extent, but not enough to make slice-of-life episodes (i.e. the filler episodes) worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were also underwhelming, usually feeling rushed. They barely have any tension to them, and usually ended far sooner than you would have liked them to. A few times they tried to mix up the fights by adding in some zany element, such as the male characters turning into old men, or the a hot liquid appearing on the floor that impaired the characters movements. Sometimes it worked, but other times it was just added a bit of stupid and unnecessary comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything that saves this show from being terribly mediocre, it\u2019s the final four episodes that manage to pull a few plot twists and make the whole mystery plot actually interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating:  6/10.\\n\\n\r\n For the most part this is a mediocre series, but it had enough saving qualities for me to rate this as \u201cabove average.\u201d For a short while each character was compelling and complex, and the last four episodes were of exceptional quality.\\n\\n\r\nBut even so, I highly recommend you avoid this series, and just play the original video-game. I wouldn't call the game a masterpiece or anything, but it's certainly better than The Animation is virtually every way.",

            "content": "Can any of you actually say there was a good video game based anime series? Seriously, the majority of them are... er, bland, and that's just saying the least about them. Regarding the Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 based anime, I think I speak for every fan of the persona series when I say that it was nothing that we were expecting in the worst way possible. Yet, not all of them get a rare second chance at redemption like the Persona series, and the Persona 4 anime could very well be the best video game based anime we'll ever see to date, but ofcourse it has it's share of problems.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: In the backwater town of Inaba, mysterious events from strange murder cases to midnight showings of people in ways they have never been seen before begin to arise. But fortunately a transfer student with strange powers is on the case with his slowly growing group of friends.\\n\r\nWith my dose of sarcasm out of the way, Persona 4 The Animation is based off of the popular (Not in sales numbers but in fandom) Playstation 2 game, Persona 4 (The name gives it's self away). As video game based anime go, this could honestly be the best in very many aspects.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the anime is very true to the source material. Character models are close to original as they will ever be, the adaption doesn't take very many liberties with the story so fans shouldn't be disappointed, and it even goes beyond and takes many elements from the game to add oh so many charms and lovable quirks like the critical hits animations. It's all great, but, this anime may be just too faithful to the game it's based on.\\n\r\nAnd then there's elements that any the fans of the game will understand, like the main character's ability to swap Personas when the rest of the cast can not, the best explanation that non fans can think of is that he's the main character and he is special.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the main character, Yu Narukami (Which isn't his real name, but Protagonist isn't an actual name so anything would've worked, even Fluffy Puppy would work because you can name him whatever you want, and yes that's what I named him in my game), is the biggest blank slate of a main character I've ever seen. And, unfortunately, it's understandable, a main character who acts according to your commands in the game, will never be a deep and interesting character with your commands now stripped away, but at least the dialogue that comes from him is hilarious at times. But it feels like you're watching him on cruise control, that is if you played the game. Okay, he isn't a complete blank slate, at the very least he has a stoic personality and emotes well when the occasion calls for it, especially in the later episode where you'd start to think he's making up for lost time, but he's using what he has left very well.\\n\r\nBut the rest of the cast is so much more animated and filled with with more life than the game, which is to be excepted. If they weren't, they wouldn't be animated. Bad pun... but it's also about as funny as the humor is, which is an abused amount of overreactions from each other and an out of no where and dragged out cartoony chase scene that is uncomfortably shoe horned in.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the pacing, the pacing is very questionable at times, though I myself agree with the sped up beginning (Which in the game, what took the anime one episode to do, took the game literally four hours to accomplish before any actual gameplay would begin), several episodes tries way to hard to cram back story of characters into them and to conclude what took many hours for any player of the game to finish one dungeon and rescue one character, all done in a single episode or two. The pacing often feels awkward and rushed, but strangely enough these episodes actually add on to characters, that the game itself neglected to do, in a small amount of crammed time in single episodes.\\n\r\nFor example, the characters Chie and Yukiko are friends as soon you see them, but the anime goes into how they  met, in a very limited amount of time, however.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the way the story progresses is understandable if you think about it like this: The whole let's go to a dungeon to save someone and have them join up rinse and repeat is not the anime's fault, but the game itself. That's because, even though the story is very anime appropriate, there's the challenge of turning (As a fan of the persona series I'll admit) repetitive dungeon crawling into a cohesive ongoing story. It's easy to do short term by filling those moments with heavy action sequences and forced comedy, but it's going to be repetitive in the long run because of how faithful the anime is inspiring to be.\\n\r\nBut there is one more thing that still transferred over from video to anime extremely well, the mystery that grabs the anime initially. It's take some sharp turns without cutting the corners, and the twists are awe inspiring and never makes you feel it was pulled out of no where, and the end result reveals to you something that, unless you played the game to the very end, someone was never who they appeared to be. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Action scenes are spectacular and well animated, and the personas look great (And not ghost-like, like in that other persona anime). Character designs are diverse, and creatures and personas are very creative looking. There are animation quirks and even a lot of times where characters go off model, but it's not enough to fully shit talk about (And apparent rumors are apparently half right about the animation quality). The last episode however, makes me think they blew the entire animation budget, in a good way, and it's a huge upgrade to previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I love Shoji Meguro's stuff, and as a fan of both the game and his music, I'm ecstatic to hear that the original soundtrack is being used in full force. But it is probably the laziest thing about the anime on a whole. Unlike that other persona anime where it had it's own soundtrack to work with, it's clear laziness that the animation company used the original soundtrack from the game itself in order to be faithful. But it really helps that the soundtrack is great and incredibly catchy, and the opening and ending theme music (Which is the only original music made for the anime) are of that quality.\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice acting is good, but as an anime fan that prefers to listen to an audio in my own language, nothing more than the original cast from the game can satisfy me. Thankfully sentai went above and beyond for the english dub, gathering the majority of the original cast like Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey. However, there two noticeable absentees, like the original voice for Chie,  Tracey Rooney, is replaced by Erin Fitzgerald, who doesn't just do a replica of the old performance, but instead makes the character her own and does an arguably better job as the character than Tracey. The other replacement is Teddie's voice actor, Dave Writtenburg, whom is now being voiced by Sam Riegal, however unlike Chie's new voice actor, he is simply trying his best to mimic the original performance. Fortunately he to does a reasonable job with the role making the english cast feel complete despite the replacements.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Decent animation with faithful character designs to the original.\\n\r\n+ Mystery from the game transferred over very well, keeping one hooked as it's pulls a unexpected surprising twist to those who never played the game or finished playing it.\\n\r\n+ English voice cast from the original game it's based off of mostly returned with the new additions doing well enough for those who couldn't make it back.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Faithful to the original source material / Faithful to a fault.\\n\r\n+/- Added character development that the game neglected / Too short of time to work with development, main character isn't interesting.\\n\r\n+/- Great music / Recycled music from the game is abused.\\n\r\n+/- Persona designs look cool. / Watching Yu switch from Persona to Persona on the fly will confuse those who are not familiar with the game it's based on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the game, I'm satisfied with the results, and I'm glad I'm not anal and nit picky like most stubborn fans. The Persona 4 anime is as good as it gets as game based anime is concerned. I'm personally happy how faithful it is to the game, but newer viewers are going to need to brush up on the game to fully enjoy the anime as a fan like myself has.",

            "content": "so here goes my first review. I felt like I had to get this off my chest because I loved Persona 4 (and 3) and I was really looking forward to this anime since I heard of its existence a while back. I will say this: this will be my honest and brutal as-can-be opinion. I haven't really decided yet what scores I'll give in each category as of writing this sentence, but I have a feeling it's going to be pretty low in some of them. however, I still enjoy the show merely because I enjoyed the game so much. I'm even watching itwith friends who haven't played it (one of them played 3) and I like being the \"expert\" telling them facts and trivia about it. I'd also like to apologies for my writing, if it actually bothers you because of its length or its awkward wording. anywho, on to the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: this is one of the times I wish I /hadn't/ played the game. I don't know if it's because of that, but the show seems to really rush through things. as mentioned in other reviews and even something I was expecting before I even watched the thing, quite a few scenes from the show is either omitted or switched about. I would say that the scenes they omitted were trivial if it weren't for the fact that there are one or two trivial additions. when I watched the pilot, I was surprised when I saw that I was already half way done. if I remember right, they were only going to do 26 episodes or so(?) so I guess they have a lot to squeeze in. I don't remember where I heard that number from and I can't find any good sources to an exact number either, so don't trust me on that. some scenes seemed a little over-exaggerated from how they originally were, also. for example, I don't remember Kubo being as aggressive and creepy as he did in the anime. nervous and creepy, yes, but not this. aside from that, it's pretty faithful to the game. I was somewhat shocked with how faithful it was in some aspects. I wasn't so sure they would include the Wild Card system because I wasn't sure how they would implement it, but it looks like they're gonna have a go at it. I also enjoyed how they kept the weather system and the player status and even how they made up for some scenes that would otherwise be awkward to convey out-of-game. not bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt: this is the main thing that bugs me and I can explain it very simply. just by looking at Yosuke's hair, you can tell the difference in art. one style has Yosuke's hair a bit wavy, while the other has it... er... a bit too spikey, even for Yosuke. we could say \"well, they might've done the scenes out of order and later they got too lazy to put so much effort into his hair.\" however, you can also tell the difference from other things like the body build, facial structure, etc. and then there is the third that actually looks like the original artwork. so there is a good, middle and bad, original-artwork-looking-one being the good and horribly-spikey-yosuke being bad. as for the coloring, well that's the easiest to explain. I didn't really care for it in the game and I don't in the show either. It's really, uh, mushy? the actual animation also shifts a bit. it goes from being a decent modern day animation to a decent early 90s animation. some movements seems well done while others seem to cut corners and make the characters look stiff. all in all, I'm a big fan of Shigenori's artwork, so I'm a bit disappointed how this turned out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: this is another instance where I sometimes wish I hadn't played the game, but this one isn't much of a big deal. most of the music comes from the original. yes, this means the silly engrish songs too. there's a few new songs, I believe. either that or I've never picked them up, in-game. the songs are put where they need to be, so good on them. the reason I regret my playthrough is because every now and then you can tell where the music has been edited, which will throw you off. but, again, it's not a big deal. the voice acting is done with the original cast from the game (if you hadn't already heard for the millionth time). I played the game dubbed and only played the undubbed for maybe an hour or two, so I can't really say much. the voice acting by itself is obviously very good. with the animation, though, I would honestly have to say it's wasted effort. I had wondered from the beginning if this would mean that the english cast would dub the anime, if they decided to bring it overseas.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Main character first, seeing as how this is what I was the most curious about. humorously enough, it was just as I expected if not a little more. he's bland and unfazed, just like how I made myself in 3&4. it also makes it comedic. I also see hints that he will be quite brotherly to Nanako so yaaaay! the other characters on the other hand... is just another thing that seems really rushed in the sake of development. I also think quite a few important qualities are missing from the characters. Yosuke doesn't seem nearly as annoyed about the world as he did in the game, Chie seems a bit too feminine, and Yukiko... is she even in this show? sometimes I forget she even is and I can't help but gasp an \"oh\" when I see her. they all seem just like regular ol', generic anime high school students. maybe it'd help if I didn't already know the characters in depth. the main reason I fell in love with the game was that I was attracted to the characters and their personalities. as lame as it sounds, they really did feel like my friends.  it's only two episodes in so I'll cross my fingers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: well, of course I enjoy it. despite all its flaws, I'll still watch this through to the end. the way I see it, the fans will be split between those who will and won't continue to watch this. they each will have their own reasons as to why whether it be obscure or dot-the-i's specific. over-fanatic, over-disappointed, over-whatever. mine is pretty obscure; I just want to watch this thing. and I am, in fact, enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: well, there's my review. I really do hate rating animes as a whole, and that especially goes for unfinished ones. I'll just go with the average. As much as I looked forward to it, I guess you can say I realistically expected it to not be all that great. The Persona series are great games, but they're not the best or most popular. And let's be serious. This is AIC ASTA we're talking about.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nSince this is Persona 4 The Animation, it's understandable that they made everything like that of the game. No fault in that, really. It's about some Tokyo kid named Narukami Yu (Or Seta Souji. Or whatever you named the MC when you played) who transfers to the province because of his parents work. He stays there for a year with his uncle who is, if I remember correctly, is the chief of the police force. Conveniently, weird shit started happening as soon as he moves to the place. People who are being featured on Mayonaka TV are being kidnapped and being the MC, hehas to save each and everyone of them with his band of buddies. That's basically it. There are twists in the end. Some pretty good emotional points every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI've always thought there was something weird with the lower portion of the characters faces being darker than their upper portion. It only bothered me a bit while playing the game because you weren't really constantly seeing the 2D animu versions of the characters. That aside, the backgrounds and everything else are really great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nI love how they used the original BGM but there are some moments where the BGM felt awkward due to excessive use. There's no issue with using BGM every single second in a video game, the characters don't speak all the time and you have to fill in the silence somehow. But that doesn't really work with anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the same without interaction. The characters lost a bit of themselves in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving this a seven out of ten because, you know, I already know what's going to happen and that's not really fun when you're watching a murder-mystery. ): But if you're a new timer, I'm telling you it gets pretty tight near the end. ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Story:  The story will probably be about the same as the video game seeing how it is playing a long, so I don't think I will really have any issues with it.  However the scenes seem to be a bit choppy.  They chopped it up to quickly and it goes to the next part before you are able to capture the emotion.  Like when his hand first gets sucked into the TV, it was not anything close to suspenseful, and I am not saying this just because I already knew what would happen.\r\nArt:  Oh my... I am very upset withthe Art.  The characters faces are blended strangely.  The coloring just doesn't look right.  The pattern on their uniforms is an eye sore and the character art does not compare to the art from the game.  It is not as solid, and the expressions are not solid.  this was one thing I thought I wouldn't have to encounter with this Anime.  The Art for the Persona at the end of episode 1 was much better than the art through out the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The sound seems to be okay,  Yosukes voice does not quite fit his character.  Some of the less important characters voices are not that great.  When it comes to music they used the exact same music from the game which isn't shocking but they could of mixed it up a little bit.  I feel like at this point that they were just trying to play it safe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters are okay.  Except it seems to clip from one emotion to the other too quickly in some parts.  Character display can go by too quickly at times.  Once again the character off is a little off.  I don't really like the changes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:  Unfortunately I am pretty disappointed with this so far.  I expected something at least a little better than this.  It would make a huge difference in the other categories if the art was better.  The music is enjoyable because I am so attuned to it.  I wish the main character stood out more.  I will probably watch the rest of it though to see what becomes of it.  If I had not played the video game I would probably of tossed this one to the curb and looked for something better to watch.  I wish I didn't feel like I had to give this such a terrible review.\\n\\n\r\nNote:  This is just from watching the first episode so I will re evaluate my opinion when I am done watching it.",

            "content": "First of all this is the first episode so nothing is certain yet.\r\nAnyway, let's start wasting my time on a review.\r\nFirst, this is based from Persona 4, a PS2 videogame and a sequel to Persona 3 (Makes me wonder why there is no P3 anime). Takes place in the same universe, just no big creepy towers this time. As mentioned earlier it's the first episode, so I can't speak much yet, but..\r\nStory:\r\nSome things are omitted from the game. Mostly trivial stuff, things that do not make a significant difference. The story didn't develop much.. yet.\r\nEveryone who played the game now should know how the storygoes. And unless you're one of these New Game++++++++++ people, omitted stuff should not or annoy you very little.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nCrap. I've got to the graphics part. Damn, this is not a videogame but hell it seems it invaded everywhere. Well, some people say looks don't matter, but people who know what marketing is would disagree. I'd also like to comment on them: Go protest for gay rights. (I do hope that offends.) It'll be great if they feel trolled, because those self-righteous bastards always find it justified to call me shallow.\\n\r\nAnyway as other reviewers noted, the art is not the best. But damnit, what were you expecting? 3D characters? Tactics menu? Personally I think the art is heartly enough, but that's perhaps because I watched it 720p on a 32' HDTV..\\n\\n\r\nI bet the art will get 100/10 once we get to Rise's part.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's based on the game, so naturally the BGM from the game will be played. Because it is the game, just an anime version, tracks play accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe only notable character is the MC, because in the game he doesn't speak (He does, you're just given usually three choices but there's no voice) and he does now. Feels the same for me.\\n\r\nOther than that, Yusuke still sexually harasses Chie and they get into occasional fights. Your normal animeistic fighting characters. Kind of disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyment.. it's pretty subjective. Actually, every damn word I type here is subjective. I enjoy it. Pretty sure some other people enjoyed it. Others maybe less.\\n\r\nI think that people who played the game will have a different type of enjoyment than people who did not. Different type is not less or more, don't get confused.\\n\r\nThere's also some elements taken from the games. The day progression and the character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOveralls suck! Oh, this isn't a fashion debate.. damn fashion disasters always have to ruin my day.\\n\r\nOveralls... this is the first episode. You know, magical stuff happens. Creepy people inviting you into their limo, with their assistant and who knows what happens there. There's still much to see.",

            "content": "Anime adapted from video games most likely won't live up to the fan's expectations. Sometimes they're way too rushed, sometimes they just don't work as an anime, sometimes they're not even faithful to its source material. The problem with video game adaptations is that, most of the time, it just feels like it's jumping from cutscenes to cutscenes without proper transition and characters weren't really... say... in-character.\r\nAdapted by AIC A.S.T.A, Persona 4 : The Animation is the perfect example of a video game adaptation done the right way. Almost everything is perfect, the story isn't rushed, the characters don't feel like puppets and it's VERYfaithful to its source material!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a series of mysterious murders occuring in the tranquil town Inaba. Whenever there's fog after heavy rain, someone dies. Also, rumors about a certain channel on television only airing at midnight named \"Mayonaka TV\", where one can see his other self on TV. After hearing about the recent murders, the brotagonist (yes-- you heard me. Brotagonist.) and his friends are determined to find the culprit behind the murders... and solve the mystery of the TV Channel. They later realize that the person appearing on TV at midnight is the next to die, and the brotagonist also discovers that TVs are gateway to another world infested of monsters called \"shadows\". Who is the culprit? What is \"Mayonaka TV\"?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise, albeit a little out of this world, has lived completely to my expectations. The only thing is that sometimes there are \"filler\" episodes (which are not really fillers and are a VERY important part of the story) where the brotagonist and his friends do random everyday shit. These episodes help developping characters and colorizing them. The mystery itself is executed perfectly and everything is foreshadowed subtly.\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the main flaw of the execution : the pacing. Every video game adaptation suffers from pacing issues, and Persona 4 : The Animation isn't an exception. The scenes are well transitioned; but jumping from, say, March 12 to March 15 in two scenes is a bit too fast. It can't be helped, though; the skipped days are gameplay-only and don't really bring anything new to the story or characters. In a way, it's good that they've skipped these parts, but it comes with a price, and that is pacing.\\n\\n\r\nLet's speak about characters. Persona 4 has a very wide and colorful cast of characters. Every single of them have issues in their lifes, secrets they wouldn't share with anyone, or simply problems they are unable to face. The brotagonist reaches out to them, and makes them face their \"true self\", which means, accepting who they are despite their flaws, and moving forward in life. The brotagonist also goes through the same process; at the beginning, he is known to be emotionless and not very sociable, but as the story goes on, he opens up to his friends and isn't afraid to show his true colors. The intermission in every episode also shows his \"stats\" reflecting his character development, quite an interesting way to show character development! In the end, the cast may seem very corny and stereotypical, but as the story goes on, they break their formulatic personalities and build their own.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and, I fucking hate the brotagonist's sense of fashion. Popped up collar is for douchebags, not for bros, man.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we're over with the story and characters, we'll go into the cosmetic aspect of the anime. The art and animation.\\n\\n\r\n...Horrible. It is completely horrible. Rumours are that the animators are not even getting paid. Is it because their work is so bad? Persona 4 is poorly animated. Backgrounds characters are drawn very sloppily and their faces don't seem... human. The movements are very stiff and robotic and there are a lot of stillframes... Closeups are not as bad, but the heads are rarely shaped the same way, LOL!\\n\r\nThe art, though, is very faithful to the original source. It gives a perfect Atlus-ish feeling, and I love it! The only thing is that sometimes their skin are a little too orange-ish, and that's pretty weird. They look like douchebags wearing too much fake tan. That might just be 'cause of the retarded animators, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nBGM and sound wise... I don't have much to say. It's the same soundtrack as Persona 4, composed by Shoji Meguro. The songs are pretty catchy but get repetitive really fast-- nothing of value to see here. The openings, both by Shihoko Hirata and are in engrish. They're pretty good, but \"I will strip search if I have to\" is a pretty damn funny lyric if you tell me. I can't take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\r\n+ Story is solid and executed perfectly\\n\r\n+ Characters are colorful and aren't afraid to break out of their stereotypic personalities\\n\r\n+ The brotagonist is fucking awesome\\n\r\n+ Lots of character development\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\r\n- The animation is horrible\\n\r\n- The BGMs are forgettable\\n\r\n- The pacing is a bit messed up\\n\r\n- The brotagonist's sense of fashion... seriously kids, don't look up to him!\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Persona 4 is the best video game adaptation I've seen, and it'll probably stay that way unless another studio decides to stop being retarded and do shit correctly.",

            "content": "Many video game-based anime titles I've come across haven't wowed me too well considering such titles are used mostly to promote their hit game source material and these don't always transition too well in creating a quality plot for an anime series. Persona 4 is another title I add to this growing list considering it's Playstation 2/ PSP video game source material was a huge hit with both American and Japanese fans thus this anime adaptation coming about. From what I gather, the video game is notable for its mix of RPG and social simulation elements through its Social Link system where your regular interactionswith your teammates and other characters allowed you to gain and strengthen the abilities of powerful beings called Personas that are used to fight monsters called Shadows within a mysterious world that can be traveled into through televisions as the bonds you establish with the game's characters deepen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime adaptation of Persona 4 takes on a mix of mystery/ action and slice-of-life comedy elements as the series mixes up episodes featuring Yu and his friends trying to figure out who is responsible for the mysterious murders and disappearances involving the TV world where they often battle enemy Shadows and gain a new ally in helping them solve the mystery like the former genre; and going about everyday activities like you would find in the latter genre. Rather than the series being prominently focused on the growing bonds that Yu establishes with different characters though, this anime adaptation appears to focus on how Yu's character becomes more open to others as he becomes more involved with the townsfolk, his friends and the relatives he stays with. This is clearly seen through the show's more mundane episodes as we see signs of Yu becoming more active, less withdrawn and willing to toss in the occasional witty line. This, and some of the show's mundane episodes, were highlights for me since there was clear development with Yu and some of the silly predicaments that he and his friends get themselves into. The show also sports some good quality visuals as they have bright colors and a good amount of visual detail with vast settings and the character designs very closely resembling how they looked from the video games.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond these praises though, Persona 4: The Animation does suffer from the fact it seems to be trying too hard to be as faithful to its video game source material as possible. The opening sequences seen at the start of many of the show's episodes with Igor and Margaret are actually quite pointless in this anime adaptation as the two don't contribute anything and seem to be added on just to please fans of the video game. The Persona/ Shadow battles aren't too engaging at many points as either they seem to try too hard in adding elements from the game like gaining new cards, summon animations in the style of the video game and Yu conveniently being the only character capable of summoning different Personas; or adapting elements from shounen action titles with characters either getting up after being heavily damaged in battle and suddenly getting power boosts or upgrades to beat their seemingly unstoppable foe. While the show's various mundane episodes are usually fun to see, they add nothing new to Persona 4's main plot with the TV world and actually make that plot slow to a halt when they come along. Plus while Yu does get some reasonable character development throughout the series, the same can't be said for many of the title's other characters, especially those among Yu's group who are tacked on with differing archetypes and don't develop any further once they come to terms with their Shadows when they are rescued.\\n\\n\r\nThe Persona 4 video game seems like a fun little premise I'd be willing to play on my PS2 whenever I work up the interest to buy the game. But as an anime, it tries too hard to incorporate as many of its elements into the animated adaptation as possible, even if those elements aren't exactly relevant or hinder things such as plot progression, engaging action scenes and character depth. This is yet another addition to my list of mediocre and horrible anime adaptations of popular video games I had to sit through.",

            "content": "Persona 4's anime adaptation came as a huge, but welcome surprise. Any fan of the highly-acclaimed video game would be curious as to how such an endeavor would turn out. After the initial announcement, there had been six months of waiting for previous and further announcements; it was six months of building hype until the airing of the first episode.\r\nDid it live up to the hype? A difficult, opinionated question, but as for myself, it managed to live up to expectations, and more.\r\nPersona 4 the Animation adapts one of the most critically-acclaimed JRPGs ever to grace the PS2. Just knowing this, it would either turnout to be a huge success or a huge failure depending on how it's handled. Thankfully, director Seiji Kishi manages to handle the difficult parts of adapting the game and manages to present not only a watchable, but an enjoyable adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest challenge to adapting a video game into an anime is making the anime enjoyable for both newcomers and old fans alike. Persona 4 the Animation manages to do so by keeping the game's atmosphere intact. I can't help but think that Seiji Kishi's brand of direction -- which one may be familiar with through Angel Beats! -- is well-suited for this particular anime; his balance of comedy and drama works for Persona 4 as it is the most light-hearted video game in a series known for its dark, dramatic and post-apocalyptic plots. The infamous comedic aspects of the game -- the camp-out, the school trip, and the school festival -- remain no less hilarious when animated, and the anime even manages to add to the hilarity with original content.\\n\\n\r\nAnother nice touch is how the staff intersperse many game mechanics into the anime. Fans of the video game would notice many subtle (and not-so-subtle) shout-outs to the game, such as the eye-catch for the Social Link stats, the passing of time, the various skills and abilities in the dungeon-crawling segments, and the Velvet Room segments at the start of each episode. They even managed to sneak in all of the Social Links, though the results of doing so are varied.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama doesn't lag behind from the comedy; the final story arcs in the anime manage to handle the most serious and dramatic parts of the game with great care, especially the episodes dedicated to a certain character's plot-related death, as well as the parts dedicated to the Investigation Team's decision to search for the truth. The episodes focusing on the Investigation Team characters -- particularly Rise's arc, which manages to integrate her Social Link development -- are particularly well-directed in terms of drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest draw to this anime comes from the sound direction, especially the music. Shoji Meguro returns as the composer for the anime, rehashing many of the great tracks found in the original video game. The anime's music is a mix of rock, J-pop, jazz, and piano music, providing a large variety of tracks to use for atmosphere. The opening themes -- \"sky's the limit\" and \"key plus words\" -- set the anime's tone similar to the game's with the familiar stilted English that fans of the Persona series have come to love. Episode 1 even rehashes the game's opening theme, Pursuing My True Self. The ending themes are fitting to end an episode with, showing the arcana that the main character has obtained through the course of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's voice acting is spectacular; of particular note are Rie Kugimiya, who manages to break out of her tsundere pigeonholing -- especially with Rise's brooding, depressed attitude during episodes 9 and 10; Yui Horie, who manages to make Chie Satonaka an energetic, lively character; Romi Park, who is particularly well-suited for the role given to her; and most especially Daisuke Namikawa, whose performance as Yu Narukami is impressive in both the deadpan and more expressive aspects.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while Persona 4 excels in many aspects, it also has its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the art is, while not particularly terrible, less-than-stellar at times. This is no longer much of a problem in the later episodes, but there are times where you might wonder if the artists and animators were half-asleep while working on the characters. Fortunately, this doesn't bleed into the action scenes, but it's still jarring to see the characters full of life in one scene then seem so lifeless in another.\\n\\n\r\nCertain plot events may also come across as cheesy, clich\u00e9d or contrived, a problem which was also present in the game. However, one can argue that these events are part of the game's themes -- that the bonds of people are the true power, that no one can live without facing themselves and other people, and that we must pursue the truth which lies behind the fog of lies.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the all-important question -- will you enjoy this anime? If you were a fan of the game, then yes, you will enjoy this anime for how well it adapts the original. If you're a first-time watcher, you'll enjoy this anime for the same reasons people enjoyed the game -- the comedy, the themes and the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nDue to time constraints, the last episode and the \"True Ending\" will be on DVD and Blu-ray on August 2012. The ending is deliberately cut short with the game's \"Normal Ending\", a clever piece of direction which manages to keep to the game's theme of \"seeking out the answers\" while advertising for the DVD and Blu-rays. Reach out to the truth, indeed.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re an RPG fan, then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve heard about the Shin Megami Tensei series. While it didn\u2019t achieve mainstream popularity in the west until the mid 2000' due to the release of two particular games, in the East it\u2019s been a mainstay of the genre since 1987. To give you a point of reference, that\u2019s the same year the original Final Fantasy hit the shelves. Damn.\r\nHowever as said before, it was through two particular games that the series reached widespread popularity in the west. Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 in 2006 and Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 in 2008, both of whichare part of the Persona sub-series. The games were definitely different from most other RPGs from the time, adding multiple Visual Novel-esque elements, focusing just as much on social interactions and school life as much as dungeon crawling. Also, Persona 4 is the game that made Troy Baker popular, so there\u2019s that\u2026 even though his overly busy schedule has not allowed him to keep playing his role in that game so he had to be replaced by Matthew Mercer like half his other Anime roles. Good job AAA Gaming.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyhow, in 2010, a mere two years after the game was released, an Anime adaptation for Persona 4 was made, simply titled Persona 4 The Animation. And the moment it was announced it was received with massive negativity as\u2026 the main character didn\u2019t have the same name as in the manga. Yeah\u2026 the fandom can be really dumb at times. In general though, this anime had a very mixed reception overall, some loving it and considering it an example on how to do videogame adaptations, and others hating it and considering it everything wrong with videogame adaptations. Unlike most of the times this happens, I did indeed pick a side and, as you can tell by the Score I gave this anime, I loved it. So, let\u2019s not waste any more time and face this beast:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re used to the story of the game (More specifically the Vanilla Version of Persona 4 as this came out before the PS Vita Version came out), you won\u2019t be exactly surprised. It\u2019s a very standard adaptation of the game. Yet there\u2019s part of where its strengths lie. Since it is so straightforward, it also allows for a lot of creative uses of all the secondary stuff. For instance, half the subplots are merged into two episodes all tied together by a frankly hilarious string of events.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not where all of its positives lie. The anime, in general, is really funny. Dare I say, funnier than the game itself. Some jokes are so absurdly ridiculous they end up working, the anime treats itself overly seriously in ridiculous situations (Never has fishing been so extremely funny) and it\u2019s just plain funny. Some of the jokes don\u2019t quite work out (No matter how much you try, cross-dressing isn\u2019t funny), but these are the exception rather than the rule. That said, it\u2019s telling that most of the dramatic moments still work out, sometimes even moreso.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaints with the plot are rather simple. The first is how Dungeon Crawling is handled. Generally, each dungeon with the exception of the first one will only get one episode, sometimes even less. To be fair, there isn\u2019t much to do with them (Mostly because the Dungeon maps were randomized), I just wish they\u2019d put a bit more effort in them. The second is the pacing. While the anime is mostly decently paced, it sometimes feels like if they\u2019re going from one scene to the next without much lead-in, and it can be kinda jarring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, the cast is certainly a colorful bunch. From the clumsy and arguably full of himself Hanamura Yosuke, the energetic and upbeat Kujikawa Rise, the though and MANLY Tatsumi Kanji, the cold and aloof Shirogane Naoto and quite a few more. Of course, none of them are quite what they seem. Just using the ones I mentioned earlier, Yosuke suffers from a massive inferiority complex, Rise\u2019s been an idol for so long she doesn\u2019t even know who she\u2019s supposed to be anymore, Kanji likes cute things (Which to me always made him manlier, to be honest) and Naoto is such a bag of emotional and temperamental insecurities it would take forever to explain them all. That said, they do have to come to terms to who they really are, which carries over to everyone else in the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBut by far this Anime\u2019s greatest achievement is its handling of its main character, Narukami Yu. The thing about Narukami in the game is that he didn\u2019t have a personality; he was a vessel for the player, one who rarely spoke or did anything outside from player control. So how did they translate this into the Anime? Well, to put it bluntly\u2026 whatever happens in Narukami\u2019s head is as mysterious as the stuff Osaka from Azumanga Daioh daydreams. He\u2019s stoic, but has a damn weird way of thinking. He gets along with people quite easily, but he\u2019s rather quiet. He can be somewhat respectful, but in general he\u2019s a massive snarker. Of course, this being Persona 4, nothing\u2019s quite like it seems, as Narukami has his own share of issues as shown it\u2019s shown over the course series. Overall, he\u2019s one of the best examples of how to make a silent protagonist no longer silent.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show looks okay. Things do occasionally go off model, but not too often. The fight scenes were pretty well done too, namely due to how chaotic they can be at times. My only real issue with the animation is that for whatever reason the top half of the character\u2019s faces has a different tone than the rest of their body. I don\u2019t know why or how this happened, but it can be quite distracting at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole Soundtrack from the game makes it out unscratched and transitions flawlessly into the animated medium. What\u2019s best is how well placed it is, as there are more than a few silent scenes here, and the mood of the songs does often match with what\u2019s happening on-screen. As for the Openings and Endings, I didn\u2019t care much for the endings, but I did like both of the openings quite a lot, with my favorite being \u201cSky\u2019s The Limit\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast from the game comes back and does a great job as always. Namikawa Daisuke in particular does a pretty great job as Narukami, as he really sells how\u2026 odd he is. I think the only performance I didn\u2019t care for that much was Kugimiya Rie as Rise, as I think she took the hyper side of her character a bit too far at times. By contrast, her FMA co-star Park Romi had my favorite performance overall as Naoto, as she just completely sold Naoto\u2019s initially cold demeanor. And of course, there\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite nutcase: Madono Mitsuaki. This guy\u2026 he\u2019s just a sight to behold, isn\u2019t he?\\n\\n\r\nThe rest is great too; we have Koshimizu Ami, Moribuko Showtaro, Horie Yui, Seki Tomokazu, Ohara Sayaka, Ono Daisuke, Ito Miki, Yamaguchi Kappei, Yuuki Aoi (In a rare, pre-Madoka Magica role), and of course, the Great Late Ishizuka Unsho. Overall, they already had a great cast to begin with, so it was just a matter of bringing the band back together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I really enjoyed this anime. While not flawless, I think this is the perfect example on how you should do a videogame adaptation. It\u2019s accessible enough for newcomers so that they become interested to play the game, but also brings enough new stuff to the table to bring old fans in. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, really.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

None of the feelings and emotions are lost in the transfer; the characters and story are kept fully in-tact, for the most part. \r\nTo start with the negatives;\r\n- It's a relatively short series.\r\nAs a result of the number of episodes being limited, a lot of stuff outside of the story doesn't make the cut. This putsa little damper on things for fans of the series going in. Certain events are covered too quickly, if they even make it in at all. It's completely understandable, but a little disappointing. Apart from a few instances later on, this point isn't really relevant to those who haven't played the game. \\n\\n\r\n- The story, again. \\n\\n\r\nPersona 4 is a monster of a game. People sink at least 40-60 hours into one play through. The problem arises when trying to fit all of this into 25 episodes (and an OVA). This isn't a humongous problem, as the characters are the driving force of the series, but it does mean that certain details are left out. Certainly towards the end of the series, this lack of detail could lead to a lot of confusion; it doesn't really do the best job of explaining itself.\\n\\n\r\nYou could bypass these by arguing that the animated series gives watchers the incentive to go and play the original material. This is true, but it still doesn't excuse the confusion that's present. They could've taken out some of the rushed parts that are irrelevant to the story and used that time to delve into the finer points of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the positives!\\n\\n\r\n- The Story.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's somewhat rushed and unexplained, the concept behind  P4: The Animation is an extremely interesting one. It pulls you in and has a few intense moments. It explores the idea of one's self and the importance of acceptance. It's really heavy stuff, but it portrays it in a way that anyone could understand. \\n\\n\r\n- The Art.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simply beautiful. I didn't notice any inconsistencies or hiccups, and the series really brings Inaba to life in a way that the original material couldn't. It's a nice, fresh look at small country town and a much welcomed one. \\n\\n\r\n- The Sound\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the tracks were taken directly from the game, but this does nothing but play to its strengths. The Persona series in general has fantastic OSTs, and this is no exception. A nice mix of Pop and Rock, and the prominence of violins in the majority of the tracks really helps to capture the atmosphere of the series. \\n\\n\r\n- The Characters\\n\\n\r\nI'd argue that this is the series' strongest asset. Watching through, I couldn't believe how well they'd done with them. The way they introduce the characters and eventually reveal their struggles is amazing. Even with the rushed pace of the series, it doesn't falter for a second in this regard. The high school setting also helps with this; the characters are put in all different sorts of situations, be it a class trip or group work, which leads to a lot of development. The seemingly mundane tasks and instances in some episodes make the series a lot more realistic, allowing the viewer to easily grow attached to the main group. \\n\\n\r\nIn short : The characters are amazing!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really enjoyed the series, if you couldn't tell. The consistent presence of humour throughout the series had me laughing, and the contrast of that with the dark story led to a really interesting experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : This is a series that anyone could pick up, no matter what genre you're a fan of. (Although, there aren't any Mechs. Personas are just as good, though!) It tackles very serious subject matter, but mixes it all with humour and happiness. Truly a unique experience, and one that you should have as soon as possible if you haven't already!",

            "content": "Before I start, please keep in mind this is MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION and that this is my review on the anime, NOT the video game.\r\nI'm a huge fan of the Persona 4 video game, so I was excited when I found out there was an animation. I was expecting the anime to be a total bust judging from other (poorly) done video game adaptions I've watched or heard about, and I was pleasantly surprised when I began watching as it far exceeded my expectations.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe plot is pretty straight forward - the protagonist moves to Inaba with his uncle as his parents are stuckon a business trip and a series of murders begin occurring. It's original, enjoyable, and most importantly, well done. There are many plot twists throughout the entirety of the series that will make you keep on watching to the very end. The one thing that seemed to bother me was that it seemed to leave out some minor, and very rarely major information that may leave someone who has never played the game for themselves very confused at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI, personally, loved the art style used in this, especially since the creators stayed loyal to the video game style which made me very, VERY happy. The art particularly shines the brightest during the battle scenes. There's always so much going on during them, and they managed to pull it off with a great deal of success.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen I began playing the game, the first thing I noticed was the great soundtrack, so seeing all the songs from the track being put to use was amazing, especially \"Castle\" and \"Reach Out To The Truth\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes the show what it is. The characters are extremely lovable, each one taking on their own unique personality. By the end of the series, you're 100% going to favor a certain character. I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis may be an inaccurate score as I watched the entire series with a close friend of mine, though I firmly believe that even if I had watched it alone, I would have enjoyed it just as much. We started it, watching constantly and before we knew it, we had finished the series. I haven't had this much fun watching anything in a long, long while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDon't assume that I don't believe the series doesn't have its flaws, because of course it does, along with any other anime, or any show for that matter, but there doesn't seem to be any crucial faults that necessarily need to be pointed out. This series made me laugh, cry, and maybe even do both at the same time, which is why I give this series a 10. I enjoyed it a lot and I think that's really all that matters.",

            "content": "*I've never played the video game this anime was based on. I wasn't even aware there was one. Also I'm not going to summarize the story because I'm kind of lazy. I just want to get my opinion of the show, purely as an anime, out there. \r\nThe story is pretty interesting, but it's definitely not the most captivating or interesting one I've seen. But the characters meld together nicely and provide some nice comedic relief. The story is pretty easy-going, and is similar to Samurai Champloo in that it's more of a \"take it as it is\" animation. Not everything is explained, and theyvery effectively use sound to convey mood instead of pure dialogue. But I do sometimes wish they could be more clear. I've never been lost, but I do think that certain parts could be conveyed more clearly. Even though I've only seen about 12 episodes, each one has been pretty predictable. I'm sure down the road there will be more plot twists, but for now it's a pretty easy-going show. Most of the episodes have followed the same archetype, like Pokemon, where we know how the conflict will end.  So far, it may not have been very challenging, but it's still enjoyable. I give the story an 7.\\n\\n\r\nI really know nothing about animation. But I do like the art in this show. It's clean and colorful and you can tell they spent some money on the animation, especially in episode 9. I would give it a 9, but compared to say Samurai Champloo, the characters aren't as individualized, which is a really big thing for me. If I change the hairstyle of one character, I want to be able to still tell who that character is. I give the art an 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nice as well. Using the same story archetype for each character is a pretty easy yet effective form of characterization. But it kind of irks me how easily definable each character is. The characters aren't cliched, per se, but they are quite predictable. They lack mystery, and it feels as though there isn't much left to their pasts. But that's a really nit-picky thing to say. Probably the most interesting character for me is Narukami, but that's because his character hasn't been defined as clearly as the others. I know I complain a lot, but one thing I do enjoy is that even though the characters may be a bit predictable, they are consistent. Through the dialogue, the characters help more firmly define each others personalities, and help provide for this consistency. Overall, the characters get an 7.\\n\\n\r\nI've personally enjoyed this anime so far. It's not even close to being one of my favorites, but it is pretty funny at times. I like how laid-back the show feels. Even if there is a murderer out on the loose, the show doesn't feel to urgent. This also has to do with the pace of the show, which was done very well. Enjoyment gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would have to say this show gets a 7. I say this because while it was enjoyable, and the majority of my scores were 8's, it's just not as good as others I've seen. So far at least, it hasn't drawn me in as some other shows that may not have been ranked so highly. I know that this entire show is a mystery, but I don't stay up at night wondering who the killer might be. Maybe that is due to its laid-back nature, but this show in general was pretty basic. It was in general, good.  And a 7 is good, but not a \"stay up all night and watch this show because it's life-changing\" kind of good.",

            "content": "Story - 7/10 - While I personally enjoyed the story of Persona 4 The Animation, there were a few hiccups that I would imagine that others would be less forgiving of.  I enjoyed the symbolism and character development throughout the series and the comedy scenes nearly had me in tears but there were a few instances where the slice-of-life episodes were a little too drawn out, slowing down the pace of the show.  Another thing that might bother other viewers is the fact that this anime follows the story of the game a little too closely.  People who have beaten Persona 4will already know the major twists and turns which might spoil some of the fun along the way.  On the other hand, people who haven't played the game might not understand some of the ins and outs that veterans of the series already understand (I had to have a friend clue me in on a few things that didn't make sense to me).  But other than these minor complaints, I can't think of any other criticisms I have for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10 - I really enjoyed the art and animation used in P4 The Animation.  The liberal use of yellow really fits the mood that the series is going for and the bright and well animated Openings are some of the best I've seen in an anime.  The animation is well done and looks fine but isn't anything worth writing home about.  The only issue I have with the art style is the use of orange on character's faces to imitate shadows.  Oftentimes, this either makes the characters look like they all have 5 o'clock shadows or (if viewed from farther away) very painful-looking  sunburns over their mouths and cheeks.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 - Persona 4 The Animation has some of the best music in an anime that I've ever heard.  Each of the songs is either lifted from Persona 4 (the game) or has been written specifically for the animation.  Also, fans of Persona 3's music will be in for a treat during an episode where the characters visit a certain Gekkoukan High School.  The only part of the sound design that I have to criticize is the voice of Teddie.  They could not have picked a more obnoxious voice for this mascot character...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10 - The characters are the real meat of the anime.  Almost every character manages to be interesting and believable no matter the circumstances. After all, this show is all about the characters coming to grip with parts of their personalities that they don't wish to recognize.  The main character is especially entertaining due to the fact that he doesn't fall into the same trap that many of the common stereotypical protagonists do in many animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 - I absolutely LOVED this show.  I am now officially obsessed with the Persona series after watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10 - While there are a few minor issues that bug the show, this is definitely a must-see in my opinion.  The good bits FAR outweigh the bad parts so you should definitely drop what you're doing right now and watch this.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",

            "content": "Persona 4 The Adaptation results\r\n\"Persona 4 The Animation\" is based on the PS2 Game \"Persona 4\", and adapts the plot it in 25 episodes, covering it untill the normal ending (the game has multiple endings, and the \"True ending\" will come out as an OVA later).\r\n[If you have not played the game and are interested in playing it, I recomend you to do so before watching so you won't kill the 60 hours+ gameplay's suspense, where the plot is much more detailed. The game is much better, really.]\r\nPeople look to this anime in 2 ways: comparing it to the game, or looking at it independently.I will try to put things in both perspectives, but I can not deny the game keeps advantage by far in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progression analysis\\n\\n\r\n>Intro (Quite good)\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when Yu Narukami (canon anime name of the game's nameless silent protagonisti) moves to his uncle and cousin's house in the \"peaceful rural town\" of Inaba, to stay for a year while his parents work aboard. Then, after his arrival a series of bizarre murders start to happen.\\n\r\nThe first episode speeds up the slow game intro events into a wise way, merging part of the two first times they enter into the TV world into one, thus allowing an action sequence in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes with the velvet open the episodes keeping track of the evolution of Yu's arcana powers by linking to other people. That was an aewsome idea and fitted very well the anime to represent the protagonist's visits to it (alongside some scenes with it during some episodes).\\n\\n\r\n>First major change (Kind of upsetting)\\n\\n\r\nThen the second episode made one of the major changes from the game (that became more clear as new episodes came out), the persona users would not use weapons nor fight directly agains the shadows. The combat in The Animation is fully by summoning, and if the casted personas take a hit, it's master will fell the damage.This second point is interesting and a good addition, but the lack of weapons helped to kill the action, even thou making sense (once in the game, even after the police oficcer issue they still carried weapons to Junes by \"hiding\" them and a lot of armors into their school uniforms, and we never saw any backpack...)\\n\\n\r\n>The Action sequences (Bad)\\n\\n\r\nIf you have played the game you might be a little upset by now with this change (removing the weapons), but even the new audience may think the combat is dull, lacking of action and in most times \"to easy\" to win. Party members other than the protagonist are most of times useless and most of the job is done in seconds by him.\\n\r\nThe animation in battles even in the bluray versions (that fix some weird animated points) doesn't help a lot, it's just not exciting.\\n\\n\r\n>Social links (Good, well made for just 25 episodes)\\n\\n\r\nIn the game the \"social links\" were some sort of simulation date event's to raise the friendship level with someone, powering the arcana that represents it's life dilema thus making the protagonist more powerfull to summon personas of that respective arcana, and by it's max level allowing him to summon it's signature ultimate persona.\\n\r\nWithout a guide and a new game+, most people will not master all the 21 social links, the anime covered that by shortcuting what takes to master  or even the concept of really mastering them. It's hard not to be expectiong a game that can take more than 80 hours to finish to not be rushed in 25 anime format episodes. In that point, Persona 4 The Animation was good, but seeing how Persona Trinity Soul (weird and boring anime sequence to Persona 3) got twice episodes makes me wonder that this anime could have used the links a lot more, beeing even able to make fillers about side stories withou it beeing non interesting once these plots are really relevant for the game.\\n\\n\r\nMixing social links like with Strenght and Moon in one episode was a good Idea as well, that made the event's not that acurate to the game but turned it in the kind of \"filler\"/ modification that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ending showing the obtained arcanas of the episode falling to Yu's hands was brilliant. \\n\\n\r\n>The plot suspense (Bad)\\n\\n\r\nDue it being rushed, the storyline had only a few moments to focus on beeing tense and create a heavier mistery atmosphere. That along with most of the humor scenes apearing among the investigations made it sound like joke or superficial. Even that simple the plot twists and suspense seemed a lot more intense in game then in the anime adaptation.\\n\r\nIf you haven't played,once the plot is very rushed and it doesn't have a lot of episodes, you might watch it beeing ok to it due the lot of information they will  be throwing at you (not that much).\\n\\n\r\n>Humor (Sorry, but it was funnier in the game once it didn't seem that much like a joke most of times)\\n\\n\r\nFor the ones who played, most of the funny parts are in The Animation, but it's not that funny 'cause the rushed plot made it sound like the same jokes were beeing told again in short periods of time.\\n\r\nIf you haven't played the game you may still notice a lot of humor sequences, I do not guarantee they will succeed, but there are some funny events.\\n\\n\r\n>Silent Protagonist personality traits and power evolution (Ok but too rushed half of time)\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist in game was silent and almost only talked by choices given to the player. With hiis personality becomes more strong by making friends and raising traits and that can be seen in the anime, where his trait status apears in the between break scene. Again that is something that apears to be too much focused in comedy, when sometimes he stands in a way players would not imagine (this akward moments are kind of funny for the ones who played, talking about fun who want to talk about murders? I mean, about the moment he falls in the river with the most \"silent protagonist\" face).\\n\r\nAs he gets stronger bonds he is able to summon and fuse more powerfull personas, what gets kind of rushed for him to be summoning high level stuff in what should be the second dungeon of the game for instance.\\n\\n\r\n>Audio (Ok, a lot from the original game sound track with some reencarnation remixes and good new ones, but many times missplaced)\\n\\n\r\nI guess everything was too rushed to make some relevant sound tracks apear for a decent time (noes Heaven plays for only like 8 seconds).\\n\r\nThe dub had a lot of actors who dubbed the game and that a very good thing.\\n\\n\r\n>The Animation (Bad, lol)\\n\\n\r\nApparently the studio was having some issues among the cast and it not end well. Some of the animation was fixed to the bluray version but it doesn't save the action scenes just because they may look better in graphics.\\n\\n\r\n>The Design (Good, downgraded in the anime)\\n\\n\r\nThe game's original Atlus' design looks more elegant, the old animated cutscenes from it are simple and the characters barelly move on them but the art style was \"darker\" even in the \"everything is yellow\" concept of the game. As I said, I don't think the animation keeps up with enough suspense.\\n\r\nIn the animation the boys seem a little too \"big / large\" maybe because the way the uniform was drawn.\\n\\n\r\n>Conclusion \\n\\n\r\nPlayed the game score: 5 of 10\\n\\n\r\nHaven't played the game score: 6 of 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have played the game you may have a lot of complains but it's still enjoyable to watch to review the facts. If not it's quite a regular show but I still recomend you to play over to watch it if you have a chance.\\n\r\nPersona 4 The Animation had everything to be a great anime with more episodes, and the social link aspect could be used to creat cliche happy-go japanese anime schoolife fillers that would even be sort of fun to watch. Too bad it was so rushed and the combat so nerfed, being utopic here I would like to see a Persona 4 The Animation: Goldenhood (only the smarts wil get).",

Not only is it poorly done in respect to anime as a whole, but it is poorly done even compared to some other video game adaptations. I fully expect I'll get a lot of hate for this, so please let me explain first. \r\nThe story is pretty typical for what you would find in most JRPGs these days, but one of the unique things about the Persona franchise has been the blend between the dating-sim styled day-to-day activities and theRPG combat. Most of the action takes place in a world hidden by all but a few lucky people granted the power of a Persona, the manifestation of the person's psyche which is used to fight shadows inside of the TV world. While it's fairly generic and comes with its fair share of clich\u00e9s, it works well because the story is self-aware and does not try to take itself too seriously. It's a fairly light-hearted story even in the midst of all the murders, kidnappings, and crazy things going on. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any inherent problem with the story here because it's simply being taken from an already well-written series. The story was fine in the game, and for the most part it's fine here too. What there IS a problem with, however, is the pacing. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing can be likened to teleportation. It's  a disorganized mess of scenes abruptly changing from one to another with a calendar flashing for a few moments. No, the people behind the adaptation don't care about pacing-- instead they use the calendar as a lazy excuse to not deal with coherent pacing. You might have the main character sitting at a table talking with the group for all of around 30 seconds and then the calendar will simply flash on screen, skipping past several days and taking you into a completely different scene with almost no link or correlation with what just happened. Sometimes the days flash by so fast that you don't even know what the hell is happening any more. Sometimes you will have a dungeon given three entire episodes dedicated to it, and another dungeon will have less than half an episode. It makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe calendar system and the day-to-day activities worked fine in the game, but this is not the game. It does not work here and it does not fit. This is an anime, not a video game, and the people behind the anime should at least try and make sure it translates properly into a condensed, strictly visual form. You can't simply take the game and then slap it into an anime. You need to make adjustments, you need to make changes, and you need to make sure it fits the medium that you are adapting it to. The staff behind the Persona 4 adaptation don't understand this important philosophy. It instead feels like they're awkwardly trying to recreate the feel of the game, but failing pretty miserably at it. I felt like I was getting a headache at times trying to follow the constant warping of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you haven't played the games, don't expect to understand much of what is going on. You will probably be lost and confused amidst the pacing, especially when important plot points and characterization is skipped upon and barely explained. There really needed to be two seasons of anime here because it's clear as day how rushed it is. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's not the only problem here. Both the animation and the art style are also poorly done. There is a strange lack of color throughout the entire show, which is odd given how colorful and vibrant the game was. Each character is drawn poorly and colored in with ugly looking gradients, something that you would expect from a high school computer animation class, not a commercial product created for thousands of people. It's all very bland and amateurish. There's also a startling lack of animation here. One character will have their mouth flap while everybody else in the background is static and motionless, often complete with disproportional faces and odd expressions, looking stupefied. For a lack of a better term, it's very 'derp'. Even when there is a decent amount of animation happening on screen it's usually done poorly with glaring mistakes in between movements, usually body parts morphing into strange shapes. Either they were lacking budget or something went horribly wrong in the production of the anime... either way, it has some of the worst art and animation I've seen in a mainstream anime. For all the years it took for the series to get a 'proper' anime adaptation, when it looks as poorly as this, well... was it really worth it?\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the music is very nice and the remixed and new tracks are greatly appreciated. It helps to spice things up a little bit from the game, though there are problems even here since the background songs will abruptly switch from one to another with complete dissonance and shifts in tone. The music itself is good, but the application of the music is not. Instead of awkwardly switching between music all the time, the staff could have opted to just use silence or ambient noise from time to time instead, and save the music only for the scenes where it truly fits in. It should feel natural, and here it just stands out in a really unpleasant way. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, there just isn't much good I can say for the anime. There's a few brief moments of hilarity scattered here and there, and while it's nice to see all the characters fully animated, the entire time I was watching it just made me want to go replay the game instead. A good adaptation wouldn't make you want to do that. The anime is nothing more than  fanservice for people who have played and enjoyed the games, and even as fanservice it fails in some pretty major areas. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe other people will enjoy it more than me, but Persona 4 deserved so much more than this.",

            "content": "\"Bonds of people is the true power\"\r\nPersona 4 is one of the best video games that I have had the chance to play. Despite being highly acclaimed by critics both in Japan and in the West, Persona 4 remains somewhat of a niche title and this more or less transfers to the anime adaptation too. As a result, those who have played the game are the ones best-placed to be able to fully appreciate the anime series, but new fans will also find a very good anime thanks to Aniplex doing a commendable job with the existing game material.\r\nThe opening episodes set the story upquite well with mysterious deaths, the TV world, shadows and personas. The main character, along with another high school student, get involved through various circumstances and then strive to solve the murder cases, meanwhile gaining new friends and abilities. However, it does take a while before huge plot developments start to occur, and these are spread out unevenly over the course of the series. As a result, the pacing is off throughout certain episodes and some important revelations are only lightly touched upon. Social links are a crucial feature in Persona 4; these are several side stories which detail the interactions and bonds that form between the main character and supporting characters. Certain social links are arguably more enjoyable to watch in the anime rather than play in the game, as there's original material which fleshes them out better. Others, however, feel rather rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThe game features several short anime-styled cut scenes, and the anime series is similar in terms of artwork and animation. Character designs, which have been copied from the game, are simple and sharp. This means it's decent, but compared to certain other anime it's probably not as visually striking. In some episodes the animation is quite inconsistent; for example, facial expressions are usually good but sometimes become lifeless. Nevertheless, the battle scenes featuring personas and shadows are mostly excellent and full of action, appropriate BGM and variation. It's also amusing that the anime retains the look and feel of a video game; the main character's stats appearing halfway through each episode, as well as the calendar being displayed when each day passes are just a couple of examples.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, in my opinion, is the best aspect of this anime. Poor music alone can't make-or-break a series, but that is irrelevant anyway when it comes to Persona 4 The Animation. The background music is composed by Shoji Meguro, who also composed the music for the game, and it doesn't disappoint, especially during battle scenes. A lot of the music has been recycled from the game and rightly so; why change something that's already superb? The OP and ED themes are new, but they're done in the same style as the OP: sung in English but still sounding incredible. The Japanese VAs have done a good job (which is expected as they also voiced the characters in the game, and therefore have previous experience), and more often than not they suit the roles well.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several characters in P4, and most seem to have made the transition from game to anime. The main character, Yu Narukami, was previously a silent protagonist but now has a voice and his own personality. The latter is initially quite bland but develops as his stats and social links develop; after a few episodes he becomes central to a fair few hilarious quips and situations. The rest of the main cast are a varied but likeable bunch, and each viewer will probably have their own favourites. This anime series has an interesting method of introducing the main characters and molding their personalities, by which I mean that it's incorporated into the Midnight Channel, one of the major plot points. Aside from Yu Narukami, some members of the main cast start out as plain high school students, but their backgrounds and insecurities are revealed as the anime progresses. As mentioned, the battles are entertaining but rather than just having persona-users as mere spectators, they feel pain when their personas are attacked, which raises the stakes and makes them more involved. Finally, the appearance of two mysterious characters (Igor and Margaret) at the beginning of each episode help to summarize which social links or bonds of friendship were developed by Yu in the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll assume that the majority of Persona 4 veterans will agree that it was a brilliant, or at the very least good, game for the Playstation 2. Therefore, it has two important challenges: to satisfy those who've played the game, and to appeal to those who haven't but are looking to watch a good anime series. The anime is a faithful adaptation, so anyone who liked the game can now enjoy watching it as a TV series. It's vastly entertaining and contains mystery, action and adventure in a high school/small town setting. Admittedly, the story does take a while to get going for those unfamiliar to P4, due to questionable pacing and an initial monster-of-the-week feeling to episodes. However, get past this and you'll find a decent series that's slightly different to others in its genre. \\n\\n\r\nIf the quality found in P4 The Animation becomes the usual standard for anime adapted from games, I'd definitely watch more of them. It complements the game adequately and while it remains quite faithful the anime also includes a lot of new stuff, as well as a heavier use of comedy. These changes allow Persona 4 The Animation to be watched as a standalone series, but at the end of the day existing P4 fans should enjoy the anime more because seeing how it handles the familiar characters and story from the game is great fun; newcomers will probably score the series a bit lower. Video gamers can look forward to more of Persona 4 in future: an updated port of the original game on Playstation Vita, and a spin-off fighting game on PS3/Xbox360.\\n\\n\r\nNote: An unaired episode that adapts the video game's True Ending is scheduled to be released in August 2012.",

            "content": "The majority of people seem to praise Persona 4: The Animation for its faithfulness to the source material, calling it \u201cthe best game-to-anime adaption ever made.\u201d As someone who finished their first playthrough of the game while the series was almost halfway through syndication, I\u2019ll agree, the series is certainly faithful. And game-to-cinema adaptions don\u2019t really have a high standard anyways, so this is probably the best adaption also. However, this is ultimately one of the main reasons why The Animation fails to be as good as the original game. (And since the original game\u2019s story was merely \u201cgood\u201d in my eyes, this causes TheAnimation to sink down into mediocre.)\\n\\n\r\nThere seems to be  misconception that if an adaption is faithful enough to the source material, than it\u2019s garanteed to be good-so long as the source material was good in the first place. This is incorrect because when a story is written for certain medium, it tends to work best in that medium because that\u2019s what the story was designed for. Persona 4 fundamentally works best as a video-game, because that\u2019s what it was written for. You could still make a good television series out of it, but in order for that to happen you have to actually change stuff and play around with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of these problems is the pacing. Persona 4 is a game where you live out the player-protagonist\u2019s highschool life day by day, with trips to the TV world every few weeks. It takes about 60-80 hours to beat, and features a very slow pacing. For a 25 episode television series, they of course would need to compress the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, it\u2019s not until a whole hour into the game until the player-protagonist actually gets to fight some Shadows. Since fighting Shadows is apart of the show\u2019s premise, you of course need to include that in the pilot. Therefor, the writers had to rush through the first hour of the game and compress into a 20-minute episode, which results in an overtly fast pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly is the formulaic structure that comprises the majority of the plot. It roughly goes something like this: \u201cEpisode A: The heroes find out who\u2019s on the Midnight Channel, and try to gather information on them so that they can save them from the TV world \u2013> Episode B: The heroes go into the TV world, and rescues the victim. The victim then joins their party and helps out in the next story arc\u2013> Episode C: Filler episode \u2013> Repeat.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe formula was no problem in the game, since the slow pacing made it so you barely even noticed the formula in the first place. However, since the formula goes through a mere three episodes of the anime, the quicker pacing makes it seem more repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there\u2019s Yu\u2019s ability to summon multiple Persona\u2019s, and acquire  \u201dSocial Links.\u201d In the video-game, these are only briefly explained, but it\u2019s no problem because it makes sense in the context of a video-game. But with The Animation,  they still don\u2019t bother to give an in-depth explanation, and it no longer makes any sense because it doesn\u2019t have the context of a game to back it up. In the game it makes complete sense from a game play mechanic, but in The Animation it serves absolutely no purpose other than to occasionally show off some of the obtainable demons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows where it starts out rather nicely; even though the first few episodes suffered from such overtly-fast pacing, they were otherwise rather enjoyable and of decent quality. After episode 4 however, the series started to steep deeper and deeper into mediocracry, and it wasn\u2019t until episode 21 (near the end of the series) that it finally started to be of exceptional quality. This is partially due to how the series quickly starts to focus less on the mystery aspects of the plot, and more on the formulaic nature of rescuing people from the TV world and forming Social Links. In other words, barely anything interesting actually happened for a large part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen each character is introduced in their respective story-arcs, they are indeed compelling characters with a good amount of depth to them. However, as soon as they face their inner selves and are rescued from the TV world, they quickly degrade into flat one-dimensional characters. They\u2019re all still likable to a certain extent, but not enough to make slice-of-life episodes (i.e. the filler episodes) worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were also underwhelming, usually feeling rushed. They barely have any tension to them, and usually ended far sooner than you would have liked them to. A few times they tried to mix up the fights by adding in some zany element, such as the male characters turning into old men, or the a hot liquid appearing on the floor that impaired the characters movements. Sometimes it worked, but other times it was just added a bit of stupid and unnecessary comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything that saves this show from being terribly mediocre, it\u2019s the final four episodes that manage to pull a few plot twists and make the whole mystery plot actually interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating:  6/10.\\n\\n\r\n For the most part this is a mediocre series, but it had enough saving qualities for me to rate this as \u201cabove average.\u201d For a short while each character was compelling and complex, and the last four episodes were of exceptional quality.\\n\\n\r\nBut even so, I highly recommend you avoid this series, and just play the original video-game. I wouldn't call the game a masterpiece or anything, but it's certainly better than The Animation is virtually every way.",

            "content": "Can any of you actually say there was a good video game based anime series? Seriously, the majority of them are... er, bland, and that's just saying the least about them. Regarding the Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 based anime, I think I speak for every fan of the persona series when I say that it was nothing that we were expecting in the worst way possible. Yet, not all of them get a rare second chance at redemption like the Persona series, and the Persona 4 anime could very well be the best video game based anime we'll ever see to date, but ofcourse it has it's share of problems.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: In the backwater town of Inaba, mysterious events from strange murder cases to midnight showings of people in ways they have never been seen before begin to arise. But fortunately a transfer student with strange powers is on the case with his slowly growing group of friends.\\n\r\nWith my dose of sarcasm out of the way, Persona 4 The Animation is based off of the popular (Not in sales numbers but in fandom) Playstation 2 game, Persona 4 (The name gives it's self away). As video game based anime go, this could honestly be the best in very many aspects.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the anime is very true to the source material. Character models are close to original as they will ever be, the adaption doesn't take very many liberties with the story so fans shouldn't be disappointed, and it even goes beyond and takes many elements from the game to add oh so many charms and lovable quirks like the critical hits animations. It's all great, but, this anime may be just too faithful to the game it's based on.\\n\r\nAnd then there's elements that any the fans of the game will understand, like the main character's ability to swap Personas when the rest of the cast can not, the best explanation that non fans can think of is that he's the main character and he is special.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the main character, Yu Narukami (Which isn't his real name, but Protagonist isn't an actual name so anything would've worked, even Fluffy Puppy would work because you can name him whatever you want, and yes that's what I named him in my game), is the biggest blank slate of a main character I've ever seen. And, unfortunately, it's understandable, a main character who acts according to your commands in the game, will never be a deep and interesting character with your commands now stripped away, but at least the dialogue that comes from him is hilarious at times. But it feels like you're watching him on cruise control, that is if you played the game. Okay, he isn't a complete blank slate, at the very least he has a stoic personality and emotes well when the occasion calls for it, especially in the later episode where you'd start to think he's making up for lost time, but he's using what he has left very well.\\n\r\nBut the rest of the cast is so much more animated and filled with with more life than the game, which is to be excepted. If they weren't, they wouldn't be animated. Bad pun... but it's also about as funny as the humor is, which is an abused amount of overreactions from each other and an out of no where and dragged out cartoony chase scene that is uncomfortably shoe horned in.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the pacing, the pacing is very questionable at times, though I myself agree with the sped up beginning (Which in the game, what took the anime one episode to do, took the game literally four hours to accomplish before any actual gameplay would begin), several episodes tries way to hard to cram back story of characters into them and to conclude what took many hours for any player of the game to finish one dungeon and rescue one character, all done in a single episode or two. The pacing often feels awkward and rushed, but strangely enough these episodes actually add on to characters, that the game itself neglected to do, in a small amount of crammed time in single episodes.\\n\r\nFor example, the characters Chie and Yukiko are friends as soon you see them, but the anime goes into how they  met, in a very limited amount of time, however.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the way the story progresses is understandable if you think about it like this: The whole let's go to a dungeon to save someone and have them join up rinse and repeat is not the anime's fault, but the game itself. That's because, even though the story is very anime appropriate, there's the challenge of turning (As a fan of the persona series I'll admit) repetitive dungeon crawling into a cohesive ongoing story. It's easy to do short term by filling those moments with heavy action sequences and forced comedy, but it's going to be repetitive in the long run because of how faithful the anime is inspiring to be.\\n\r\nBut there is one more thing that still transferred over from video to anime extremely well, the mystery that grabs the anime initially. It's take some sharp turns without cutting the corners, and the twists are awe inspiring and never makes you feel it was pulled out of no where, and the end result reveals to you something that, unless you played the game to the very end, someone was never who they appeared to be. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Action scenes are spectacular and well animated, and the personas look great (And not ghost-like, like in that other persona anime). Character designs are diverse, and creatures and personas are very creative looking. There are animation quirks and even a lot of times where characters go off model, but it's not enough to fully shit talk about (And apparent rumors are apparently half right about the animation quality). The last episode however, makes me think they blew the entire animation budget, in a good way, and it's a huge upgrade to previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I love Shoji Meguro's stuff, and as a fan of both the game and his music, I'm ecstatic to hear that the original soundtrack is being used in full force. But it is probably the laziest thing about the anime on a whole. Unlike that other persona anime where it had it's own soundtrack to work with, it's clear laziness that the animation company used the original soundtrack from the game itself in order to be faithful. But it really helps that the soundtrack is great and incredibly catchy, and the opening and ending theme music (Which is the only original music made for the anime) are of that quality.\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice acting is good, but as an anime fan that prefers to listen to an audio in my own language, nothing more than the original cast from the game can satisfy me. Thankfully sentai went above and beyond for the english dub, gathering the majority of the original cast like Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey. However, there two noticeable absentees, like the original voice for Chie,  Tracey Rooney, is replaced by Erin Fitzgerald, who doesn't just do a replica of the old performance, but instead makes the character her own and does an arguably better job as the character than Tracey. The other replacement is Teddie's voice actor, Dave Writtenburg, whom is now being voiced by Sam Riegal, however unlike Chie's new voice actor, he is simply trying his best to mimic the original performance. Fortunately he to does a reasonable job with the role making the english cast feel complete despite the replacements.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Decent animation with faithful character designs to the original.\\n\r\n+ Mystery from the game transferred over very well, keeping one hooked as it's pulls a unexpected surprising twist to those who never played the game or finished playing it.\\n\r\n+ English voice cast from the original game it's based off of mostly returned with the new additions doing well enough for those who couldn't make it back.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Faithful to the original source material / Faithful to a fault.\\n\r\n+/- Added character development that the game neglected / Too short of time to work with development, main character isn't interesting.\\n\r\n+/- Great music / Recycled music from the game is abused.\\n\r\n+/- Persona designs look cool. / Watching Yu switch from Persona to Persona on the fly will confuse those who are not familiar with the game it's based on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the game, I'm satisfied with the results, and I'm glad I'm not anal and nit picky like most stubborn fans. The Persona 4 anime is as good as it gets as game based anime is concerned. I'm personally happy how faithful it is to the game, but newer viewers are going to need to brush up on the game to fully enjoy the anime as a fan like myself has.",

            "content": "so here goes my first review. I felt like I had to get this off my chest because I loved Persona 4 (and 3) and I was really looking forward to this anime since I heard of its existence a while back. I will say this: this will be my honest and brutal as-can-be opinion. I haven't really decided yet what scores I'll give in each category as of writing this sentence, but I have a feeling it's going to be pretty low in some of them. however, I still enjoy the show merely because I enjoyed the game so much. I'm even watching itwith friends who haven't played it (one of them played 3) and I like being the \"expert\" telling them facts and trivia about it. I'd also like to apologies for my writing, if it actually bothers you because of its length or its awkward wording. anywho, on to the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: this is one of the times I wish I /hadn't/ played the game. I don't know if it's because of that, but the show seems to really rush through things. as mentioned in other reviews and even something I was expecting before I even watched the thing, quite a few scenes from the show is either omitted or switched about. I would say that the scenes they omitted were trivial if it weren't for the fact that there are one or two trivial additions. when I watched the pilot, I was surprised when I saw that I was already half way done. if I remember right, they were only going to do 26 episodes or so(?) so I guess they have a lot to squeeze in. I don't remember where I heard that number from and I can't find any good sources to an exact number either, so don't trust me on that. some scenes seemed a little over-exaggerated from how they originally were, also. for example, I don't remember Kubo being as aggressive and creepy as he did in the anime. nervous and creepy, yes, but not this. aside from that, it's pretty faithful to the game. I was somewhat shocked with how faithful it was in some aspects. I wasn't so sure they would include the Wild Card system because I wasn't sure how they would implement it, but it looks like they're gonna have a go at it. I also enjoyed how they kept the weather system and the player status and even how they made up for some scenes that would otherwise be awkward to convey out-of-game. not bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt: this is the main thing that bugs me and I can explain it very simply. just by looking at Yosuke's hair, you can tell the difference in art. one style has Yosuke's hair a bit wavy, while the other has it... er... a bit too spikey, even for Yosuke. we could say \"well, they might've done the scenes out of order and later they got too lazy to put so much effort into his hair.\" however, you can also tell the difference from other things like the body build, facial structure, etc. and then there is the third that actually looks like the original artwork. so there is a good, middle and bad, original-artwork-looking-one being the good and horribly-spikey-yosuke being bad. as for the coloring, well that's the easiest to explain. I didn't really care for it in the game and I don't in the show either. It's really, uh, mushy? the actual animation also shifts a bit. it goes from being a decent modern day animation to a decent early 90s animation. some movements seems well done while others seem to cut corners and make the characters look stiff. all in all, I'm a big fan of Shigenori's artwork, so I'm a bit disappointed how this turned out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: this is another instance where I sometimes wish I hadn't played the game, but this one isn't much of a big deal. most of the music comes from the original. yes, this means the silly engrish songs too. there's a few new songs, I believe. either that or I've never picked them up, in-game. the songs are put where they need to be, so good on them. the reason I regret my playthrough is because every now and then you can tell where the music has been edited, which will throw you off. but, again, it's not a big deal. the voice acting is done with the original cast from the game (if you hadn't already heard for the millionth time). I played the game dubbed and only played the undubbed for maybe an hour or two, so I can't really say much. the voice acting by itself is obviously very good. with the animation, though, I would honestly have to say it's wasted effort. I had wondered from the beginning if this would mean that the english cast would dub the anime, if they decided to bring it overseas.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Main character first, seeing as how this is what I was the most curious about. humorously enough, it was just as I expected if not a little more. he's bland and unfazed, just like how I made myself in 3&4. it also makes it comedic. I also see hints that he will be quite brotherly to Nanako so yaaaay! the other characters on the other hand... is just another thing that seems really rushed in the sake of development. I also think quite a few important qualities are missing from the characters. Yosuke doesn't seem nearly as annoyed about the world as he did in the game, Chie seems a bit too feminine, and Yukiko... is she even in this show? sometimes I forget she even is and I can't help but gasp an \"oh\" when I see her. they all seem just like regular ol', generic anime high school students. maybe it'd help if I didn't already know the characters in depth. the main reason I fell in love with the game was that I was attracted to the characters and their personalities. as lame as it sounds, they really did feel like my friends.  it's only two episodes in so I'll cross my fingers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: well, of course I enjoy it. despite all its flaws, I'll still watch this through to the end. the way I see it, the fans will be split between those who will and won't continue to watch this. they each will have their own reasons as to why whether it be obscure or dot-the-i's specific. over-fanatic, over-disappointed, over-whatever. mine is pretty obscure; I just want to watch this thing. and I am, in fact, enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: well, there's my review. I really do hate rating animes as a whole, and that especially goes for unfinished ones. I'll just go with the average. As much as I looked forward to it, I guess you can say I realistically expected it to not be all that great. The Persona series are great games, but they're not the best or most popular. And let's be serious. This is AIC ASTA we're talking about.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nSince this is Persona 4 The Animation, it's understandable that they made everything like that of the game. No fault in that, really. It's about some Tokyo kid named Narukami Yu (Or Seta Souji. Or whatever you named the MC when you played) who transfers to the province because of his parents work. He stays there for a year with his uncle who is, if I remember correctly, is the chief of the police force. Conveniently, weird shit started happening as soon as he moves to the place. People who are being featured on Mayonaka TV are being kidnapped and being the MC, hehas to save each and everyone of them with his band of buddies. That's basically it. There are twists in the end. Some pretty good emotional points every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI've always thought there was something weird with the lower portion of the characters faces being darker than their upper portion. It only bothered me a bit while playing the game because you weren't really constantly seeing the 2D animu versions of the characters. That aside, the backgrounds and everything else are really great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nI love how they used the original BGM but there are some moments where the BGM felt awkward due to excessive use. There's no issue with using BGM every single second in a video game, the characters don't speak all the time and you have to fill in the silence somehow. But that doesn't really work with anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the same without interaction. The characters lost a bit of themselves in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving this a seven out of ten because, you know, I already know what's going to happen and that's not really fun when you're watching a murder-mystery. ): But if you're a new timer, I'm telling you it gets pretty tight near the end. ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Story:  The story will probably be about the same as the video game seeing how it is playing a long, so I don't think I will really have any issues with it.  However the scenes seem to be a bit choppy.  They chopped it up to quickly and it goes to the next part before you are able to capture the emotion.  Like when his hand first gets sucked into the TV, it was not anything close to suspenseful, and I am not saying this just because I already knew what would happen.\r\nArt:  Oh my... I am very upset withthe Art.  The characters faces are blended strangely.  The coloring just doesn't look right.  The pattern on their uniforms is an eye sore and the character art does not compare to the art from the game.  It is not as solid, and the expressions are not solid.  this was one thing I thought I wouldn't have to encounter with this Anime.  The Art for the Persona at the end of episode 1 was much better than the art through out the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The sound seems to be okay,  Yosukes voice does not quite fit his character.  Some of the less important characters voices are not that great.  When it comes to music they used the exact same music from the game which isn't shocking but they could of mixed it up a little bit.  I feel like at this point that they were just trying to play it safe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters are okay.  Except it seems to clip from one emotion to the other too quickly in some parts.  Character display can go by too quickly at times.  Once again the character off is a little off.  I don't really like the changes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:  Unfortunately I am pretty disappointed with this so far.  I expected something at least a little better than this.  It would make a huge difference in the other categories if the art was better.  The music is enjoyable because I am so attuned to it.  I wish the main character stood out more.  I will probably watch the rest of it though to see what becomes of it.  If I had not played the video game I would probably of tossed this one to the curb and looked for something better to watch.  I wish I didn't feel like I had to give this such a terrible review.\\n\\n\r\nNote:  This is just from watching the first episode so I will re evaluate my opinion when I am done watching it.",

            "content": "First of all this is the first episode so nothing is certain yet.\r\nAnyway, let's start wasting my time on a review.\r\nFirst, this is based from Persona 4, a PS2 videogame and a sequel to Persona 3 (Makes me wonder why there is no P3 anime). Takes place in the same universe, just no big creepy towers this time. As mentioned earlier it's the first episode, so I can't speak much yet, but..\r\nStory:\r\nSome things are omitted from the game. Mostly trivial stuff, things that do not make a significant difference. The story didn't develop much.. yet.\r\nEveryone who played the game now should know how the storygoes. And unless you're one of these New Game++++++++++ people, omitted stuff should not or annoy you very little.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nCrap. I've got to the graphics part. Damn, this is not a videogame but hell it seems it invaded everywhere. Well, some people say looks don't matter, but people who know what marketing is would disagree. I'd also like to comment on them: Go protest for gay rights. (I do hope that offends.) It'll be great if they feel trolled, because those self-righteous bastards always find it justified to call me shallow.\\n\r\nAnyway as other reviewers noted, the art is not the best. But damnit, what were you expecting? 3D characters? Tactics menu? Personally I think the art is heartly enough, but that's perhaps because I watched it 720p on a 32' HDTV..\\n\\n\r\nI bet the art will get 100/10 once we get to Rise's part.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's based on the game, so naturally the BGM from the game will be played. Because it is the game, just an anime version, tracks play accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe only notable character is the MC, because in the game he doesn't speak (He does, you're just given usually three choices but there's no voice) and he does now. Feels the same for me.\\n\r\nOther than that, Yusuke still sexually harasses Chie and they get into occasional fights. Your normal animeistic fighting characters. Kind of disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyment.. it's pretty subjective. Actually, every damn word I type here is subjective. I enjoy it. Pretty sure some other people enjoyed it. Others maybe less.\\n\r\nI think that people who played the game will have a different type of enjoyment than people who did not. Different type is not less or more, don't get confused.\\n\r\nThere's also some elements taken from the games. The day progression and the character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOveralls suck! Oh, this isn't a fashion debate.. damn fashion disasters always have to ruin my day.\\n\r\nOveralls... this is the first episode. You know, magical stuff happens. Creepy people inviting you into their limo, with their assistant and who knows what happens there. There's still much to see.",

            "content": "Anime adapted from video games most likely won't live up to the fan's expectations. Sometimes they're way too rushed, sometimes they just don't work as an anime, sometimes they're not even faithful to its source material. The problem with video game adaptations is that, most of the time, it just feels like it's jumping from cutscenes to cutscenes without proper transition and characters weren't really... say... in-character.\r\nAdapted by AIC A.S.T.A, Persona 4 : The Animation is the perfect example of a video game adaptation done the right way. Almost everything is perfect, the story isn't rushed, the characters don't feel like puppets and it's VERYfaithful to its source material!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a series of mysterious murders occuring in the tranquil town Inaba. Whenever there's fog after heavy rain, someone dies. Also, rumors about a certain channel on television only airing at midnight named \"Mayonaka TV\", where one can see his other self on TV. After hearing about the recent murders, the brotagonist (yes-- you heard me. Brotagonist.) and his friends are determined to find the culprit behind the murders... and solve the mystery of the TV Channel. They later realize that the person appearing on TV at midnight is the next to die, and the brotagonist also discovers that TVs are gateway to another world infested of monsters called \"shadows\". Who is the culprit? What is \"Mayonaka TV\"?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise, albeit a little out of this world, has lived completely to my expectations. The only thing is that sometimes there are \"filler\" episodes (which are not really fillers and are a VERY important part of the story) where the brotagonist and his friends do random everyday shit. These episodes help developping characters and colorizing them. The mystery itself is executed perfectly and everything is foreshadowed subtly.\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the main flaw of the execution : the pacing. Every video game adaptation suffers from pacing issues, and Persona 4 : The Animation isn't an exception. The scenes are well transitioned; but jumping from, say, March 12 to March 15 in two scenes is a bit too fast. It can't be helped, though; the skipped days are gameplay-only and don't really bring anything new to the story or characters. In a way, it's good that they've skipped these parts, but it comes with a price, and that is pacing.\\n\\n\r\nLet's speak about characters. Persona 4 has a very wide and colorful cast of characters. Every single of them have issues in their lifes, secrets they wouldn't share with anyone, or simply problems they are unable to face. The brotagonist reaches out to them, and makes them face their \"true self\", which means, accepting who they are despite their flaws, and moving forward in life. The brotagonist also goes through the same process; at the beginning, he is known to be emotionless and not very sociable, but as the story goes on, he opens up to his friends and isn't afraid to show his true colors. The intermission in every episode also shows his \"stats\" reflecting his character development, quite an interesting way to show character development! In the end, the cast may seem very corny and stereotypical, but as the story goes on, they break their formulatic personalities and build their own.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and, I fucking hate the brotagonist's sense of fashion. Popped up collar is for douchebags, not for bros, man.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we're over with the story and characters, we'll go into the cosmetic aspect of the anime. The art and animation.\\n\\n\r\n...Horrible. It is completely horrible. Rumours are that the animators are not even getting paid. Is it because their work is so bad? Persona 4 is poorly animated. Backgrounds characters are drawn very sloppily and their faces don't seem... human. The movements are very stiff and robotic and there are a lot of stillframes... Closeups are not as bad, but the heads are rarely shaped the same way, LOL!\\n\r\nThe art, though, is very faithful to the original source. It gives a perfect Atlus-ish feeling, and I love it! The only thing is that sometimes their skin are a little too orange-ish, and that's pretty weird. They look like douchebags wearing too much fake tan. That might just be 'cause of the retarded animators, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nBGM and sound wise... I don't have much to say. It's the same soundtrack as Persona 4, composed by Shoji Meguro. The songs are pretty catchy but get repetitive really fast-- nothing of value to see here. The openings, both by Shihoko Hirata and are in engrish. They're pretty good, but \"I will strip search if I have to\" is a pretty damn funny lyric if you tell me. I can't take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\r\n+ Story is solid and executed perfectly\\n\r\n+ Characters are colorful and aren't afraid to break out of their stereotypic personalities\\n\r\n+ The brotagonist is fucking awesome\\n\r\n+ Lots of character development\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\r\n- The animation is horrible\\n\r\n- The BGMs are forgettable\\n\r\n- The pacing is a bit messed up\\n\r\n- The brotagonist's sense of fashion... seriously kids, don't look up to him!\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Persona 4 is the best video game adaptation I've seen, and it'll probably stay that way unless another studio decides to stop being retarded and do shit correctly.",

            "content": "Many video game-based anime titles I've come across haven't wowed me too well considering such titles are used mostly to promote their hit game source material and these don't always transition too well in creating a quality plot for an anime series. Persona 4 is another title I add to this growing list considering it's Playstation 2/ PSP video game source material was a huge hit with both American and Japanese fans thus this anime adaptation coming about. From what I gather, the video game is notable for its mix of RPG and social simulation elements through its Social Link system where your regular interactionswith your teammates and other characters allowed you to gain and strengthen the abilities of powerful beings called Personas that are used to fight monsters called Shadows within a mysterious world that can be traveled into through televisions as the bonds you establish with the game's characters deepen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime adaptation of Persona 4 takes on a mix of mystery/ action and slice-of-life comedy elements as the series mixes up episodes featuring Yu and his friends trying to figure out who is responsible for the mysterious murders and disappearances involving the TV world where they often battle enemy Shadows and gain a new ally in helping them solve the mystery like the former genre; and going about everyday activities like you would find in the latter genre. Rather than the series being prominently focused on the growing bonds that Yu establishes with different characters though, this anime adaptation appears to focus on how Yu's character becomes more open to others as he becomes more involved with the townsfolk, his friends and the relatives he stays with. This is clearly seen through the show's more mundane episodes as we see signs of Yu becoming more active, less withdrawn and willing to toss in the occasional witty line. This, and some of the show's mundane episodes, were highlights for me since there was clear development with Yu and some of the silly predicaments that he and his friends get themselves into. The show also sports some good quality visuals as they have bright colors and a good amount of visual detail with vast settings and the character designs very closely resembling how they looked from the video games.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond these praises though, Persona 4: The Animation does suffer from the fact it seems to be trying too hard to be as faithful to its video game source material as possible. The opening sequences seen at the start of many of the show's episodes with Igor and Margaret are actually quite pointless in this anime adaptation as the two don't contribute anything and seem to be added on just to please fans of the video game. The Persona/ Shadow battles aren't too engaging at many points as either they seem to try too hard in adding elements from the game like gaining new cards, summon animations in the style of the video game and Yu conveniently being the only character capable of summoning different Personas; or adapting elements from shounen action titles with characters either getting up after being heavily damaged in battle and suddenly getting power boosts or upgrades to beat their seemingly unstoppable foe. While the show's various mundane episodes are usually fun to see, they add nothing new to Persona 4's main plot with the TV world and actually make that plot slow to a halt when they come along. Plus while Yu does get some reasonable character development throughout the series, the same can't be said for many of the title's other characters, especially those among Yu's group who are tacked on with differing archetypes and don't develop any further once they come to terms with their Shadows when they are rescued.\\n\\n\r\nThe Persona 4 video game seems like a fun little premise I'd be willing to play on my PS2 whenever I work up the interest to buy the game. But as an anime, it tries too hard to incorporate as many of its elements into the animated adaptation as possible, even if those elements aren't exactly relevant or hinder things such as plot progression, engaging action scenes and character depth. This is yet another addition to my list of mediocre and horrible anime adaptations of popular video games I had to sit through.",

            "content": "Persona 4's anime adaptation came as a huge, but welcome surprise. Any fan of the highly-acclaimed video game would be curious as to how such an endeavor would turn out. After the initial announcement, there had been six months of waiting for previous and further announcements; it was six months of building hype until the airing of the first episode.\r\nDid it live up to the hype? A difficult, opinionated question, but as for myself, it managed to live up to expectations, and more.\r\nPersona 4 the Animation adapts one of the most critically-acclaimed JRPGs ever to grace the PS2. Just knowing this, it would either turnout to be a huge success or a huge failure depending on how it's handled. Thankfully, director Seiji Kishi manages to handle the difficult parts of adapting the game and manages to present not only a watchable, but an enjoyable adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest challenge to adapting a video game into an anime is making the anime enjoyable for both newcomers and old fans alike. Persona 4 the Animation manages to do so by keeping the game's atmosphere intact. I can't help but think that Seiji Kishi's brand of direction -- which one may be familiar with through Angel Beats! -- is well-suited for this particular anime; his balance of comedy and drama works for Persona 4 as it is the most light-hearted video game in a series known for its dark, dramatic and post-apocalyptic plots. The infamous comedic aspects of the game -- the camp-out, the school trip, and the school festival -- remain no less hilarious when animated, and the anime even manages to add to the hilarity with original content.\\n\\n\r\nAnother nice touch is how the staff intersperse many game mechanics into the anime. Fans of the video game would notice many subtle (and not-so-subtle) shout-outs to the game, such as the eye-catch for the Social Link stats, the passing of time, the various skills and abilities in the dungeon-crawling segments, and the Velvet Room segments at the start of each episode. They even managed to sneak in all of the Social Links, though the results of doing so are varied.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama doesn't lag behind from the comedy; the final story arcs in the anime manage to handle the most serious and dramatic parts of the game with great care, especially the episodes dedicated to a certain character's plot-related death, as well as the parts dedicated to the Investigation Team's decision to search for the truth. The episodes focusing on the Investigation Team characters -- particularly Rise's arc, which manages to integrate her Social Link development -- are particularly well-directed in terms of drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest draw to this anime comes from the sound direction, especially the music. Shoji Meguro returns as the composer for the anime, rehashing many of the great tracks found in the original video game. The anime's music is a mix of rock, J-pop, jazz, and piano music, providing a large variety of tracks to use for atmosphere. The opening themes -- \"sky's the limit\" and \"key plus words\" -- set the anime's tone similar to the game's with the familiar stilted English that fans of the Persona series have come to love. Episode 1 even rehashes the game's opening theme, Pursuing My True Self. The ending themes are fitting to end an episode with, showing the arcana that the main character has obtained through the course of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's voice acting is spectacular; of particular note are Rie Kugimiya, who manages to break out of her tsundere pigeonholing -- especially with Rise's brooding, depressed attitude during episodes 9 and 10; Yui Horie, who manages to make Chie Satonaka an energetic, lively character; Romi Park, who is particularly well-suited for the role given to her; and most especially Daisuke Namikawa, whose performance as Yu Narukami is impressive in both the deadpan and more expressive aspects.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while Persona 4 excels in many aspects, it also has its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the art is, while not particularly terrible, less-than-stellar at times. This is no longer much of a problem in the later episodes, but there are times where you might wonder if the artists and animators were half-asleep while working on the characters. Fortunately, this doesn't bleed into the action scenes, but it's still jarring to see the characters full of life in one scene then seem so lifeless in another.\\n\\n\r\nCertain plot events may also come across as cheesy, clich\u00e9d or contrived, a problem which was also present in the game. However, one can argue that these events are part of the game's themes -- that the bonds of people are the true power, that no one can live without facing themselves and other people, and that we must pursue the truth which lies behind the fog of lies.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the all-important question -- will you enjoy this anime? If you were a fan of the game, then yes, you will enjoy this anime for how well it adapts the original. If you're a first-time watcher, you'll enjoy this anime for the same reasons people enjoyed the game -- the comedy, the themes and the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nDue to time constraints, the last episode and the \"True Ending\" will be on DVD and Blu-ray on August 2012. The ending is deliberately cut short with the game's \"Normal Ending\", a clever piece of direction which manages to keep to the game's theme of \"seeking out the answers\" while advertising for the DVD and Blu-rays. Reach out to the truth, indeed.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re an RPG fan, then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve heard about the Shin Megami Tensei series. While it didn\u2019t achieve mainstream popularity in the west until the mid 2000' due to the release of two particular games, in the East it\u2019s been a mainstay of the genre since 1987. To give you a point of reference, that\u2019s the same year the original Final Fantasy hit the shelves. Damn.\r\nHowever as said before, it was through two particular games that the series reached widespread popularity in the west. Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 in 2006 and Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 in 2008, both of whichare part of the Persona sub-series. The games were definitely different from most other RPGs from the time, adding multiple Visual Novel-esque elements, focusing just as much on social interactions and school life as much as dungeon crawling. Also, Persona 4 is the game that made Troy Baker popular, so there\u2019s that\u2026 even though his overly busy schedule has not allowed him to keep playing his role in that game so he had to be replaced by Matthew Mercer like half his other Anime roles. Good job AAA Gaming.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyhow, in 2010, a mere two years after the game was released, an Anime adaptation for Persona 4 was made, simply titled Persona 4 The Animation. And the moment it was announced it was received with massive negativity as\u2026 the main character didn\u2019t have the same name as in the manga. Yeah\u2026 the fandom can be really dumb at times. In general though, this anime had a very mixed reception overall, some loving it and considering it an example on how to do videogame adaptations, and others hating it and considering it everything wrong with videogame adaptations. Unlike most of the times this happens, I did indeed pick a side and, as you can tell by the Score I gave this anime, I loved it. So, let\u2019s not waste any more time and face this beast:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re used to the story of the game (More specifically the Vanilla Version of Persona 4 as this came out before the PS Vita Version came out), you won\u2019t be exactly surprised. It\u2019s a very standard adaptation of the game. Yet there\u2019s part of where its strengths lie. Since it is so straightforward, it also allows for a lot of creative uses of all the secondary stuff. For instance, half the subplots are merged into two episodes all tied together by a frankly hilarious string of events.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not where all of its positives lie. The anime, in general, is really funny. Dare I say, funnier than the game itself. Some jokes are so absurdly ridiculous they end up working, the anime treats itself overly seriously in ridiculous situations (Never has fishing been so extremely funny) and it\u2019s just plain funny. Some of the jokes don\u2019t quite work out (No matter how much you try, cross-dressing isn\u2019t funny), but these are the exception rather than the rule. That said, it\u2019s telling that most of the dramatic moments still work out, sometimes even moreso.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaints with the plot are rather simple. The first is how Dungeon Crawling is handled. Generally, each dungeon with the exception of the first one will only get one episode, sometimes even less. To be fair, there isn\u2019t much to do with them (Mostly because the Dungeon maps were randomized), I just wish they\u2019d put a bit more effort in them. The second is the pacing. While the anime is mostly decently paced, it sometimes feels like if they\u2019re going from one scene to the next without much lead-in, and it can be kinda jarring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, the cast is certainly a colorful bunch. From the clumsy and arguably full of himself Hanamura Yosuke, the energetic and upbeat Kujikawa Rise, the though and MANLY Tatsumi Kanji, the cold and aloof Shirogane Naoto and quite a few more. Of course, none of them are quite what they seem. Just using the ones I mentioned earlier, Yosuke suffers from a massive inferiority complex, Rise\u2019s been an idol for so long she doesn\u2019t even know who she\u2019s supposed to be anymore, Kanji likes cute things (Which to me always made him manlier, to be honest) and Naoto is such a bag of emotional and temperamental insecurities it would take forever to explain them all. That said, they do have to come to terms to who they really are, which carries over to everyone else in the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBut by far this Anime\u2019s greatest achievement is its handling of its main character, Narukami Yu. The thing about Narukami in the game is that he didn\u2019t have a personality; he was a vessel for the player, one who rarely spoke or did anything outside from player control. So how did they translate this into the Anime? Well, to put it bluntly\u2026 whatever happens in Narukami\u2019s head is as mysterious as the stuff Osaka from Azumanga Daioh daydreams. He\u2019s stoic, but has a damn weird way of thinking. He gets along with people quite easily, but he\u2019s rather quiet. He can be somewhat respectful, but in general he\u2019s a massive snarker. Of course, this being Persona 4, nothing\u2019s quite like it seems, as Narukami has his own share of issues as shown it\u2019s shown over the course series. Overall, he\u2019s one of the best examples of how to make a silent protagonist no longer silent.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show looks okay. Things do occasionally go off model, but not too often. The fight scenes were pretty well done too, namely due to how chaotic they can be at times. My only real issue with the animation is that for whatever reason the top half of the character\u2019s faces has a different tone than the rest of their body. I don\u2019t know why or how this happened, but it can be quite distracting at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole Soundtrack from the game makes it out unscratched and transitions flawlessly into the animated medium. What\u2019s best is how well placed it is, as there are more than a few silent scenes here, and the mood of the songs does often match with what\u2019s happening on-screen. As for the Openings and Endings, I didn\u2019t care much for the endings, but I did like both of the openings quite a lot, with my favorite being \u201cSky\u2019s The Limit\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast from the game comes back and does a great job as always. Namikawa Daisuke in particular does a pretty great job as Narukami, as he really sells how\u2026 odd he is. I think the only performance I didn\u2019t care for that much was Kugimiya Rie as Rise, as I think she took the hyper side of her character a bit too far at times. By contrast, her FMA co-star Park Romi had my favorite performance overall as Naoto, as she just completely sold Naoto\u2019s initially cold demeanor. And of course, there\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite nutcase: Madono Mitsuaki. This guy\u2026 he\u2019s just a sight to behold, isn\u2019t he?\\n\\n\r\nThe rest is great too; we have Koshimizu Ami, Moribuko Showtaro, Horie Yui, Seki Tomokazu, Ohara Sayaka, Ono Daisuke, Ito Miki, Yamaguchi Kappei, Yuuki Aoi (In a rare, pre-Madoka Magica role), and of course, the Great Late Ishizuka Unsho. Overall, they already had a great cast to begin with, so it was just a matter of bringing the band back together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I really enjoyed this anime. While not flawless, I think this is the perfect example on how you should do a videogame adaptation. It\u2019s accessible enough for newcomers so that they become interested to play the game, but also brings enough new stuff to the table to bring old fans in. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, really.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

I was worried that trying to fit everything from the game into a small-ish animated series was going to end up with it being butchered.\r\nI was wrong. \r\nPersona 4 : The Animation captures the essence of the game perfectly. None of the feelings and emotions are lost in the transfer; the characters and story are kept fully in-tact, for the most part. \r\nTo start with the negatives;\r\n- It's a relatively short series.\r\nAs a result of the number of episodes being limited, a lot of stuff outside of the story doesn't make the cut. This putsa little damper on things for fans of the series going in. Certain events are covered too quickly, if they even make it in at all. It's completely understandable, but a little disappointing. Apart from a few instances later on, this point isn't really relevant to those who haven't played the game. \\n\\n\r\n- The story, again. \\n\\n\r\nPersona 4 is a monster of a game. People sink at least 40-60 hours into one play through. The problem arises when trying to fit all of this into 25 episodes (and an OVA). This isn't a humongous problem, as the characters are the driving force of the series, but it does mean that certain details are left out. Certainly towards the end of the series, this lack of detail could lead to a lot of confusion; it doesn't really do the best job of explaining itself.\\n\\n\r\nYou could bypass these by arguing that the animated series gives watchers the incentive to go and play the original material. This is true, but it still doesn't excuse the confusion that's present. They could've taken out some of the rushed parts that are irrelevant to the story and used that time to delve into the finer points of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the positives!\\n\\n\r\n- The Story.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's somewhat rushed and unexplained, the concept behind  P4: The Animation is an extremely interesting one. It pulls you in and has a few intense moments. It explores the idea of one's self and the importance of acceptance. It's really heavy stuff, but it portrays it in a way that anyone could understand. \\n\\n\r\n- The Art.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simply beautiful. I didn't notice any inconsistencies or hiccups, and the series really brings Inaba to life in a way that the original material couldn't. It's a nice, fresh look at small country town and a much welcomed one. \\n\\n\r\n- The Sound\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the tracks were taken directly from the game, but this does nothing but play to its strengths. The Persona series in general has fantastic OSTs, and this is no exception. A nice mix of Pop and Rock, and the prominence of violins in the majority of the tracks really helps to capture the atmosphere of the series. \\n\\n\r\n- The Characters\\n\\n\r\nI'd argue that this is the series' strongest asset. Watching through, I couldn't believe how well they'd done with them. The way they introduce the characters and eventually reveal their struggles is amazing. Even with the rushed pace of the series, it doesn't falter for a second in this regard. The high school setting also helps with this; the characters are put in all different sorts of situations, be it a class trip or group work, which leads to a lot of development. The seemingly mundane tasks and instances in some episodes make the series a lot more realistic, allowing the viewer to easily grow attached to the main group. \\n\\n\r\nIn short : The characters are amazing!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really enjoyed the series, if you couldn't tell. The consistent presence of humour throughout the series had me laughing, and the contrast of that with the dark story led to a really interesting experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : This is a series that anyone could pick up, no matter what genre you're a fan of. (Although, there aren't any Mechs. Personas are just as good, though!) It tackles very serious subject matter, but mixes it all with humour and happiness. Truly a unique experience, and one that you should have as soon as possible if you haven't already!",

            "content": "Before I start, please keep in mind this is MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION and that this is my review on the anime, NOT the video game.\r\nI'm a huge fan of the Persona 4 video game, so I was excited when I found out there was an animation. I was expecting the anime to be a total bust judging from other (poorly) done video game adaptions I've watched or heard about, and I was pleasantly surprised when I began watching as it far exceeded my expectations.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe plot is pretty straight forward - the protagonist moves to Inaba with his uncle as his parents are stuckon a business trip and a series of murders begin occurring. It's original, enjoyable, and most importantly, well done. There are many plot twists throughout the entirety of the series that will make you keep on watching to the very end. The one thing that seemed to bother me was that it seemed to leave out some minor, and very rarely major information that may leave someone who has never played the game for themselves very confused at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI, personally, loved the art style used in this, especially since the creators stayed loyal to the video game style which made me very, VERY happy. The art particularly shines the brightest during the battle scenes. There's always so much going on during them, and they managed to pull it off with a great deal of success.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen I began playing the game, the first thing I noticed was the great soundtrack, so seeing all the songs from the track being put to use was amazing, especially \"Castle\" and \"Reach Out To The Truth\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes the show what it is. The characters are extremely lovable, each one taking on their own unique personality. By the end of the series, you're 100% going to favor a certain character. I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis may be an inaccurate score as I watched the entire series with a close friend of mine, though I firmly believe that even if I had watched it alone, I would have enjoyed it just as much. We started it, watching constantly and before we knew it, we had finished the series. I haven't had this much fun watching anything in a long, long while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDon't assume that I don't believe the series doesn't have its flaws, because of course it does, along with any other anime, or any show for that matter, but there doesn't seem to be any crucial faults that necessarily need to be pointed out. This series made me laugh, cry, and maybe even do both at the same time, which is why I give this series a 10. I enjoyed it a lot and I think that's really all that matters.",

            "content": "*I've never played the video game this anime was based on. I wasn't even aware there was one. Also I'm not going to summarize the story because I'm kind of lazy. I just want to get my opinion of the show, purely as an anime, out there. \r\nThe story is pretty interesting, but it's definitely not the most captivating or interesting one I've seen. But the characters meld together nicely and provide some nice comedic relief. The story is pretty easy-going, and is similar to Samurai Champloo in that it's more of a \"take it as it is\" animation. Not everything is explained, and theyvery effectively use sound to convey mood instead of pure dialogue. But I do sometimes wish they could be more clear. I've never been lost, but I do think that certain parts could be conveyed more clearly. Even though I've only seen about 12 episodes, each one has been pretty predictable. I'm sure down the road there will be more plot twists, but for now it's a pretty easy-going show. Most of the episodes have followed the same archetype, like Pokemon, where we know how the conflict will end.  So far, it may not have been very challenging, but it's still enjoyable. I give the story an 7.\\n\\n\r\nI really know nothing about animation. But I do like the art in this show. It's clean and colorful and you can tell they spent some money on the animation, especially in episode 9. I would give it a 9, but compared to say Samurai Champloo, the characters aren't as individualized, which is a really big thing for me. If I change the hairstyle of one character, I want to be able to still tell who that character is. I give the art an 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nice as well. Using the same story archetype for each character is a pretty easy yet effective form of characterization. But it kind of irks me how easily definable each character is. The characters aren't cliched, per se, but they are quite predictable. They lack mystery, and it feels as though there isn't much left to their pasts. But that's a really nit-picky thing to say. Probably the most interesting character for me is Narukami, but that's because his character hasn't been defined as clearly as the others. I know I complain a lot, but one thing I do enjoy is that even though the characters may be a bit predictable, they are consistent. Through the dialogue, the characters help more firmly define each others personalities, and help provide for this consistency. Overall, the characters get an 7.\\n\\n\r\nI've personally enjoyed this anime so far. It's not even close to being one of my favorites, but it is pretty funny at times. I like how laid-back the show feels. Even if there is a murderer out on the loose, the show doesn't feel to urgent. This also has to do with the pace of the show, which was done very well. Enjoyment gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would have to say this show gets a 7. I say this because while it was enjoyable, and the majority of my scores were 8's, it's just not as good as others I've seen. So far at least, it hasn't drawn me in as some other shows that may not have been ranked so highly. I know that this entire show is a mystery, but I don't stay up at night wondering who the killer might be. Maybe that is due to its laid-back nature, but this show in general was pretty basic. It was in general, good.  And a 7 is good, but not a \"stay up all night and watch this show because it's life-changing\" kind of good.",

            "content": "Story - 7/10 - While I personally enjoyed the story of Persona 4 The Animation, there were a few hiccups that I would imagine that others would be less forgiving of.  I enjoyed the symbolism and character development throughout the series and the comedy scenes nearly had me in tears but there were a few instances where the slice-of-life episodes were a little too drawn out, slowing down the pace of the show.  Another thing that might bother other viewers is the fact that this anime follows the story of the game a little too closely.  People who have beaten Persona 4will already know the major twists and turns which might spoil some of the fun along the way.  On the other hand, people who haven't played the game might not understand some of the ins and outs that veterans of the series already understand (I had to have a friend clue me in on a few things that didn't make sense to me).  But other than these minor complaints, I can't think of any other criticisms I have for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10 - I really enjoyed the art and animation used in P4 The Animation.  The liberal use of yellow really fits the mood that the series is going for and the bright and well animated Openings are some of the best I've seen in an anime.  The animation is well done and looks fine but isn't anything worth writing home about.  The only issue I have with the art style is the use of orange on character's faces to imitate shadows.  Oftentimes, this either makes the characters look like they all have 5 o'clock shadows or (if viewed from farther away) very painful-looking  sunburns over their mouths and cheeks.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 - Persona 4 The Animation has some of the best music in an anime that I've ever heard.  Each of the songs is either lifted from Persona 4 (the game) or has been written specifically for the animation.  Also, fans of Persona 3's music will be in for a treat during an episode where the characters visit a certain Gekkoukan High School.  The only part of the sound design that I have to criticize is the voice of Teddie.  They could not have picked a more obnoxious voice for this mascot character...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10 - The characters are the real meat of the anime.  Almost every character manages to be interesting and believable no matter the circumstances. After all, this show is all about the characters coming to grip with parts of their personalities that they don't wish to recognize.  The main character is especially entertaining due to the fact that he doesn't fall into the same trap that many of the common stereotypical protagonists do in many animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 - I absolutely LOVED this show.  I am now officially obsessed with the Persona series after watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10 - While there are a few minor issues that bug the show, this is definitely a must-see in my opinion.  The good bits FAR outweigh the bad parts so you should definitely drop what you're doing right now and watch this.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",

            "content": "Persona 4 The Adaptation results\r\n\"Persona 4 The Animation\" is based on the PS2 Game \"Persona 4\", and adapts the plot it in 25 episodes, covering it untill the normal ending (the game has multiple endings, and the \"True ending\" will come out as an OVA later).\r\n[If you have not played the game and are interested in playing it, I recomend you to do so before watching so you won't kill the 60 hours+ gameplay's suspense, where the plot is much more detailed. The game is much better, really.]\r\nPeople look to this anime in 2 ways: comparing it to the game, or looking at it independently.I will try to put things in both perspectives, but I can not deny the game keeps advantage by far in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progression analysis\\n\\n\r\n>Intro (Quite good)\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when Yu Narukami (canon anime name of the game's nameless silent protagonisti) moves to his uncle and cousin's house in the \"peaceful rural town\" of Inaba, to stay for a year while his parents work aboard. Then, after his arrival a series of bizarre murders start to happen.\\n\r\nThe first episode speeds up the slow game intro events into a wise way, merging part of the two first times they enter into the TV world into one, thus allowing an action sequence in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes with the velvet open the episodes keeping track of the evolution of Yu's arcana powers by linking to other people. That was an aewsome idea and fitted very well the anime to represent the protagonist's visits to it (alongside some scenes with it during some episodes).\\n\\n\r\n>First major change (Kind of upsetting)\\n\\n\r\nThen the second episode made one of the major changes from the game (that became more clear as new episodes came out), the persona users would not use weapons nor fight directly agains the shadows. The combat in The Animation is fully by summoning, and if the casted personas take a hit, it's master will fell the damage.This second point is interesting and a good addition, but the lack of weapons helped to kill the action, even thou making sense (once in the game, even after the police oficcer issue they still carried weapons to Junes by \"hiding\" them and a lot of armors into their school uniforms, and we never saw any backpack...)\\n\\n\r\n>The Action sequences (Bad)\\n\\n\r\nIf you have played the game you might be a little upset by now with this change (removing the weapons), but even the new audience may think the combat is dull, lacking of action and in most times \"to easy\" to win. Party members other than the protagonist are most of times useless and most of the job is done in seconds by him.\\n\r\nThe animation in battles even in the bluray versions (that fix some weird animated points) doesn't help a lot, it's just not exciting.\\n\\n\r\n>Social links (Good, well made for just 25 episodes)\\n\\n\r\nIn the game the \"social links\" were some sort of simulation date event's to raise the friendship level with someone, powering the arcana that represents it's life dilema thus making the protagonist more powerfull to summon personas of that respective arcana, and by it's max level allowing him to summon it's signature ultimate persona.\\n\r\nWithout a guide and a new game+, most people will not master all the 21 social links, the anime covered that by shortcuting what takes to master  or even the concept of really mastering them. It's hard not to be expectiong a game that can take more than 80 hours to finish to not be rushed in 25 anime format episodes. In that point, Persona 4 The Animation was good, but seeing how Persona Trinity Soul (weird and boring anime sequence to Persona 3) got twice episodes makes me wonder that this anime could have used the links a lot more, beeing even able to make fillers about side stories withou it beeing non interesting once these plots are really relevant for the game.\\n\\n\r\nMixing social links like with Strenght and Moon in one episode was a good Idea as well, that made the event's not that acurate to the game but turned it in the kind of \"filler\"/ modification that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ending showing the obtained arcanas of the episode falling to Yu's hands was brilliant. \\n\\n\r\n>The plot suspense (Bad)\\n\\n\r\nDue it being rushed, the storyline had only a few moments to focus on beeing tense and create a heavier mistery atmosphere. That along with most of the humor scenes apearing among the investigations made it sound like joke or superficial. Even that simple the plot twists and suspense seemed a lot more intense in game then in the anime adaptation.\\n\r\nIf you haven't played,once the plot is very rushed and it doesn't have a lot of episodes, you might watch it beeing ok to it due the lot of information they will  be throwing at you (not that much).\\n\\n\r\n>Humor (Sorry, but it was funnier in the game once it didn't seem that much like a joke most of times)\\n\\n\r\nFor the ones who played, most of the funny parts are in The Animation, but it's not that funny 'cause the rushed plot made it sound like the same jokes were beeing told again in short periods of time.\\n\r\nIf you haven't played the game you may still notice a lot of humor sequences, I do not guarantee they will succeed, but there are some funny events.\\n\\n\r\n>Silent Protagonist personality traits and power evolution (Ok but too rushed half of time)\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist in game was silent and almost only talked by choices given to the player. With hiis personality becomes more strong by making friends and raising traits and that can be seen in the anime, where his trait status apears in the between break scene. Again that is something that apears to be too much focused in comedy, when sometimes he stands in a way players would not imagine (this akward moments are kind of funny for the ones who played, talking about fun who want to talk about murders? I mean, about the moment he falls in the river with the most \"silent protagonist\" face).\\n\r\nAs he gets stronger bonds he is able to summon and fuse more powerfull personas, what gets kind of rushed for him to be summoning high level stuff in what should be the second dungeon of the game for instance.\\n\\n\r\n>Audio (Ok, a lot from the original game sound track with some reencarnation remixes and good new ones, but many times missplaced)\\n\\n\r\nI guess everything was too rushed to make some relevant sound tracks apear for a decent time (noes Heaven plays for only like 8 seconds).\\n\r\nThe dub had a lot of actors who dubbed the game and that a very good thing.\\n\\n\r\n>The Animation (Bad, lol)\\n\\n\r\nApparently the studio was having some issues among the cast and it not end well. Some of the animation was fixed to the bluray version but it doesn't save the action scenes just because they may look better in graphics.\\n\\n\r\n>The Design (Good, downgraded in the anime)\\n\\n\r\nThe game's original Atlus' design looks more elegant, the old animated cutscenes from it are simple and the characters barelly move on them but the art style was \"darker\" even in the \"everything is yellow\" concept of the game. As I said, I don't think the animation keeps up with enough suspense.\\n\r\nIn the animation the boys seem a little too \"big / large\" maybe because the way the uniform was drawn.\\n\\n\r\n>Conclusion \\n\\n\r\nPlayed the game score: 5 of 10\\n\\n\r\nHaven't played the game score: 6 of 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have played the game you may have a lot of complains but it's still enjoyable to watch to review the facts. If not it's quite a regular show but I still recomend you to play over to watch it if you have a chance.\\n\r\nPersona 4 The Animation had everything to be a great anime with more episodes, and the social link aspect could be used to creat cliche happy-go japanese anime schoolife fillers that would even be sort of fun to watch. Too bad it was so rushed and the combat so nerfed, being utopic here I would like to see a Persona 4 The Animation: Goldenhood (only the smarts wil get).",

As he settles in, a bizarre string of murders begin to occur where bodies are found hanging from television reception antenna.\r\nA huge chunk of the game was made up of Visual Novel elements though, precisely the 'Social Linking' parts, where the players charactergets stronger from hanging out and meeting with people around his community, widening his social circle, and whats best about this feature is that the player (for the most part) kind of chooses how to reply/what to say and/or do with the characters, making the dialogue and story really flexible.\\n\\n\r\nDue to Yuus dialogue being completely controlled by the player, that made it quite hard to make fitting dialogue from scratch, even in the game there were only simple choices and the talking was mostly done by the other characters which made him seem to be really silent, which I really didn't care for, considering he was the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast of characters, on the other hand, were great. They were all different from each other, all having their own issues which the protagonist helps them with, and these issues were all, in one way or another, connected to the main plot, were all very diverse in general, making some of them quite easy to relate to, except Rise Kujikawa, who I found to be quite cliched, but the anime does a great job in developing all of them, the characters were all well done overall, the were different, lovable, and most of all, human.\\n\\n\r\nI found the main plot being quite predictable at times, but that didn't really affect it, as the story was built upon the characters, and made a great ride to see them all progress through the mystery of the murders. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo make up for all the parts in the game where characters developed, they made a few episodes that don't focus on the story much, but rather on character development, these episodes were fun, and really helped the characters grow, and helped the anime live out the theme where \"Bonds of friendship make you stronger\". And don't worry, it doesn't have any shounen-style friendship asspulls. Here, its all serves for character development.\\n\\n\r\nIt's ending got dragged a bit too much, making it a bit anti-climactic, and it really lacked in the side characters who were only in \"Social linking\" part of the game, and it didn't do well to explain parts like the 'Velvet Room' as untranslated game mechanics. They were interesting but never explained. Which really wasnt cool. \\n\\n\r\nIt's good as an anime, but not as an adaptation. I don't think you would get the same depth as you would in the game, but as an anime, it definitley stands great on its own. \\n\\n\r\nNot too special, but worth a watch.",

            "content": "*This is a review Persona 4 The Animation and its conclusion special Persona 4 The Animation: No One is Alone. I\u2019ve also never played the PlayStation 2 classic Persona 4, and this review will be solely based on my experiences with the anime.\r\nPersona 4 The Animation was an anime I was on the fence about for a while. It was based off of a video game series that I had never even heard of, and I didn\u2019t want to go into the series and be completely confused. After doing some more research on the series I discovered that I had received pretty good reviews allaround, some people even call it things like, \u201cThe greatest video game to anime adaptation ever.\u201d After I finding out that this game was so close to the source material that I\u2019d be able to understand it without having to even play the game I decided that I would check this series out. Persona 4 The Animation not only exceeded my expectations, but it managed to keep me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nPersona 4 The Animation\u2019s story takes place in the small country town of Inaba, where there have been a series of mysterious murders taking place. These murders seem to be connected to a mysterious phenomenon known as the Midnight Channel, and while the main characters are investigating, they discover a world hidden on the other side of the TV screen. In this newfound world, the characters not only uncover information about the mysteries in Inaba, but also discover new things about themselves. While it might seem like it, the story isn\u2019t just some clich\u00e9\u2019 story about the power of friendship and self-discovery, even though they happen to be prominent themes in the story. The mystery narrative was very interesting, and was explained really well. It kept me invested in the story, and I was always interested in what would happen next. The show is paced well, for the most part, and the story comes to a decently satisfying conclusion within the series\u2019 original 25 episodes, but the series\u2019 \u201cTrue Ending\u201d is told in the conclusion special Persona 4 The Animation: No One is Alone. The ending does clear up a few things left out from the original, but it definitely feels rushed. While there are a lot of things crammed into the 30-minute conclusion, it does provide us with decent conclusion to the story. That being said, there things that Persona 4 The Animation just doesn\u2019t explain at all, an example being the existence of \u201cThe Velvet Room\u201d and the characters that seem to live there. We really aren\u2019t given any information about either of them, which is disappointing considering that they appear quite often in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Persona 4 The Animation was good at times, and very average at others. There are several moments in the series where the characters\u2019 faces lack detail and look pretty plain. There also is a weird tint that shows up throughout the series that affects the skin color of the characters. But, the backgrounds used in the series are usually done pretty well. The fights scenes aren\u2019t anything special, but they decently animated and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is this series is excellent and boast a variety of different types of music that fit really well into the scenes and moments that they are used in. All of the openings and endings for this series are very well done, and extremely enjoyable to listen to. Even if you tend to just skip over an anime\u2019s opening and ending themes, you might find yourself watching, and listening to, them several times over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are several main characters in the series, and we get a good amount of development and backstory on most of the characters. The series stars several students from Yasogami High School, including: Yukiko Amagi, Yosuke Hanamura, Rise Kujikawa, Chie Satonaka , Naoto Shirogane, Kanji Tatsumi, and Yuu Narukami, as well as their friend from the alternate TV world, Teddie (Kuma). Throughout the series we are given background information about a majority of the characters. Each character goes through pretty good amount of development during the series as well. While some of supporting characters are given a fair amount of development and backstory, there are others that we learn little about. My main issue with the characters is that we really aren\u2019t given much information about our main protagonist, Yuu Narukami. He does go have some development, but we don\u2019t really know anything about his backstory other than the fact that he came from Tokyo. Teddie is another character that doesn\u2019t get a lot of backstory or development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the flaws that this anime has, I found it very enjoyable. The mystery of the story pulled me in from the beginning, and kept me interested throughout the series. I really liked all of the characters, and enjoyed their interactions among one another. I also really enjoyed the music in this anime, and don\u2019t mind listening to it by itself.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.4/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 3.2/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.4/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4.2/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.3/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.9/5\\n\\n\r\nPersona 4 The Animation has its problems, but it\u2019s still a very enjoyable series to watch.",

            "content": "Persona 4: Anime adaptation from Video games..\r\nOnce day, my friend told me about this anime. I was kinda \"meh, nope\", but i give a try to watching it.. The result is wow, this is not bad.. The story itself about bunch of people go to another dimension, fight a monsters, and save people. Is it good? Let's see...\r\nStory: 7 / 10\r\nAs you can see from synopsis, Persona 4 take place in a rural town. There have been mysterious murders in that town. The main plot of this anime is to solve that mysterious murders. As the story progresses, the main character also discover that theycan go to another dimension (they called TV World), and discover clue about that mysterious murders. The story itself not always about mysterious murders. There's also school-day section, holiday section, and the other things because the Main Character also highschool student.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art style is well made.. but it less colorful.. Either background or people, their art style is consistent. Most of character art style is pretty much same.. So, nothing special about it. The art style is just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is outstanding. Persona 4 probably one of the best anime that has best sound i ever know. The opening and ending song is good and a lot. The background music is also fitting for the story and atmosphere. Their seiyuu/character voice is fit every character personality\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat we got here is a \"Investigation Team\", leaded by dependable person.. Every character is pretty much detailed. Not only the main character, but also the supporting character. \"Bonds of people is the true power\" is main quote of the series. So, there's will a lot of supporting character, and it's also pretty much detailed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime. As fan of slice-of-life anime, i like the way they put a gags in this series. The battle scene is intresting, and also fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's very good.  I never played Persona 4 game before first time i watch the Animation. After i watching this, it made me want to play the game. And soon, i became Persona fan. Either if you already playing the game before, or not, i recommend this anime to you, who like some mystery genre, with also has superpower to beat the enemy..",

            "content": "I went into this anime with low expectations, but i was overall pleased with what they pulled off. I am a long running fan of the Persona series so getting to watch one of my favorite games in anime form was a blast, however there were definitely pacing issues which i will get too later.\r\nBefore i go over the story im going to quickly mention the one problem i had with the anime. This of course is the pacing of the show, I say this because it is an adaptation of a game that takes most people 50+ hours to complete and they tried tojam the whole thing into 25 episodes. This of course causes alot of problems as things feel really rushed, for example in the game there is alot of introductions to the town and a few characters before the main character gains the ability to summon his persona this can take anywhere between 1-2 hours and they basically crammed all that into the first episode. It also feels like the story jumps around alot and because it is so short you dont get a full interaction with each social link from the game, instead Yu is shown with each of them for a short time during the series. This makes the viewer miss out on alot of the back-story's of every character (unless they have played the game)\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story to Persona 4 the animation follows the story of the original game but of course it is much more compressed then the game. The story is captivating a provides many mystery's for the watcher to get lost in.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music comes straight from the game, giving the anime a great soundtrack. I loved all the songs in the game so hearing them playing during the anime was awesome. There were some parts of the anime where the music could have been toned down a bit as it sometimes plays when characters are constantly talking, apart from this point the music fits every\\n\r\nsituation that it is placed in perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI always found something kinda strange about the art style but i never really could put my finger on it, i guess their faces look kinda weird. I always imagined an anime of Persona for would constantly look like the anime cutscenes from the game. At times the animation looks better then those cutscenes but at other times i like the art style in the  cutscenes better. While both these styles are very similar and the anime art style is really nice i still prefer the cutscenes from the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhile not being able to see the full back-story of each character and not getting to know them more personally like you can in the game, the characters are still an amazing part of the show. Every character feels diverse giving each character their own personality. The shadow versions of each character are amazing as well just because it shows how different each of them are and how they are truly feeling. The character are one thing that may keep you hooked on the anime as they help keep it interesting throughout.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching this anime and i would say it is a much better experience for someone who hasnt played the game as this is a quick way of understanding what Persona 4 is really about instead of playing the game which is very long. For people who have played the game though i think you will have a much better time just replaying the game again (Ive played through it way too many times haha). But overall i never stopped enjoying the anime, from start to finish it kept me watching.",

            "content": "Persona 4 is LA's first foray into the Persona franchise and by all means Persona 4 was a good entrance into this game series.\r\nFor such an anime adaptation of a JRPG, LA really had some high expectations for this anime and the \"video game anime adaptation curse\" couldn't touch this for alot of reasons, but it still Persona 4 had some minor problems here and there nonetheless LA's high expectations were met and then some.\r\nLet's start with the plot of Persona 4. Persona 4's plot follows a typical murder mystery anime mixed in with supernatural RPG elements. The plot follows a group of highschool studentstrying to find the culprit of the bizarre murders involving the Midnight Channel, Persona 4 follows the typical high school life of Yu Narukami voiced by Daisuke Namikawa as well as trying to solve this bizarre murder case. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character and development, the Midnight Channel and the main cast develops their character quite well, with the main focus of \"trying to resolve things with yourself\" with some great resolutions from Yukiko Amagi voiced by Ami Koshimizu the resident ojou, Naoto Shirogane voiced by Romi Park the highschool detective, Kanji Tatsumi voiced by Tomokazu Seki's the delinquent with the heart of gold, Rise Kujikawa voiced by Rie Kugimiya the idol and Kuma voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi a mysterious resident of the Midnight Channel. Now LA will say that there was a bit of a problem to Yu, that being he's too OP and rather generic though he gains something of a minor personality outside from the Persona battles, the minor personality is \"ok\", that being something of a over-exaggeration of the situation given to him which is mainly for comedic moments at best. Nonetheless, Yu as a character does develop the best with his family members of Nanako voiced by Akemi Kanda and Ryoutarou Doujima voiced by Unshou Ishizuka as well as his friends and later down the line, his personality does get greatly better by the final episodes giving him something of a \"hero\" persona which melds well with both his power and beliefs as a character. LA's favourite character however goes to Chie Satonaka a friend of Yu, LA doesn't know, the reasoning for this was probably because of Yui Horie's tsundere vocals, but due to Chie's development as a character, her boisterous personality and something about her manzai acts with Yosuke Hanamura voiced by Showtaro Morikubo (another friend of Yu) helped alot, she just kinda stuck with LA once she got her Persona. Overall, due to the nature and mechanics of Persona 4, the characters especially the Persona 4 gang naturally gets the character development they deserve even outside their personal Persona arcs which makes all of them quite easy to get invested by, the mystery murder case involvement is a great bonus especially to Yu as he needed it otherwise he would have quite easily been the generic main male OP protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nFor the minor characters in Persona 4, even they gets some \"development\" in the form of one or two episodic arcs and appear later as something like a cameo like Ai Ebihara voiced by Kanae Ito or the ever-busy part timer Aika Nakamura voiced by Aoi Yuuki though some of the huge cast of Persona 4 are just there for comedic relief, such examples of that being Noriko Kashiwagi voiced by Hitomi Nabatame and Hanako Ootani voiced by Ryou Agawa. The only two characters LA always questioned every time were the two characters of the Velvet Room of Margaret voiced by Sayaka Ohara and Igor voiced by Isamu Tanonaka, like their meta-characters who keep tabs on Yu's progress, but really...WHO ARE THEY, they never specifically tell us who they were.\\n\\n\r\nNow as great as both the mystery element of Persona 4 is AND IT IS, trying to figure out who the culprit is along with the main Persona cast and the Persona battles were decently done slightly-RPG styled battles scenes were and is the main focus of Persona 4, Persona 4 sometimes goes into sort of \"break episodes\" from time to time and really, LA didn't mind them, as it helped to \"take a break\" from the mystery and just have fun. It really brings home the message of \"youth is freedom so do whatever you want before life catches up with you\", but from a \"filler\" perspective it helped grow the Persona group as a group and as to why they are friends (and slightly vague romantic tensions here and there), so even the \"filler\" episodes does develop or move the plot forward in some ways and LA was grateful for that as the mystery/Persona elements does get rather intense come the finale.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, done by AIC A.S.T.A, the overall animation was decent with little to nothing of animation errors. What realy stood out from the animation was the character designs of nearly every character beings well defined and LA knew who they were (be it due to their eclectic costumes or their appearance in general) as well as the rather detailed backgrounds though of a typical \"counties\" scenery but from the Midnight Channel scenery had those bright and darker tones to contrast the counties scenery. The battle scenes were decent as well, being rather flashy and tense even with Yu being the OP, but thankfully the other Persona cast members do their time to shine during the battles which kept the tension during the battles, nonetheless the animation was a standout.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing LA would like to note is how the anime feels like a visual novel with the additions of weather calendar which is essential in the plot to the commercial break eye catches of Yu's stats to the tutorial guide-like Velvet Room to heck even the filler episodes feels more like a character route at times. It's those kind of aesthetics to Persona 4 that made feel like an actual anime RPG visual novel of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice cast, the main voice cast was pretty well known, from Ami Koshimizu to Yui Horie to Romi Park to Rie Kugimiya to heck even the minor voice cast like Kanae Ito and Hitome Nabatame and really Persona 4 had an excellent voice cast overall that brought their all when vociing their respective characters. The only problem and this was most probably a personal opinon was Kuma's voice actor of Kappei Yamaguchi, YES, LA knows that was his style of speech of adding bear puns to nearly everything he said, but the biggest problem was that Kappei's \"screechiness\" trumps even Rie Kugimiya's typical vocals and that kinda irritated LA when Kuma spoke (for the most part...that as LA said, it's a personal complaint and a rather minor one at that). As much as LA doesn't talk about the soundtrack, Persona 4's was utterly amazing, making use of it's rather electro-sync pop rock and calming vocals in many of tracks makes the atmosphere from soothing to awesome in an instant. The first and second OP also gets an mention as to what Persona 4 is as well. The soundtrack overall fits very well into the Persona 4 anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending finally brings us the actual true villain of Persona 4 with all the information given to us like a mystery solving game, and really the first praise to this ending would be the true villain and his motives as not only does it add up but it puts in a stark contrast to Yu as character. Best of all, the ending resolves everything including who the mysterious Kuma is and the rather dramatic turn Persona 4 took to get to this ending as well as why and how the true villain did everything. In terms of the final battle with the true villain it comes off as a battle of beliefs which later on in the spirit of JRPG's comes a final boss that makes both the battle of beliefs and the awesome battle with this final battle as both meaningful and an amazing battle. Really the ending was great due to the investment in both the mystery murder case as well as the great character development to the main persona cast that the ending had the impact that it did and for anything was satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nPersona 4 overall exceeded LA's expectations and thrashed the video game anime adaptation curse quite easily and for a person who has no prior experiences to the Persona franchise or played the game, LA still got what Persona 4 was about from both it's characters and overall plot as it became something of coming of age story laced with supernatural murder mystery plot. Persona 4 had it's problems of filler school life episodes (though that can easily be forgiven with it's well done minor character development and messages it brings) and the main protagonist being generic and OP (which can be defended as the main Persona cast does help to further brings in the message of friendship that Persona 4 has), but for what it was worth and LA's experience in watching Persona 4, it's strengths with it's well-developed main and minor characters, an intriguing mystery plot and great Persona battles overwhelmingly outweighed it's small minor weaknesses of this rather great anime adaptation.",

            "content": "Here is a bit of a disclaimer, I have never played any of the Persona games or even seen walkthroughs. I never looked anything up about the game and storyline before watching this so I have had a clean slate. The only thing I ever knew about it was that it was an anime and game franchise that was out there and that some people liked it. Meaning, if I seem stupid to the show or to anything about the show, NO FANMAIL SAYING I SUCK! Thank you. Sorry but I had to put this in here because people have been bugging me about gettingthings wrong in shows that branch out into other medias.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, onto the review, lets see how this show pans out. It surprises me that when I first started watching it, I got a really heavy feeling that I watched a show similar to this before, then I noticed it felt like D. Gray Man. That\u2019s not to say that this whole show is just like it, oh no, but the opening had that slightly creepy feeling to it that I got with D. Gray Man. It wasn\u2019t bad, in fact, the opening made me a little more intrigued as to what this was all about since the \u2018old man\u2019 Egor in the beginning had the same feeling as the Millennium Earl. The sad part though was that it was such a short introduction to him that I didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about.\\n\\n\r\nYu Narukami seems to be the main character in this show, and seems to be a rather quiet and thoughtful person. The nephew of a detective, he seems a little out of it, which is normal for someone moving from a big town to a smaller one. Oh come on now! I know this is a Japanese name but\u2026 Yu?\u2026 I guess the fact that if you place his name as Narukami Yu, you get what translates roughly into \u2018You become God.\u2019 (Special thanks to Professor Otaku for helping me out with that.) Yu has trouble at school with the really stupid and over dramatic home room teacher he has, but does tend to get friends a bit easy despite being quiet. Sadly, after the first half of the episodes, Yu ended up becoming a rather strange individual. I\u2019m not sure what it is, but he just acted serious for everything he did and even showed a rather perverted side to him that really changed his personality. It was a change I rather didn\u2019t like and threw me off a bit to much (not that I didn\u2019t stop watching). I kept wanting him to go back to the way he was before. Yu\u2019s Uncle really isn\u2019t a family type of guy, which I have noticed is typical for detectives in anime. His little girl is much more grown up it seems.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are actually interesting and even though they seem to be standard characters with rather predictable personalities but because of their persona, they learn that everything is not all that it seems. They have another self and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s wonderful about this show. It gets into the whole aspect of an inner self, fighting to break free. I guess this is the time that I will get into a little bit of my own philosophy. Same as this anime, I believe we all have a mask we hid behind because we are scared of showing what we truly are. Some of us even do it out of habit, never really knowing there is a person within crying out for attention. That might be why the show actually felt close to me, it was because it spoke to what I believe in. That though, does not mean that something like this would really happen but in a small way, it could. I mean that the feelings that you have deep inside can burst out.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is mostly basic though I have to ask what is up with the stitching on their clothing! It\u2019s way to big to be normal and just makes them look a bit tacky. Also, why do most of the main character girls have different uniforms then the others around them? I guess part of it makes them stand out as saying \u2018hey! I\u2019m a main character\u2019 but I would think they would of already been called on not using the right dress code by now. For example, Chie wears a green jacket over her uniform and Yukiko has a red sailor shirt on when the dress code clearly shows a black sailor uniform. Sometimes the scenes seem to jump rather fast as though they were cut scenes from the video game and only used to pin point small things about the characters around Yu. The action scenes were actually rather good, not using a lot of just speed lines.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version, meaning I was able to hear the English version of the opening song (Though I have no clue if there is a Japanese version) and I think it was done pretty well in fact. It was actually surprising to me that they worked a new opening and song into episode 9 because it was about a teen idol. Not many studios would actually pay that much attention to that. Some of the background \u2018noises\u2019 and music sounds a bit like they came from the video game. The other background music is actually rather \u2018rocking\u2019 and has a bit of a fun beat to it. My favorite is some of the battle music.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder sometimes about the English dubbing. There was one little nit-pick that I have to say from the first episode, why does Yu\u2019s Uncle say that he picked up his nephew at the airport when we just saw him seconds on a damn TRAIN! It\u2019s Train Station you picked him up at stupid! Also, why did the person at the gas station ask someone who just moved there to think about working with him? He has no idea what this guy it like. I have problems with the tarot cards that they have as well. While I am happy that they have a show based around persona\u2019s and the fact of showing ones fate in cards that tell fortunes but the names that they keep calling the cards aren\u2019t right sometimes. The first card is not called \u2018wild card.\u2019 It\u2019s the card of the Fool. Now with all the odd things about this show, I have to say I really loved the strange fact that not only does Johnny Young Bosh play Yu Narukami, but he also plays Tohru Adachi, and it really was quite interesting seeing him interact with himself in a way. Also noted is Sam Riegel who played Teddie. I give him props for making a character that started out rather annoying, but yet grew on me so much more and turned into one of my favorite characters (Not my all time favorite, but still a favorite). My favorite still goes to Naoto Shirogane who is voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn who does a perfect cool and collected voice. And I give big props on the fact they only used Vic Mignogna for a character that only showed up for a brief time.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: I watched a couple \u2018Let\u2019s Plays\u2019 of Persona 4 the game and I have to say, the anime seems extremely close to the game. In fact, almost all the dub seems to be taken from the game itself. Now, I have not been able to see all of that, but it is rather close.",

            "content": "Good for fans of the game - And no one else.\r\nPersona 4 is a great PS2 JRPG and blah blah I'm not going to review it here.  Persona 4 The Animation is an animation based on the game (shocker!).  The set-up is thus: Yu Narukami, the protagonist, has just moved to the town of Inaba for a year because his parents are out of the country, he quickly gets caught up in a murder mystery, a mysterious other world, and a bunch of dorky high-school students.\r\nOver all Persona 4 the anime is good, but you have to attach a giant BUT to that:It's very much fanservice (the non-sexy kind).  The plot kind of assumes you already know what's going on from the game, the characters are more shallow and one-note than before, and really a lot of the fun of the series comes from just seeing how scenes of the games are translated.  To make things worse, the thing was produced on a shoestring budget, and rushed at that, which shows most in the art.  The art is horribly mediocre.  Some still close-ups look very nice, but in movement the characters go off model all the time, and everyone is generally pretty ugly.\\n\\n\r\nWith the negatives out of the way, though, we can turn towards the positive.  Even if it's a somewhat shallow adaptation, it's still a competent one, and it does a good job of capturing the feel of the game.  The show also does have some legitimately great moments that even exceed the game.  If you watch the dub, the VAs from the game are here, so it's high quality and feels legitimate.  I also have to give them credit for the protagonist.  They did a pretty nice job turning a silent protagonist into an actual character without betraying the feel of the protagonist from the game.  The music's also quite nice, featuring tracks from the game and new music by their composer, Shoji Meguro.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, PLAY THE GAME.  But then after you have, I'd freely recommend Persona 4 The Animation to you, you'll probably have fun.",

            "content": "General Review + English Dub Review (Sentai):\r\nGeneral Thoughts:\r\nI\u2019ve had the Persona 4 TV Game on my to buy list for years since I didn\u2019t have a PS2 when it first came out, so when I heard this anime was planned I was very excited and eager to give it a try.  I am happy to say that I wasn\u2019t disappointing at all and thoroughly enjoyed it!  I found the concept of each main character meeting their \u201cshadow self\u201d to be an intriguing concept and I liked the idea of confronting ones\u2019 hidden doubts and insecurities.  I will say that towards the endthe usual \u201cyou\u2019re a part of me and I\u2019m a part of you\u201d monologue after each character defeats their shadow got a bit repetitive towards the end, but the variety of stories kept each sequence fresh and somewhat new.  In addition to the overall theme, I fell in love with the diverse group of colorful characters.  I found myself very engaged and interested and it doesn\u2019t hurt that the anime pulled off humor and comedy masterfully when appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nI had a few minor nitpicks here and there that mainly go back to the anime being based off a game.  Some of the filler episodes felt out of place in the anime, mainly the summer festival sequence in the middle of the series.  While the bond-building and relationship dialogue had it\u2019s place in the original game, I felt the handling of it was a bit unsteady, resulting in an unsteady story progression.  Another minor quarrel I had were some of the later action sequences were almost entirely of Yu shifting though various Personas in rapid sequences that were probably required during gameplay, but felt a little odd while watching.  However the action was generally quite good and the Personas were animated very well regardless of any questionable battle sequences.\\n\\n\r\nIn general though I thoroughly loved this anime!  The characters completely sold it to me and despite some minor cliches here and there or the awkward summer festival arc, the characters were always a joy to watch.  The ending also had a nice twist and a villain I was not expecting which was a nice little bonus on top of a solid series in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDub Presentation:\\n\r\nSentai enlisted Bang Zoom Entertainment for the audio dub work which was a smart move in order to retain majority of the original game\u2019s cast.  With the exception of Chie played by Erin Fitzgerald and Naoto by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, pretty much the entire cast reprised their roles and it shows in the final product as performances all around were top-notch (though the new actors and actresses were outstanding as well).  Johnny Yong Bosch played Yu right on the money and it was refreshing to hear Yu have much more spoken dialogue compared to the game.  Yuri Lowenthal as Yosuke and Troy Baker as Kanji were two standout performances for me, stealing the spotlight whenever their characters popped up.  While I have been unsure of some of Kristi Reed\u2019s past directed works, this is by far my personal favorite of hers as the resulting dub is near perfect with the exception of one principal cast member which I will mention later.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Kanji\u2019s voice actor changes mid-way through the series though I believe most listeners won\u2019t notice the change unless they actively listen for it.  Though Troy Baker\u2019s performance as Kanji as superior in my opinion, Matthew Mercer\u2019s voice match to Baker is so ridiculously close it blew my mind.  While I feel Baker\u2019s lines flowed a little more natural and captured the Kanji\u2019s humorous moments a bit better, I commend Matthew Mercer for such a respectable replacement job, these two could be voice twins for this role!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately holding back this dub from a perfect 10 for me is Karen Strassman as Nanoka.  While I found her voice and inflection spot-on for the age of the character, her acting and dialogue felt incredibly inconsistent and forced.  At times she sounded so genuinely young but a good majority of the time her acting fell very flat and dulled many of Nanoka\u2019s key emotional scenes.  Another minor nitpick is the double casting as Johnny Yong Bosch as Yu and Adachi.  For the most part Bosch does a good job at distinguishing the two characters (which is very respectable considering the amount of scenes both characters converse with each other directly), however in later scenes where Adachi gets fired up and yells, the distinction between characters gets a little fuzzy.  However this is a very minor issue which does not detract from a very strong English dub presentation.\\n\\n\r\nRecap:\\n\r\nI found both the overall series and dub to be very strong and solid.  A few minor cliches and nitpicks and one particular actress holds this series back from a perfect score on both departments for me, but it is very close.  The story and concept is unlike any other anime I\u2019ve heard of and the outstanding English dub only heightens the viewing experience.  While I\u2019ve been disappointed by many of Sentai\u2019s recent works, their handling of Persona was great; an awesome anime with a likewise awesome dub.",

            "content": "Adapting a video game story into any sort of media outlet is much, much harder than adapting, lets say, a manga into an anime. Video games are the most immersive medium of entertainment I feel, because for all intents and purposes, you ARE the main protagonist, and you are living out the story and setting the creators have given you. That being said, the tools used to create these immersive settings for the player, the game mechanics especially, are extremely hard to translate into any other medium, since you are not interacting with the world, just observing. \r\nQuick disclaimer. I have played the game throughonce, and went straight into the anime after finishing it, so I apologize if it influences my review of the anime. I am under the belief that an adaptation doesn't have to be faithful to the source material in order for it to be good, so I will try to view it as it's own seperate entity.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I would like to talk about is the overall flow and pacing of the show. Translating 80+ hours of gameplay into 13 or so hours of anime means things are going to be tweaked around a bunch. That being said, the anime does a very good job of keeping the story in characters intact with such a limited timespace. However, the whole show feels very disjointed as a result. After revealing a certain plot point that is relevant to the story, the anime loves to timeskip to other days that are also important to the plot, creating this awkward pacing that sometimes skips through multiple days making it too fast, and sometimes having one episode be focused entirely within the timespan of a couple days, making it too slow. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some moments that I believe actually surpass the original source material. The biggest factor in this would certainly be the comedy. You'd think that the episodes focusing on comic relief would be kind of bad, but I enjoyed these more than the actual mystery parts of the show. \\n\r\nThe actual mystery of the show is fairly weak, so that's probably the reason why. \\n\\n\r\nA big part of this show is the main characters of the show getting kidnapped and thrown into this \"TV World\" where they meet their shadows. These shadows are pretty much the repressed feelings of that characters inner self; something inside of them that they want to forget about. Each main \"party member\" (except for the MC) gets these shadows, and they have to accept them, and when they do, they become personas. It's a pretty half baked explanation I know.\\n\\n\r\nThis setup creates some of the easiest character development possible. There wasn't as much as a focus on this as in the game, because of time restraints, but there was enough to create characters that are fairly layered. Other than that, the main bunch are extremely likeable, and add a lot to the enjoyment of the show, my personal favourite being Chie Satonaka. The side characters are less than spectacular for sure, since they are sidelined for the mystery, the main characters, among other things. Like, there is an episode where they try to develop 6 characters at once, that doesn't really work out at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Yu Narukami, is pretty much a blank slate. This is one of those things that works much better in a game since you basically build his personality to your liking, but in anime, he is only seen as boring, and at times, without a personality. Granted, there are times where does genuinely have some great moments, particularly at the end of the show. That, and he is a surprising factor to the comedic aspects of the show (mainly because of the dub, but we will get to that later).\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil the main villain for you, but let's just say you probably won't expect it. The way they hide who the villain really is is one of the better aspects of the mystery. As for the villain itself, you might find him a bit of a turn off since his main motivation is \"because I'm bored\", but he is still an okay villain by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art stays pretty faithful to the game, which is nice. Everything looks very detailed, and the character designs are well done. The music is mainly just copy and pasted stuff from the game, which is fine since I like the music from the game. The standouts for OP's and ED's for me would have to be the second OP and ED (which aren't copy pasted).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a weird thing to talk about. I'm not an expert on this, so I apologize if I am wrong, but it feels a lot like how a poorly shot western action movie is filmed. With those movies, the action is filmed with quite a bit of shaky cam and lots of edited shots that last only a couple seconds to indicate that stuff is actually happening. This is used mainly to mask bad directing. This is kind of how the fight sequences in Persona 4: The Animation look. Multiple quick camera shots are used with a very heavy motion blur to make it seem like the animation is high quality, but in reality, it isn't. Granted, there aren't many fight scenes to begin with, but that is just something I felt needed to be adressed. Other than that, the animation is standard fare.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'll talk about the dub. Since I played the game in English, it only made sense to watch the dub, since most of the people were voice actors for the game reprised their roles in this anime (except for Chie's VA, which made me very sad for a while). I feel they did a fantastic job, moreso than their performances in the game, but I have to mention two performances. \\n\\n\r\nThe first being Johnny Yong Bosch. In the game, he is the VA for the main character and Adachi, a rookie police detective. Since the MC barely talked at all, he only had to do various grunts and stuff mainly, and only had to do the VA for Adachi. However, in the anime, he still plays both roles, but Yu Narukami (the MC) gets much more talking roles, which meant he had to try and make two people with decent amounts of dialogue sound different from each other, and for the most part, he pulls it off, which I applaud him for. Not only that, but he is a big part in Yu actually having some emotions, along with his delivery of some of the comedic lines he says.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have Mary Elizabeth McGlynn for her performance of Naoto Shirogane. She plays the part of a male detective character very well to the point where she actually does sound like a guy, which is an impressive feat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI want to say that the biggest problem with P4: The Animation is that it is too short, but that isn't really it's problem. With more episodes, even if things would be fleshed out more, it would be very hard to keep the viewers interest. This is exactly why game adaptations are very hard to make. That  being said, it is probably one of, if not the greatest game adaptations for anime. It's shoddy pacing, lackluster side characters(except for a couple) and Yu Narukami, and average mystery/plot didn't really kill the enjoyment for me, as I still enjoyed the series wholeheartedly. Whilst not at the level of the game, I was invested into the characters, and the dub and comedy was a large selling point for me as well. If you don't want to spend 80+ hours on the game (which I would recommend as the game is quite fantastic), Persona 4: the Animation is actually a decent alternative. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is heavily laced in spoilers, so if you want to discuss it with me further, give me a shout on my profile. You can do the same if you want to discuss the game this anime was adapted from.\\n\\n",

The Persona's the characters use to fight are designed differently for each person so I find that cool. I heard the game was on a PS2. I don't have that system and I don't think I'm getting it anytime soon. I find the fighting scene's really cool as well. It's interesting how the characters go into a TV set. I don't think any other anime has that.",

I have to say, from someone who watched the anime after ten hours of gameplay, then later finishing the game after finishing the anime, it's fairly decent in it's portrayal of Persona 4. \r\nStory - 6\r\nI'll be fair here, the story isn't that good, or bad, in my opinion. To avoid putting spoilers here, I'll try explaining things without using plot points as examples. The plot of Persona 4 The Animation isn't very well grounded in the anime as it is inthe video games, but it's still a decent one to take a look at, if you're into Slice of Life/School anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. Nothing too major to point out, it's not outstanding, nor is it bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nMany of these characters are given fantastic development, well that may be stretching it, but they are developed well. It's great that the developers include Social Link events in the game, that will later affect the protagonist later. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I loved this anime. It's very enjoyable. That's all I got to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a decent anime, for fans of the original JRPG. I recommend it.",

            "content": "After watching this anime for 2 times and playing for 40+ hours of gameplay at the original game, i can confidently say that i love and the game and the animation aswell. The animation has actualy 2 cons infront of the source material: The first one - Fillers which are just killing the whole Persona 4 atmosphere with their stupidity, because in the original game every single filler/side-quest was connected to a side-character and the side-character itself wasn't felt separated from the whole story because of the \"social-link\" mechanics (but i have to admit that the 5th episode is one of the best in theanimation and it whole tells absolutely nothing about the plot itself and doesn't tell about the characters feelings and motivations aswell because it presents us the side-quest characters from the game which doesn't apear at the anime at all again. I was calling this a con also, but i think that Persona 4 shouldn't have been adaptated as an 100-episode grind kinda sort of anime with showing all of the side-characters and other things) and the second one - Not being friendly to the newcomers: If you didn't played the game, for the first time you'll need to get deal with the fact it's a game adaptation and many things as the persona mechanics wouldn't be explained. The idea of adapting the Persona 4 main storyline to an anime is great because it is interesting even without the fillers/side-quest things, but i think it is also the main reason why people hate it. The whole atmosphere of \"Friendship is magic\"-thing doesn't getting to you immediatly as in the game. As an adaptation it's great, but as an separated from the game anime it doesn't even worth to watch. I want to see more of adaptations like this, because they're can show you the game from another angle and show more than the game's plot retold.",

            "content": "Persona 4 The Animation should be mandatory study material for everyone who is tasked with adapting a video game into an anime or tv series because THIS is how its done. Persona 4 is arguably the best of the Persona series and this animation of the game is hands down the best video game adaptation anime I have ever seen. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well Ill get to that.\r\nStory wise this anime deserves major props for the near perfect job they did adapting a video game plot to an anime. Most adaptations of video games follow thenarrative of the game only loosely and end up doing a sloppy job story wise. Persona 4 stays extremely loyal to the video game's story, diverging only when it is necessary to do so (for example the long trek to dungeon bosses are usually glossed over in favor of an immediate confrontation with the boss). I was lucky enough to finish playing the game just before I started watching this and was amazed at how close the anime story is to the game story. In fact some scenes take the dialogue from the game almost word for word. Now despite all this praise its worth pointing out that as a J-RPG, Persona 4 is a heavily story driven game anyway so you would think it would be easy to just cut it up into 25 episodes right? If its that easy then how come other adaptations like the Xenosaga anime keep screwing up their game's stories so much? As I said before, the story is near flawless so 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the art, I have to give props to the animators for apparently studying the game religiously and making sure ever visual detail of both the characters and scenery are reproduced accurately in the anime. A lot of video game adaptations are thrown together in order to make some extra money off the game's fans but in Persona 4's case its clear a lot of effort was put into making this anime an extremely loyal adaptation visually as well as story wise. The anime even takes it a few steps further by showing us scenes that were never present in the game. While they went above and beyond on the animation, I give Art an 7 out of 10 because honestly the art style in the game is a tad stale since the anime uses the same art style it doesnt quite measure up to the art styles in other animes. Its still good though so once again, 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise, no surprises, the soundtrack is lifted almost verbatim from the game and if you liked the music in the game you are in luck cause the anime uses it too. However the opening and closing titles are (as far as I can tell) original and the soundtrack from the game is inserted with attention to context in the anime. Personally there was only one song on the soundtrack that I kinda liked, the rest were ok enough and the anime uses them responsibly so you never really get tired of one that is used too much. 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are seeing a trend then it continues with the Characters. The personalities of the anime characters match up almost perfectly with those in the video game and the anime actually takes every opportunity to expound on them, providing even more background than we get in the game but does so in a way that seems meaningful and not just tacked on. On top of this the voice actors are (in both the Japanese and English versions at I believe) the same ones used in the game and just as in the game everyone does a great job bringing their characters across, better in the anime in fact than in the game given the animation limitations of video games compared to anime. One key difference between the anime and the game is that the main character is mostly silent in the game but in the anime he speaks...quite a lot actually. The problem is that the Main Character in the anime is inconsistent and in some scenes just comes off as too robotic and less real than the other characters, however these scenes are few and far between and they do a good enough job with the Main Character and an excellent job with all the characters. Of particular note are Rie Kugimiya (Shana from Shakugan no Shana and Taiga from Toradora!) as Rise and Kappei Yamaguchi (L from Death Note) as Kuma. Ryusei Nakao (Frieza from DBZ and Mayuri from Bleach) even voices an important character in the last episode. All the voice actors and actresses do a superb job really but if I talked about each one this review would never get submitted. For characters, 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important question with any anime or video game is \"did you enjoy it?\" With Persona 4, if you liked the game you will like the anime, if you didn't like the game then you don't like J-RPGs or anime so you wouldn't be watching the anime anyway. Unlike most video game adaptions, Persona 4 does everything right and delivers an experience just as, if not even more, enjoyable than the game itself. The only problem is that if you watch the anime first then you have spoiled the game for yourself and if you play the game first you know kinda whats going to happen in the anime. Personally I played the game first and enjoyed the anime a lot so I recommend you do the same if you havnt played the game or seen the anime yet. 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSo if Persona 4 The Animation is a near perfect adaptation of a video game into an anime, why do I only give it a 7 out of 10? The simple answer is BECAUSE its a video game adaption. Video games are an interactive form of entertainment while anime and movies are not interactive. No matter how loyal you are to the game it doesnt change the fact that the story of a video game is (ideally) supposed to drive the plot and mesh with the gameplay. If you take the story and leave out the gameplay then even if its a good story its going to feel a little empty like its missing something. In the end you almost feel like you are watching someone else play the game for you (ok its more exciting than that I admit). Overall, compared to other video game adaptation animes Persona 4 is probably as good as it gets. However when compared with animes in general Persona 4 The Animation is good but not great, 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "This is one of the anime, where watching it can be a brilliant idea, or your worst choice in a long time. Starting from the routes, this anime was adapted from a game. The game was brilliant, and was highly renowned for being one of the best games of its kind on the PS2; so when the anime came out, people who played the game and were really looking forward to one of the best anime of the year, were quite disappointed. It wasn't that the anime was bad, for if it had been released as an anime before it was a game, reviewswould probably have been higher. It's just that the anime paled in comparison to the game. Partly because scenes were missed out, partly because they knew the plot among other reasons.\\n\r\n However, if you have never played the game, this is an okay watch. Starting with the story, we have a pretty different plot. It deviates from the generic romance and happy supernatural anime. There is death and mysteries to be solved, however there are heroines, but don't watch the whole anime hoping for a love scene.\\n\r\n The art is good once you get used to it. The illustrator adapted something new into his work which is meant to make faces look more realistic. It does work, but for a while the characters look like they have tanned chins. The sound is fairly good, taking some songs from the game, along with using some new songs and sounds not used in Persona 4 or previous releases of the Persona games.\\n\r\n The characters are a bit odd. The protagonist has this whole 'bystander looking out for everyone from the sidelines, whilst still remaining the center of attention' thing going on. This strangely works and is one of the things I like about the show. In the breaks of episodes you can see the protagonists development in his bonds with other people, improving his diligence, knowledge, expression, understanding and courage. The other main characters seem to all revolve around the protagonist, with completely different personalities. It's actually amazing how they all became friends, even in the circumstances they had to deal with. There is slight romance, but nothing to really take notice of.\\n\r\n On the whole, I enjoyed this anime a fair amount, but nothing really stood out, so I'm giving it a fair six.",

As a fan of the game I can proudly say they did it justice and then some. \r\nStory\r\nThis is story done right, no info dumping here. Every piece of information you learn is through the characters themselves. You discover the supernatural by following the main character, Yu Narukami.\r\nArt\r\nPersona 4 the Animation possess a unique sense of style that is sure to split people's opinions on this subject.\r\nSound\r\nThe overall sound is done quite well. Many tracks are brought in from the game alongwith some new that fits right in with the old. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is where the anime shines. Every character is unique with many hidden depths. Even the side characters are interesting and memorable. This is where the anime has outdone the game. The way they handled the MC from the game was my biggest worry and I'm happy to say they went beyond. They have made Yu Narukami into a fully realized fun character to watch\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is a pitch perfect anime that can pull on your heart stings or make you laugh your ass off whenever it feels like. A fantastic cast of well developed characters, interesting story, artistic style, and one of the best English dubs I've heard seals a 10/10 from me.",

The show is mainly a mystery. There is a lot of what seems like filler, but its really apart of the story in a way that doesn't really matter but is still notable.\r\nThe mystery is the most important part of the story, which is slowly revealed throughout the show until the end.\r\nMeanwhile, the characters who will become our protagonists begin to come together.\r\nThere are some unexplained things, like about personas, the fog, etc. Which were explained in the game, but nothere. If this were maybe as part of the game or something, I might give it a 8 or maybe a 9. But they could have put it in. But they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nPersona 4 The Animation has a noticeable art style sort of. Its better than average in its own way, but its nothing special.\\n\r\nThey did try some noticeable things with this show like on the characters skin, there was noticeable shading, but I think this works in their favor.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are fine, and seem to be based off of music from the game. As well as a lot of the soundtracks.\\n\r\nBut they were really unique and catchy. They fit well for the mood of whatever point the show was at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is probably the most important part of the show.\\n\r\nAll the major characters are pretty deep. They go though a change that is literally directly a result of the plot, and the protagonist's actions.\\n\r\n(Main Protagonist) Yuu is pretty quiet and mysterious. His character is pretty shallow, but only because he seems to be sort of unconflicted and one with himself. He can be badass at times, and say embarrassing things as he has to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nVery interesting, somewhat entertaining.\\n\r\nI was kind of touched with how the plot played out at some times, and the show has some nice slice-of-life parts to it. They don't try to mix in their every-day life with the action. But those moments aren't so memorable to me. I may recommend to someone who likes mystery. This is what I felt was the greatest mood during the serious parts of the show. Has its slow points but picks up a lot by the end. Might seem a little rushed but not really. I can tell it was intentional.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nVery good. I guess all that friendship stuff got to me, in a good way :) But if you dont really care for that then go ahead and not watch this. Like most shows, not everyone can love it. So if you're not really into the mystery, then I don't think you'd be very interested.\\n\r\nI will always recommend you at least try a few episodes, but I wouldn't expect just anyone to like it.\\n\r\nI do want to play the game now too, not just to compare, but for the sake of experiencing the full story.",

For this reason many things seem to happen without reason and the relationship of the characters seems to be that of people who know each other, it is because the game takes place in a school year and each relationship with a character has a developed subplot and obviously in the anime you do not get to explain of individual story of all the characters. My recommendation is that you shouldn't see the anime waiting for something for anyone, It ispreferable to play the game to know if it is worth it.",

            "content": "The purpose of an adaptation is to adapt an original piece of work into another medium. These adaptations are supposed to satisfy fans of the series already while being able to introduce newcomers on a positive note. \r\nPersona 4 the Animation is the anime adaptation of the 2008 PS2 JRPG Persona 4 and it does a well job adapting it into anime. With this anime adaptation being my first exposure to the Persona series, I think it does a good job doing so. This adaptation of Persona 4 convinced to try out the series, which I am having a lot fun playing. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe storyis probably the weakest part of this series. It starts of slow and only picks up after episode 10. These beginning episodes usually consist of two episode arcs of trying to find out the next victim and saving them. Once that section is over; we reach the middle section, which consists mostly of character interaction and enjoyable slice of life moments. Although the main murder mystery plot does not develop during this part, this part is still fun to watch. The end section of the show is when the murder mystery plot picks up again and we reach the climax of the show. The emotions you get from watching the final section is heart-wrenching and feels satisfying the murder mystery is solved. Although it starts of slow, Persona definitely picks up about halfway. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes this series great and makes up for the story, which can be slow at times.  The character interactions are also funny and awesome to watch, even if it involves minor characters. Each character is unique and has their own troubles, desires and struggles the must overcome; even the minor characters get development. This is what makes this series great. Most show usually sideline the minor characters, but what Persona knows well is that minor character have unique lives as well, even if they are not focused on as much as the main characters. The main characters are all unique and have to overcome their struggles to use the powers of Persona. Although some of the main cast isn't that interesting, watching them accept who they are is inspiring in accepting yourself. Through these characters, we learn that even though we have faults, they make up who we are regardless. And this is what gives these characters depth. The main cast is not is defined by their struggles, but rather it is part of them. Yu Narukami, who was original a silent protagonist in his game is given more of a personality and it fits him. The sarcastic but helpful personality fits his character well and in the anime, he has to go over his struggles as well, which was enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the series is crisp and fluid. The characters designs are also faithful to the original source material, while having its only unique flair. My only complaint on the art is the lower half of the characters' faces get progressive darker, making them look more tanned as you go down. It looks kind of unnatural and sometimes off-putting. This unique design choice by the studio is my only gripe in concerns with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic can be used in a show to help convey the emotions and create a tone for the scene. Persona 4 does this to near perfection with amazing tracks like \"Reach out to the Truth\" and \"I'll face myself\". Tracks like these can get you pumped for a fight scene, feeling teary-eyed during an emotional scene, feel for a character's struggle and many more. The music is super addictive and can be listened to on its own (I'm actually listening to one of the songs while writing this review). The openings and endings are great in their right and convey the feelings for the series well. I especially enjoy the first opening. The Japanese and English cast for this show was done on both ends. Each voice fits well for the characters and the writing for the series was enjoyable and easy to understand. The actors delivered there lines well, with fitting emotions for the scene they were doing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed myself a lot while watching this. Although the slow and repetitive beginning kind of ruined my enjoyment, the characters and their interactions really made this series enjoyable. The music and voice are also fun to listen to as well. It was a feels trip through the end that had me hooked into the plot, character and setting. This was a truly enjoyable show, that has a few issues, but it does not hamper its ability to entertain the audience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPersona 4 is one of the best video game adaptations I have seen and got me interested into the Persona series. A few issues here and there may impede it from being a masterpiece, but it is still a great anime to watch. Overall, I give Persona 4 the animation a rating of 9.2/10",

            "content": "There are 2 things I fear when it comes to anime. Movie adaption (Again, I sincerely apolgize for dragonball fans everywhere for Evolution), and video game adaptions. I walk into them with the lowest expectations possible like I do with every anime. Now there are a few I'm okay with like the Ace Attorney anime (Kinda in the minority there but I walked in and it met my expectations, which were average to low) and Pokemon (F*ck Black and White though). and then there are some I f*cking despise (School Days, Mars of Destruction and Skelter Sh- I mean Heaven...No further comment) and some thatwent below my average expectations (Blazblue) That being said I am a huge fan of the Persona series and when I saw this anime I didn't know what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nHello everyone. For those who don't know I am Josh and today I am reviewing the Persona 4 anime which is adapted from the popular gaming series with a cult following Persona. Let's get this show on the road\\n\\n\r\nStory: The anime stays faithful to the Persona 4 game which I like. Now note this is anime is based off the original Persona 4 game, not Golden, so if you played Golden like me, certain events will not be in there cause this is based off the original game, Golden added content. That being said the pacing is bad. Not the worst pacing I have seen in anything but it is bad. I have no real issue with them using the calendar in the anime but I do find it weird. Overall though the story gets a 6/10. They stay true to the game but the pacing can be a mess. The comedy in it can aldo be hit or mess sometimes but I found my self laughing more\\n\\n\r\nArt- I am okay with the art for the most part. It can be a little weird at times but anything particular bad. I'm okay with all the characters designs and the backgrounds can be alright. Overall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSounds- Sounds not bad. The first opening is one I am effy on but the second opening is real good. The voice actors for the dub are good anf they got my favorite one Johnny Yong Bosch voicing the Mc Yu Narukami so it gets a plus for that. Plus the endings are alright. Overall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are just how they are in the game, even the MC to a certain extent (The main difference being him talking which he doesn't do in the game). The characters are alright and came out feeling just how I felt for all of them in the games. The interactions between them though I had a few problems cause it seemed like they rushed the interactions. But overall characters get a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I really enjoyed this and to me this is probably one if not the best game adaption in anime. I found myself enjoying this one a lot\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Persona 4 is a good anime but it is an anime you might be better off watching if you played the game. I would still recommend it though to anyone cause it might be a good way to get you into the game. Overall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said I am out people. Peace",

            "content": "It's ironic that a game structured similarly to an Anime would create such a poor adaptation.  For the interests of disclosure, I am a huge Persona fan.  The expected fanboy criticism of an adaptation is that it isn't loyal enough to the source material.  I actually think this is remarkably faithful; what this anime lacks is the re-imagining needed to make a great game into a great anime.\r\nFor those completely unfamiliar with P4, it begins with a high school student, Yu Narukami, moving to Inaba for a year.  His arrival coincides with a serial murder case that seems to be tiedwith an urban legend named \"The Midnight Channel.\"  Yu and his classmates find themselves caught up in this case as discover an ability to enter TV's, use summonings called \"Persona's,\" all of which relate to the serial murders.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest discrepancy between a persona game and an anime is the silent protagonist.  Its role in a game is to enhance roleplaying, perhaps immersion, but this has no place in an anime.  Somehow, Yu actually manages to reprise his role as the essentially silent protagonist.  A rare deadpan joke with 1 or 2 lines meant to inspire at ciritcal points are the extent of his verbalizations.  His utter LACK of leadership and vapid, almost robotic personality doesn't fit with the respect he gets from his comrades.  He is seen as the leader by the group when to viewers, he's clearly a Robin, or maybe even an Alfred.  Not a Batman.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace is breakneck, and the series suffers for it in the early going.  We never get to soak in the creepiness of the murders, the newscasts, the body positions, and the bizzaro TV world.  Even the \"social links,\" relationship building sequences between the main character and classmates, feel rushed.  Absent are the dramatic changes of tone, or the critical moments that completely change the relationships' course.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems this Anime was designed with fanservice in mind.  It assumes everyone knows the story and doesn't bother illustrating it properly.  Instead, it just tries to cover as many events in the game as possible.  Less is definitely more in this case.  It's a nice recap of the P4 story for those who have played the game for anyone who needs one, but I wouldn't recommend it beyond that.",

            "content": "On the rare, but occasional occurrence, that a video game gets a great anime adaptation, don't pass it up.\r\nPersona 4: The Animation is based on the Shin Megami Tensei title of the same name. The plot follows almost the exact same way, with a few new jokes thrown into the mix here and there, and the re-imagining of others in an anime format covering for any lack of originality it might have from the original. Those of you who have played the game will know right away that the story is far from lackluster, combining elements of mystery and danger with supernatural action and excitement.Persona 4 was, in my opinion, the best game ever to come out on the PS2, and the anime does a great job of reinforcing the same spirit and levels of suspense to it that the game had, albeit in a shorter, and therefore more concise, package. This throws off the pacing a little bit, but it's not a big enough difference to make or break this show.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime adaptations, Persona 4 had a high budget, and it shows. SMT games are never ugly to look at, so the anime is just as pretty, with all kinds of great lighting techniques that really show off the perfect levels of detail and attention they paid to the artwork itself. At times, it feels closer to playing out as a live-action color manga than an anime, and this works to its advantage. The animation and style will keep you hooked, especially if you're an older viewer with fond memories of growing up and watching some fantastic animation out of older shonen-action series. That said, it's not style over substance, either, though. The show's got plenty of substance to back up that style, and it ultimately feels very rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, like with the games, the sound work is high-budget and it shows. I'm personally really happy that as much of the game's OST made it into the anime as it did, because you don't have to fix what isn't broken. That said, I prefer the anime's OP to that of the game's, which is a good thing. The few things they added into the anime that weren't in the original series don't hold anything back in terms of how it all comes together. Voice actors are just as precise with their ability to exercise their emotional versatility as they are in the game, if not, perhaps even more so.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this series have really taken off on their own. The game's silent protagonist, Narukami Yu in the anime, in particular, is a blast to watch. His jokes are simply great because, whether you've played the games or not, you can instantly get a feel for his sense of humor and victorious sense of style. The other characters and events have been expanded upon as well, and it sets up the protagonist and other characters alike to have much more familial, close relationships with their teammates than anything a silent protagonist could offer. In this way, the anime really succeeded at capturing the feel the game was trying to offer, without making you feel like you have to pick the controller back up when you're done.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. Everything feels right in its style and execution, and ultimately does a reliable job of bringing the story and characters of P4 to a wider audience with every step it takes. In short, this is a fantastic way to get into Persona without having to hunt down a copy and play through it, a task that can take upwards of 100 hours in one playthrough. Definitely give this anime a shot if you've ever been interested in Persona. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

It stands high above every video game in my mind.\r\nWith that said Persona 4 the animation is disappointing, but thats to be expected really. Persona 4 Golden took me 40 hours to complete and truthfully 25 episodes is not enough get the whole plot across. I believe the creators did as good a job as they could have possibly done with the time they had been given. The artwork is phenomenal, the characters amazing and the same great soundtrack carries over. It really falls short because itfeels like a condensed version of something that is so much more robust. For fans of Persona, I'd say, watch the anime because its really novel seeing it all in motion. If youre not a fan of the game I'd say, dont expect to be blown away because the story just isnt as fleshed out so nothing really has the same impact. Overall the anime is good but still seriously lacking substance.",

I have played the rpgs and the fighting games and all of them didn't fail my expectations one bit. Of course its not a perfect anime, mostly all have a few flaws...but the flaws are so unnoticeable in my eyes that they don't even matter. If you are new to the series I would suggest trying to play the rpg game first to further understand the concept of things like shadows, persona summonings, social links etc. ifyou dont and are a newcomer you will be quite confused. That aside I highly recommend this anime, the characters are enjoyable, the art is pretty good and also the show plays quite a few familiar tracks that the fans would take notice to almost instantly...not to mention its funny as hell at times lol. Two thumbs up!!!",

            "content": "A little insight to whom those that have not heard of the \"Persona Series\", Like all Persona series, the persona series has a Male protagonist, not all but mainly all.\r\nWhy is the series called Persona 4 The Animation and not just Persona? The story was adapted from the game itself, all scenes in the anime is a main scenery from the game itself. With that said, those who are a fan of RPG tactical games with a interest in visual novel mechanics; stay away from the anime until you've completed the game.\r\nThe animation itself had a great adaptation with their respective art style adapted fromthe game itself,it has similar characteristics; but the personalities differs on each character depending on how the main protagonist acts on his behalf, which showed to be promising.\\n\r\nThe story adapted pretty well with the game, but could've gone longer as the game moves by days and the anime had a lot of time skips to usually get to the important key points to the story line.\\n\r\nThe sound and characters had their respective Voice Actors which was great.\\n\r\nOverall; to those who want slight laughter with a sense of drama between friends and foes, romance and a tear jerker, you may want to watch the anime, you may not, but that differs on each individual. People who would want to watch Persona are usually familiar with the game and want to see it animated; some may want it due to the genre overall it's a great adaptation.",

            "content": "Video game adaptations are very tricky to do well. You have to make sure you please both the people who are accustomed with the game and those who are not. The story must have a sensible flow of progression and the cast of characters must be faithful and if possible, better than the game. Nonetheless, there are so many cases where the adaptations are schlock for the sake of schlock, recently Assassin's Creed. But most of the time the best level the adaptations can reach are usually up to the level of guilty pleasure and badassery, which at least makes them enjoyable as a popcornflick. But, animated adaptations are a whole other beast to tackle with. The people working in the adaptation do not have physical limits and games that would require years of production for a live-action film can be adapted with greater ease.\\n\\n\r\nI have never played a Persona or Shin Megami Tenshei game in my life and before watching Persona 4 the animation, I had close to zero expectations. The only thing I knew is that it was a cool series. I started watching it and it was decent. But oh boy when I finished it, was I depressed. I really enjoyed this series more than I expected. The comedy was mostly hit with the exception of the bear puns... Teddie is the worst thing to be created after Yukiko, for whom I will talk later.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the biggest plus in the series. The art and animation and the sound. The character design was very good in my opinion and Inaba looked like a very vibrant place. The TV world design was very cool since it changed depending on the person trapped in there, i.e. a hot spring, a laboratory and even a strip club. The fighting scenes kicked ass so much. And the animation definitely reinforced the comedy in the show. As for the sound, Shoji Meguro did his thing again. I got addicted to his Persona 5 ost and to be honest, I liked the ost for Persona 4 too. Except the second ending and very few standard tracks, the rest was kick-ass and nice to listen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters mostly are very good. Even Yu felt more natural as the show went on since some time was given for him to get a character, instead of being the (insert personality here) character. Btw Naoto is best girl and your waifu sucks! The only complaints I have for the characters are for Yukiko and Teddie. Yukiko is your class president but without any sort of personality except from the one shown in her episode. Also, who can forget her cringe-worthy bursts of laughter that always happened out of the blue and are very unfunny. If you replaced her with a cupboard it would not make a difference. And now the bane of my existence...Teddie and his dumb, I-want-somebody-to-kill-me-now bear puns or if you watched the sub, his ear-bleeding \"Kuma\" in every sentence. How un-bear-able! He is an annoying, perverted thing that should close his mouth every once in a while and just not be there for a few episodes, but nope...his un-bear-ableness cannot do that!\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story which is the weakest part in the show. Although it has its faults such as the two last episodes who took the speed of the first three and multiplied it by 5 and the TV world thingy that does not make a lot of sense in its own way, it is a pretty fun story and even the slice-of-life parts were extremely enjoyable and good for character development. Plus, the way Yu became stronger did not look like an ass-pull but instead his bonds with his friends are what made his Personas stronger. The killer was actually predictable in the end if you have read or seen lots of mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Persona 4 The Animation is an underrated hidden gem that not many appreciate and it has a lower average than SAO, because...\"it did not adapt fully the game\". Definitely worth watching.\\n\\n",

More importantly, the anime adds a lot of depth which is often only hinted at in the game.This includes both more detailed backstory for a lot of the key characters as well as heartbreaking arcs giving some insight into Yu as an independent person (rather than just the player) not found in the game at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Slightly worse than the game, but still very enjoyable. Yukiko for some reason looks very strange in this anime but they made Ayane less derpy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Solid voice acting, great throwbacks to the game music, and fantastic OP + ED + Insert songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Some characters are given a bit of a rushed exposition due to time constraints, but everyone's key arcs are included and most importantly there are a lot of new scenes and depth to both Yu and Nanako. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I marathoned this series immediately after playing the game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Persona 4 has one of the most optimistic and charming themes I've seen in anime, the anime is a great companion to the game and can stand on its own if you haven't played the game as well.",

The show understood that as well.\r\nStory 10.\r\nOne of the biggest compliments I can give this show is that it almost followed the direction of the game to the letter. Game related events were shown in the Anime very closely, while some had to be cut for obvious time constraints and keeping the show to a proper length. \r\nArt 8.\r\nNow the art is quite nice for most part. But it unfortunately falls flat every now and then. It hadsome lapses in quality even when something was the scenes main focus. When the Anime needed to focus more on fighting it staved itself away from to much flair for more of a Elegant look as to probably not task themselves to much.\\n\r\nSound 10.\\n\r\nNow I watched the English Dubbed version of the show, just to put that out there. I thought the voice acting was particularly good, with the Studio vying to stay with the original voice cast instead of going in a different direction. The openings are extremely well put together. With the songs being  in my rotation for when i'm driving. Even the Closing song which I don't usually give a second thought, was soothing.\\n\r\nCharacter 8.\\n\r\nThis could of very well been a 9 if not for the fact that they stayed away from to much Romantic involvement. Chie is just to cute you here me! The biggest complaint is that all the side characters are leashed to some Cliche that they can't quite break. The Voice Acting did a lot to make the Characters roughest moments seem better and more refined.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9. \\n\r\nThis is not a 10 because I already knew where it was going and the fact that even the Casual anime watcher can see some of the hints and guess how the show will end. Nonetheless the amount of times i found myself thinking to myself made this show instantly Enjoyable. To me a show being Enjoyable is when it puts me into the MC shoes and my IF factor. (If it was me)\\n\r\nOverall 9.\\n\r\nIf you love crime mysteries and Slice of life this show should be on your radar. Don't prejudge it just because it was a Game or you will sorely miss out. Now to find it on DVD.",

            "content": "This is the second anime I've watched that was adapted from a game (the other being Xenosaga), and it's definitely the better of the two. This anime did the game a lot of justice, but there were also some glaring problems that made the show difficult to sit through at times. But first, I'll just start with the positives.\r\nFirst off, the story stays very true to the game. There were a few side stories here and there, and relationships and events that happened in-game were fleshed out much more in the anime and actually were more exciting to watch. Characters that I felt like didn'thave enough personality in the game (specifically Chie and Yukiko) were improved in the show, and became likable. Really, the anime did a good job of fixing whatever was wrong or felt incomplete with the game. (Keep in mind I'm only speaking of P4, not Golden, as I've yet to play it.)\\n\r\nThere were moments that were really laugh-out-loud funny, too. Now, onto the unfortunate side of the show.\\n\r\nThe animation is probably first on the list. There were moments where the animation was really good, and then moments where I wondered if the animators fell asleep. There are quite a few derp faces throughout and awkwardly drawn bodies (specifically hands and arms). I felt like Kanji really got the short end of the stick; I can only recall a few scenes where his face didn't look strange. \\n\r\nNext is the lack of explanation. In the game, the Velvet Room was decently explained, as well as Social Links, but there's no mention of social links in the anime, just what they refer to as 'bonds'. Which makes sense, but you're left scratching your head at what exactly these bonds are, and how they correspond to unlocking the new Arcana cards that Margaret mentions. Unless you've played the game, these scenes can be quite confusing. The anime does a good job of trying to actually flesh out these social links/bonds, but as a result, you're left with some pretty dull moments in episodes, or in the case of the \"Do you love me?\" episode, you're left with a whole episode of boring. It wasn't really necessary to give Ai Ebihara such a prominent role, but I commend the anime for trying. My final complaint would have to be the anime adaption of episode 26, which in my opinion is an episode that's totally optional to watch. In fact, I don't think you should watch it, period. 25 does a good job of wrapping up the show, but if you want to see what happens in 26, well...you've been warned. But be prepared to hit google up for an explanation, because I know I had to. It was just so poorly written and executed that even though I'd gotten what happened in episode 26 (trying my best to not spoil anything here) in the game, I still had to look up what the hell was going on.\\n\r\nAll in all, this wasn't a perfect adaption of the video game, but it came pretty close. Aside from a lot of animation blunders that were rampant through some episodes, the story is very true to the game and even surpassed the game at some points in the level of enjoyment I got out of watching it. But if you haven't played the game, there are definitely some scenes you might be confused with. Still, that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the show, because the story is still sharply written and the characters are just as lovable.",

            "content": "Alright! My 4th review here at mal.. first if you are a grammar nazi then don\u2019t bother reading my review.  Why? English is not my native language. Some or most are spoilers ahead so if didn\u2019t played the game then it\u2019s better to back off and read other\u2019s review for this adaption. Since this contains major or a lot of spoilers thru out the anime be brave enough to click the spoilers button if they have lol. And I am a huge fan of Persona 4 so here goes nothing lol. So, if you are disappointed with my grammars then I am sorry seriously:P\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright let us start with the BGM, I rate it 7. The BGM is poorly overused. Sometimes the BGM is making it awkward to watch this cause the game itself doesn\u2019t have much voice over thru out the dialog. The anime is different cause you will hear the characters talking to each other with voices. Although the  execution when on the dungeon is still there the dialogues are purely voiced out or overlapped  so the great BGM is replaced by shouting/talking. This is also great cause they\u2019ve used the original cast from the game. Also note that the OP 1 and OP 2 are from the game.  Pursuing My True Self as OP 1 from the OP Credits from the game got remixed. Longer instrumental lol. Sky's the Limit well, kinda good for the beat.Beauty of Destiny for ED, I didn't really listened to this one. Except for the ED song from Episode 18. Burn My Dread OP at episode 15 brought back the atmosphere at persona 3.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt. I will rate it 7. 2d isn\u2019t fit for the usual characters that I often see when I am playing the game version of this although Yukiko is hotter than usual lol. I have no complains either at the animation. Some fighting scenes are good some are not. The lack of color is what I am pointing out here. But if you don\u2019t mind the colors like I do its fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the story \u2026. If you didn\u2019t really played the game before you won\u2019t understand a goddamn thing about this. Social links are the HUGE yeah I really mean HUGE part of the story. Although I am happy the social links fit the situation from the anime, some are really out of place like. I will give out the details later on when the airing is finished so there would be not much spoilers. I will rate 6/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier about the story you won\u2019t understand a goddamn thing about what the eff is happening at the characters. The characters revolves around the Social Links. some scenes are cut or rather than giving them more screentime they just cut the whole thing out. I will put 6 at the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment so far for me. I will give it 7. I understand what is the \u201cSocial Link\u201d so the enjoyment for this anime is a hit for me. I think they only focused on the Hermit, Chariot, Lovers, Magician, Emperor, Fortune, Star, Priestess and Justice social link. Although some of the awaited social links are seen over the anime but not that good compare to the game.\\n\r\nOverall? I will give this a 6. Some fit some doesn\u2019t . I believe that handling a game to anime is HARD. But not this crappy show although I am still watching it and barely holding until the \u201c true ending \u201c \\n",

I understood everything as I had previously played persona games, but I'm sure not everybody has. The other BIG letdown was the ending, which i will not discuss here so the people that hasn't seen it have a chance to see for themselves.\r\nThe ending left me hoping for more, I was expecting a battle better than on ep. 12 when Yu starts calling personas one after the other, butfor what I've heard they are planning on releasing an ep. 26 with the TRUE ending according to the 100% completion of the game.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line is that it is an enjoyable anime, it has its comic reliefs, which I liked, and it entertained me. But that ending killed it for me. I am disappoint",

            "content": "The way this Anime turned out is why Video Games are not good source material.\r\nPersona 4: The Animation follows the main story arc of the PS2 classic Persona 4. It is one of the absolute best stories ever told in that generation of console gaming. It's a story about friendship and conquering one's self.\r\nThe Anime follows Yu Narukami, who you play as in the game. The interesting thing here is that Yu in the game is a typical pair of trousers character. He was never supposed to be a real character. He was supposed to be defined by the player. The named him YU forgod's sake. Very noticeable for me were the authors' attempts to make an actual character out of Yu and I'd say that is done fairly well but the attempts (at making him a character) stick out like a sore thumb to anyone that has already played the game. This wasn't off-putting to me but I could see how it could be for some people.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why games might not be the best source material is that because this is an anime, and you don't have 2 hours to devote to exposition. You end up with a sophisticated mess that misses a lot of the detail that the game had. The first episode alone amounts to about 3 hours in the game. Mind you, this game is very heavy on the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem keeps on occurring. Some of the most fun I even had in the game is leveling up the Social Link system. To sum up, you spend time with a character developing your relationship with them. For that you're rewarded with the ability to create better Personas. You can do this not only with every one of the characters in the anime, but with tons of other side characters that don't seem to even appear here. and this is why I give 7 in the Character category instead of higher. Most of the character development isn't in the main story. While 'overcoming their selves' is, the actual stories are not. Did you know that Yukiko plans to leave the city? Well you couldn't have if you only watched this. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were unimpressive. They were pretty amazing for PS2 era but they don't hold up, unfortunately. You don't see many fight scenes in this anime, because, again, the source material is a game in which the player fights. I guess they could have figured out a way to do it, but they didn't have the time, or the resources, or the talent to figure it out.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, on the other hand is all from the soundtrack of the game which is absolutely brilliant. I love this thing to bits.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you really want to experience this story the way it was meant to be experienced, go play the game. Persona 4: Golden is available on PS3 and PS: Vita. What you have here is an abbreviation of the main story, and that's it. It's not bad by any stretch but be warned as you enter into the world of Persona, that this is a comparatively sub-par experience.",

            "content": "First, I would like to open with the fact that I've never played Persona 4, so my views are not in any way coloured by the video game.\r\nStory:\r\nPersona 4's story is fantastically written and acted out by its characters. It perfectly blends the themes of mystery and mysticism with the broader main theme of camaraderie, which is an overarching point in the anime and is easily its strongest point. The way the anime details the various struggles the characters go through, their increasing faith and trust in one another, and the foes their pitted against is extremely fleshed out, bringing the tale to life ina manner I've never quite seen replicated. The story holds your attention completely, never failing to entertain at any point, even during a couple of what could be seen as filler episodes, which in themselves serve less as filler and are exceptionally aimed at the characterisation of the characters and their friendship. The anime deploys heavy use of humour, but never seems excessive in any way and never fails to make you laugh at least three times per episode. Even when deployed in the serious scenes, the humour doesn't take away from the feel of the scenario, rather it serves to show the characters trying to make each other feel better about their situation than destroy the atmosphere. The serious scenes in themselves take on completely different angles, but always manage to get their point and atmosphere across to the viewer. Persona 4: The Animation is beautifully written, bringing across a variety of emotions in the viewer and telling an exceptional tale with completely unforeseeable plot twists, turns and character issues which keep you hooked from episode one until the end, and always leave you wanting more after the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nPersona 4's artwork is very well done, but can leave a little to be desired. I've noticed that each character's way of drying tears when crying seems to be identical, and characters seem to go a very long time without moving or blinking in a few scenes, but otherwise the artwork is very well done. The characters aren't drawn like American teenagers from most anime, and do look Japanese, which adds to the authenticity of the location. (A rural town outside Tokyo.) The character design is noticeably original without being too extravagant, and I believe that the small animations that play at points around character's heads (Sudden burst of flowers, sweat drops) are a constant reference to features that play during those scenes in the video games, which will serve as a point of enjoyment for those who've played the game. The fight scenes and particle effects are beautifully animated, and serve as a great boon to the anime's immersion and action, and the effects between characters facial expressions and their general attitude adds a huge amount of character to them in each of their scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPersona 4's soundtrack is absolutely sublime. While I didn't particularly enjoy the first opening theme, I didn't inherently dislike it, and the other ED's and OP were exceptional. The score of the anime itself were also superb, adding exceptional weight to scenes that were otherwise already powerful. This anime wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is without its score, and the fact that most of the songs are sung in English doesn't detract from their sheer coolness whatsoever. The two themes that play during combat, one a fairly rock-pop song and the other a piano piece that also plays slowly during the emotional scenes, are without a doubt the best pieces of the soundtrack, and I encourage listening to them even if you don't watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the Persona 4 characters are probably my favorite as an entire cast. They genuinely feel like people, with their own insecurities and issues, but also their own lively, profound personalities, and it is their interactions with one another that is probably my favorite part of the anime. Each character is noticeably distinct in and of themselves, but also function exceptionally well as a cast. Even supporting characters feel like mainstays, and no character feels left out of the series at any point. Even supporting characters that appear literally three seconds are somehow included later on in the show, and it's a wonderful job of making sure no one is unnecessary. My only, and extremely small issue, is the lack of characterisation for Yukiko. She does get some characterisation, but not enough to make her feel all that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved watching this anime. I laughed, I got excited, I got intrigued, I shared in the character's moments of pain, I shared in their moments of elation, and not once was I ever left unentertained. There were several points when I was watching when I was struck by how much I was thoroughly enjoying the anime and how much I loved the characters. If the soon to be aired Persona 4 The Golden is anywhere near as good as this was, I will be watching it just as avidly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and all of its aspects, and would firmly recommend it to anyone with the time to watch it.",

It is based on the highest rated ps2 rpg (and it lives up to that title.) just like the game, the series is amazing. The animation is really good and is quite colourful. The characters are really likeable which is good. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's really enjoyable and has a lot of comedic moments which are balanced out by dramatic and serious moments. And I have to say that the voice acting in theseries is really good with the voice actors from the original game coming back along with a new voice actor who voices the previously silent protagonist Yu Narukami.\\n\r\nDespite how good I think it is, there is something about it that I didn't really like. To make the series shorter, they missed out on quite a few things from the game. Sure they're not all that important but it would have been nice to see those parts adapted. \\n\r\nIf you are looking for a series and you are a fan of video games look no further than persona 4 the animation. I highly recommend it to people. Just go watch it. It's great. There is also persona 4 golden the animation which basically expands on it with newer events which take place in the game persona 4 golden (released exclusively on ps vita, the console that Sony wants to forget.) there's nothing more I can say really.

            "content": "Persona 4 the animation review\r\nPlot: The basic story of Persona 4 is that Yu Narukami moves to the rural town of Inaba for a year with his uncle and cousin due to his parents working overseas. When Yu moves to the town people start to die in odd ways and it is concluded that there is a murder on the loose in Inaba. So like all teenagers must you and his new friends start to explore a mysterious T.V. world which is linked to the murders and the murderer and in this world Yu and company awaken the power of persona. Yu and friends makea vow to solve the murders and bring peace back to Inaba.  That is the basic story and is very much the same story of the game; this however leads to Persona 4 major flaw the pacing. The pacing is all over the place in persona 4. It starts off steady but as the story moves on the story begins to jump all over the place and this can be a major turn off to many viewers. This is especially evident during the middle arc of persona 4.  Also it should be noted that due to pacing issues many things that were important in the game were skimmed over rather quickly. However the pacing issue is understandable as the P4 anime is basically the game in an animated form. The game was roughly a seventy five hour game (on an average play through) and a large portion of those seventy five hours was the actual plot and the social link side stories and it is very difficult to put all of that content into a twelve and a half hour show. They could have changed the story greatly and cut out all the social links and this could have helped the pacing but it would have made a lot of people angry. They tried their best to make a very faithful adaptation and they succeeded but this resulted in pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Persona 4 the game were all very well developed characters and were all pretty great and you could relate to at least one of them by the end of the story. However in the anime a lot of the characters don\u2019t get the development they got in the game. The best example of this is Yosuke. In the game Yosuke was a fantastically developed character who was very comical but had a deeper side to him than just the comedy, however in the anime Yosuke just comes off as your basic comic relief character which is a shame, also it should be noted that Yosuke was also a very important asset in battle in the game one of the best in fact but in the anime he and his persona come across as weaklings (not till episode 25 does Yosuke seem to be of use in a battle situation). Now while other characters suffer a development loss from the game one character gets more development here than in the game, and that character is the protagonist Yu Narukami. In the game Yu had the personality of a rock and had no real kind of development however in the anime Yu has excellent development. Yu when he arrived in town had as much personality as a rock; he only ever spoke when spoken to, had little to no facial expression and had no real emotion in his voice but as the series went on and as Yu\u2019s stats improved we went from having a terrible unlikeable protagonist to a pretty likeable guy. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Now this is an extremely mixed bag. Some in some shots there is some really great animation of facial expressions and some superb battle animations and effects but at other time the animation is just so terrible that you want to smack your head against the table. Some for the far away shots of the characters just look so terrible kind of like someone just scribbled on a head. This results in extreme derp faces. Also another knock against the animation is that the lower portion of character faces seemed to be a different more tanned colour than the rest of the face (however in latter episodes this problem seemed to be fixed or I just stopped noticing it). So over all the animation is not all that great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now this is a category I can\u2019t find any real fault in. All of the voice actors due a superb job here all the performances are very good however standout performances are Daisuke Namikawa as Yu and Mitsuaki Madono as Adachi. These two gave great performances especially Mitsuaki (mostly in episode 25). Now the soundtrack is just great. They took all the music from the Persona 4 and put it in the anime and the persona 4 sound track was great to begin with. Hearing reach out to the truth, I\u2019ll face myself, Heartbreak Heartbreak was all great. They even added some music form the Persona 4 Reincarnation sound track it was really great to hear the reincarnation version of I\u2019ll face myself. They even included (for one episode only though) the persona 3 soundtrack, having burn my dread as the opening for episode 15 was a great decision. Even the new original music was pretty great, the standouts for me was Sky\u2019s the limit and Beautiful Destiny. If I were to find fault in the soundtrack it would have to be with opening 2 song Key words plus it was just not as good as the other opening.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing: Now Persona 4 had major problems with it but by no long shot was it ever a terrible show, in fact it may just be one of the best adaptations of a video game to an anime. Persona 4 in no way was ment to be some award winning anime no it was made for the fans to see all of their favourite characters run around on screen and to see all of their favourite scenes animated. This anime was made by fans for the fans, and I loved watching every second of it warts and all.\\n",

            "content": "(Spoilers incoming) This review is coming from someone who's played the game multiple times. I think it's an understatement when I say the show is a very big disappointment.\r\nStory: 7/10. The story is really nothing special: there's a series of murders going on, and our protagonist and his friends investigate a parallel world using their Personas in the attempt to save victims and find a lead on the murderer. The setup for the story is alright, and the biggest appeal is the mystery of who the murderer might be. Other than that, the execution of the story is pretty formulaic and uninspired. It essentially followsthe pattern of:\\n\\n\r\n1) Person gets captured\\n\r\n2) Hero + friends find a lead and jump into the TV world\\n\r\n3) Big persona battle happens, person is rescued\\n\r\n4) Person joins the team\\n\r\n5) Bunch of filler social life until next kidnapping occurs\\n\\n\r\nAfter a while, the story gets stale until we actually reach the climax of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. The art isn't anything special, in fact there were times where the characters just looked awkward and stiff. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Persona is known for its fantastic music, although I'd say even in the games Persona 4 is known for having the 'worst' OST. I say 'worst' in relative terms because it's still a fantastic OST. I think better choices of music could've been used for certain scenes though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10. The characters suffer from a lack of depth and are essentially caricatures of what they are in the game, although that's to be expected when you only have 20 or so episodes to flesh out a team of several people. If you played the game and come into this, you'll probably be surprised at how shallow the characters are compared to their game counterparts. If you're coming into this show without playing the game, you'll might still think the characters fall flat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10. Instead of watching the anime, I should've just replayed the game. The anime does little to convey the true appeal of Persona, which is to engage the player into the world and characters as an active component in the narrative. With a game, you're part of the story: a driving force that can do whatever you want, building the relationships you want and forging the story you want to follow while enjoying a well-made RPG. The show in comparison is just a slideshow of Persona 4's main situations and social highlights. Personally, I found the show something unnecessary, as it just showcases parts of the game and adds nothing new to the series itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10. Despite my abysmal enjoyment, I think someone who hasn't played the games might be able to find (marginally) more interest in the show and be able to look over some of its flaws. However, I still think these flaws bring the show down quite a bit, and whether you've played the game or not I think the flaws of the show far outweigh the positives. I highly recommend picking up the game and playing through it yourself, because Persona shines as a phenomenal series when you experience it through the video-game medium. As an anime, it's nothing more than a sub-par detective story with mediocre characters and awkwardly fitted social events made in an attempt to cram 80 or so hours of content into a 20+ episode series.",

            "content": "This anime is based off one of my favourite game series and I'd wished I'd watched the show sooner. It's a pretty good anime, especially with the mystery side of it. I also love the characters and their very different personalities. I also like how it has a lot of funny moments and episodes. I also like how there are some things are kept a secret at the end, because they weren't explained like they were in the games. (e.g. The Velvet Room)\r\nBut I feel like about the first fourteen episodes were deeply tied around the murder mystery but then it sort of forgets aboutit then comes back to it at then end. \\n\\n\r\n(Lastly, if you're the type of person who likes a simple, happy ending, I'd stay away from watching the alternative ending. It was really confusing, for me at least, and really ruined it for me)",
