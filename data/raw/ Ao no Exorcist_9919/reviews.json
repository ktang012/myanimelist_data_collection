It will be too stereotyped\" When A-1 pictures said \"hm...why not?\".And they weren't mistaken. Now we have one of greatest anime of summer 2011. I enjoyed it so much and I hope you will too.\nStory 9/10: \n+:The story is just masterpiece. As i said, it stereotyped,but it does not affect at fun of watching. You just watch and say \"oh Sh**t! That was awesome!\"\n -:The story little bit slowly accelerates. I mean when you watch 1-2 episodes you think\"in the next episode he definitely will kick someone's ass!\". But in 6-7 story become boring a little bit. Because Rin collect his own team or smt else. \\n\n But I completely sure it will be briliant story. We just need to wait...\\n\\n\nArt 10/10:\\n\n+:I really love how ANE are drawn.It doesn't lose quality at battle scene, how does bleach or smt like that.\\n\n -:Nothing to say. Just 10/10\\n\\n\nSound 9/10:\\n\n+: Rin's voice actor is Nobuhiko Okamoto. He famous for acting in Bakuman, Bleach, Durarara!!, Shiki, Toaru Majutsu no Index, etc. Of course he great and I totally approve set of voice actors. \\n\n -: Opening, ending and soundtrack isn't so cool how it could be\\n\\n\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\n+: All the characters are charismatic and hilarious. Especially Rin. He is really character with balls. I definitely love moments when he release his demonic power. It looks amazing. Also in anime we have kinda tsundere, nerd, foolish beauty, badass friend and brother. Yes, I told you it is cliched. But it's doesn't nary irritate.\\n\n -: Too many minor characters. Trolls and atc...Why did you do that, men? they don't need to anybody! why you made the whole episode about it? \\n\\n\nEnjoyment 10/10: \\n\nNothing to say. I just in love with it since first episode.\\n\\n\nOverall 9/10:\\n\nIf you whant a classic shounen, which will cause you to scream \"OH MY GOSH!\" and all it conjugate with wonderful art, marvelous sound and damn good fightings so this is anime for you! m/",

            "content": "\"Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!\" - Anton LaVey\r\nOne of the constants of many religions is the idea that sin and evil stem from a higher power. In some cases this means another deity that works in opposition to all things good, but for Christianity, Islam and Judaism such things are viewed as the domain of Satan (or \"Lucifer, Fallen Angel, Prince of Darkness, Bringer of Light, Ruler of Hell, Lord of the Flies, Father of Lies, Apostate Supreme, Tempter of Mankind, Bringer of the Apocalypse, Old Serpent, Prince ofthis World, Seducer, Accuser, Tormentor, Blasphemer\" - Glen Duncan).\\n\\n\r\nWhatever name is ascribed to this being, the idea of him being the enemy of all things good is so deeply ingrained in society, he is usually depicted as the epitome of darkness and evil. While there are tales out there that try to cast Satan in a different light (for example, DC Vertigo's \"Lucifer\"), most writers find it easier to go with the prevailing opinion - which is a bit ... lazy to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the ongoing shounen manga by Kato Kazue, Ao no Exorcist follows the adventures of Okumura Rin, a boisterous teenager with superhuman strength and a problem controlling his temper. Together with his younger twin brother Yukio, they live in a small Christian monastery run by their father, Fujimoto Shiro, and several monks who have helped raise the two boys. The series opens with a group of priests who are frantically praying in unison, but one by one they are being killed by a mysterious blue fire.\\n\\n\r\nThe scene shifts to Rin, who has just punched a delinquent for shooting pigeons with a crossbow.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is a shounen anime, the plot adopts the action oriented, fight-of-the-week format that is so common in the genre. While this method is formulaic, it does have two advantages, the first being that the story becomes very easy to follow. Overly complex details and anything truly thought provoking have been discarded, which is more than a little ironic as, in true shounen anime style, this simplistic approach is reflective of the content of the series. The second advantage is familiarity, and while it doesn't seem like an important factor, it does play a key role when it comes to enjoying this show.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Ao no Exorcist also suffers from many of the problems that plague the shounen genre, partly because of the formulaic plot, but mainly because the series lacks the much of the depth needed to keep the story interesting. The lacklustre narrative is filled with bland humour and pointless angst, and because of these factors, the series has a tendency to veer off track. Although there are attempts to keep everything running smoothly, the underlying lack of creativity and complexity make this difficult to achieve. In addition to this, only a part of the manga has made the transition to anime, and much like the first adaptation of Full Metal Alchemist, the latter portion of the series is completely original - and it shows (more on this in a bit)\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to looks, Ao no Exorcist is on surer footing, although a part of that is because this is a manga adaptation. The majority of the character designs are very typically shounen in style (even down to the short, bald guy), but while the source material adds a degree of refinement to their composition, there are also a few inherent limitations. That said, there's a surprising degree of creativity in the supernatural elements of the series, and a few of the weird and wonderful concepts really steal the show. There are also a few imaginative settings that make a nice contrast to the rather humdrum everyday scenery, and when everything comes together the overall effect can be colourful and slightly outrageous (in a good way).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, A-1 Pictures have done a decent job for the most part, even with the typical shounen posturing and theatrics. The characters move well, if at times a little unrealistically, and the majority of action scenes are fluid and well choreographed. Unfortunately there are some noticeable occasions where the standard drops, and sadly these aren't limited to periods of frenetic activity.\\n\\n\r\nThe strong shounen theme is prevalent in the two opening sequences, both of which are filled with action, posturing, and a smattering of angst. In addition to this, the two introductory tracks, \"Core Pride\" by Uverworld (episodes 1 to 12), and \"In My World\" by Rookiez Is Punk'd (episode 13 onwards), are very typical rock songs that one might find at the beginning of any shounen anime. Ao no Exorcist also features two ending sequences, the first one being a CG \"journey\" through a city that is accompanied by \"Take Off\" by South Korean boy band 2PM. The second features a montage of the characters against a variety of patterned backgrounds, all to the tune of \"Wired Life\" by Kuroki Meisa. The rest of the soundtrack is features dramatic orchestral pieces and strange little comic relief ditties, and while these are generally well choreographed, as a whole there's nothing really special about the background music.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the shounen genre is that it can often be too formulaic, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the dialogue. The script appears to have been written by people with no idea of how teenagers actually talk, and the conversations are filled with pointless banalities, angst ridden diatribes and cumbersome bravado. Everything's a bit too contrived, and to further compound matters, the voice actors have obviously been instructed to play their parts with extra \"oomph\". The result is that emotions like anger, frustration, joy, fear, etc, often involve lots of shouting, while the rest of the acting has enough ham to start a business making sandwiches.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a veritable \"who's who\" of stereotypes, and it can sometimes seem as though the mangaka has followed the instructions in \"How To Make A Shounen Character\" to the letter. Rin is the typical lead male - all brawn, very little brains, and tries to solve every problem by hitting it, and surrounding him are people who epitomise their archetypes. In addition to this, Ao no Exorcist makes the age old mistake of assuming that overcoming trials and tribulations equals development, and while some of the characters do learn a thing or two over the course of the series, much of what passes for growth is nothing more than window dressing on a mannequin.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty the only interesting person in the whole show is Yukio, but given how shallow everyone else is, this may not be saying much.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist isn't a new concept, and much of the inspiration for the story has obviously come from Mike Mignola's \"Hellboy\". The sad part is that although the latter work is a gripping supernatural horror/thriller that touches upon many different cultural beliefs, legends and aspects of folklore, virtually none of that is present in this anime. The decision to make this a shounen tale has placed severe limitations on what can and cannot be done, and this means that the narrative can't achieve the atmosphere, the tone, or even the level of complexity of Hellboy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us back to the latter portion of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the series moves away from the source material the story takes a slightly darker turn, and several themes are introduced that, if they had been used earlier, could have raised the show above mediocrity. Unfortunately these concepts are only lightly touched upon, which is a shame as there was an opportunity to take the anime in a direction that would have made it far more interesting than it actually is. That doesn't mean it should have gone done the path used by The Omen trilogy though (i.e. Rin becomes The Antichrist), but it would have been nice if the wistful, almost melancholy desire of his father was examined in more detail.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of its flaws it may seem as though Ao no Exorcist has nothing to offer, so it's surprising that the show is reasonably enjoyable. That said, the best way to treat this anime is to think of it as a rather long action movie that has difficulty getting to the point, and if it's watched for the sole purposes of no-brain entertainment, then viewers can expect a decent return for their time.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, with two live action movies, two animated features, and a world of difference in content, some people may find Hellboy a better proposition.",

            "content": "I started this show with high hopes; needless to say I was let down. I liked the aesthetic, the characters seemed ok and I liked the premise. All signs pointed in a positive direction.\r\nUnfortunately, that's exactly what this show lacked: direction.\r\nAside from establishing the premise, very little is done to advance the plot throughout the show. Most of the show is episodic, and the archs don't build up to anything. It really seemed like the creators didn't know where it was all supposed to go.\r\nOne of the things that disappointed me was the fighting, or the lackthereof. From the beginning they establish a universe withpotential for awesome, supernatural fighting, and even introduce a number of characters that would probably be pretty awesome for that kind of show. In the end, there was really only a couple of fight scenes, and most (if not all) of them involved the same couple of characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also disappointing considering those fights ultimately meant nothing. They had nothing to do with any overarching plot because there was none; at least, not until very late in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending for this show was pretty bad. It didn't do anything interesting with what the show brought to the table, and was downright terrible from an action standpoint. If it had introduced some kind of twist or something, then it might have redeemed the show a little bit, but it didn't. \\n\\n\r\nSince both the action and the plot were nonexistent, there's really not much reason to like this show, though I will give it that the aesthetic and comedy were nice. It's a show that could have been nice had they decided whether or not fighting was what they were going for, but they couldn't make up there mind, and in the end they had nothing to show for it.",

But there was little depth in the characters otherwise. Instead, the writers took theeasy route and focused on Izumo's (spoiler) easily-predictable somewhat transformation and Rin and Yukio's unorthodox relationship (which came off as awkward and forced to me). Though I must applaud the series for (spoiler) letting Noriko go, which shows some resolve. \\n\\n\r\nConcept & Execution: 5\\n\r\nThe daddy complex was nothing new, though I thought the religious overtones and occasional references were interesting and almost Neon Genesis Evangelion-esque. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 4/4\\n\r\nI was rather let down by the series after hearing so many good things from friends. The first few episodes are still wonderful and emotion-filled, in my opinion, but the rest of the show fails to follow-up and the conclusion is horrifically anticlimactic, (spoiler) with the exception of the relationship between Rin's mother and Satan, which I found surprisingly touching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels like a textbook shounen that could have taken an edgy turn with the religious overtones and instead wimped out.",

            "content": "Ao No Exorcist is set in a battle of exorcists versus demons. It is a typical shonen with a good main character as the backbone. \r\nThe backdrop of the story is that Rin and brother Yukio are the sons of Satan and a human mother. Rin inherited the demonic powers, while Yukio didn't. They are taken in by the current Paladin, Shiro, who raises them as sons. Soon, they are thrust in an ongoing battle of the Exorcists versus Demons. The story gets off to a very fast start, but from what I understand, lack of material for the spots the manga covered caused somemore prolonged fillers than usual. Towards the end when the story picks back up, there are some \"jumping the shark\" moments which try to add to the intrigue and plays well on the Rin's character, but ultimately falls flat. \\n\\n\r\nRin makes an excellent main character. As the son of Satan who wishes to fight demons his very existence challenges the traditional views of the vatican, the major \"good guy\" base, in the series. He's foremost, a character you like to root for. \\n\\n\r\nHis brother Yukio is somewhat a foil to Rin. His personality is pretty much the opposite of Rin's, and even his weapon choice (guns) are contrary to his brother's (A sword). The strong point about both characters are that both of them have a good mix of personal strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nAs good as the brothers are, the supporting cast fails to meet the same marks. Most of them have some sort of character episode or small backstory, but none of them really have any true development. In comparison, a show like Soul Eater (while having twice the episodes) managed to handle all of the characters in a way that made all of them seem important, this is not true for Ao No Exorcist. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a fairly good mix of comedy and action. Some of the more comedic episodes are actually the stronger ones as they tend to focus more on a characters personality rather than the kinda middling story. \\n\\n\r\nAo No Exorcist is nothing new to the Shonen world, it suffers from some pacing issues and a bland supporting cast, but has strengths with the mains and overall theme. It's a decent show with some demons to deal with.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist is a short shounen that has become memorable. That's not the same as saying it's great though. Here's why.\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nRin and Yukio were raised by a priest, yet are the sons of Satan. Sadly, it turns into more of a school setting- based anime. While there are still some good, fast action scenes, there are too many plot holes as the story goes on. They train to be exorcists in this school, even though they are part demon themselves, so that becomes a large plot device. One of the better ones too. It's OK, nothing spectacular.\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI love the art. It complementsthe action scenes real well. It can be dark or light depending on the scenario. Well animated and colorful enough to not loose my attention.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nCathy openings and endings. The ost's, though could use some work outside of battle themes. The English dub was not quite as good as it could have been, as it does not fit the character roles all the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThis has to be the most memorable part of the show. Rin is calm and collected, and only freaks out when a normal person would, unlike most main characters. This is not to say he's not fun, he knows fun more than any stuck up snob in the academy. This is what I do NOT like. Yukio is the most legalistic person on the show. Whenever they argue, I find myself wanting to have Rin beat the living shit out of his brother.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\r\nGood popcorn flick. The beginning was great, then slowly turns into a typical shounen that has semi-fulfilled potential, that does show up at times in the series. Once I was finished watching it, and listening to the ending themes over and over, I could move on with it always in mind. Don't rush into it expecting very much and you'll like it.",

            "content": "This review has been edited quite a bit.  Ok, first off, this anime does not seem to following the manga closely anymore.  Up until ep 13 it was, but after that, who knows where the story will go~\r\nStory 9: The story was so tightly packed into the first three episodes, it felt like I was watching some kind of epic movie.  I'll admit the basic plot has been done before, we have all had our share of Son's of Satan, but it still manages to be interesting anyways.  Somehow it has that spark which makes it amazingly unique, yet it stillincludes anime cliches at the same time.  The good thing about this show is that you'll know if you like the story just from the first episode.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this is true about the first few eps, I can't say it is the same for the rest of the show.  Ao no Exorcist is still enjoyable, but the action is far less than it was in those eps.  The action did pick up like for example in ep 12, but I can't say it's consistent.  Read the manga if this bothers you~\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: The art is perfect for me.  Honestly though, it's a matter of opinion.  I don't like my characters too bishounen or too muscular.  The characters are drawn, for the most part, in between the two (leaning on the bishie side), so I love it.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Sound I love the sound as well.  There was appropriate music in the appropriate scenes that's all I can say.  When the tragic moments occurred, really sad music played.  When they were running/fighting against demons, it was more upbeat.  It was well done in my opinion~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: Characters now this is my favorite out of everything (even though everything is rated the same).  Rin, the main character, is not too whiny nor really bad ass.  He acts like a normal 15 year old for the most part, although a bit on the bad side until, of course, he finds out he's a demon.  The main enemy on the otherside, Satan, is extremely creepy and scary (imo).  But this is good because who wants a sappy enemy?  At least you know that he won't be one of those villains that switch sides.  If you like your main characters not too over the top and your villains totally villainous, this is your show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:  I REALLY enjoyed this show.  I've been pretty much obsessing over it so much the past few days it's sad haha.  Maybe you'll end up the same way, but that won't happen unless you give it a try.  Demons and exorcists fighting, that's the basic point, although that's definitely NOT the entire story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:  Overall, I love this show.  Hopefully it can continue being this good in the future.  -edit- I'll admit it does get slow eps 4-8, but as I have read the manga, believe me there is action to come.",

This anime oozes from genericism.\r\nStory: 2, Character: 2\r\nYour typical shounen story done a million times, only now with exorcists.\r\nThe story starts as Rin, the protagonist and the guy who gets the most favorites of the show in MAL, becomes an exorcist because of certain circumstances (I don't want to spoil you why).\r\nHe enrolls to an academy, which deals with many things, along how to become a full fledged  exorcist.\r\nSounds interesting at first? Well, NOPE. \r\nThe execution is so generic and bland.\r\n*We have a protagonist who is short tempered and likes to fight alot? check.\r\n*His brother is a cool calculated guy whothe protagonist want to surpass? check.\\n\r\n*A useless female heroine/supporting character? check.\\n\r\n*A chock full of cast of annoying and useless characters? check.\\n\r\n*A female character with weird eyebrows that is even more useless than all of the other characters in the show? check.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is your typical  Naruto/Bleach/One Piece, only with ten times more annoying and bland and useless characters. Even Heroman has more story going on than Ao no Exorcist, and Heroman doesn't have any story! EVEN HEROMAN HAS A CAST OF BETTER CHARACTERS...Wait... does Heroman has any notable characters?\\n\\n\r\nThe single interesting character of the show WAS Rin and Yukio's dad. But because of certain circumstances, he's not in the show anymore (I don't want to spoil you why).\\n\\n\r\nRin main goal in the story is to defeat SATAN. How is it different from your typical shounen goal of becoming the Pirate King/Hokage/whatever Ichigo from Bleach wants to become? Well, it's NOT.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5, Sound: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are the strongest point of Ao no Excorist, but the art and sound are wasted on this bland show. The opening theme and ending theme songs are catchy at first, but then become annoying after a few watches because of their bland contents. The voice acting is bland too, because the script is bland and the lines are straight from a B-side shounen show. Did I mention the word Bland?\\n\\n\r\nThe art inconsistent, because many times you will notice the QUALITY. You feel that all the budget of  the animation went to the damned and notorious cooking filler episode, because the foods look awesome, man!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nWhat Enjoyment? Nothing is enjoyable about this show. But... it's possible that it will be enjoyable as your first anime, because baby's first anime is always enjoyable and unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nI can't recommend this show to anyone and not even as a baby's first anime, because there are much more interesting and unique anime shows out there  that you can watch as your first compared to Ao no Exorcist.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like generic stuff/Naruto-One Piece-Bleach you might enjoy this anime. Otherwise, steer away. It's not worth your time.",

            "content": "Hey guys, this is my first review on this site and frankly it's my first review I've ever written so here it goes. \r\nAo no Exorcist is an classic shounen anime as you may know judging by the hype it has gotten. Well to cut to the story, it revolves mainly around Rin whom is a demon spawn living in a chantry with his father, brother and a bunch of munks/exorcists. \r\n  The theory of the story is good, but not well made, a battle between exorcists and demons, a struggle to fit in where you should not belong, a strive to be thebest. The pace in the story line kicks of in the first two episodes which frankly I think is great but after that is slows down more and more 'til the end of the anime where it speeds up 9999% without warning or preperations. That is a bad sign, to speed up an anime just to fit the ending in 4 episodes, I haven't read the manga so I can't say if the story is copied 100%. In my opinion the first episodes was freaking awesome, it was battles, hearbreaking and were exiting. After those episodes it slows down as I said before, to a pace were it resembles  fillers that you can find in Naruto and other animes that are over 24-50 episodes. That is bad my friends in a 25 episoded anime, and it cuts down the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n  The art is just great, it's classic, nice colors plain beautiful. It goes from small cute demons to rotten ghouls very well made I must say and a very high variety of characters, you won't see anyone in this anime look the same exept from some smaller demons. The sound in this anime is well placed and has a great soundtrack fitting the moments. The ''main characters'' are well placed so to say, a great kemistry and gives a nice vibb to it. They have the right voice casting for every person that fitts their personality.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall it's a fair anime in my opinion, it may have a good theory behind it but is crushed by the way they made it to the screen. It jumps from one thing to another so it's hard to keep track of where it is taking you. I had high expectations for this anime which is a bad thing when they are not able to pull it through the way I like it. But, I have not seen the whole anime since it has not been subbed but I know that I can make a clear statement of the score I want to give it, sadly I think it's a disappontment.",

            "content": "Let it stand that I have not given the manga any read whatsoever so I'm not sure of any kind of discrepancies, but I would have to say that from my experience with manga|anime comparison in general, I think A-1 Pictures has done an outstanding and top-notch job with the anime adaptation of Ao no Exorcist. To note, I have given every criteria of this review a 10 except for the story, which I granted a 9. Normally, the rating of a 10 seems to be very esteemed to me, just because it represents a perfect score. However, myanimelist's linguistic translation of the \"10\" asan \"outstanding\" compelled me to score it as such because the series simply is o u t s t a n d i n g. \\n\\n\r\nGetting back to what I surfaced upon earlier, A-1 Pictures has created an excellent adaptation. I''m compelled to think that the anime is better than the manga (probably without justification) just because of the elements included that a manga, UNFORTUNATELY, cannot implement such as color, motion, soundtrack, voice acting, etc. etc. all of which are conspicuously done with great detail in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd here I go, cracking my knuckles, preparing to review each category of rating as I listen to Takeoff by 2PM, the first ED to the series. And whilst typing that, I've decided to start in the order of appearance. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story, it has presented itself with expansive potential. It doesn't seem like I'll be able to avoid spoilers now so you have been warned. As the first and second episode have shown, Rin's adventures can extend to the realms of working at the local supermarket, beating the crap out of a pretentious wealthy douchebag, throwing a trident at one of Satan's underlings, being absorbed by the gates of hell by his (literally) Satanic father, or attending True Cross Academy. As a shounen series, I'm particularly happy that it can include the slice of life portion, humor, and in-depth character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Personally, I am a fan of mangaka Kazue Kato's artstyle. Prior to the first episode's airing, I was up and about ogling at his volume covers in excitement of the series premiere.  And then A-1 Pictures comes in and provides us with such excellent animation quality (which truthfully and unfortunately, overshadows their work on Fairy Tall), subsequently whooping my ass upside-down.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The seiyuus are a part of a great cast is what I have thought since the start. The soundtrack specifically \"sounded out\" for me in the second episode. During the Gehena Gate opening and the funeral was where the compositions really enhanced the intensity, pushing me off the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Lovely. Not only are the characters witty, humorous, respectable, but the character relations have already shown heartfelt aspects in the first and second episode. Rin and Yukio's brotherhood made me reminiscent of One Piece's Ace and Luffy, which only made it more emotionally awesome for me. If it's still unclear how cool they are together, just think of them as potential Edward and Alphonse Elric or some such! Episode two nearly had me tearing up at that one, particular part... Also worth noting is that none of the main characters introduced so far are female, a very commendable achievement for Kazue Kato not to depend on erotic or sexual elements to keep the story and characters (if you know what I mean) driven. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 10.\\n\r\nJust recognize.",

For those who are not afraid to be disappointed in a story they've seen many times in many different places, this anime is still quite bearable.

Rin is training to become a demon exorcist- talk about ironic. \r\nOverall, this anime so far has been extremely entertaining and actually has had some surprises, which makes it more enjoyable.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe storyline in connection with the characters and their motivations actually seems believable. It's not some far-fetched concept with characters that don't do anything at all related to the plot. The way the story of Ao no Exorcist is connected by and through the characters if very realistic and makes the story very enjoyable to watch. \r\nArt: 10\r\nI really like the art style, it has angularlines with some soft coloring in contrast with bright colors. It makes it very appeasing to the eyes, lol. Also, the city in which the school resides in is very cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening/ending is pretty good, but other than that, the sounds in the anime are just general so far, nothing too fancy but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character of Rin is well developed and he actually sticks to his motivations and personality. His personality supports his actions and vice versa. He wants to become stronger after seeing his father die, and wants to deny his demon self because he wasn't brought up that way, and demons have harmed his family. His slacker attitude fits him well and provides comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nYukio actually has surprised me. His character as first is different from what is shown a couple of episodes later. But in fact, his actions in the first episode completely make sense once you know more about Yukio. Most of his reactions completely make sense with his studious, serious personality. It is a nice balance when Yukio and Rin are next to each other since they are so different. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10!\\n\r\nIt's been a really good 3 episodes. I definitely recommend it. The characters are fun and genuine, and the story is extremely compelling. Plus, there's nothing wrong with watching a teenager burning with blue flames and slaying demons with a katana. \\n\\n",

Protagonist is fighting against the biggest embodiment of evil there is(+1) for revenge of his father(+1) who died trying to protecthim(+1).  (Total clich\u00e9 points so far +7)\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist have a brother(+1) that is smarter and more skilled than him(+1), including more popular with the girls(+1), and he appears to be wearing glasses(+1). The brother have higher rank than the protagonist in their job(+1), prefer long-ranged weapon in comparison with the protagonist\u2019s preference of melee(+1), and the protagonist wants to surpass his brother(+1).(Note: please take into account that some points regarding Yukio is meant to be taken as \"secondary lead male\" rather than \"brother\") (Total clich\u00e9 points so far +14)\\n\\n\r\nNow we also have a heroine who is a klutz(+1), doesn\u2019t fight herself(in this case fight with her summoned demon)(+1). A group of people who are seemingly unfriendly at first(+1), which one of them took position as the protagonist\u2019s rival(+1). The group grew closer to the protagonist but become hostile more than ever when they learned of the protagonist\u2019s secret(+1), and so the protagonist must try to convince them 1 each at a time(+1). (Total clich\u00e9 points +20)\\n\\n\r\nSo there you go, 20 clich\u00e9 points altogether, but that wasn\u2019t the reason I decided to drop the show from my list, I can live with the clich\u00e9s and would even admire them if clich\u00e9d points turned out to be used uniquely. The reason I decide to leave this show is how it strayed from the manga, I have not read the manga but it simply seem rather obvious that what happen in ep16 is written by someone from the anime team who have very weak writing skill. The early eps was fine in my opinion, it was indeed clich\u00e9d but the writer still managed to make it touching to a minor extent, but after that nothing else touch you anymore and I was simply sitting there, waiting for something non-clich\u00e9d to happen, which it did not.\\n\\n\r\nThe usage on each terms are could have been achieved with better researches. The first example is the usage of the word \u201cPaladin\u201d, if you have played some RPG games you would have known that paladins, while may be a class of high rank warriors, with some saintly properties, are by no mean the best. Real historical paladins are the best guys the holy court can have, which is obvious that the king will have better men than that, and even more obvious that it is not a title suited just for 1 individual, as historical evidences pointed out that there are indeed multiple men who bear the title \u201cPaladin\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFurther points about this ranking system, I highly doubt how Fr.Fujimoto, Rin\u2019s father, who was appointed the Paladin when he was still living, would be free enough to live in an old church in the middle of Tokyo, raising 2 boys while keeping one away from the existence of anything magical. That logic never worked anyway in any situation, if you\u2019re the top guy the organization have, then by normal logical thinking, you would be so damn busy that you would never get to exist in the old church you own, let alone raising boys and keeping big secrets, if you\u2019re not gonna do it then you\u2019d be instantly demoted. And as of anime ep16, Arthur Auguste Angel, the new Paladin along with Shura, a high-ranked exorcist could not handle golem-form Amaimon despite going 2 to 1, but then Rin awaken and bam! In 5 seconds Amaimon is history. So either Rin should be promoted uber-Paladin right at the spot, or Angel and Shura should seriously be fired from the Order.\\n\\n\r\nAnother inaccurate use of information is on the use of demonology, as an expert in world mythology myself(for my age, I have over 400 hours of research on myths of the world), each demon names used are either inaccurately used(Naberius being a lesser demon, while Astaroth and Amaimon are high-ranked demons, in reality all 3 are individuals among the 72 pillars of Ars Goetia and supposedly comparable in strength), self-made up demons(Leaper and Coal Tar should have been obvious enough), and for anime\u2019s case, inappropriately used (Mara got demoted to a mere lesser demon when in truth, he should have been the Buddhist equivalent of Lucifer, being the tempter of the messiah of their respective religion, no you would not want to see Lucifer die by a single gunshot(unless the title of the anime is \u2018Yondemasuyo Azazel-san\u2019 in which a shoe would be enough to kill even Satan) so the usage of Mara in the anime as a minion demon disturbed me alot)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are the saving grace of this series, the art is neatly drawn and the designs are actually not-so cliched as everything else the plot covers. I actually liked the second OP and ED and felt a little regret in dropping the series almost as soon as the new songs came up, the voice acting is nice with a neat selection of seiyuus that do actually fit the roles they are given.\\n\\n\r\nNote: as someone who have spent 400 over anything you could have find on fantasy-JRPGs(mythology, middle age weaponries, etc) I know the terminology problem pretty much bugs only me and no one else, so yeah try to ignore my own little paranoia",

            "content": "Well guys let\u2019s start off with the awesome characters in this awesome manga. First and foremost we have Rin Okumura our principle protagonist, followed by his younger twin brother Yukio Okumura, and then we have Rin Okumura, and then Yukio Okumura, Rin Okumura again, some blond haired chick, random people and some dude named Shiro (and guess what he has white hair, har har har\u2026 weaboo) oh and did I mention Rin fucking Okumura. Theatrics aside, we essentially only have two or three characters with important roles throughout the whole TV show. The rest are just ballast. However, seeing as this is a review andnot a rant, I must divulge in the sweet juicy details. As I said earlier our primary protagonist is Rin Okumura, but what I neglected to mention earlier is that he is the son of satan (oh sh-).  Now would be a good time to hide your nuns. It is almost as if the Japanese people live in an unreligious society and are completely unaware of the ramifications and controversy that would ensue from pursuing such a plotline. That being said, as far as shounen characters go he\u2019s as typical as they get. Out of place, just found out he\u2019s not like everyone else, has a tendency to fight a lot, not very intelligent. You\u2019ll find him very reminiscent of Naruto(among others) character wise.  Through his character we are expected to sympathize with him, the son of satan. Likewise, his younger brother Yukio, serves pretty much the same purpose. Although, much more akin to the role of a character like Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist. I mention these well-known shounen because that is essentially what this anime (and I assume manga) is; a bastardization/ hot pot of various other well-known shounen titles. While originality is not really known to the shounen genre (or all anime these days) this anime makes it blatantly obvious which minds it is melding from. More on this though when we reach the story section. The blond girl has a role but it\u2019s more of the not really romantic, love interest that we are so used to in anime by now.  Her and this big voluptuous chick named Shura are pretty much this show\u2019s cockteases. The rest of the characters are not really important and seeing as the show simply abandons them half way in, I will do the same. Sure we have an episode where they celebrate everyone\u2019s birthday but that\u2019s just an excuse to do stupid crap for 30 minutes while displaying the whole cast. Those crazy Japanese! And that even crazier Daimyo for watching shows not originally intended for Western audiences. 6/10\\n\\n\\n\nIndeed going by the story it would not be hard to pinpoint who this show was originally intended for.  A predominately nihonjin audience, most likely in school, more specifically junior high- high school,  and while the manga is published in a shounen magazine, it is subtle enough to appeal to both males and females. In other words, it\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s anime, full of everything but substantially nothing overall. Yea you\u2019ll eat it when you\u2019re hungry but after you salivate it for a while you\u2019ll feel nothing but cold guilt, despair and diarrhea as you ponder on why you didn\u2019t find anything better and less regurgitating to eat. Opps, did I ramble off again? Sorry about that. The story is pretty much this, troublemaker boy who everyone avoids finds out he has a demon side to him, then goes to school for exorcism, wants to be the strongest exorcist which is called hokage\u2026Paladin. Does this sound familiar to anyone yet? That was just the basic plot outline. We also neglected to mention that this show steals\u2026gathers inspiration from other shounen titles like d.gray-man, souleater, fullmetal alchemist, among others.  As naruto like as this anime is you\u2019ll be verily disappointed to find out that a filler episode of Naruto has better and more exciting fights than this.  Action- wise this show climaxed when Rin had to face Amaimon the earth king (2 lazy to add him to my character section). Everything else after this moment was just depressingly bad.  Many times I looked forward to this character named Mephisto(opps left out another) to kickass but every single damn time he failed to deliver. Ultimately, that is what this show does, it fails to deliver. It tries to cater to a shounen audience but lacks the impact of better more successful shounen. Now Daimyo you might say that this anime is more story driven and thus does not need to rely on cheap acts of violence. Well, then OBJECTION! This show\u2019s story is just as terrible as any other is, if not worse. There are a lot of useless plotlines that don\u2019t even get properly resolved. Like who was it that brought Neuhaus\u2019(at this point just screw the character section) wife back to life in the first place. That eyebrow\u2019s girl story was pretty much thrown out the window too. We do not even know who the antagonist is the majority of the show\u2019s run. When we finally find it out it\u2019s satan, of course the Japanese have to make us try to sympathize so they paint satan as more of an anti-hero or at the very least an anti-villain(tv tropes motherfucker). He is trying to usher in a new world where the demons of Gehenna and the people of Assiah (more terms I ignored) can live together. So we get a satan that sounds more like Lelouche fucking Lamperouge than well satan. You know the absolute evil, cursed by the big G(google?), hated by all,  yadda, yadda, yadda(for more info pick up your nearest Bible, Torah or Quran).  Just as they had extinguished Mephisto\u2019s flames right before his crowning moment of awesome, I felt they had extinguished my ability to enjoy this show.5/10\\n\\n\nLet\u2019s recap this a bit shall we. We are given a show with essentially two or three characters, a poor clumsy attempt at a storyline, topped off with disappointing fights. Basically, what we have is a wet mess.  However, seeing as we had 3 paragraphs full of my failed attempts at comedy let\u2019s get serious here.  I am left somewhat confused as to how to finally score this anime. There were many moments throughout the course of the show\u2019s run where I felt this show truly did deserve its rating of 8.20. Had this show ended right after the fight with Amaimon I would have scored it somewhere between the 7.0-7.5 range.  The reason is not length. I mean the show is only 25 episodes, so perhaps I might be able to add this to the oh so common manga-anime adaptation failure\u2019s list. Then you might say that this show is simply not my taste. Not quite if you were to view my anime and mangalists you would see that the majority of the shows I complete are in the category of shounen. Some might say this has caused me to lose out on other great animes from different genres/demographics over the years (alas only shounen and seinen satisfy my young manly soul). I feel modern anime in general tries to cater to too many different tastes at once and overall just ends up being tasteless.  This is not to say I did not enjoy this show, it just felt rather bland. It\u2019s not the type of show that left an impact. And ten years from now if someone asked me to name the animes from this era that left the biggest imprint on me, ao no exorcist most likely would not be part of the conversation. Who knows though? Anime is like fine wine, much better when it\u2019s aged.  Hopefully, by then Daimyo will be sufficiently aged as well.",

            "content": "(Scroll down for my... second review.)\r\nI don't know how to rate this anime. I feel guilty for even liking it all. Everything is so cliche. If you based a drinking game on this show, where whenever someone or something cliche came up, take a sip. You'd be sick for the rest of your life. So why did I even like this as much as I did? I don't know! As a reviewer, it frustrates me not to know what I even sort of liked about a show, so in this review I'll be attempting (probably in vain) to find that reason.\r\nStory~\r\nNothing new. We've all seenit before. When I first started this, I wondered why I was bothering. The religious subjects could have gone deeper, and then that would be my reason for liking it-- but did they? No, I think they purposely tried to keep it stereotypical. Why? There were so many dang good directions they could have gone. After I finished this, I just sat down and thought about it. I wish they could have taken this to a better light, but nah. Oh well, what's done is done I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nMe oh my. What to say here? Typical style for this genre, but still done very well. The movement for the fight scenes was definitely not skimpy, and was pleasing to my eye. Just because the style is a bit cliched doesn't automatically make it bad. I still think they gave us a nice bit of work of art to watch. But oh dear... When the animators DO skimp out, it's apparent, at least I thought so. Sometimes the quality takes a dip, but then raises later on. Erm... One problem though. This was supposed to be a shounen fighting anime right? Or was it? With the lack of fighting it makes you wonder. I hate drawn out fights where that's all the anime is about, and they last more than one episode-- it just bugs me. But this just didn't have enough fighting. Oh well... The art was still good when they did fight, though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\n...Good. The voice actors give a lot of emphasis to their roles, though sometimes way too much, which... sometimes ruins the mood. The openings and endings were present, but not memorable by any means whatsoever. I likedsome of the orchestral music that really built upon the mood when it needed to, but for the most part it went... unnoticed. But it's still overall good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nThey were very cliche, even when fleshed out. Some developed more than others, but nobody really grew up too much. They all stayed their same old selves, with their same old goals and things. But they were entertaining somehow. I kept slapping my head while watching this show, hoping my brain would wake up and tell me the truth-- these are just cliche characters. But it never did. I still somehow enjoyed them, and though a lot of humor was dry, it sort of... mademelaugh. I know, you're going to kill me. But the characters were still somehow fun to me despite being so... well, unoriginal. But because of that, I can't give them a high score, no matter how much I sort of enjoyed watching them supposedly \"grow\" in whatever way they did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Ao no Exorcist does a decent job, but nothing above that. The show itself takes a darker and stranger turn which was... to me, expected in a way, yet unexpected. I don't know how to explain it. I can't find what it is I liked about this show, but I did enjoy it very much as it was on-screen. Other parts were much less enjoyable but I still had fun watching this as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on your taste, you'll either love it or hate it. Maybe I liked it because I watched all of it in one day and finished at about 4:00 in the morning... so if I give it another try while my brain is less asleep (the darn thing) then I can give it a more accurate review. Overall, it's entertaining but it didn't escape its cliches, and could have gone an entirely different and better direction-- but didn't. Yet somehow it was still so much fun. AGAIN-- I'll watch this one more when I'm actually awake, and maybe I'll re-review it with a more accurate score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n..:::..:::..\\n\\n\r\nSECOND REVIEW\\n\\n\r\nAll right. As promised, I watched Ao no Exorcist a second time, and my rating hasn't dropped TOO much, but it still has lowered. I'll show you why.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory~\\n\r\nI don't want to go into this again. It's cliche. It takes a few twists and does this and that, and the religious themes can be fairly enthralling-- but it's just cliche. That's all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nYes, yes, if you read my first review you know what I think here. It's again-- cliche, but smooth and cute, and I thought very nice. The movement was eye-pleasing, but when they made mistakes it was... very apparent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\n...The review for the soundtrack remains the same. Please refer to my first review above.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nThe characters for Ao no Exorcist seemed as if taken out of \"Anime's Book of Cliche Characters\". The first time around, I actually enjoyed them, though they were admittedly cliche. Even when fleshed out they were still rather... overused. The second time around, my enjoyment didn't actually go down one bit-- except for Izumo and Paku's small arc. For some reason, the enjoyment there went down considerably, and I almost couldn't stand it. I pointed out every dang cliche thing about them and could only groan at it. For the rest of the series, it was still entertaining until episode 22. There's something about the ending (I have NO idea what) that just angers, irritates, and annoys me. I just dislike it, and I have no idea why. The characters are developed enough but still... yes, cliche. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Ao no Exorcist is actually very entertaining the first time around, if you don't mind cliche shounen and don't mind shutting your brain off for just a little bit of action and random yet cliche twists. I have a hard time knocking the enjoyment level down, because it's still fun for the first time around-- but the second time, I had to force my way through some parts.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love shounen genre, you will love this. I highly recommend this to you if you're like that. If you like a good, unique twist or something deeper, then maybe *maybe* try this if you just want to shut your brain off and not care about what happens on-screen. If you're hardcore mystery, dark plot twists, unpredictable things happening, and deep characters, don't try this at home. Just... Oh, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it's another addition to the cliche shounen thing, but at 4:00 in the morning I was highly entertained the first time around. The second time-- I... wasobsessedwithRin'stail-- I mean, it was all very old and cliche. .../shiftyeyes\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this entire show depends on your opinion, but the second time around I hated Yukio even more, disliked Paku and Izumo arc-thing, and hated the ending. Everything else was equally fun as the first time around. Do whatever you feel like based on this review (and some of the others).",

After that, new friends also appear, humor appears,then drama and other unexpected events in his life. The story I liked in overall.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10- Could be better and fair, because it looks a little funny, no i'm not saying bad, the main characters and others seem to have been pushed out of some sort of comedy, but the main thing I liked was because it was interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10- At first, I did not understand where I've heard this masterpiece of music and then it reminds me of a bit of bios ost from the guilty crown, later a little attack on titan osts, I'm looking at the internet and it turns out Hiroyuki Sawano he is so masterpiece, and the other sounds were just a hat off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10- Almost all characters are told a bit, except Okumura, Rin and Okumura, Yukio about which I found out only to the end (last episodes) completely everything, and this is also what I like best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10- Every day I watched by three-four episodes and everything was satisfying me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10- So....

            "content": "At first I became curious of this anime. Seemed a lot of people wanted to watch it and the name \"Ao no Exorcist\" Popped up everywhere. It was always in my recommended bar. Finally i decided to watch it and now that I have I feel like it was a complete waste of time. \r\nI'm sure the manga is great. I thought the basic story was a good one. Son's of Satan and then coming of age to inherit his powers, Great! The anime had a few great things in it. Some parts of the story was really beautiful but when you put it alltogether it was just a big mess. \\n\\n\r\n(I'm only reviewing the anime NOT the manga).\\n\\n\r\nThere were plot holes everywhere. They would end an episode in a certain way and then start the next one entirely different with a new character all of a sudden. \\n\\n\r\nI also had a problem buying the fact that they were twins. Yukio felt more like a middle aged man throughout the show and it kept bothering me a lot. I see how he couldn't have been older and I see why they couldn't be half brothers but the least they could do was give him a personality fitting a 15-year old. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime also contains a love story with no end. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the poorly set up episodes. \\n\r\nWhat i mean is (judging from anime only, haven't read the manga) They had filler episodes that really weren't needed at all which they could have replaced with more important episodes that would've carried the main story better. What happened now is that they waited with the actual mission till there were only 5 episodes left. Everything felt rushed and i couldn't really comprehend what the heck was happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe goal was kind of unclear through the whole thing until the brothers revealed what they were fighting for in a final battle with fancy words. \\n\\n\r\nBeautiful personality change in Satan, Yukio and Shiemi. (Add a ton of sarcasm)\\n\\n\r\nFear of killing main characters turned in to constant reviving or ridiculous \"solutions\" \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\\n\\n\r\nSatan only wanted to unite the two worlds so that humans and demons could live in harmony in honor of his beloved \"Wife\" (apparently). Rin and Yukio should have wanted that more than anyone considering how they have gone through life, still they refuse to help Satan in the name of friendship. They killed their parents dream and the potentially wonderful lesson you could learn from this anime was killed along with it. instead they settled with a weaker message turning the entire series into a joke.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist (Blue Exorcist)\r\nThe first impression of this show was impressive, especially the first episode. An incredible start that set the scene for the series which had me hooked. (Including the theme song!) Sadly as the show progressed, my interest began to waiver. It has to do with the bulk of the characters and lack of progressive to flesh out the main story arc which really disappointed me. \r\nCharacter and Plot development. (4.5) Rin is the MC (protagonist) of this story and by far the most interesting character alongside his father Shirou Fujimoto. The rest of the cast isn't really worth mentioning because theylack development on their identity. Sure you could argue that they have either subtle or obvious agendas in regards to their relationship to Rin but there's no growth to this intriguing introduction which sadly makes them a background addition to fill in for the off-screen time of Rin. This also translates to the plot there is no exploration of the Demon World and very little development of the outside world for an exorcist. Instead, the creators settled for a high-school setting with contrived situations and melodramas. The only substantial plot development is when Fujimoto is on-screen and given he's on-screen time is probably one of the shortest of the cast, this is pretty laughable and disappointing. One thing I will mention though is that the different forms of exorcists is interesting and is one of the few bright spots of the plot that they explore.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound and Action. (8.5)  I must admit, it is done quiet well. Especially the Art of when Rin unleashes his Demon powers. (blue flames) The fast action scenes are also very pretty and great to watch. You'll be popping eye and ear gasms throughout the series which makes up for the lack of plot. Looks a bit like the action of Bleach using their zanpakutos, only better animated. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Blue exorcist for the most part. It has a great start and builds an ethos worth exploring. Sadly they don't venture outside the realm of school very much but when they do its very limited and thus creates unexplained plot holes. So be ready for the melodramas and misfits of high school life. I would recommend watching with a lowered expectation of the ratings on MAL (currently 8.09 at the time of this review) or only watching the first 4 episodes to get the idea and then decide whether to drop or continue. Its certainly interesting and has the pieces to become a great anime, just lacks the execution to deliver a plot to bind all its characters, art, sound and action together.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hey, if your series can't be original, you better make damn sure it's entertaining with a decent story.\r\nSTORY: Raising teenagers at a large school to become warrior exorcists that fight the forces of hell and to one day defeat the king of hell and all that's evil, satan? That's right it's time for this year's big shonen anime, Ao no Exorcist (Blue Exorcist in english).\r\nAnd yes that is the basic gist of the plot of the anime, and of course it's likely that it's never going to end any time soon (The main characters want to defeat satan, so that's a pretty defty job fora kid but someone's gotta do it, right?), but at least the anime will end, in about 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I got that out of the way, Ao no Exorcist is the latest big name anime by Aniplex, who also produced other big name titles such as Fullmetal Alchemist, Black Butler, and Durarara.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to the story, I have to say right away, there's nothing original here in the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters? We've seen them all before. \\n\\n\r\nTheir abilities? We've seen those so many more times before too. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting? Come on now, it's at a freaking school for crying out loud! That not at all different!\\n\\n\r\nLook, I can waste your time explaining the similarities to other stories that already used these elements all night and day, but it all matters with one (or two) simple questions: does it have a good story and does it have characters to care about?\\n\\n\r\nStory: Yes and no.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Definitely.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Rin Okumura, who wants to defeat satan because he killed his foster father and the all time big bad priest exorcist, Fujimoto Shiro, despite Rin being the son of satan himself, and heads off to exorcist school with his brother and gains like minded allys who will inevitably befriend and aid him on his resolution to fight satan.\\n\\n\r\nBut in between all of that, there are school filled days of Rin training, developing, and learning what it takes to become an exorcist, and some seemingly filler moments too, and a few things that expand the world of the series (Like familiars, ranks of exorcist, and different abilities among the other exorcists).\\n\r\nAs a shonen battle story, you can absolutely do worse, as the story seems to be more competent than other shonens (Especially with the school life elements as it feel substantial to the overall plot), and maintains a constant not too serious yet not too whimsical mood, though when the story demands it, it becomes the appropriate  right mood for the situations that get thrown out at the lead characters.\\n\r\nHowever, as a stand alone story not categorized into genres, it's very unoriginal, and does hardly little to make viewers take it serious, or to separate itself from others (Especially if one goes back to compare it other shonens), or even take any chances to do something unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on the other hand are instantly likable.\\n\\n\r\nRin is a great protagonist and easily sympathetic and a crowd pleaser, and he somewhat turns a trope on it's head; every shonen hero aspires to like their badass fathers (Would I really need to make a reference for this?), but Rin want to kick his father's ass and for 100% justified reasons.\\n\r\nOther characters like Rin's younger brother Yukio and Shiemi Moriyama are also easy to like characters.\\n\r\nThere are still plenty of obvious tropes walking around like a tsundere and the rival character that becomes a friend.\\n\\n\r\nEven though in the long run it's not very original, that should not easily scare you away as the series itself is very entertaining and is as fun as all shonen series should strive to be, unless you're very tired of shonen genre at this point, don't waste your time that could've been used to look for other anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Of course, when Aniplex is producing an anime, obviously the visuals are going to be superb (Which most shonen series usually get cheap treatments).\\n\r\nBattles are very well animated, the character designs and artwork are very true to the source material, not much to nit pick at all.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The back ground music almost leaves no impression, the theme music isn't nothing worth noting about other than it's what you should except for a shonen anime (Though the ending theme feel really out of place).\\n\r\nThe voice acting on the other hand is good, Nobuhiko Okamoto is a good fit for Rin, and Jun Fukuyama is Jun Fukuyama, if you like Jun then... yeah, you like Jun, he voices Rin's brother.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Competent shonen story, with better school life elements than other shonen anime.\\n\r\n+ Likable characters with a great main character that topples other similar main characters from other shonen series.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding animation, especially during battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Unoriginal, as in it's pretty much what you literally get if you mash Soul Eater and D.Gray-Man together.\\n\r\n- Story does absolutely nothing to make the anime standout from others from the same genre.\\n\r\n- Tired of shonen? Don't look here.\\n\\n\r\nHey, it's hard to be original now a days, and if you're not worried by that, then by all means, I recommend Ao no Exorcist for your viewing delight.\\n\r\nAs the latest shonen big hit continues to shine, let's all hope it doesn't get overblown and over saturated like the big hits before it (Coughnarutocough).",

It will be too stereotyped\" When A-1 pictures said \"hm...why not?\".And they weren't mistaken. Now we have one of greatest anime of summer 2011. I enjoyed it so much and I hope you will too.\nStory 9/10: \n+:The story is just masterpiece. As i said, it stereotyped,but it does not affect at fun of watching. You just watch and say \"oh Sh**t! That was awesome!\"\n -:The story little bit slowly accelerates. I mean when you watch 1-2 episodes you think\"in the next episode he definitely will kick someone's ass!\". But in 6-7 story become boring a little bit. Because Rin collect his own team or smt else. \\n\n But I completely sure it will be briliant story. We just need to wait...\\n\\n\nArt 10/10:\\n\n+:I really love how ANE are drawn.It doesn't lose quality at battle scene, how does bleach or smt like that.\\n\n -:Nothing to say. Just 10/10\\n\\n\nSound 9/10:\\n\n+: Rin's voice actor is Nobuhiko Okamoto. He famous for acting in Bakuman, Bleach, Durarara!!, Shiki, Toaru Majutsu no Index, etc. Of course he great and I totally approve set of voice actors. \\n\n -: Opening, ending and soundtrack isn't so cool how it could be\\n\\n\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\n+: All the characters are charismatic and hilarious. Especially Rin. He is really character with balls. I definitely love moments when he release his demonic power. It looks amazing. Also in anime we have kinda tsundere, nerd, foolish beauty, badass friend and brother. Yes, I told you it is cliched. But it's doesn't nary irritate.\\n\n -: Too many minor characters. Trolls and atc...Why did you do that, men? they don't need to anybody! why you made the whole episode about it? \\n\\n\nEnjoyment 10/10: \\n\nNothing to say. I just in love with it since first episode.\\n\\n\nOverall 9/10:\\n\nIf you whant a classic shounen, which will cause you to scream \"OH MY GOSH!\" and all it conjugate with wonderful art, marvelous sound and damn good fightings so this is anime for you! m/",

            "content": "\"Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!\" - Anton LaVey\r\nOne of the constants of many religions is the idea that sin and evil stem from a higher power. In some cases this means another deity that works in opposition to all things good, but for Christianity, Islam and Judaism such things are viewed as the domain of Satan (or \"Lucifer, Fallen Angel, Prince of Darkness, Bringer of Light, Ruler of Hell, Lord of the Flies, Father of Lies, Apostate Supreme, Tempter of Mankind, Bringer of the Apocalypse, Old Serpent, Prince ofthis World, Seducer, Accuser, Tormentor, Blasphemer\" - Glen Duncan).\\n\\n\r\nWhatever name is ascribed to this being, the idea of him being the enemy of all things good is so deeply ingrained in society, he is usually depicted as the epitome of darkness and evil. While there are tales out there that try to cast Satan in a different light (for example, DC Vertigo's \"Lucifer\"), most writers find it easier to go with the prevailing opinion - which is a bit ... lazy to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the ongoing shounen manga by Kato Kazue, Ao no Exorcist follows the adventures of Okumura Rin, a boisterous teenager with superhuman strength and a problem controlling his temper. Together with his younger twin brother Yukio, they live in a small Christian monastery run by their father, Fujimoto Shiro, and several monks who have helped raise the two boys. The series opens with a group of priests who are frantically praying in unison, but one by one they are being killed by a mysterious blue fire.\\n\\n\r\nThe scene shifts to Rin, who has just punched a delinquent for shooting pigeons with a crossbow.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is a shounen anime, the plot adopts the action oriented, fight-of-the-week format that is so common in the genre. While this method is formulaic, it does have two advantages, the first being that the story becomes very easy to follow. Overly complex details and anything truly thought provoking have been discarded, which is more than a little ironic as, in true shounen anime style, this simplistic approach is reflective of the content of the series. The second advantage is familiarity, and while it doesn't seem like an important factor, it does play a key role when it comes to enjoying this show.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Ao no Exorcist also suffers from many of the problems that plague the shounen genre, partly because of the formulaic plot, but mainly because the series lacks the much of the depth needed to keep the story interesting. The lacklustre narrative is filled with bland humour and pointless angst, and because of these factors, the series has a tendency to veer off track. Although there are attempts to keep everything running smoothly, the underlying lack of creativity and complexity make this difficult to achieve. In addition to this, only a part of the manga has made the transition to anime, and much like the first adaptation of Full Metal Alchemist, the latter portion of the series is completely original - and it shows (more on this in a bit)\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to looks, Ao no Exorcist is on surer footing, although a part of that is because this is a manga adaptation. The majority of the character designs are very typically shounen in style (even down to the short, bald guy), but while the source material adds a degree of refinement to their composition, there are also a few inherent limitations. That said, there's a surprising degree of creativity in the supernatural elements of the series, and a few of the weird and wonderful concepts really steal the show. There are also a few imaginative settings that make a nice contrast to the rather humdrum everyday scenery, and when everything comes together the overall effect can be colourful and slightly outrageous (in a good way).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, A-1 Pictures have done a decent job for the most part, even with the typical shounen posturing and theatrics. The characters move well, if at times a little unrealistically, and the majority of action scenes are fluid and well choreographed. Unfortunately there are some noticeable occasions where the standard drops, and sadly these aren't limited to periods of frenetic activity.\\n\\n\r\nThe strong shounen theme is prevalent in the two opening sequences, both of which are filled with action, posturing, and a smattering of angst. In addition to this, the two introductory tracks, \"Core Pride\" by Uverworld (episodes 1 to 12), and \"In My World\" by Rookiez Is Punk'd (episode 13 onwards), are very typical rock songs that one might find at the beginning of any shounen anime. Ao no Exorcist also features two ending sequences, the first one being a CG \"journey\" through a city that is accompanied by \"Take Off\" by South Korean boy band 2PM. The second features a montage of the characters against a variety of patterned backgrounds, all to the tune of \"Wired Life\" by Kuroki Meisa. The rest of the soundtrack is features dramatic orchestral pieces and strange little comic relief ditties, and while these are generally well choreographed, as a whole there's nothing really special about the background music.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the shounen genre is that it can often be too formulaic, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the dialogue. The script appears to have been written by people with no idea of how teenagers actually talk, and the conversations are filled with pointless banalities, angst ridden diatribes and cumbersome bravado. Everything's a bit too contrived, and to further compound matters, the voice actors have obviously been instructed to play their parts with extra \"oomph\". The result is that emotions like anger, frustration, joy, fear, etc, often involve lots of shouting, while the rest of the acting has enough ham to start a business making sandwiches.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a veritable \"who's who\" of stereotypes, and it can sometimes seem as though the mangaka has followed the instructions in \"How To Make A Shounen Character\" to the letter. Rin is the typical lead male - all brawn, very little brains, and tries to solve every problem by hitting it, and surrounding him are people who epitomise their archetypes. In addition to this, Ao no Exorcist makes the age old mistake of assuming that overcoming trials and tribulations equals development, and while some of the characters do learn a thing or two over the course of the series, much of what passes for growth is nothing more than window dressing on a mannequin.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty the only interesting person in the whole show is Yukio, but given how shallow everyone else is, this may not be saying much.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist isn't a new concept, and much of the inspiration for the story has obviously come from Mike Mignola's \"Hellboy\". The sad part is that although the latter work is a gripping supernatural horror/thriller that touches upon many different cultural beliefs, legends and aspects of folklore, virtually none of that is present in this anime. The decision to make this a shounen tale has placed severe limitations on what can and cannot be done, and this means that the narrative can't achieve the atmosphere, the tone, or even the level of complexity of Hellboy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us back to the latter portion of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the series moves away from the source material the story takes a slightly darker turn, and several themes are introduced that, if they had been used earlier, could have raised the show above mediocrity. Unfortunately these concepts are only lightly touched upon, which is a shame as there was an opportunity to take the anime in a direction that would have made it far more interesting than it actually is. That doesn't mean it should have gone done the path used by The Omen trilogy though (i.e. Rin becomes The Antichrist), but it would have been nice if the wistful, almost melancholy desire of his father was examined in more detail.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of its flaws it may seem as though Ao no Exorcist has nothing to offer, so it's surprising that the show is reasonably enjoyable. That said, the best way to treat this anime is to think of it as a rather long action movie that has difficulty getting to the point, and if it's watched for the sole purposes of no-brain entertainment, then viewers can expect a decent return for their time.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, with two live action movies, two animated features, and a world of difference in content, some people may find Hellboy a better proposition.",

All signs pointed in a positive direction.\r\nUnfortunately, that's exactly what this show lacked: direction.\r\nAside from establishing the premise, very little is done to advance the plot throughout the show. Most of the show is episodic, and the archs don't build up to anything. It really seemed like the creators didn't know where it was all supposed to go.\r\nOne of the things that disappointed me was the fighting, or the lackthereof. From the beginning they establish a universe withpotential for awesome, supernatural fighting, and even introduce a number of characters that would probably be pretty awesome for that kind of show. In the end, there was really only a couple of fight scenes, and most (if not all) of them involved the same couple of characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also disappointing considering those fights ultimately meant nothing. They had nothing to do with any overarching plot because there was none; at least, not until very late in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending for this show was pretty bad. It didn't do anything interesting with what the show brought to the table, and was downright terrible from an action standpoint. If it had introduced some kind of twist or something, then it might have redeemed the show a little bit, but it didn't. \\n\\n\r\nSince both the action and the plot were nonexistent, there's really not much reason to like this show, though I will give it that the aesthetic and comedy were nice. It's a show that could have been nice had they decided whether or not fighting was what they were going for, but they couldn't make up there mind, and in the end they had nothing to show for it.",

Though I must applaud the series for (spoiler) letting Noriko go, which shows some resolve. \\n\\n\r\nConcept & Execution: 5\\n\r\nThe daddy complex was nothing new, though I thought the religious overtones and occasional references were interesting and almost Neon Genesis Evangelion-esque. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 4/4\\n\r\nI was rather let down by the series after hearing so many good things from friends. The first few episodes are still wonderful and emotion-filled, in my opinion, but the rest of the show fails to follow-up and the conclusion is horrifically anticlimactic, (spoiler) with the exception of the relationship between Rin's mother and Satan, which I found surprisingly touching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels like a textbook shounen that could have taken an edgy turn with the religious overtones and instead wimped out.",

            "content": "Ao No Exorcist is set in a battle of exorcists versus demons. It is a typical shonen with a good main character as the backbone. \r\nThe backdrop of the story is that Rin and brother Yukio are the sons of Satan and a human mother. Rin inherited the demonic powers, while Yukio didn't. They are taken in by the current Paladin, Shiro, who raises them as sons. Soon, they are thrust in an ongoing battle of the Exorcists versus Demons. The story gets off to a very fast start, but from what I understand, lack of material for the spots the manga covered caused somemore prolonged fillers than usual. Towards the end when the story picks back up, there are some \"jumping the shark\" moments which try to add to the intrigue and plays well on the Rin's character, but ultimately falls flat. \\n\\n\r\nRin makes an excellent main character. As the son of Satan who wishes to fight demons his very existence challenges the traditional views of the vatican, the major \"good guy\" base, in the series. He's foremost, a character you like to root for. \\n\\n\r\nHis brother Yukio is somewhat a foil to Rin. His personality is pretty much the opposite of Rin's, and even his weapon choice (guns) are contrary to his brother's (A sword). The strong point about both characters are that both of them have a good mix of personal strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nAs good as the brothers are, the supporting cast fails to meet the same marks. Most of them have some sort of character episode or small backstory, but none of them really have any true development. In comparison, a show like Soul Eater (while having twice the episodes) managed to handle all of the characters in a way that made all of them seem important, this is not true for Ao No Exorcist. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a fairly good mix of comedy and action. Some of the more comedic episodes are actually the stronger ones as they tend to focus more on a characters personality rather than the kinda middling story. \\n\\n\r\nAo No Exorcist is nothing new to the Shonen world, it suffers from some pacing issues and a bland supporting cast, but has strengths with the mains and overall theme. It's a decent show with some demons to deal with.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist is a short shounen that has become memorable. That's not the same as saying it's great though. Here's why.\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nRin and Yukio were raised by a priest, yet are the sons of Satan. Sadly, it turns into more of a school setting- based anime. While there are still some good, fast action scenes, there are too many plot holes as the story goes on. They train to be exorcists in this school, even though they are part demon themselves, so that becomes a large plot device. One of the better ones too. It's OK, nothing spectacular.\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI love the art. It complementsthe action scenes real well. It can be dark or light depending on the scenario. Well animated and colorful enough to not loose my attention.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nCathy openings and endings. The ost's, though could use some work outside of battle themes. The English dub was not quite as good as it could have been, as it does not fit the character roles all the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThis has to be the most memorable part of the show. Rin is calm and collected, and only freaks out when a normal person would, unlike most main characters. This is not to say he's not fun, he knows fun more than any stuck up snob in the academy. This is what I do NOT like. Yukio is the most legalistic person on the show. Whenever they argue, I find myself wanting to have Rin beat the living shit out of his brother.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\r\nGood popcorn flick. The beginning was great, then slowly turns into a typical shounen that has semi-fulfilled potential, that does show up at times in the series. Once I was finished watching it, and listening to the ending themes over and over, I could move on with it always in mind. Don't rush into it expecting very much and you'll like it.",

            "content": "This review has been edited quite a bit.  Ok, first off, this anime does not seem to following the manga closely anymore.  Up until ep 13 it was, but after that, who knows where the story will go~\r\nStory 9: The story was so tightly packed into the first three episodes, it felt like I was watching some kind of epic movie.  I'll admit the basic plot has been done before, we have all had our share of Son's of Satan, but it still manages to be interesting anyways.  Somehow it has that spark which makes it amazingly unique, yet it stillincludes anime cliches at the same time.  The good thing about this show is that you'll know if you like the story just from the first episode.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this is true about the first few eps, I can't say it is the same for the rest of the show.  Ao no Exorcist is still enjoyable, but the action is far less than it was in those eps.  The action did pick up like for example in ep 12, but I can't say it's consistent.  Read the manga if this bothers you~\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: The art is perfect for me.  Honestly though, it's a matter of opinion.  I don't like my characters too bishounen or too muscular.  The characters are drawn, for the most part, in between the two (leaning on the bishie side), so I love it.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Sound I love the sound as well.  There was appropriate music in the appropriate scenes that's all I can say.  When the tragic moments occurred, really sad music played.  When they were running/fighting against demons, it was more upbeat.  It was well done in my opinion~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: Characters now this is my favorite out of everything (even though everything is rated the same).  Rin, the main character, is not too whiny nor really bad ass.  He acts like a normal 15 year old for the most part, although a bit on the bad side until, of course, he finds out he's a demon.  The main enemy on the otherside, Satan, is extremely creepy and scary (imo).  But this is good because who wants a sappy enemy?  At least you know that he won't be one of those villains that switch sides.  If you like your main characters not too over the top and your villains totally villainous, this is your show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:  I REALLY enjoyed this show.  I've been pretty much obsessing over it so much the past few days it's sad haha.  Maybe you'll end up the same way, but that won't happen unless you give it a try.  Demons and exorcists fighting, that's the basic point, although that's definitely NOT the entire story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:  Overall, I love this show.  Hopefully it can continue being this good in the future.  -edit- I'll admit it does get slow eps 4-8, but as I have read the manga, believe me there is action to come.",

            "content": "Generic, generic, generic. This anime oozes from genericism.\r\nStory: 2, Character: 2\r\nYour typical shounen story done a million times, only now with exorcists.\r\nThe story starts as Rin, the protagonist and the guy who gets the most favorites of the show in MAL, becomes an exorcist because of certain circumstances (I don't want to spoil you why).\r\nHe enrolls to an academy, which deals with many things, along how to become a full fledged  exorcist.\r\nSounds interesting at first? Well, NOPE. \r\nThe execution is so generic and bland.\r\n*We have a protagonist who is short tempered and likes to fight alot? check.\r\n*His brother is a cool calculated guy whothe protagonist want to surpass? check.\\n\r\n*A useless female heroine/supporting character? check.\\n\r\n*A chock full of cast of annoying and useless characters? check.\\n\r\n*A female character with weird eyebrows that is even more useless than all of the other characters in the show? check.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is your typical  Naruto/Bleach/One Piece, only with ten times more annoying and bland and useless characters. Even Heroman has more story going on than Ao no Exorcist, and Heroman doesn't have any story! EVEN HEROMAN HAS A CAST OF BETTER CHARACTERS...Wait... does Heroman has any notable characters?\\n\\n\r\nThe single interesting character of the show WAS Rin and Yukio's dad. But because of certain circumstances, he's not in the show anymore (I don't want to spoil you why).\\n\\n\r\nRin main goal in the story is to defeat SATAN. How is it different from your typical shounen goal of becoming the Pirate King/Hokage/whatever Ichigo from Bleach wants to become? Well, it's NOT.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5, Sound: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are the strongest point of Ao no Excorist, but the art and sound are wasted on this bland show. The opening theme and ending theme songs are catchy at first, but then become annoying after a few watches because of their bland contents. The voice acting is bland too, because the script is bland and the lines are straight from a B-side shounen show. Did I mention the word Bland?\\n\\n\r\nThe art inconsistent, because many times you will notice the QUALITY. You feel that all the budget of  the animation went to the damned and notorious cooking filler episode, because the foods look awesome, man!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nWhat Enjoyment? Nothing is enjoyable about this show. But... it's possible that it will be enjoyable as your first anime, because baby's first anime is always enjoyable and unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nI can't recommend this show to anyone and not even as a baby's first anime, because there are much more interesting and unique anime shows out there  that you can watch as your first compared to Ao no Exorcist.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like generic stuff/Naruto-One Piece-Bleach you might enjoy this anime. Otherwise, steer away. It's not worth your time.",

            "content": "Hey guys, this is my first review on this site and frankly it's my first review I've ever written so here it goes. \r\nAo no Exorcist is an classic shounen anime as you may know judging by the hype it has gotten. Well to cut to the story, it revolves mainly around Rin whom is a demon spawn living in a chantry with his father, brother and a bunch of munks/exorcists. \r\n  The theory of the story is good, but not well made, a battle between exorcists and demons, a struggle to fit in where you should not belong, a strive to be thebest. The pace in the story line kicks of in the first two episodes which frankly I think is great but after that is slows down more and more 'til the end of the anime where it speeds up 9999% without warning or preperations. That is a bad sign, to speed up an anime just to fit the ending in 4 episodes, I haven't read the manga so I can't say if the story is copied 100%. In my opinion the first episodes was freaking awesome, it was battles, hearbreaking and were exiting. After those episodes it slows down as I said before, to a pace were it resembles  fillers that you can find in Naruto and other animes that are over 24-50 episodes. That is bad my friends in a 25 episoded anime, and it cuts down the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n  The art is just great, it's classic, nice colors plain beautiful. It goes from small cute demons to rotten ghouls very well made I must say and a very high variety of characters, you won't see anyone in this anime look the same exept from some smaller demons. The sound in this anime is well placed and has a great soundtrack fitting the moments. The ''main characters'' are well placed so to say, a great kemistry and gives a nice vibb to it. They have the right voice casting for every person that fitts their personality.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall it's a fair anime in my opinion, it may have a good theory behind it but is crushed by the way they made it to the screen. It jumps from one thing to another so it's hard to keep track of where it is taking you. I had high expectations for this anime which is a bad thing when they are not able to pull it through the way I like it. But, I have not seen the whole anime since it has not been subbed but I know that I can make a clear statement of the score I want to give it, sadly I think it's a disappontment.",

            "content": "Let it stand that I have not given the manga any read whatsoever so I'm not sure of any kind of discrepancies, but I would have to say that from my experience with manga|anime comparison in general, I think A-1 Pictures has done an outstanding and top-notch job with the anime adaptation of Ao no Exorcist. To note, I have given every criteria of this review a 10 except for the story, which I granted a 9. Normally, the rating of a 10 seems to be very esteemed to me, just because it represents a perfect score. However, myanimelist's linguistic translation of the \"10\" asan \"outstanding\" compelled me to score it as such because the series simply is o u t s t a n d i n g. \\n\\n\r\nGetting back to what I surfaced upon earlier, A-1 Pictures has created an excellent adaptation. I''m compelled to think that the anime is better than the manga (probably without justification) just because of the elements included that a manga, UNFORTUNATELY, cannot implement such as color, motion, soundtrack, voice acting, etc. etc. all of which are conspicuously done with great detail in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd here I go, cracking my knuckles, preparing to review each category of rating as I listen to Takeoff by 2PM, the first ED to the series. And whilst typing that, I've decided to start in the order of appearance. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story, it has presented itself with expansive potential. It doesn't seem like I'll be able to avoid spoilers now so you have been warned. As the first and second episode have shown, Rin's adventures can extend to the realms of working at the local supermarket, beating the crap out of a pretentious wealthy douchebag, throwing a trident at one of Satan's underlings, being absorbed by the gates of hell by his (literally) Satanic father, or attending True Cross Academy. As a shounen series, I'm particularly happy that it can include the slice of life portion, humor, and in-depth character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Personally, I am a fan of mangaka Kazue Kato's artstyle. Prior to the first episode's airing, I was up and about ogling at his volume covers in excitement of the series premiere.  And then A-1 Pictures comes in and provides us with such excellent animation quality (which truthfully and unfortunately, overshadows their work on Fairy Tall), subsequently whooping my ass upside-down.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The seiyuus are a part of a great cast is what I have thought since the start. The soundtrack specifically \"sounded out\" for me in the second episode. During the Gehena Gate opening and the funeral was where the compositions really enhanced the intensity, pushing me off the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Lovely. Not only are the characters witty, humorous, respectable, but the character relations have already shown heartfelt aspects in the first and second episode. Rin and Yukio's brotherhood made me reminiscent of One Piece's Ace and Luffy, which only made it more emotionally awesome for me. If it's still unclear how cool they are together, just think of them as potential Edward and Alphonse Elric or some such! Episode two nearly had me tearing up at that one, particular part... Also worth noting is that none of the main characters introduced so far are female, a very commendable achievement for Kazue Kato not to depend on erotic or sexual elements to keep the story and characters (if you know what I mean) driven. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 10.\\n\r\nJust recognize.",

As for those who are looking for a more in-depth review:\r\nSummary: \r\nIn one sentence, Ao no Exorcist is about a rowdy rambunctious teen who not only discovers the existence of \"demons\", but is actually the son of Satan himself, and decides to attend a school of Exorcism to strengthen himself and learn to control his demonic power.\r\nStory (6): \r\nExtremely predictable and unoriginal. For those who are not afraid to be disappointed in a story they've seen many times in many different places, this anime is still quite bearable. I won't go into detail, but forthe most part it is reminiscent of Naruto, Bleach, and Hellsing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nClean, consistent, great color-composition. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nGeneric and doesn't leave an impression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7):\\n\r\nTying in with the story rating, the characters and their roles are in essence unoriginal. They are nonetheless fun and have a solidified personality that completes this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, what makes this anime shine is the characters and how they find their roles as they strive to achieve their own personal goals. Watch it, seriously.",

            "content": "Meet Rin. Rin is the son of Satan. Rin is training to become a demon exorcist- talk about ironic. \r\nOverall, this anime so far has been extremely entertaining and actually has had some surprises, which makes it more enjoyable.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe storyline in connection with the characters and their motivations actually seems believable. It's not some far-fetched concept with characters that don't do anything at all related to the plot. The way the story of Ao no Exorcist is connected by and through the characters if very realistic and makes the story very enjoyable to watch. \r\nArt: 10\r\nI really like the art style, it has angularlines with some soft coloring in contrast with bright colors. It makes it very appeasing to the eyes, lol. Also, the city in which the school resides in is very cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening/ending is pretty good, but other than that, the sounds in the anime are just general so far, nothing too fancy but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character of Rin is well developed and he actually sticks to his motivations and personality. His personality supports his actions and vice versa. He wants to become stronger after seeing his father die, and wants to deny his demon self because he wasn't brought up that way, and demons have harmed his family. His slacker attitude fits him well and provides comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nYukio actually has surprised me. His character as first is different from what is shown a couple of episodes later. But in fact, his actions in the first episode completely make sense once you know more about Yukio. Most of his reactions completely make sense with his studious, serious personality. It is a nice balance when Yukio and Rin are next to each other since they are so different. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10!\\n\r\nIt's been a really good 3 episodes. I definitely recommend it. The characters are fun and genuine, and the story is extremely compelling. Plus, there's nothing wrong with watching a teenager burning with blue flames and slaying demons with a katana. \\n\\n",

            "content": "[SPOILER ALERT] I expected you to have watched past ep16(which is when I dropped this anime) already when reading this, so if you have not you may want to skip this review\r\nAs many people say, Ao no Exorcist is heavily clich\u00e9d in many aspects so I might as well point them out first\r\nWe have a hot headed protagonist(+1) who hold immense power he could not quite control(+1), use a sword(+1) that is not any random sword but a special one assigned especially to him(+1). Protagonist is fighting against the biggest embodiment of evil there is(+1) for revenge of his father(+1) who died trying to protecthim(+1).  (Total clich\u00e9 points so far +7)\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist have a brother(+1) that is smarter and more skilled than him(+1), including more popular with the girls(+1), and he appears to be wearing glasses(+1). The brother have higher rank than the protagonist in their job(+1), prefer long-ranged weapon in comparison with the protagonist\u2019s preference of melee(+1), and the protagonist wants to surpass his brother(+1).(Note: please take into account that some points regarding Yukio is meant to be taken as \"secondary lead male\" rather than \"brother\") (Total clich\u00e9 points so far +14)\\n\\n\r\nNow we also have a heroine who is a klutz(+1), doesn\u2019t fight herself(in this case fight with her summoned demon)(+1). A group of people who are seemingly unfriendly at first(+1), which one of them took position as the protagonist\u2019s rival(+1). The group grew closer to the protagonist but become hostile more than ever when they learned of the protagonist\u2019s secret(+1), and so the protagonist must try to convince them 1 each at a time(+1). (Total clich\u00e9 points +20)\\n\\n\r\nSo there you go, 20 clich\u00e9 points altogether, but that wasn\u2019t the reason I decided to drop the show from my list, I can live with the clich\u00e9s and would even admire them if clich\u00e9d points turned out to be used uniquely. The reason I decide to leave this show is how it strayed from the manga, I have not read the manga but it simply seem rather obvious that what happen in ep16 is written by someone from the anime team who have very weak writing skill. The early eps was fine in my opinion, it was indeed clich\u00e9d but the writer still managed to make it touching to a minor extent, but after that nothing else touch you anymore and I was simply sitting there, waiting for something non-clich\u00e9d to happen, which it did not.\\n\\n\r\nThe usage on each terms are could have been achieved with better researches. The first example is the usage of the word \u201cPaladin\u201d, if you have played some RPG games you would have known that paladins, while may be a class of high rank warriors, with some saintly properties, are by no mean the best. Real historical paladins are the best guys the holy court can have, which is obvious that the king will have better men than that, and even more obvious that it is not a title suited just for 1 individual, as historical evidences pointed out that there are indeed multiple men who bear the title \u201cPaladin\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFurther points about this ranking system, I highly doubt how Fr.Fujimoto, Rin\u2019s father, who was appointed the Paladin when he was still living, would be free enough to live in an old church in the middle of Tokyo, raising 2 boys while keeping one away from the existence of anything magical. That logic never worked anyway in any situation, if you\u2019re the top guy the organization have, then by normal logical thinking, you would be so damn busy that you would never get to exist in the old church you own, let alone raising boys and keeping big secrets, if you\u2019re not gonna do it then you\u2019d be instantly demoted. And as of anime ep16, Arthur Auguste Angel, the new Paladin along with Shura, a high-ranked exorcist could not handle golem-form Amaimon despite going 2 to 1, but then Rin awaken and bam! In 5 seconds Amaimon is history. So either Rin should be promoted uber-Paladin right at the spot, or Angel and Shura should seriously be fired from the Order.\\n\\n\r\nAnother inaccurate use of information is on the use of demonology, as an expert in world mythology myself(for my age, I have over 400 hours of research on myths of the world), each demon names used are either inaccurately used(Naberius being a lesser demon, while Astaroth and Amaimon are high-ranked demons, in reality all 3 are individuals among the 72 pillars of Ars Goetia and supposedly comparable in strength), self-made up demons(Leaper and Coal Tar should have been obvious enough), and for anime\u2019s case, inappropriately used (Mara got demoted to a mere lesser demon when in truth, he should have been the Buddhist equivalent of Lucifer, being the tempter of the messiah of their respective religion, no you would not want to see Lucifer die by a single gunshot(unless the title of the anime is \u2018Yondemasuyo Azazel-san\u2019 in which a shoe would be enough to kill even Satan) so the usage of Mara in the anime as a minion demon disturbed me alot)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are the saving grace of this series, the art is neatly drawn and the designs are actually not-so cliched as everything else the plot covers. I actually liked the second OP and ED and felt a little regret in dropping the series almost as soon as the new songs came up, the voice acting is nice with a neat selection of seiyuus that do actually fit the roles they are given.\\n\\n\r\nNote: as someone who have spent 400 over anything you could have find on fantasy-JRPGs(mythology, middle age weaponries, etc) I know the terminology problem pretty much bugs only me and no one else, so yeah try to ignore my own little paranoia",

            "content": "Well guys let\u2019s start off with the awesome characters in this awesome manga. First and foremost we have Rin Okumura our principle protagonist, followed by his younger twin brother Yukio Okumura, and then we have Rin Okumura, and then Yukio Okumura, Rin Okumura again, some blond haired chick, random people and some dude named Shiro (and guess what he has white hair, har har har\u2026 weaboo) oh and did I mention Rin fucking Okumura. Theatrics aside, we essentially only have two or three characters with important roles throughout the whole TV show. The rest are just ballast. However, seeing as this is a review andnot a rant, I must divulge in the sweet juicy details. As I said earlier our primary protagonist is Rin Okumura, but what I neglected to mention earlier is that he is the son of satan (oh sh-).  Now would be a good time to hide your nuns. It is almost as if the Japanese people live in an unreligious society and are completely unaware of the ramifications and controversy that would ensue from pursuing such a plotline. That being said, as far as shounen characters go he\u2019s as typical as they get. Out of place, just found out he\u2019s not like everyone else, has a tendency to fight a lot, not very intelligent. You\u2019ll find him very reminiscent of Naruto(among others) character wise.  Through his character we are expected to sympathize with him, the son of satan. Likewise, his younger brother Yukio, serves pretty much the same purpose. Although, much more akin to the role of a character like Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist. I mention these well-known shounen because that is essentially what this anime (and I assume manga) is; a bastardization/ hot pot of various other well-known shounen titles. While originality is not really known to the shounen genre (or all anime these days) this anime makes it blatantly obvious which minds it is melding from. More on this though when we reach the story section. The blond girl has a role but it\u2019s more of the not really romantic, love interest that we are so used to in anime by now.  Her and this big voluptuous chick named Shura are pretty much this show\u2019s cockteases. The rest of the characters are not really important and seeing as the show simply abandons them half way in, I will do the same. Sure we have an episode where they celebrate everyone\u2019s birthday but that\u2019s just an excuse to do stupid crap for 30 minutes while displaying the whole cast. Those crazy Japanese! And that even crazier Daimyo for watching shows not originally intended for Western audiences. 6/10\\n\\n\\n\nIndeed going by the story it would not be hard to pinpoint who this show was originally intended for.  A predominately nihonjin audience, most likely in school, more specifically junior high- high school,  and while the manga is published in a shounen magazine, it is subtle enough to appeal to both males and females. In other words, it\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s anime, full of everything but substantially nothing overall. Yea you\u2019ll eat it when you\u2019re hungry but after you salivate it for a while you\u2019ll feel nothing but cold guilt, despair and diarrhea as you ponder on why you didn\u2019t find anything better and less regurgitating to eat. Opps, did I ramble off again? Sorry about that. The story is pretty much this, troublemaker boy who everyone avoids finds out he has a demon side to him, then goes to school for exorcism, wants to be the strongest exorcist which is called hokage\u2026Paladin. Does this sound familiar to anyone yet? That was just the basic plot outline. We also neglected to mention that this show steals\u2026gathers inspiration from other shounen titles like d.gray-man, souleater, fullmetal alchemist, among others.  As naruto like as this anime is you\u2019ll be verily disappointed to find out that a filler episode of Naruto has better and more exciting fights than this.  Action- wise this show climaxed when Rin had to face Amaimon the earth king (2 lazy to add him to my character section). Everything else after this moment was just depressingly bad.  Many times I looked forward to this character named Mephisto(opps left out another) to kickass but every single damn time he failed to deliver. Ultimately, that is what this show does, it fails to deliver. It tries to cater to a shounen audience but lacks the impact of better more successful shounen. Now Daimyo you might say that this anime is more story driven and thus does not need to rely on cheap acts of violence. Well, then OBJECTION! This show\u2019s story is just as terrible as any other is, if not worse. There are a lot of useless plotlines that don\u2019t even get properly resolved. Like who was it that brought Neuhaus\u2019(at this point just screw the character section) wife back to life in the first place. That eyebrow\u2019s girl story was pretty much thrown out the window too. We do not even know who the antagonist is the majority of the show\u2019s run. When we finally find it out it\u2019s satan, of course the Japanese have to make us try to sympathize so they paint satan as more of an anti-hero or at the very least an anti-villain(tv tropes motherfucker). He is trying to usher in a new world where the demons of Gehenna and the people of Assiah (more terms I ignored) can live together. So we get a satan that sounds more like Lelouche fucking Lamperouge than well satan. You know the absolute evil, cursed by the big G(google?), hated by all,  yadda, yadda, yadda(for more info pick up your nearest Bible, Torah or Quran).  Just as they had extinguished Mephisto\u2019s flames right before his crowning moment of awesome, I felt they had extinguished my ability to enjoy this show.5/10\\n\\n\nLet\u2019s recap this a bit shall we. We are given a show with essentially two or three characters, a poor clumsy attempt at a storyline, topped off with disappointing fights. Basically, what we have is a wet mess.  However, seeing as we had 3 paragraphs full of my failed attempts at comedy let\u2019s get serious here.  I am left somewhat confused as to how to finally score this anime. There were many moments throughout the course of the show\u2019s run where I felt this show truly did deserve its rating of 8.20. Had this show ended right after the fight with Amaimon I would have scored it somewhere between the 7.0-7.5 range.  The reason is not length. I mean the show is only 25 episodes, so perhaps I might be able to add this to the oh so common manga-anime adaptation failure\u2019s list. Then you might say that this show is simply not my taste. Not quite if you were to view my anime and mangalists you would see that the majority of the shows I complete are in the category of shounen. Some might say this has caused me to lose out on other great animes from different genres/demographics over the years (alas only shounen and seinen satisfy my young manly soul). I feel modern anime in general tries to cater to too many different tastes at once and overall just ends up being tasteless.  This is not to say I did not enjoy this show, it just felt rather bland. It\u2019s not the type of show that left an impact. And ten years from now if someone asked me to name the animes from this era that left the biggest imprint on me, ao no exorcist most likely would not be part of the conversation. Who knows though? Anime is like fine wine, much better when it\u2019s aged.  Hopefully, by then Daimyo will be sufficiently aged as well.",

            "content": "(Scroll down for my... second review.)\r\nI don't know how to rate this anime. I feel guilty for even liking it all. Everything is so cliche. If you based a drinking game on this show, where whenever someone or something cliche came up, take a sip. You'd be sick for the rest of your life. So why did I even like this as much as I did? I don't know! As a reviewer, it frustrates me not to know what I even sort of liked about a show, so in this review I'll be attempting (probably in vain) to find that reason.\r\nStory~\r\nNothing new. We've all seenit before. When I first started this, I wondered why I was bothering. The religious subjects could have gone deeper, and then that would be my reason for liking it-- but did they? No, I think they purposely tried to keep it stereotypical. Why? There were so many dang good directions they could have gone. After I finished this, I just sat down and thought about it. I wish they could have taken this to a better light, but nah. Oh well, what's done is done I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nMe oh my. What to say here? Typical style for this genre, but still done very well. The movement for the fight scenes was definitely not skimpy, and was pleasing to my eye. Just because the style is a bit cliched doesn't automatically make it bad. I still think they gave us a nice bit of work of art to watch. But oh dear... When the animators DO skimp out, it's apparent, at least I thought so. Sometimes the quality takes a dip, but then raises later on. Erm... One problem though. This was supposed to be a shounen fighting anime right? Or was it? With the lack of fighting it makes you wonder. I hate drawn out fights where that's all the anime is about, and they last more than one episode-- it just bugs me. But this just didn't have enough fighting. Oh well... The art was still good when they did fight, though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\n...Good. The voice actors give a lot of emphasis to their roles, though sometimes way too much, which... sometimes ruins the mood. The openings and endings were present, but not memorable by any means whatsoever. I likedsome of the orchestral music that really built upon the mood when it needed to, but for the most part it went... unnoticed. But it's still overall good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nThey were very cliche, even when fleshed out. Some developed more than others, but nobody really grew up too much. They all stayed their same old selves, with their same old goals and things. But they were entertaining somehow. I kept slapping my head while watching this show, hoping my brain would wake up and tell me the truth-- these are just cliche characters. But it never did. I still somehow enjoyed them, and though a lot of humor was dry, it sort of... mademelaugh. I know, you're going to kill me. But the characters were still somehow fun to me despite being so... well, unoriginal. But because of that, I can't give them a high score, no matter how much I sort of enjoyed watching them supposedly \"grow\" in whatever way they did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Ao no Exorcist does a decent job, but nothing above that. The show itself takes a darker and stranger turn which was... to me, expected in a way, yet unexpected. I don't know how to explain it. I can't find what it is I liked about this show, but I did enjoy it very much as it was on-screen. Other parts were much less enjoyable but I still had fun watching this as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on your taste, you'll either love it or hate it. Maybe I liked it because I watched all of it in one day and finished at about 4:00 in the morning... so if I give it another try while my brain is less asleep (the darn thing) then I can give it a more accurate review. Overall, it's entertaining but it didn't escape its cliches, and could have gone an entirely different and better direction-- but didn't. Yet somehow it was still so much fun. AGAIN-- I'll watch this one more when I'm actually awake, and maybe I'll re-review it with a more accurate score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n..:::..:::..\\n\\n\r\nSECOND REVIEW\\n\\n\r\nAll right. As promised, I watched Ao no Exorcist a second time, and my rating hasn't dropped TOO much, but it still has lowered. I'll show you why.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory~\\n\r\nI don't want to go into this again. It's cliche. It takes a few twists and does this and that, and the religious themes can be fairly enthralling-- but it's just cliche. That's all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nYes, yes, if you read my first review you know what I think here. It's again-- cliche, but smooth and cute, and I thought very nice. The movement was eye-pleasing, but when they made mistakes it was... very apparent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\n...The review for the soundtrack remains the same. Please refer to my first review above.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nThe characters for Ao no Exorcist seemed as if taken out of \"Anime's Book of Cliche Characters\". The first time around, I actually enjoyed them, though they were admittedly cliche. Even when fleshed out they were still rather... overused. The second time around, my enjoyment didn't actually go down one bit-- except for Izumo and Paku's small arc. For some reason, the enjoyment there went down considerably, and I almost couldn't stand it. I pointed out every dang cliche thing about them and could only groan at it. For the rest of the series, it was still entertaining until episode 22. There's something about the ending (I have NO idea what) that just angers, irritates, and annoys me. I just dislike it, and I have no idea why. The characters are developed enough but still... yes, cliche. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Ao no Exorcist is actually very entertaining the first time around, if you don't mind cliche shounen and don't mind shutting your brain off for just a little bit of action and random yet cliche twists. I have a hard time knocking the enjoyment level down, because it's still fun for the first time around-- but the second time, I had to force my way through some parts.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love shounen genre, you will love this. I highly recommend this to you if you're like that. If you like a good, unique twist or something deeper, then maybe *maybe* try this if you just want to shut your brain off and not care about what happens on-screen. If you're hardcore mystery, dark plot twists, unpredictable things happening, and deep characters, don't try this at home. Just... Oh, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it's another addition to the cliche shounen thing, but at 4:00 in the morning I was highly entertained the first time around. The second time-- I... wasobsessedwithRin'stail-- I mean, it was all very old and cliche. .../shiftyeyes\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this entire show depends on your opinion, but the second time around I hated Yukio even more, disliked Paku and Izumo arc-thing, and hated the ending. Everything else was equally fun as the first time around. Do whatever you feel like based on this review (and some of the others).",

After that, new friends also appear, humor appears,then drama and other unexpected events in his life. The story I liked in overall.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10- Could be better and fair, because it looks a little funny, no i'm not saying bad, the main characters and others seem to have been pushed out of some sort of comedy, but the main thing I liked was because it was interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10- At first, I did not understand where I've heard this masterpiece of music and then it reminds me of a bit of bios ost from the guilty crown, later a little attack on titan osts, I'm looking at the internet and it turns out Hiroyuki Sawano he is so masterpiece, and the other sounds were just a hat off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10- Almost all characters are told a bit, except Okumura, Rin and Okumura, Yukio about which I found out only to the end (last episodes) completely everything, and this is also what I like best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10- Every day I watched by three-four episodes and everything was satisfying me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10- So.... I look forward to the continuation and bad or good, show in the memories will certainly stay.",

            "content": "At first I became curious of this anime. Seemed a lot of people wanted to watch it and the name \"Ao no Exorcist\" Popped up everywhere. It was always in my recommended bar. Finally i decided to watch it and now that I have I feel like it was a complete waste of time. \r\nI'm sure the manga is great. I thought the basic story was a good one. Son's of Satan and then coming of age to inherit his powers, Great! The anime had a few great things in it. Some parts of the story was really beautiful but when you put it alltogether it was just a big mess. \\n\\n\r\n(I'm only reviewing the anime NOT the manga).\\n\\n\r\nThere were plot holes everywhere. They would end an episode in a certain way and then start the next one entirely different with a new character all of a sudden. \\n\\n\r\nI also had a problem buying the fact that they were twins. Yukio felt more like a middle aged man throughout the show and it kept bothering me a lot. I see how he couldn't have been older and I see why they couldn't be half brothers but the least they could do was give him a personality fitting a 15-year old. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime also contains a love story with no end. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the poorly set up episodes. \\n\r\nWhat i mean is (judging from anime only, haven't read the manga) They had filler episodes that really weren't needed at all which they could have replaced with more important episodes that would've carried the main story better. What happened now is that they waited with the actual mission till there were only 5 episodes left. Everything felt rushed and i couldn't really comprehend what the heck was happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe goal was kind of unclear through the whole thing until the brothers revealed what they were fighting for in a final battle with fancy words. \\n\\n\r\nBeautiful personality change in Satan, Yukio and Shiemi. (Add a ton of sarcasm)\\n\\n\r\nFear of killing main characters turned in to constant reviving or ridiculous \"solutions\" \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\\n\\n\r\nSatan only wanted to unite the two worlds so that humans and demons could live in harmony in honor of his beloved \"Wife\" (apparently). Rin and Yukio should have wanted that more than anyone considering how they have gone through life, still they refuse to help Satan in the name of friendship. They killed their parents dream and the potentially wonderful lesson you could learn from this anime was killed along with it. instead they settled with a weaker message turning the entire series into a joke.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist (Blue Exorcist)\r\nThe first impression of this show was impressive, especially the first episode. An incredible start that set the scene for the series which had me hooked. (Including the theme song!) Sadly as the show progressed, my interest began to waiver. It has to do with the bulk of the characters and lack of progressive to flesh out the main story arc which really disappointed me. \r\nCharacter and Plot development. (4.5) Rin is the MC (protagonist) of this story and by far the most interesting character alongside his father Shirou Fujimoto. The rest of the cast isn't really worth mentioning because theylack development on their identity. Sure you could argue that they have either subtle or obvious agendas in regards to their relationship to Rin but there's no growth to this intriguing introduction which sadly makes them a background addition to fill in for the off-screen time of Rin. This also translates to the plot there is no exploration of the Demon World and very little development of the outside world for an exorcist. Instead, the creators settled for a high-school setting with contrived situations and melodramas. The only substantial plot development is when Fujimoto is on-screen and given he's on-screen time is probably one of the shortest of the cast, this is pretty laughable and disappointing. One thing I will mention though is that the different forms of exorcists is interesting and is one of the few bright spots of the plot that they explore.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound and Action. (8.5)  I must admit, it is done quiet well. Especially the Art of when Rin unleashes his Demon powers. (blue flames) The fast action scenes are also very pretty and great to watch. You'll be popping eye and ear gasms throughout the series which makes up for the lack of plot. Looks a bit like the action of Bleach using their zanpakutos, only better animated. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Blue exorcist for the most part. It has a great start and builds an ethos worth exploring. Sadly they don't venture outside the realm of school very much but when they do its very limited and thus creates unexplained plot holes. So be ready for the melodramas and misfits of high school life. I would recommend watching with a lowered expectation of the ratings on MAL (currently 8.09 at the time of this review) or only watching the first 4 episodes to get the idea and then decide whether to drop or continue. Its certainly interesting and has the pieces to become a great anime, just lacks the execution to deliver a plot to bind all its characters, art, sound and action together.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hey, if your series can't be original, you better make damn sure it's entertaining with a decent story.\r\nSTORY: Raising teenagers at a large school to become warrior exorcists that fight the forces of hell and to one day defeat the king of hell and all that's evil, satan? That's right it's time for this year's big shonen anime, Ao no Exorcist (Blue Exorcist in english).\r\nAnd yes that is the basic gist of the plot of the anime, and of course it's likely that it's never going to end any time soon (The main characters want to defeat satan, so that's a pretty defty job fora kid but someone's gotta do it, right?), but at least the anime will end, in about 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I got that out of the way, Ao no Exorcist is the latest big name anime by Aniplex, who also produced other big name titles such as Fullmetal Alchemist, Black Butler, and Durarara.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to the story, I have to say right away, there's nothing original here in the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters? We've seen them all before. \\n\\n\r\nTheir abilities? We've seen those so many more times before too. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting? Come on now, it's at a freaking school for crying out loud! That not at all different!\\n\\n\r\nLook, I can waste your time explaining the similarities to other stories that already used these elements all night and day, but it all matters with one (or two) simple questions: does it have a good story and does it have characters to care about?\\n\\n\r\nStory: Yes and no.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Definitely.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Rin Okumura, who wants to defeat satan because he killed his foster father and the all time big bad priest exorcist, Fujimoto Shiro, despite Rin being the son of satan himself, and heads off to exorcist school with his brother and gains like minded allys who will inevitably befriend and aid him on his resolution to fight satan.\\n\\n\r\nBut in between all of that, there are school filled days of Rin training, developing, and learning what it takes to become an exorcist, and some seemingly filler moments too, and a few things that expand the world of the series (Like familiars, ranks of exorcist, and different abilities among the other exorcists).\\n\r\nAs a shonen battle story, you can absolutely do worse, as the story seems to be more competent than other shonens (Especially with the school life elements as it feel substantial to the overall plot), and maintains a constant not too serious yet not too whimsical mood, though when the story demands it, it becomes the appropriate  right mood for the situations that get thrown out at the lead characters.\\n\r\nHowever, as a stand alone story not categorized into genres, it's very unoriginal, and does hardly little to make viewers take it serious, or to separate itself from others (Especially if one goes back to compare it other shonens), or even take any chances to do something unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on the other hand are instantly likable.\\n\\n\r\nRin is a great protagonist and easily sympathetic and a crowd pleaser, and he somewhat turns a trope on it's head; every shonen hero aspires to like their badass fathers (Would I really need to make a reference for this?), but Rin want to kick his father's ass and for 100% justified reasons.\\n\r\nOther characters like Rin's younger brother Yukio and Shiemi Moriyama are also easy to like characters.\\n\r\nThere are still plenty of obvious tropes walking around like a tsundere and the rival character that becomes a friend.\\n\\n\r\nEven though in the long run it's not very original, that should not easily scare you away as the series itself is very entertaining and is as fun as all shonen series should strive to be, unless you're very tired of shonen genre at this point, don't waste your time that could've been used to look for other anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Of course, when Aniplex is producing an anime, obviously the visuals are going to be superb (Which most shonen series usually get cheap treatments).\\n\r\nBattles are very well animated, the character designs and artwork are very true to the source material, not much to nit pick at all.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The back ground music almost leaves no impression, the theme music isn't nothing worth noting about other than it's what you should except for a shonen anime (Though the ending theme feel really out of place).\\n\r\nThe voice acting on the other hand is good, Nobuhiko Okamoto is a good fit for Rin, and Jun Fukuyama is Jun Fukuyama, if you like Jun then... yeah, you like Jun, he voices Rin's brother.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Competent shonen story, with better school life elements than other shonen anime.\\n\r\n+ Likable characters with a great main character that topples other similar main characters from other shonen series.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding animation, especially during battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Unoriginal, as in it's pretty much what you literally get if you mash Soul Eater and D.Gray-Man together.\\n\r\n- Story does absolutely nothing to make the anime standout from others from the same genre.\\n\r\n- Tired of shonen? Don't look here.\\n\\n\r\nHey, it's hard to be original now a days, and if you're not worried by that, then by all means, I recommend Ao no Exorcist for your viewing delight.\\n\r\nAs the latest shonen big hit continues to shine, let's all hope it doesn't get overblown and over saturated like the big hits before it (Coughnarutocough).",

This anime is reflects absolutely nothing of its tittle, but more of the current trend of today's fantasy. \r\nWhen i started watching it, i was hoping for more of dark exorcist kind of anime. A much darker and eerie reincarnation of the son of satan , born and raised humble followers of God. But this hope was soon shattered in episode 2....\r\nFirst of all, before you start thinking about exorcism and stuff, you should instead begin with looking at fairy tail. You see, the idea of church style exorcism hereof more of a paganism... The so called \"charms\" around the church, the summoning of angelic protector in which the blood of the summoner must be spilled changed the entire tone... the so called church is no more than a black magic cult\\n\\n\r\nthe entire church itself seems to be protected by pagan magic entirely instead of the giant crucifix.. Its basically yet another random shounen incarnation with church in the background and having absolutely nothing to do with church itself...\\n\\n\r\nWhile i prematurely dropped it, i can almost see how this goes.\\n\\n\r\n1. It follows with him killing the \"last boss\"\\n\r\nor\\n\r\n2.

The story had so much potential, but it didn't use everything that it had to really get you into the story. I'm not going to criticize the show forusing the overused \"demon within\" thing, because let's face it, originality is hard to come by these days. Now what I will criticize is how poorly this was done. There were parts that showed how Rin is looked down on, hated and/or feared for being the devil spawn, these parts I liked, but they could have been better... or at least gotten deeper into the plot with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is consumed by his demon powers and is throwing a fit like how most teenagers would when they're mom takes away their phone, but then the power of friendship or the love interest's voice (his brother) wakes him from his mood swing. It is your typical shounen anime so don't expect much, but this is just boring now. The first few times I saw this in an anime I was like,  \"...cool?\", but now it's just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending... well do you remember your favorite 25 episode shounen anime's ending? Well it's just like that... there's lame music in the background, the characters team up and defeat the Big Bad, but not before saying something friendship related. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm just going to assume that the manga is still ongoing because, it doesn't take much to impress an anime fan. So while we wait for the next season let us foolishly hope that it will get better and that the author is just warming up.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's anime the greatest art form to plague the internet what else do you want? Oh wait I know! Something that catches my eye and makes it look different from other shows.... it gets a 6 for looking  decent, and like the story, it had cool design for some characters, but failed to take advantage of that. I did like the school though and a number of the demons.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7\\n\\n\r\nUmmm.... I don't remember the OST... and maybe because of that it deserves less than a 7, but I loved the both openings and the two ending were aight. Sound really helps set up the mood and atmosphere, while it certainly did the job, it's not enough to make them memorable. Like I said, loved the openings so it gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 5\\n\\n\r\n... They all suck... not really. The characters are entertaining I give the show that one. Rin is like your typical delinquent, but the author did a decent job in making him just notch higher than most anime delinquent characters. A number of the characters help prevent the show from being dry, but it really is just not trying hard enough. I'm just glad that the characters have enough personality to be individuals and not stock anime characters. Is there character development? Yes. Is there good character development? Ehh... as much any other anime...\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to point something out, and that is Satan... watch out for spoilers... this isn't really part of the review, it's more like a nitpick. Ok, so Satan in the first episode was this crazy maniac that tried to take Rin away, but then over a dozen episodes later, we find out that he is actually a pretty decent dude that just wanted live on earth. He fell in love with Rin and Yukio's mother... I think... and is shown to be very protective and caring. But fast forward that 5 minute in the same episode, Satan is batshit crazy again... The  lack of consistency with him just baffles me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 6\\n\\n\r\nEh... it was pretty dry. I really have nothing else to say, it was just dry. There were moments that were funny, but no action scene that really got my testosterone pumping the same way other shows do... so yeah 6. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- durrr this anime so good it gets a 10... no it gets a 6\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm a little harsh on the show, but maybe I'm also just tired of the same crap over and over again. I criticized the show for lacking originality, and I'm staying with that. I'm not really looking for something completely new, but what I'm looking for is a fresh new take on something overdone and this show just didn't do that for me.",

            "content": "Blue Exorcist Review:\r\n(Ao no excorcist)\r\nMINDSET:\r\nAw, no excrement why am I seeing this with eights and nines?!\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nRin Okumura is living through he's slice of life as a pubed teen with he's family and brother, soon finding out that he's excremental we don't care a jack prehistorically grown ash  father gotten the fecies kicked out of him by Satan. Now its up to our run of the mill protagonist to shaft satan at he's new high school who teaches the art of excrementations, sorry, I mean rex-cor-cis-mmm. And lots of other jazz that needs explaining that will drag out five minute review! And he's brother isan excorcist and Rin is the son of satan, cuz the author thought they were cool...\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nBasically, if You imagine all of the tropes and most generic archetypes in all of shonen add \u201cexcorcist\u201d because it sounds cool BUT make it shorter, we get this horrendous piece of abomination! BTW You make them worse (and obviously, here is why)\\n\r\na majority or even all of the entire cast don't seem to have enough depth, the show focuses way to heavily on the protagonist,  anyone else who get more screen time and some characters that none of us give a damn. They show there back stories giving a decent or sometimes half-ashed explanation on why they have become that person.\\n\r\nHowever, that do not develop, or develop enough to show our empathy and care. All or most of the characters in some way shape or form, does not show a large amount of complexity or depth, they are governed by Archetypes and show no sign of originality or multiple factors and traits.\\n\r\n (That Anime Snob has much more detail on this subject from he's ten dimensions video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob3ReizUo1c) Sure there are characters that do actually develop, however, they still had the same issue with lacking enough complexity and have not developed just enough for us to care when they are at a rough situation. Also, there are like 3 characters that meet this criteria out of like more than 10 side characters and villains!\\n\\n\r\nIf we talk about those \u201cother\u201d characters who seem to be the majority out numbering the three characters who show \u201csome\u201d overall depth, Blue Excrement does not repair the damage it has done by having a bunch of badly written characters with only three average characters! Those characters can go to a tentacle hentai if  they truly become 100% forgettable pieces of writing!\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is a Shounen, it is the characters that will drive the plot on being actually good. So yes, the story is bad. Soo to summarise a lot of details while having a clear image, far too much of the story heavily relies on plot conveniences. Too much feels forced, it doesn\u2019t feel as if stuff happens naturally like how the show portrays that not all demons are bad and are just trying to protect there territory like animals. That could have been very interesting if we seen there side of view. However, the scenes about the concept seem to be rather few and far between, and none of us even care and none of the more \u201cmonster-like demons\u201d seem to develop.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd now because I felt like it, here are a few reasons why Naruto is the better show: (despite of them being both sh!t)\\n\\n\r\n-Naruto gives actual character exploration and some development through quite a lot of characters. (until the author thought we need to mix in some Yaoi)\\n\r\n-Some back stories make actual sense and logic.\\n\r\n-They had this whole concept of teamwork (before Sasuke becomes gay) ninjas MUST co-ordinate to become successful. In Blue Exorcist, we all know that the protagonist is going to kill everything at the end, so why not bother if the going gets rough if he was the son of satan?\\n\\n\r\nCONGRABULATION NARUTO... YOU ARE RETARDED, YET YOU ACTUALLY MANAGE TO BEAT SOMTHING THAT IS NOT A TRAINWRECK AND YOU ARE AN ACTUAL EXAMPLE ON HOW MUCH THE 21ST CENTURY SHONENS HAVE WORSEN OVER THE PASSAGE OF TIME.\\n\r\n *CLAPS VIGORUSLY* \\n\\n\r\nSCORE:\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 Characters. HOW Can WE CARE?\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 Half of the show was filler. The story was still bad any ways.\\n\r\n6/10 \u2013 Good Animation\\n\r\n6/10 \u2013 WHY IS THE OP SO F**KING AMAZING?!\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL SCORE:\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 I feel nothing when I watched this show.",

            "content": "*Pure Review (Anime Only)*\r\nA dark, gripping, action enriched adventure from the very beginning...\r\nDespite its often harsh reputation; i found Ao No Exorcist both exhilarating, and although the premise is not completely original - an interesting watch.\r\nThe whole show retains an effective sense of scale, and an appropriately dark, suspenseful overriding tone. Its shounen identity becomes clear pretty soon on, and although it follows a formulaic structure, it's well executed. Alike most viewers, i particularly praise the beginning on its intricate and vivid setup; it starts off while fulfilling every criteria... A great starting point in terms of character development and story - that demonstrates theshow's action-related and emotional capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a few episodes of brilliant drama, action and attention to detail, a notable amount of filler does unfortunately come into light. At times i feared that the show may cease to progress as seamlessly as in the beginning, though these were at least temporary setbacks, and overall, the whole story and the development of Rin in particular continued to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's something this show does right, it's the fighting, and although it became a tad repetitive, this was already acknowledged, and the very relevant scenes documenting Rin's growth, came paired with the introduction of more characters, THEIR stories, and extensions to the theory behind the premise.\\n\\n\r\nOne recurring theme of Blue Exorcist is discovery - and those who have completed will know the extent of this word's connections. The main thrill, the main kick behind the story comes often in the form of twists, making everything more unpredictable in the short-run, and therefore intensifying the action. Rin's circumstances continue to become more real in time, and this conveys the friction between the forces in the story very well.  \\n\\n\r\nEach episode is rather cinematic in the way it congeals action and drama from multiple perspectives, which is great - though it must be said that the minor comedy/innuendo elements just plain interfere with the shows intensity at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have their own bit of development, but alike most other action-based shows, it's not quite comprehensive. In terms of story, i'm sure you don't have to scroll much to gather that it's a cliche, but particularly nearer the start and finish, it's incredibly well presented, and works wonders for illustrating the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWith a divided reserve of strength, it's hard to think of something Ao No Exorcist truly excels at, though nothing is too weak either... I guess you could say that to conclude, the whole thing is a touch self limiting in terms of potential. \\n\\n\r\nBut...\\n\\n\r\nAo No Exorcist works!\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting premise brings about a refreshing, dark and suspenseful array of attributes that add a lot of great drama and detail. The particularly story-heavy ending was my highlight, as i'm sure you know what i mean when i mention discovery: realization and unpredictability. When this anime gets going, it really does go all out!\\n\\n\r\nSo who would i recommend this for? Well, like with Attack on Titan, the show thrives on the opportunity to fuse drama and action - so for action/epic-style and plot twist appreciating viewers in particular, \\n\r\nif the whole religious war theme is something that works for you... You'll really enjoy!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"I'm going to beat the sh*t out of Satan!!\" - Rin Okumura.\r\nIf there was an award for the most pure shonen of all time, that award would not belong to any of the big names in the business... No, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, and any other series that comprises the collective of instantly recognizable \"shonen\" can't touch the perfection with which the myriad of shonen tropes were implemented in Blue Exorcist. \r\nArtwork and Animation: 8\r\nAs with most A-1 Pictures productions, Blue Exorcist looks very good. The traditional animation, particularly with the signature flames, is very crisp and smooth. There are a few moments where thebudget wore thin and some fidelity was lost, but overall a good looking series. No terrible 3D, and no overly repetitive scenes- consistent. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 8 \\n\\n\r\nWhile the sub sounds rather generic, with the exception of Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch, Code Geass) as Yukio, the dub brings out some of the best of Aniplex. The every-shonen-protag Bryce Papenbrook (Kirito, Eren, Shiro Emiya) stars as Rin, with some definite imitation of Vic Mignogna's Ed Elric- at times I really couldn't tell if Vic had stepped up to the mic (which was a good thing.) Papenbrook's best role, definitely.\\n\\n\r\nOpposite Papenbrook we have the ever great Johnny Yong Bosch as Yukio, Kyle Hebert as Suguro, Wendee Lee as Shura, and the spaztastic Christine Marie Cabanos as Shiemi. Aniplex always puts together a good dub cast, and this is no exception. All around well done. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, there's not much to bring to attention. It does its job with tension in exciting moments, and letting the air out in sad ones. The openings and endings are solid tunes, your standard issue J rock, with a little techno for the 2nd ending. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nNow, what was that I said about shonen? Oh yeah- how this show took the tvtropes list for the genre and used it as a checklist for this series. The story fares better than the characters, but with one glaring, and impossible to ignore problem: It's incomplete. Right, it's been said before that after episode 16 this show takes a turn for the filler, and this is truth. It deviated from the still-being-written manga to an anime original ending. From our experiences with this... it typically does not end well, right? Blue Exorcist doesn't have a horrible ending- it just has a non-ending. All the struggle through the beginning of the show culminates in a giant \"eeeeehhh\" at the end where nothing gets resolved. But hey, the big bad was defeated, right? Only for there to be another to crop up in its place and set the story up for a sequel that may never come. \\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn't be the first time that this's happened, nor will it be the last, but when it does happen, non endings typically stick- and audiences rarely eat them up. For an engaging start of a timeless Father/Son struggle with a unique setting, and the feeling of growing strength and power through self discovery, the story has a particularly inauspicious ending. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist with undiscovered superpowers? Check.\\n\r\nProtagonist with daddy issues? Checkeroo.\\n\r\nProtagonist who gets beaten down with self guilt and lacking the strength to go on until spurred onward by female love interest character? You betcha.\\n\r\nTakes place in a magical high school, with a ragtag gang of friends? Of course.\\n\r\nHeadstrong, \"must save everyone\", will stop at nothing to gain more power to protect their loved ones, it goes on and on. This show gives shonen a living, breathing body. \\n\\n\r\nOther things like \"annoying girl that nobody likes who turns into a useful member/saves everyone\", \"enemy turns into friend after being defeated\", and \"hidden evil family member\" all make themselves known. The \"believe in yourself and succeed against impossible odds\" trope checks in too, nearly every episode.\\n\r\nWhile these, on paper, read like \"wow, I've seen this in every show already, why's this any different?\" The truth is that Blue Exorcist embraces this. It's not pretentious, and it's not pushy or hamfisted in some ideal or moral, it's just taking these tropes and making a popcorn story out of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between Rin and Yukio is, however, fairly interesting. While not characterized on a basis of say Edward and Alphonse Elric, there's still quite a few good moments, between them, cliche as they may be. The classic \"being outdone by the other\" and sibling rivalry through Rin and Yukio's disparate personalities arises. While at times it drives them apart, and they have to face their challenges alone-  as expected, they manage to work together and do something great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I've really ripped on the characters being the embodiment of shonen cliche and the story getting really off track in useless filler territory that leaves nothing resolved, I have to say, I don't hate Blue Exorcist. \\n\r\nI watched Blue Exorcist alongside Neon Genesis Evangelion, and it was an excellent break from the dark and depressing but intricately crafted character drama of NGE. Watching Blue Exorcist was like watching TV, where NGE is more like reading a book. It didn't require any real thought of me to watch, no presence of mind- it was just for fun. \\n\\n\r\nFor a lighthearted, shoneny romp through a vibrant and imaginative fantasy world, one can do a lot worse than Blue Exorcist.",

            "content": "Seriously, can Shounen get more generic than this? This is like a cookie-cutter example of a shounen title.\r\nThe visuals and music are solid though, I didn't notice any bad animation moments and the OPs and EDs might be generic (I really don't like the 1st ones, sung by mediocre Jrock band and Korean boyband), but the 2nd OP is really catchy and great song and the ED also grew on me.\r\nEnough with production, the biggest problem about this anime is the characters. Seriously, there's not a single character that stands out between the cast.\r\nRin Okumura is absolutely forgettable character, just Naruto with blue flames insteadof red ones, but at least he can cook. His brother, Yukio is likable, but doesn't do anything at all and their relationship is poor compared to the one between Ed and Alphonse. \\n\r\nMephisto Pheles would be an entertaining character, if he wasn't a total Shinigami Sama rip off.\\n\r\nShura Kirigakure (is she seriously named after hidden mist village from Naruto?) is Yoko Littner with bad hairstyle. (It's weird calling her a fanservice character considering the mangaka of this is a woman).\\n\r\nThe classmates are also painfully bland, Renzou Shima is just a guy with some weird staff who hates bugs, Ryuji Suguro is a typical angry ambitious kid and Shiemi Moriyama is a 5 times more annoying and whiny version of Sakura, Kuro is just there because cats.\\n\r\nOk, there actually was a good character, Shirou Fujimoto, twins' adoptive father, a careful and good person who reads hentai manga but unfortunately gets killed in the beginning. But at least he still appears in some flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is weak and starts totally slow, most early episodes feel more like slice of life show, however the sword and gun fights in this show are well made. (The fights with praying and summoning beasts look stupid though) and the anime gets kind of interesting in the 2nd half, but it's just too late, a few people would be willing to watch the first episodes for so long. The religious symbolism and syncretism also doesn't really work here and is as pointless as in Evangelion. Look, D. Gray-man and Kuroshitsuji and most demon-themed anime worked well without it. It just looks weird using one guy fight with a cross and another one with a Buddhistic prayer. And it never gets to any really serious themes unlike Trigun, where the symbolism actually meant something.\\n\\n\r\nSo is it recommended? Not really, everything this anime has done was done before and BETTER, but at least it's not painfully long, so it won't waste your time too much. Why won't you check out Soul Eater or D. Gray-Man instead?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a strong 5,8",

Blue Exorcist has quite a good story, the artwork is so good that calling it first rate would be an insult, the characters are enjoyable and the sound & music was done really nicely. I'm not going to give the details, I can't do that without spoiling stuff, but I really recommend you to give this one a whirl. My only problem with this anime is a very common one- only 3 episodes have aired so far, wich means that there will be endless weeks of looking forward to the nextepisode ;). I give this one a 10 overall and recommend you once again to watch this- you won't be sorry.",

            "content": "I've seen 6 episodes so far and I'm quiet fond of it. When I first glanced at the picture (yes I haven't read the summary) it gave me the \"Fairy Tail\" impact. So I started watching it without reading the summary XD. \r\nSTORY - 10\r\nIt already gives you alot of chills of excitement (like doki-doki lol) just by watching the first episode ^^. I was so itchy to know what's gonna happen next so I've read the manga :P (last chapter: 24 at the moment). So I think its really have so much potential its going to be a HUGE disappointment if they're just gonnaair 12 to 25 episodes. Ao no Exorcist has the same level as the top animes. Yes, I'm talking about Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, Reborn (when it comes to fighting scenes), Code Geass etc if you know what I mean. I'M EXPECTING MORE EPISODES!!!!!! \\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\r\nIt really suits their own characteristics! Most of all, the special effects! They are all awesome and I think its better than good-looking guys/gals style. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\r\nI like the opening theme and just so-so with the ending since it doesn't really matter if its good or not (lol). But the background music surely fits the scenes. It makes you really hooked and carried away haha. Yes, sounds gives you that kind of feeling when watching it if you didn't notice =D.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nI love all the characters most of all Bon (Suguro, Ryuuji)! Why? Because his seriousness makes it funny and it making Rin, Shima (Renzo) and Kamiki (Izumo) mess with him (HAHAHA). They're portraying unique combinations from one person to another that brings out enjoyable atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nOf course! It's 200% enjoyment (hehe). I've been looking for months to find an awesome anime like the ones I've seen and loved. At last, I found the best anime yet! Despite the fact it just started ( T_T ), I'm sooooooooooooooo crazy about this anime! \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10 \\n\r\nI LOVE IT!!!! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!! But really, if the manga is this slow (like super slow), let's keep it in mind the worst case scenario (*sobs*). So .. I DEMAND THIS SHOW TO BE ONGOING for so long to satisfy its fans. :P Just like the top animes. =D",

            "content": "Rin Okumura, our main Protagonist, lives a fairly normal life until the day he finds out he is the son of a demon - more specifically: the living offspring of Satan. Quite a promising premise for a shounen anime; unfortunately, it could not keep its promise, mainly due to its characters and storyline.\r\nHaving said that, this leads us to the first issue: the Story. Ao no Exorcist starts off strong; throwing both you and Rin into unfamiliar territory filled with demons and priests and a very interesting actual state of the world and how it is divided. But soon after, the story develops into averitable donwfall. The Serie suffers greatly under its predictable storyline and lacks of the much needed depth which is essential to keep the story interesting for the rest of the show. Rather than giving us a better picture of the two worlds, the Story is filled with bland humour and uninteresting storyarcs instead.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist revolves around two worlds; the human world \"Assiah\" and the demon world \"Gehenna\". One does not simply travel between these two worlds unless you have a key which, paradoxically, quite a bunch of poeple seem to have. With this being the case it appears as if this key had been sort of a giveaway long time ago.\\n\\n\r\nLet us have a look at the characters of Ao no Exorcist. Rin Okumura appears as the stereotypical shounen main protagonist; not much intelligence, edgy personalty,... . He might be likeable, but is definitely not worth being called memorable. \\n\r\nYukio, his brother, serves as the smart, clever boy who tries to hold his brother in check throughout the anime - but offers not very much to the story itself. \\n\r\nAnd of course there is a archetypical girl in the anime which, after all, can easily be compared to Sakura from Naruto or Asuna from Sword Art Online. They all share and possess the same stunning quality to serve a story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were things that deserve a certain amount of praise. Let us begin with the Animation and the visual quality. The regular animation (CGI has been used as well) and the visuals of the demons did not disappoint. The variety of demons that were presented can arguably be \\n\r\nclassified in \"exceptionally creepy\", \"fancy little badass\" or \"cute little fellows\". \\n\\n\r\nEditing/Cutting were well-directed and the Music/Sound were appropriate for each scene. That is all we can ask for.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the anime does not have the dark tone as we could have expected out of the first few episodes. Surprisingly, however, it possess a reasonable amount of Entertainment, especially at the beginning. Therefore, Ao no Exorcist cannot be classified as entirely bad rather than wasted potential. \\n\\n",

            "content": "A classic shounen anime that I'm not too fond of. I know this is a popular anime but I honestly don't think it deserves it's popularity. It was just eh.\r\nStory: The world that this plot takes place in consists of two dimensions joined as one, like a mirror. The first is the world in which humans live, Assiah. The other is the world of demons, Gehenna. (MyAnimeList.net summary part)\r\nThe Plot revolves around a young boy called Rin Okumura and his twin brother Yukio Okumura, both sons of the demon king, Satan. They both end up attending True Cross Academy due to reasons that I don'twant to spoil. And there, Rin decides to become an exorcist. Meanwhile, Yukio was already a exorcist, but why? Yukio doesn't seem to have demonic powers, but Rin does, and everytime he uses his demonic sword, Kurikara, he seems to lose control of his powers and himself. All the meanwhile, Satan is lurking beneath the surface waiting to take the form of someone powerful enough to contain him (Maybe someone with demonic powers like Rin? Or maybe not) and take over Assiah for specific reasons. The overall story actually takes place in school/or school-related activities outside of school, rather than random demonic fight scenes, which I didn't mind that much. I thought the story was all over the place though, and the ending just didn't make any sense to me. The series lacked the depth needed to keep the story interesting, and had no comedy to keep me interested. Random fighting going on that I didn't really enjoy either. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Just like any other modern day anime... It was decent, nothing too special though. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I actually liked both the openings of the anime, they were really good! Furthermore, the soundtracks of the anime actually kept my attention onto the anime, without the epic music, I'm not sure if I would have actually payed attention to the fighting or useless dialogue going on. Very good music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters lacked depth. Overtime, there was supposedly development/change in the characters because of what they've experienced, but I didn't really notice any significant development or change other than the fact that the Okumura brothers went from innocent and pure to corrupt and berserk, back to being heroic brothers and saving the day in the end. Typical shounen... Too many minor characters that disappear without another trace. The only memorable character was Memphisto because he was the only entertaining, funny character. Everyone else was really dull, boring, and honestly besides the Okumura brothers, pointless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not terrible, but definitely not a memorable anime that I'd recommend to everyone. If you like to watch shounen anime that include exorcists, and devils with random action then I guess this anime would be enjoyable for you. I don't know, Ao no Exorcist just didn't appeal to me as much as I had hoped it would from it's popularity.",

The lengths of the skirts ofthe school girls' uniform\\n\r\n3. Shiemi's sudden giant breasts\\n\r\n4. The woman with the massive breasts. She added nothing to the story; it would have continued the same without her presence. And WHY did the animators have to give her such big breasts? She was the WORST thing about the anime.

I didn't regret it but it was not what I thought it was. \r\nI really waiting from it to be more dark and kinda scary but no. \r\nEven though it didn't get any near to my expectations it was fun to watch. \r\nGoing to the rating: \r\nSTORY: 6 \r\nYes, it has demons and exorcists and magic and evil, but it alson haveevil mushrooms and insects and stuff like that and I didn't understand why did they exist but nevermind. The story for me is going reallyyyy slow like super slow. You get a really good start, a boring middle and a fair end which is not the real end and you have to read the manga if you want something more or wait for the nevercoming season two. \\n\\n\r\nART: 7 \\n\r\nI have to be honest to myself, the art was good, not something special but good. I really loved the faces Rin made and I really loved the art of the characters but like I said it was not something special. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6 \\n\\n\r\nNot something special. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8 \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I loved them, every single one of them, especially Shiro and Kuro were my favorites. I loved the brothers and everyone. They have a great character development. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7 \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching it. It was a good anime to spend my time with it and that was the reason I watched and enjoyed it. If you love shonen anime that's a good one ;) \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7",

This story is rich with humor, drama, action, and so much more. The rich characters, strong plot, and steady pace make it hard to stop watching. Lessons of comradery and friendship are heavy themes throughout the story, and the bonds formed are done so in good fashion. \r\nFrom his \"awakening\" in the beginning of the story Rin is being targeted by the demon world. Some want him dead and some want to bringhim to his birth father (Satan) so he can fulfill his purpose for being born. Due to a tragedy early on, he finds himself at the True Cross Academy where he begins his exorcist training. Rin is such a strong moral character that it's easy to like him from the start. He's no angel (in fact he's literally half demon), but he seems to always want to do good. Will he succumb to the weight of his demonic powers or overcome them? Will he fall victim to the prejudices of the world around him? I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stop there, but I hope I at least peaked your interest enough for you to give this 25 episode series a try. You won't regret it. It's worth watching over and over again!",

This may look like another run of the mill action type show at first glance but it\u2019s really something more complex than that.\r\nThe anime has two main plot points that the show steadily builds at each episode. Thefirst plot point is Rin being the son of Satan. He is trying to become an Exorcist while trying to control his demonic power. It\u2019s not an easy task since he just recently learned of his powers and it\u2019s going to take a while to get used to it. This power will make his life hard though because a lot of people are interested at the son of Satan. There are people out to kill him and people scheming to use him. Rin is more focused on controlling his powers though because he wants to use it for good and to protect his friends as oppose to wreaking havoc with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second plot point is the group of friends Rin has as he tries to become an Exorcist. These are his classmates and comrades as he fights demons from all over. An exorcist cannot fight alone so there was a lot of focus given to the bonds the group forms. They start out as classmates, grow to become rivals and soon become comrades that have each other\u2019s back. A lot of episodes are focused to how the individual characters learn to trust each other and fight for the common good.\\n\\n\r\nThese anime only has two plot points but it\u2019s not as simple as that. Under these plot points are sub-plots that are also incorporated to the story. I call them sub plots under the main plot points because they aren\u2019t really as vital to the plot and they only make up parts of the main plot points. They don\u2019t stand alone but rather, adds depth to the main plot points. The story about Rin being a demon is more complicated than it looks.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there is a sub plot about his family dynamic. He grew up being protected by his father but the anime soon explored just how much the guy went through to ensure Rin grew up as a happy normal human being. He also has a very complicated relationship with his fraternal twin who has known all along that he was a demon but has taken up their father\u2019s role of protecting Rin. Rin is a stubborn guy though that wants to protect others and not the other way around. As the anime progresses, we soon discover just how much the family sacrifices to make the other person happy.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a sub plot about the inner working of the True Cross Order. There is the principal of True Cross Academy who has taken a liking towards Rin. He thinks of him as a very convenient weapon but the man is very much shrouded in mystery. He seems to love toying with Rin and seeing just how much he can push the guy before he starts pushing back. His intensions aren\u2019t that simple though and the anime soon revealed just how Rin being a demon really fascinates this man. The principal is someone who wants to use Rin but there are also people who just want him dead. There are shady individuals who would go so far to make sure he drops dead and then there are others who would even hurt innocent people to see him dead. Majority of the people in True Cross doesn\u2019t like the fact that the son of Satan is within their group and there was a very interesting power play that commences between the principal and the rest of the Order. This was a fascinating development of the anime because it involves a guy you seriously cannot read up against people far superior than him.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there is the typical Shounen aspect of the anime. It\u2019s the subplot about Rin trying to become strong. He faces a lot of adversity because of his demonic powers. There are some episodes that focus on his ties with other demons and there are also episodes focused on trying to control his powers. This wasn\u2019t that heavily focused though but this is where Rin would do different kind of trainings to become strong. Some of them aren\u2019t the conventional kind of training that requires some fighting though so it was pretty intriguing to see Rin try to become a better individual using these very unique kinds of training. I say it\u2019s not heavily focused because there aren\u2019t a lot of episodes where Rin would see progress. The anime had too much stuff to tackle other than the typical Shounen aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThese three stories are all bound together to the first main plot point about Rin being the son of Satan. It\u2019s a simple plot point but so heavily detailed and intricately constructed, it\u2019s pretty amazing. The second plot point also share the same kind of complexity.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the anime are pretty impressive. They all had a pretty decent character development and they all had a nice personality to them. The best part is that each character was given a decent spotlight including the minor characters. Rin is the typical Shounen hero character who charges head on and often shows her inexperience. His determination is strong though even though he lacks proper training. He had a very steady growth in the anime that I find pretty impressive. He starts out as a total hot head with a heart of gold but he soon transform into a very impressive person. I also enjoy this relationship he had with his brother. His brother, Yukio, is good at everything he does and an overachiever than Rin often feels jealous of him. Yukio is born as a human and he looks up to his brother though and he also has a bit of envy towards him. It\u2019s pretty sweet.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the class of exorcists Rin associates with. I love the interaction between them because it really brightens up the anime and they bring forth the classic Shounen theme of \u201cFriendship\u201d. The characters start out generic like the tsundere, the loud guy, the level headed guy and the airheaded girl but the anime was able to give them adequate time to really grow. Certain conflicts are presented to make these characters rounded and it strengthen the interaction among them. It\u2019s really well done.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of antagonists in the anime and they are all pretty impressive. There is the hard to gauge principal who seems to play both sides. One moment he helps the characters then the next you often feel like he is behind the incidents befalling the characters. The best part is that he has never once revealed his cards. He is really just in the grey instead of siding with the good guys. Of course, there is also Satan. He is portrayed pretty nicely in the anime. The super menacing guy that no one can beat with a pretty high level the characters can\u2019t reach. He doesn\u2019t appear much in the anime though because the anime wanted him to be an enigma until the later parts of the anime. There are also the people running the True Cross Order. I won\u2019t spoil much because most of them are introduced at the later parts of the anime but a lot of them are really irritating. They hold power and they run the place so they\u2019re order is absolute even if it harms others. They often just butt in without seeing the whole picture. They\u2019re really nice antagonists but they aren\u2019t really super evil like Satan.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least the animation was amazing. Some of the fight scenes are fast but they are very organic. It utilizes a lot of camera angles and there are some cool effects added to enhance the scenes. I love the one on one fight among characters because they all had different style and stances that looks really cool. Plus, the animation is so smooth that the battles are really easy to follow. The demon battles are also impressive in their own right. It\u2019s paced well that both the demons and the characters had enough time to strut their stuff. The background is very much involve in these fights because a lot of things are destroyed and flying all over. There also some CG works in some fights scenes. The anime is dominantly normal animated though. This CG are just added to make some things more awesome looking like the gate at the beginning of the anime with some menacing looking faces rippling like water.",

            "content": "A quick and easy review of Ao no Exorcist (Blue Exorcist)-- SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment.\r\nPROS:\r\n+ Interesting story\r\n+ Good comedy factor \r\n+ Beautiful art with bright colors and good use of light/dark contrasts\r\n+ Fantastic voice actors\r\n+ Great in sub or dub\r\n+ Good soundtrack\r\n+ Interesting characters (no one annoyed me!)\r\n+ Quick paced and exciting\r\n+ High overall enjoyment \r\nCONS:\r\n+ Ending seems a little disjointed\r\n+ \"Typical\" shonen story (if that bothers you)\r\n+ Not much growth/change for supporting characters\r\n+ Some unnecessary characters\r\nWant some more detail? See blow:\r\nSTORY:\r\nFor people to say this story is cliche is, in my opinion, a bit close minded. Definitely, the idea of a main protagonistwho become stronger in order to fight evil and defend those he loves is a nearly ageless story. The key is how writers reinvent that classic story to make it interesting. In the case of Ao no Exorcist this involves a son of Satan, various demons, cool weaponry, a school for exorcists, magic spells, and some awesome powers/abilities. These factors are the keys that make this show interesting!\\n\\n\r\nSome people are put off by the fact that not every episode is moving towards the final climax. And it is true that at some points the show is more episodic than larger story-oriented. I normally DO NOT like episodic show, but for some reason, this one stayed enjoyable to me the whole time. It didn't feel at all repetitive or like it was dragging. It just presents the audience with a lot of great illustrations of the world it is trying to create.\\n\\n\r\nBONUS-- I get tired of 11 year old protagonists saving the world, and was glad to have at least high school aged characters. \\n\r\nAlso, I wasn't expecting much comedy from this, and found myself pleasantly surprised by steady humor throughout with some really good laugh out loud moments.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nGreat art with very few inconsistencies. Too many shows these days are animated so darkly that you can hardly see details and, on the flip side, many shows are so bright that its like there is no variation in lighting. Ao no Exorcist does a good job utilizing both light and dark frames to create great contrasts, and using a wide spectrum of colors to give the animation depth.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nTHE VOICE ACTORS-- they are all so great! Really strong casts both in Japanese and English. The original cast is led by Okamoto Nobuhiko (Niizuma Eiji in Bakuman, Nishinoya Yuu in Haikyuu, Usui Takumi in Kaichou wa Maid-Sama) and Fukuyama Jun (Lelouch Lamperouge in Code Geass, Dr. Shinra Kishitani in Durarara!!, Kazuma in Noragami, Grell in Kuroshitsuji). They also have others you know and love, i.e. Kamiya Hiroshi (Orihara Izaya in Durarara!!, Akashi Seijuurou in Kuroko no Basket, Yato in Noragami, Levi in Shingeki no Kyojin).\\n\\n\r\nThe english cast is led by Bryce Papenbrook (Eren Jaeger in Attack on Titan, Kirito in Sword Art Online, Shirou Emiya in Fate/Stay Night: UBW, Masaomi Kida in Durarara!!) and Johnny Young Bosch (Makoto Tachibana in Free!, Izaya Orihara in Durarara!!, Ichigo Kurosaki in Bleach, Yusaku Kitamura in Toradora!).\\n\\n\r\nPoint is, you'll love the sub or the dub. Great casts no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is good throughout but nothing amazing. Enjoyed the first OST better than the second, but sound track was fine overall.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nI am someone who gets easily annoyed by characters. Fortunately, there weren't any characters in Ao no Exorcist that I was dreading being on screen. I really enjoyed them all, even though they may fit into some of the common character tropes. While the leads are well-developed, most of the supporting characters get only minimal background and development. However, for a 25 episode series, I thought the amount of character development was appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a two characters in particular hanging around that I found unnecessary (maybe they play a bigger part in the manga?), but I was disappointed that they weren't ever really fleshed out. These characters were used at times to manipulate the plot in ways that seemed a little cheap.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nDespite some of its faults, I found this show to be very enjoyable. I sped through it, and never found myself bored. It is quick-paced and action packed, and had much more comedy than I was expecting. If you enjoy shonen, battles, magic, or demons (with some great comedy and a fun school-setting), give it a try!",

            "content": "Oh boy, this anime though...*sigh* \r\nStory: \r\nWhere to start? I did find the first half of this very enjoyable. The flow was consistence and kept my levels of anticipation high, but once the filler arc came in... plot holes ahoy! I found myself slowly and slowly getting more bored. Things would happen that didn't make a whole lot of sense, the pace felt off, and some cliche scene came into play. I found  there were references to other mangas (Bleach) and TV shows (Supernatural). The story-line was a bit overdone and cliche at that point. \r\nArt:\r\nI was very impressed with the animation in this.I really loved the setting and the placement of The Vatican in there. There was some really good detail especially in the main city and the Academy as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nI loved the first opening song. I actually downloaded it on my iPod for later use. But I didn't really like some of the music they used. It didn't quite match the scene as well as I wanted it to. It did add a bit of interest, but I just didn't get the anxious and suspenseful feeling I wanted to get.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nI found a few stereotypical characters, Izumo was one of them with her snobby attitude and thinking she's better than everyone, there was also Yukio holding the litter-brother-smarter-than-the-big-brother characteristic. Shura reminded me a lot of Yoruichi from Bleach too, and almost had the same personality as her (and yes I am aware the English Dub was voice by the same actor). I didn't find much depth or development in characters either. There were a lot of static characters. Throughout the whole thing I think Shiemi was the only character that was well developed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, this wasn't the best anime I've seen. I was quite disappointed in the end and didn't get the satisfying feeling I wanted to get. I understand the manga is very popular, but I don't think I'll pick it up. I lost  interest in reading the real plot after watching this. At first, yes this was very exciting and I loved some of the scenes, but I felt like when the filler came, my whole experience was ruined. I would recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime if you don't want to be disappointed. Other than that, I give this anime a C- or 58% on the scale.",

            "content": "I've recently discovered that Ao no Exorcist, or Blue Exorcist, is divided up between those who love it and those who... well... don't really love it.\r\nSo it Blue Exorcist really worth the watch? Well...\r\nStory:\r\nAnyone who has witnessed shounen series of any kind will be able to instantly recognize the fact that this story doesn't fail to follow in the footsteps of others. A teenage boy who discovers he has all these immense powers and sets out to defeat evil.\r\nBut despite this, the premise itself does pose an interesting storyline, and poses some strong introductory episodes. But while the story does start off strong and Ienjoyed it until about the halfway point, it really disappoints in the end. There is little advancement in plot throughout the whole series, and so lots is taken up by filler.\\n\\n\r\nI found the first half of the series enjoyable enough, but my real problem was with the second half. The closer I got to reaching the ending, the more it felt like a chore to complete this series. While plenty of other 25-episode series have filler episodes in them, I found this to be very frustrating. It felt like the writers didn't have anything good to give us until their very anticlimactic ending (I'll get to that in a sec) so they gave us poorly written filler that didn't serve any purpose to the outcome of the story, and I really stopped caring altogether before the series even ended.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's up with this ending? Well it shouldn't be any surprise to hear that this shounen follows others by finishing off with an unsatisfactory, mediocre ending that doesn't follow the original media. Now this wouldn't be as big of a problem if they had bothered to write a decent ending. But while the rest of the series was enjoyable to an extent, the ending feels rushed, anticlimactic, and a poor way to finish off ta series that generally had promise to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not terribly written. It is not a bad story, but it certainly is not a masterpiece to me. Overall, it's alright. Not too bad, not too great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nSo if the story wasn't all too great, then the characters must be better... right?\\n\\n\r\nWell............................\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did find Rin Okumura enjoyable enough to watch as a main character, I didn't truly find anything special about him. He was okay. He was a typical rebellious teenager who was trying to defeat evil with his powers. And that's kind of it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, he is the most entertaining of the series to watch, maybe besides Yukio, who also holds up strongly as a main character. Shiemi is a femcale character who's there just for fanservice and undergoes little development. The other characters lack development and backstory, not to mention how little they are explored, and are just okay. None are too interesting, and the female characters just aren't all that standoutish. Most of the characters aren't memorable, aside from maybe Rin. I just couldn't get into the characters all that much and found them very by the numbers.\\n\\n\r\nThe only true relationship I really cared about was the one between Rin and Fujimoto, which is the strongest and the most realistic in the entire anime, despite it only being shown very briefly. Rin's bond with Yukio is genuine enough, but fails in comparison to other brotherly relationships in anime. Shiemi's \"romance\" with Rin is incomplete and is frustratingly very scarce, giving viewers no chance to really root them on. I truly found the characters to be disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\n The art style is certainly not my favorite, but the animation is solid and the style compliments the series well with its themes and moods. There isn't much to say here besides the fact that it holds up well in this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAll the music in this anime is very well done. The OST is pretty epic and compliments the story very well. The openings aren't my favorite, but that's just me. They do hold up well with the story though, and have good animation. I wasn't too big on the endings, but as far as the music goes as a whole, I found it to be well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI truly base my ratings off of how much I enjoyed as series, regardless of flaws or how much I can overlook them. But I didn't really enjoy this series. It isn't because it's a shounen; I like action well enough. But it just isn't a well told series. There's a lack of action, very flat romance, and the characters just aren't that memorable and don't hold up all that well in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the series is just alright. It's nothing too special. If you want a story with memorable characters, great action and a great story, than this isn't an anime for you. It just isn't executed well, and while it appeared interesting at first, it failed to hold up in almost all aspects. I could have lived without seeing this anime, as it really isn't anything that good or special. It's very by-the-numbers, and I found little enjoyment in it. While it does stand slightly above average with it's exceptionally strong beginning and good first half, it truly just falls to pieces as the story struggles on. Not all that worthwhile.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS! \r\nThe reason why I did not place any spoilers for people to really step up their game and try watching Ao no Exorcist! You have to find out the mytery behind these phrases. Why this? Why that? How come?\r\nI\u2019m surprised by the fact that people would label Ao no Exorcist as a generic shounen anime. I couldn\u2019t agree more with that but somehow it suits my taste, I don\u2019t know why. What surprised me the most was the scores they gave here in MAL. Most were practically low or just average. Now let me tell you why I loved BlueExorcist.\\n\\n\r\nKazue Katou, the original creator of the manga based show exquisitely chose the theme of demons and humans divided in two worlds, Gehenna (realm of demons or hell) and Assiah (earth). These worlds are mirrors of each other but somehow, obviously, Gehenna is the more evil side. The story goes really fast without any filler in the manga, but in the anime\u2026 they fabricated some details and events. From the very start, the production staff already added scenes that may or may not be entertaining. I think because they lacked material and information from the manga. Here is a short summary of the events, Rin Okumura is a son of an exorcist and has a twin brother who is seemingly ahead of him when it comes to academics and behavior (best of both worlds kind of guy). He remained to have a normal human life for 15 years but little did he know there is a secret that lurks inside of him, a secret that is crucial for anyone to find out. The show actually has a number of genres in it. You got action, comedy, drama and loads of things that you can find in your average show. I know it may sound normal but I was a bit hesitant to watch it at first but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like it once you\u2019ve come across the depths of this anime. Usually the first half of the show is a bit okay but I guess the second took all the glory and showed all the action and answers behind each question. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go to well. Everything seemed abnormal from the development of the characters to the storyline. It seemed rush and not handled very well. I did enjoy the fillers like the ones in Soul Eater but more importantly we did not watch the anime because of the non existent and non canon episodes made by A\u20131 Pictures. I guess half of the show became OVA (Obviously Very Apathetic). I wished they\u2019d make a new season because most of the arcs in the manga really kept the story in a more understandable pace. Anyway, if you extremely hate fillers and you can\u2019t bear to watch nonsensical scenes, you can skip episodes 17 \u2013 25 and start reading chapter 14 or 15 of the manga. There are major changes in most of the scenes. But if you\u2019re like me who loves to finish a good show and just start reading the manga from the start, you can actually just watch the whole thing and read the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nArt is Artstanding! Okay that was so lame. I\u2019m sorry. Well it is the truth. This is probably my first time watching a show that is produced by A-1 Pictures, that or I just couldn\u2019t remember. The music sounds great too. I noticed that they used the traditional piano and electric guitar tunes; moreover, what caught my attention is the godlike chanting in the BGM (background music). The opening and ending songs were dramatic and fantastic to hear. My favorite would be Core Pride by UVERworld. The voice actors did well. I\u2019m surprised that Kaji Yuuki voiced Konekomaru! I mean, WOW! Yukio\u2019s voice sounded more mature which suits him well. On the other hand, Rin\u2019s voice is a bit rebellious and fit for his character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were just amazing. I know some of them are your typical shounen characters. We have Rin who is a hot headed teenage guy who had a rough past and becomes a hero. Yukio, his brother, on the other hand, is calm at most situations and also has tons of secrets. Shiemi, the moe type of girl who cares for everyone (like a Mary Sue) and guys fawn over her. Kamiki, tsundere girl, absolutely predictable. Shima, the perverted guy. Suguro, cool and mysteriously smart. Konekomaru, also smart and flexible with people. You got every basic thing that you can see in most characters but somehow there are interesting ones like Mephisto who is the most mysterious guy and he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to. He can control any situation with his brilliant mind with full of schemes. Shura, the badass girl who can dress and express her reactions and can still kick some ass. Let us not forget the addition of animals. What I like about these characters, despite the fact that they portray the most commonly seen traits, I\u2019d say most of them are really helpful. You cannot deny the fact that each and everyone of them have the guts to protect someone they love and they have the most interesting fighting tactics. \\n\\n\r\nThere may be unexplainable reasons why I loved Blue Exorcist because somehow my reasons were a bit vague for people to understand. Maybe sometimes we have different tastes in anime and genres. Sometimes we just need to respect each other\u2019s likings. For example, one may prefer watching Code Geass over Naruto or One Piece over Fairy Tail. Some people would go for underrated shows rather than overrated or famous ones. Either way, we all have our own playlists in anime. Going back to this show, I believe you will definitely love it. Go straight to the manga once you finish watching it because every chapter will be worth the wait. \\n",

            "content": "VERY MINOR SPOILERS:\r\nSTORY: This anime is a basic shounen with strong similarities to the Fate Series. To break that down, there are many objective feelings of it being rushed, convenience, filler/transition episodes, absence of world building, and the need for more explanation at every turn. I understand several folks must like this style, as seen with high reviews to Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagann, so my review comes from a fondness of good story. The main way Blue Exorcist is different than the Fate Series is it doesn't have Ufotable's superior art style and less character growth. You start to notice these things inthe first episode with the rapid death of a potentially amazing character. Other pivotal example include the potential to explore the world, no diving into the details of the Mystics of Exorcism and Ranks, the apparent pitiful state of power the Knights of the True Cross possess, and the nearly complete absence of character growth for the protagonists in both combat and reasonable emotions. Now, if this anime was given a hundred or so episodes, it truly could have been amazing. The potential you gleam from the world is inspiring but eventually becomes ignored all together. I confess I'm a huge fan of growth of characters, story, and the world; This is why my review is low. Also, the last episode really epitomizes everything I've said thus far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: Very on par art style with 99% of other anime. As stated earlier, Ufotable are the objective leaders in Art. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The usual cast of professional voice actors heard in many anime. Always good, no complaints here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Like I said, has great potential, charm, and ideas, however, needs the super-anime treatment to really blow us away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Fine, definitely fine, but would be infinitely more so if they weren't in such a hurry to finish it. It can be enjoyed if you come from the Kill La Kill/ Gurren Lagann mindset of entertainment: where story is negligible as well as much growth, convenience is only viewed as a plus, and you skip every other episode due them been filler/transition pieces. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: This anime had incredible potential and good hook. With many more episodes, time and dedication, it would have been one to truly compare to the greats of Hunter x Hunter and Naruto, but it fails in every single area where they excel.",

            "content": "This is one of those animes that doesn't fail to baffle me. I watched it because it was available on Netflix and was the sort of show that was good to have on in the background while I did something else. Why? Because it's so unbelievably unoriginal that you don't have to pay attention to it whatsoever to know what's gong on. Yet, it has this huge fanbase and receives a ton of attention for its next season for what, to me, are unexplainable reasons.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nIt is the definition of a cookie-cutter shounen. Rough around the edges male protagonist discovers his special powers and hasto go to a magical specialty school to learn more about them and fight something. There's nothing wrong with this premise, aside from pretending like it's still interesting. People will say, 'Well, it's unoriginal, we've seen it done before, but it has bright colors so it's still interesting'. I disagree; it's nothing horrible to watch, but there's nothing notable about it. The whole Satanic aspect could have been really cool and interesting, but instead it gets turned into like a weird, knock-off Soul Eater type of deal that just doesn't really make sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are unique or interesting. They're all just archetypes and cliches and even the few that try to break out of that box fail to be compelling or likable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is fine. It's as interesting as all of the other shows that it is exactly like. But do I have any interest in watching the next season unless I have to do a large project with a show on in the background? Absolutely not. The finale in particular was really the final straw for me and I finished the show thinking, 'Wow, that went downhill fast and never redeemed itself'.",

The plot is incredibly easy to follow so you might lose interest early on. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is decent but once again its nothing you haven't seen before its just playing it safe, although the blue flames look pretty nice that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The openings are quite nice but doesn't really hook you in it's just there, voice acting is okay but nothing special or unique and could be done by anyone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character Rin is your typical reckless, powerful, violent but friendly person who looks very average apart from blue flames, there are a lot of other characters such as his brother Yukio who is the complete opposite of Rin and once again doesn't stand out. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I watched it because nothing else was on at the time and I just wanted to watch something I don't need to think too hard about, if you just want generic shonen anime then this anime is for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're tired of shonen anime then avoid this because every cliche you see is in this series and feel that you watched it but didn't gain anything from it.",

            "content": "Why did I watch this anime? Well I was on Netflix and I happened to scroll onto a show called Blue Exorcist.  It told me that it was about a teenage boy who had to deal with being the son of Satan.  Holy shit that sounds cool right?  So I watched the first two episodes.  The main character, Rin, finds out that he and his twin brother, Yukio, are both sons of Satan but only Rin inherited Satan's power.  Satan kills Rin's adoptive father and Rin vows to kill Satan by joining a group called the Exorcist who are devotedto killing dangerous demons.  \"Wow this anime is looking to be really good\" I said to myself.  Too bad it was all a huge disappointment and a fucking waste of time.  The plot sounded like this anime was gonna be big shit but literally NOTHING HAPPENS.  Rin is transferred to a new school, his brother who is already an Exorcist has to train and keep an eye on him, and Rin literally does NOTHING to come even remotely close to even figuring out how to kill Satan.  It's all episode after episode of Rin either easily killing irrelevant demons or dicking around with his friends (who suck by the way but we'll get to that later).\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure how to classify the art in this anime.  It's not terrible but nowhere near the best.  I'd say it's more like one piece but a few notches better.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound?  I never really payed attention to it so it was nothing memorable but doesn't take away from the overall experience\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters.  Rin, Yukio, and Shura are the only characters who you should give a damn about.  Everyone else is useless and annoying.  Let's go down the list.\\n\r\nShiemi:  She's a shy and polite girl who's very socially awkward.  That's pretty much it and it gets old real fast\\n\\n\r\nBon:  This guy gets on my nerves.  He talks shit to Rin and acts big all the goddamn time but he is fucking useless and a waste of space.\\n\\n\r\nRenzou:  Annoying NEXT!!!\\n\\n\r\nKamiki: Bitch NEXT!!!!\\n\\n\r\nKonekomaru:  Real smart guy but can't do shit when fighting happens\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  If the show stayed true to its original goal then I would've had a lot of fun.  The action isn't that good, Rin just swings his sword around with no skill and thats it.  Most enemies can be taken down in one move because they're so weak.  Comedy is forced, nonexistent, and boring.  A waste of my damn time.   A terrible execution of something that could've been phenomenal.\\n",

I liked the diversity in styles. So A+ on that.\r\nThe plot of this anime is interesting; however it is filled with holes and cliches. There were so many moments in the anime where something was brought up and I was completely confused as to what they were talking about. Then other times, plots would be touched on and then later they wouldbe completely dropped. My largest problem with this anime is the pacing. The beginning is great; well paced and just enough to draw you in. After awhile, the plot slows down and it doesn't have much of any direction (fillers). However, just when there are just a few episodes left and you wonder, where could this possibly go now? it speeds up to the point that you can hardly keep up. Too much information is shoved into the last few episodes which makes the ending unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what makes this show enjoyable is the characters. The show focuses on friendship and doing the right thing.  It was nice to watch the characters grow closer to each other over the course of each episode. Although some characters were somewhat stereotypical, there was not one that I disliked. This is because of the strong relationships which were formed and the willingness to sacrifice for each other that each character possessed. \\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend this anime? Yes. Is this the best anime ever? No, not by a long shot. But overall, it's good and worth the watch.",

            "content": "Story: 3.4\r\nThis show has a very good start to it and introduced a lot of potentially interesting themes, however after the first few episodes things start to go downhill. Inconsistencies is this shows' biggest problem as it tries to be many things but by doing so it looses its identity. One episode its an action anime the next its a slice of life show and few episodes later it can be a romance when really it should be more focused towards being a supernatural show. I'm not saying that a show can't be multiple things but when its bad at them the show suffers forthis loss of direction. The show is best when it does focus on the super natural however the narrative quickly becomes very predictable.\\n\r\nAnother major issue that plagues this show is the lack of character development. The viewer really only gets the back story to a select few characters and you only see a slight character arc with Rin. This in turn makes the action sequences feel inconsequential and lack any emotion put in by the viewer and the show never really makes you care for many characters, and in some cases makes you dislike them. The action sequences are pretty good and the overall art style is the best part of the show but without an attachment to these characters its hard to care if they succeed in battle or not.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3.5\\n\r\nOn my other point on making the viewer dislike characters, for me there were a few standouts in this area. The standout of the awful characters has to be Shiemi in my opinion. This girl never actually does anything when it comes to the action sequences, rather relies on her familiar, and is actually kinda dumb as she is more of a hindrance towards the group then anything else. Her only use in the show is as a love interest towards the brothers which is just sad. The other horrible character would have to be Shura, which clearly exemplifies a prime example of how the creators of the show view women, as it is common to all the female characters in this show but with Shura it is at an extreme. She basically doesn't wear anything, just a bikini top that is big enough to cover her nipples but small enough so you can see the rest of her DD breasts. I would have even of brushed it off if it was just a one time thing that she wore but this was what she wore all of the time even as a teacher... There are many women in anime who are objectified as sex object and are amazing characters like Winry Rockbell from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Kurisu Makise from Stiens Gate, and this show sadly goes in the opposite direction of a strong female character. The only character I did like was their dad Shirou Fujimoto, and was the only character that had any real depth to him and was likable but sadly was only around for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.8\\n\r\nAs I said above the art is great and the action sequences are pretty good but nothing really amazing. The best parts of the art is when they show off the variety of demons but like I was saying before its hard to feel anything towards these action sequences with the poorly written characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThere is nothing amazing either about the sound in this show as the voice acting for the characters do not fit for many characters, most notably would be Rin voiced by Papenbrook, Bryce. There is a lot of humor in this show that I never laughed at and I can't help but feel it was poor line delivery by the main character here. Sure it might not have been my kind of humor but the delivery of the lines throughout the show by him in particular came off as annoying to me and sometimes laughably bad, and laughing for the wrong reasons isn't a plus for the show. Voice acting for Shiemi is pretty bad as well as she just comes off as annoying and there's even a line where she says,\"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait ect... The only decent performance was by Johnny Yong Bosch as Yukio which is no surprise given how talented he is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime showed some early signs of promise but quickly diminished when the show lost focused and become an entirely different show then it seemed to have initially intended. The action and art are the standouts of the show however it is bogged down by terrible characters, lack of character development, unfocused narrative, cheesy dialogue and flat humor.I might recommend this to people who are die hard fans of the supernatural genre but other then that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 4.8\\n\r\n+Nice art and action sequences\\n\r\n+Cool supernatural elements\\n\r\n-Bad character development\\n\r\n-Many unlikable characters\\n\r\n-Dialogue cheesy\\n\r\n-Overall story predictable\\n\r\n-Sexual objectification of every female character\\n\\n",

There are far worse anime, but the character and story development leave a lot to be desired. Very unoriginal, very cliche, very generic. Too much fanservicing. Anyone who rates it very highly likely has zeal for other superficial anime or is unconcerned with depth.\r\nHighs: Decent action scenes, a few glimpses of interesting art, interesting first few episodes\r\nLows: Overarching unoriginality, very poor character development, annoying at times",

How could they do this?\r\nAnd anyway, the story was like a jigsaw puzzle, where I felt likeI missed an episode or two all the time because things were evolving too fast (damn those fillers for doing nothing)!\\n\r\nCharacter development sometimes felt like a neglected aspect too.\\n\r\nThe main thing was that at even the 20th episode, I was like \"where is the plot, was that thing the plot?\"\\n\r\nOverall: It wasn't a bad show, and it had a satisfying ending (sort of sad), there is some decent comedy and you can enjoy it if you put aside a few annoyances.",

            "content": "-This review is spoiler free-\r\nBlue Exorcist is your normal anime. A story line that meets your expectations, good characters and enjoyment. It's like enjoying a warm breeze with fluttering eyelashes. However, there's a catch... \r\nStory (7/10)\r\nIt's a pleasant story that involves originality when it comes down to it. However, while I sat through episodes, my eyes seems to wander elsewhere. My focus is not struck onto my laptop screen, but is observing the blank walls and other thoughts drifting through my mind - all while I'm watching the episode. This is not necessarily a horrible coincidence, I usually act like this when it comes downto watching new animes. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if my attention keeps prolonging - now that's a problem. It's not particularly the actual \"plot\" but the way they performed it. As I stated before: It's similar to enjoying a breeze warming up your face...\\n\\n\r\nBut that quickly becomes boring, doesn't it? \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art is good. Not something that people should fawn over, but not something that deserves a sign of revolt. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done. I suspect that every animes voice acting is splendid. I never crossed one that made me cringe. The OST for Blue Exorcist has a very powerful and epic tone, but it also has a tranquil atmosphere, depending on the scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nYour typical goofy and impulsive main, male protagonist. A man who would risk his life for his friends and family. There isn't much to say, except that I didn't get very attached towards the characters. From my perspective, I didn't find them that unique. However, Shiemi had a little touch towards her character, which I found very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) \\n\\n\r\nBlue Exorcist was a nice experience, but I quickly dropped it once my attention diverted from it completely. I actually dropped it when it hit the climax, and it's safe to say I didn't really regret my decision. However, I would totally recommend this to you if you prefer something gentle, but still realistic and ferocious when it grows more into the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a deeper connection with a story, then this might not suit you well. There is still a connection, but instead of it hitting five bars, it somehow hits a low three. (WiFi reference. TeeHee.) However, that doesn't mean that you can bring it back up. This may not be for everyone (especially not me) but give it a try! You may be surprised by the outcome. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series. It does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I've liked and disliked about the anime and the reason(s) I have had dropped it for. While I didn't experience the anime in its entirety and therefore I can't form an opinion based off of its entire content, I think it's important when picking a show to watch to also consult the perspective of someone who has decided to avoid a show after experiencing it, because these people might be more critical and moreaware of the flaws a show presents than people who were capable of completing the series. Hence why I'm writing this. \\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist was a poor choice for me because of a few factors, the first being the setting. Since the anime doesn't start with its actual setting from the very start, I'll have to say that the anime until the point I got spent most of its time within a highschool setting were kids train in order to become exorcists, with everyone important in the school lowkey having superpowers or something to do with superpowers. So if you're tired of this setting, take a breath because not only this is the setting you get, but each episode the anime introduces a new character on which they focus on, in a somewhat slice of lifey demeanor, respectively with a food battle, a guy who's whiny that a guy takes worse grades than him and a girl who won't leave her yard. All of these episodes have a sense of the supernatural setting, but they very much feel like irrelevant everyday non-threat episodic stories, that after the introduction arc are a sore taste, and I can't detail exactly why without spoiling that arc. What credit I can give Ao no Exorcist in its introduction arc is that things constantly change and nothing really is constant, and the main character is constantly hit with new information about the life he's lived and who he is, which kinda makes the story seem like it's gonna have a direction and not be stationary. Like in a highschool setting. Meeting other students every episode. In an anime about the son of Satan. Birthed through a cult killing itself and being burnt. \\n\\n\r\nThe second gripe is the characters because they're uninteresting. The main character is a generic shounen wild numbfuck who's good natured and the whole package, but he's played off as intimidating and brutish because he's a demon. His twin brother on the other hand is the booksmart guy, who is popular, wears glasses, is smart, is booksmart, popular, wears glasses, is smart, wears glasses... Truly a character who interests me so much due to his abundance of character traits. What I'm saying that most of the characters don't really have depth and are one dimensional, and even despite life changing events, they will continue to act a certain way because the plot demands it, without their personality changing or the series taking it slow to show them taking it in. I don't really wanna describe any other characters, since they're either the main focus of the episode, and hence I will describe an entire episode, or they're barely relevant or just overall uninteresting because they haven't done anything noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my third gripe is the lack of action the series has. Look, on a technical note, yes, Ao no Exorcist has some action bits every episode. However, truthfully the fights never feel like they're ever gonna be a threat, with the characters even admitting that everything is a low threat and not that dangerous. There's only one episode where the fights had some sense of urgency and where everyone actually fought against a different side, with the feeling that this was an actual confrontation. And even if I found it a little ridiculous that the characters are constantly chanting and spilling christian bullshit while spitting fire from their mouths, at least I saw an actual confrontation that didn't feel onesided. Any other fight it's just some supernatural creatures getting their ass kicked and having no lines except for like one exception, and that's only about them having lines. None of the confrontations hold any meaning for the most part and they're there at best to enhance the drama, with some random fights and dangerous situations whenever is need of characterization. Like it's the only way to resolve conflict. They are also plainly one sided. And that made them really boring for me.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, my final and most important gripe is the story itself. Continue reading this paragraph only if you don't mind being spoiled, as I will spoil the   first three episodes with important and essential plot details. Skip this paragraph if you don't wanna be spoiled. This is your last chance. So after the first episode, it's revealed that MC's father is an exorcist and takes him home, a church to protect him against the deomns that found his location and give him a chance to run from Satan. He doesn't and instead argues with his dad which upsets his dad and thus the dad becomes emotionally weak and that way he gets possessed by Satan. And then the father kills himself in order to drive Satan out of his body. The brothers, after their father's death pretty much... are okay. I mean, they bury him, they both look at the grave alone for a while and then... one of them tells the other to die and afterwards the other says \"BUT I WANNA BEH STRONK\" and then they're like bruuuuuuuh and they're okay now, their relationship is back to square one. The way they resolve their conflict is quite superficial, and is merely done to keep the series lighthearted, and have their relationship as a tool for that. If you don't understand what my problem is, basically, after a battle against Satan and the main character, the son of Satan, loses his adoptive father, he goes to school and every episode meets new students or residents which are the focal point of the episode. After a fight in a church against demons with various techniques displayed, every battle is now onesided and non-threatening. And any attempt at drama is futile since the series has bad writing and the characters are uninteresting. This is exactly my problem. The direction of the story. Or rather lack thereof.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I have dropped it for is because I don't care about the long winded wait for the confrontation against Satan and don't want to keep watching boring highschool students. None of the characters I have found compelling and the series feels like is gonna go nowhere and just keep the characters in school with perhaps random arcs threatening MC's safety and his friends. And I couldn't care less about any of that. There wasn't any action to entice me, the dramatic bits are poorly written, I don't want to wait for the show to find its direction and I don't care about any of the series' characters because they act like generic shounen tropes, despite plausibly being more substance to build them above that if the show tries. \\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend the series if you are tired of the generic shounen tropes and action animes with a school setting. The action bits could always change, and there is promise there, substance might show through later, so I don't want to ruin your hopes for that, but I am 3 hours in and had only one relevant fight in the entire anime. If the setting doesn't bother you, then the anime might be worth a shot, as it has fairly decent production values. The animation looked decent, althought the art style is a bit generic and I have no complaints in the sound department. If you're looking for a shounen in a school setting that rather than focusing on action, chooses to focus on the characters inside its setting and their setting, this might be worth a shot. Ao no Exorcist isn't exactly bad, I simply found it uninteresting, because of its setting, its lack of compelling action and I found its bits where it tried to be dramatic quite dull and poorly written. However it can be comedic and enjoyable through its lighthearted nature, but it doesn't have substance in terms of narrative. Ultimately, it boils down to whether or not you enjoy a group of high school friends poking fun at each other with some supernatural elements in the story. I certainly don't. But if you do, this is the aspect in which I will agree it succeeds in the most. Unfortunately, this is not something I'm looking for in a series but if there's any other elements that might interest you in Ao no Exorcist, its setting might keep it alive for you. Unfortunately, it killed it off for me.",

            "content": "Well I have only seen up to Episode seven and while there might be more out there I'm limited to the site I use as to how far I can get. I can really say I have enjoyed it a lot so far. My first time seeing it was a random chapter in Shonen Jump and while I liked it just fine I didn't think that it was really worth going to look up but when I stumbled upon its anime adaptation i thought it was at least worth a look. \r\nThe first episode you might think that its a slice of life towards thebeginning since it starts early enough that you aren't dropped just right into his life at the academy. That got some serious points from me since I hate when an anime just gives you a story and expects you to already know everything from the beginning. This anime lets you move along with the main character and learn everything as he does which is a huge help. They take the time to explain demons, exorcists and everything in between the two without getting boring or having to have those random times that show up just to give you information. Everything you learn you learn because Rin needs to know it as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all enjoyable so far which is weird for me since I usually single out a specific character I know I will hate just from the opening alone. Yukio is by far my favorite though since I never seem to find enough anime characters with glasses. All of the students are developed to the point that you want them to show up more often and aren't just useless filler characters you see in the background of all the scenes. They keep Rin's class size low so that you get this chance. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is great for the most part I just had small problems here and there with it so it fell short of a perfect 10 along with the sound but nothing that would take away from the overall experience of this anime.",

This is why 7 is not a particularly flattering score. Blue Exorcist is a very 7 show for me.\r\nThis show is ambitious, I'll give it that. But I couldn't really fully immerse myself in it because I have already seen Soul Eater.\r\nWhether intentional ornot, the comparison has to be made. Both involve Halloween themes, both have students fighting demons, both have an off-color when not immature sense of humor. But sadly, Soul Eater comes out on top at every turn. The biggest thing that Soul Eater did better was the choice of main character. Our protagonist, Rin, is somewhere in between Soul and Black Star. I don't know if that was the smartest choice. This show needed a Maka to balance him out. He is not unlikable; in fact, he is funny and entertaining, but there is a problem.\\n\r\nRin is not a particularly dynamic character. Despite what the show tells me, I don't see much change in his character over the course of the show. All of his plotlines (either all or most) pan out the same. Rin tries to do something stupid and heroic; Yukio, Ryuji, or whomever tries to stop him; Rin does it anyway; Rin makes it work; fade out. If Rin never really fails after the 2nd episode, he can't grow in a way that doesn't seem superficial or forced. All the characters are written well, sure, but they can't change because the plot never allows them to learn anything. There isn't much room for real drama. \\n\r\nIt's not all disappointing. The characters are likable enough, the animation is very good, and this show is genuinely funny, but it could have been more. We could have had a show as good as Soul Eater. With a heavy heart, I give it a C.",

            "content": "I'm really NOT into badass priests and fighting nuns, so at first, I didn't want anything to do with this anime. I kept rolling my eyes whenever I saw the words \u201cexorcists\u201d or \u201cSatan\u2019s son\u201d. How did I end up marathoning Ao no Exorcist in a matter of a few days? It was somewhat recent, I read interesting reviews about it, and the protagonist looked so damn good. I regret nothing.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nAs you might have guessed, I was not impressed by the overall theme of exorcism. Chanting the bible to fight off demons remains pretty lame. However, I think they did bring something else tothe genre. I liked the part where they join a secret school in their school, and we get to see what they have to learn - very Harry Potter style, but more off-the-wall, because it's an anime. They managed to wrap the story in the end, and they made it quite dramatic, but you can feel that's a deviation from the manga it's based on.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI am no expert on art, but I definitely enjoyed the look of this series. I found the drawings appealing from the start, and that's actually what convinced me to give the series a try. You've got pretty eyes, pretty backgrounds and cool flames. The characters are good looking, and so are the fight scenes. Even the openings and endings are nice to watch. Also, kudos for having Rin wear a bobby pin and actually look cool with it!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nThere is a fun balance of power between two very different twin brothers. The school principal is a true eccentric. And there is eventually one kickass female. All in all, I was pleased with the ensemble cast. Each character has qualities and flaws, which makes them likeable. They are at times surprising and they prove themselves useful. My only regret is that the anime was too short to let us see where these characters are really going and how the relationships develop further.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is an ordinary anime, but the attention paid to details makes it good, and highly watchable. It had been a long time since I last found an anime that didn't bore me after a couple episodes. Somehow, this one did the trick, and it even got me to write my first review ever! Bottom line, I recommand this series to anyone who liked Naruto, FMA, Fairy Tail and the likes. It has this \"boy tries hard to succeed in a weird world\" vibe about it, and some of the silly humor.",

More than half of the episode are episodic stories that are mostly used to introduce all the side characters. It does start to pick up at the 13 episode mark only to fall back down, than get back up for a rather unimpressive ending. it does use most flashbacks In a useful way of showing things, not seen before, but there are so many and they don't really do much for the story. the setting takes place at some school which they don't bother rather explaining to a good extent. \\n\r\neven being exorcist is the same as calling ninjas characters in Naruto ninjas. the classes don't seem to serve one another when it comes to teamwork, and it wouldn't matter since you can have more than one class. even then if they are called exorcist why are they summoning demons to help them?\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\ncharacters- as said in the story most character introduced are given their own episode. most of them have some sort of tragic backstory and we should feel bad, but over time feels repetitive and boring. there is little development with all the characters so they are mostly 2-dimensional. Rin is standard shounen protagonist and can best be described with few words and is nothing special. his brother is mostly a foil to him, but it can be said the same for him as well.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- it was alright nothing notable that made me happy or frustrated. mostly bored\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nconclusion- the show has mostly good animation, average soundtrack, good voice acting,and  below average story and characters.\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "A five out of ten because quite frankly, this isn't new or innovative enough to warrant a higher score. The animation is fluid and crisp, the character designs are great, and the action scenes are fresh. I also like the balance of humor and fanservice. The problem is phrases like stereotypical, cliched, run of the mill, and by the numbers comes to mind. \r\nRin Okumura, our main protagonist with magical powers no one else can match\r\nHis brother Yukio Okumura an exorcist with no magical powers but is so book smart they let him teach a class at True Cross Academy's Japanese branch; where they trainexorcists. Satan kills their father and this motivates Rin to become an exorcist declaring, \"He's gonna beat the shit out of satan\" before Mephisto Pheles who let's Rin into True Cross Academy's Japanese branch. Rin is a \u201ccombat application is more important than book smarts\u201d kind of guy. He is also master chef (as all anime heroes tend to be these days); which serves as his deus ex machina to gain friends and acceptance despite his atypical personality traits of rude cutting remarks and penchant for violence against bullies. This of course is constantly in strife with Yukio always calm, level headed and smart. And it would have worked if it wasn't for the scoobies that also are in this show.\\n\r\nThis series features seven other characters whose contribution to this series is so little I question why bother having them in this series. The only answer I can come up with is to fill the cliche quota:\\n\r\nTough guy with a heart of gold that has more in common with the main hero than he knows? Enter Ryuji Suguro\\n\r\nTsundere who acts this way as a defensive mechanism? Enter Izumo Kamiki\\n\r\nA timid but brilliant individual, able to come up with complex strategies in a short window of time? Enter Konekomaru Miwa.\\n\r\nThe easy going faux ladies man who's the voice of reason and stability in the group? Enter Renzo Shima.\\n\r\nCan't forget the shy, naive, potential love interest for our main hero, enter Shiemi Moriyama.\\n\r\nYou know what we're missing? A fantasy sex object to drool over. Enter Shura Kirigakure\\n\r\nAnd then there's Mephisto Pheles, aka Johann Faust V, the Chairman of True Cross Academy's Japanese branch. A being with supernatural powers that he does NOT use to aid the exorcists in any way. \\n\r\nThe very little these characters have to do and the time spent introducing and exploring them made me wish this series was either longer; because it seems to have a lot more to say. Or wish it was shorter because it doesn't have enough to say. \\n\r\nIt's not that it wasn't entertaining, it's not that they were bad characters. I'm just old enough to demand better anime than this.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist or \"Blue Exorcist\" is actually an amazing show and one of the first anime i have ever watched. However upon rewatching it a agian to ready myself for season 2 iran into a problem a an anime only watcher. More on that later however time to focus on the review.\r\nPlot:\r\n You read it in the summary so unlike other reviews i'm not going to summarize it for you. However i will say that the plot isn't awfully original however they do play around with it quite well. the plot is easy to follow and have fun with but mycomplaint lies with the shows barely above medicore writing.\\n\\n\r\nart & animation:\\n\r\n The art for this show is quite good and looks very bright and at times cheery. At times the backgrounds and settings look beautiful but don't expect these looks to appear often. The animation a little above average at times. the panels flow pretty well and the lip syncing (mouth movements) are done spot on ( for majority of the show). The fight scenes however are for the most part less than steller. The fights can be way too short or just not really exciting to watch. The show barely has any super impressive sakuga moments but the fights (some of them) do there job and can be exciting to watch nearing the middle and towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nmusic/sound\\n\r\nThe sound quality is good and the music does its job but its nothing to write home about. The openings for the show were ok but i wasn't too crazy for them. As for the endings i have about the same opinion as i have for them as i have for the openingd=s except that i think that they are pretty forgetable.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters\\n\r\n The characters in this show were pretty great, cliche or just all around awsome. The main character and the whole cast progress and grow slowly as the series progresses. The characters usually learn from their mistakes (well not all of them i.e Rin for the majority of the show), Also the character interactions between Rin(protangonist) and Suguro (the rival) were pretty funny. However i didn't get attached to any of the other characters except one named Kirigakure Shura who is just the best. Also the villians are pretty cliche and just annoying.\\n\\n\r\nBIG COMPLAINT:\\n\r\n Back onto the problem i had for the show was that for episodes 18-24 they are all filler and many including me had no idea that they were. Due to this when i started season 2 i was extremely confused. However while that annoyance was there i actually really enjoyed those last few episodes they were really fun and exciting to watch. However do bear in mind that these episodes are void in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nconclusion\\n\r\n  In the end Blue Exorcist is a fun average shounen anime that can be easily enjoyed by the average shounen fan but hasn't done anything better than other anime. so if you have run out of the greater shounen anime (my hero academia, Naruto, One piece) or just bored i reccomend Blue Exorcist.\\n",

Some sort of creepy (not necessarily Halloween) vibes that would create an atmosphere that I could get into. For me, it did not do this. The characters, the ones used at least, had overall a pretty good design. They all had different things that allowed them to work together and synchronize after coming to an understanding of each other. The other problems I had with this would be the action, the pacing, and overall how things happen. There were so many times where there were some weird episodesthat had nothing to do with anything that was happening. At the end, it felt like nothing had been accomplished.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite character: Shima Renzo\\n\r\nI liked Shima because he was a laid back guy that could pretty much get along with anyone.

However i got medium dark and not quite as bloody as i would anticipate a demon genre anime.  It was too chill for a satan and demon anime.  Rin was motivated but ultimately came off as a spaz and had to be kept in check by his older brother Yukio.  Comedic aspects yes, would i watch again.  Not really.  A final confrontation that lasted maybe two episodes with some lame ass writing,  I enjoyed it literally up to the end.But it is still something that would be nice for casual watching between shows.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nThe story has a nice, organized, strong structure which allows a good foothold for a nice story to develop off of it. The concept itself is very fascinating, and I think the author did a fantastic job at executing it with a tale like this. It was clear that a lot of research had been made to make sure that information was accurate (i.e. the demons and the Vatican). While the pacing occasionally felt a bit slow, the show was still capable of picking it up with more serious segments. \r\nArt: 7/10 \r\nI was pretty impressed with how the art and animation went downfor this show. While I'm not a HUGE fan of certain character designs, the speed and intensity of the animation was enough for me to leave that bit a little off the hook. What I admire most is that it never felt like A1 Pictures was trying to save money on certain episodes by limiting movement or anything like that: every episode was perfect and spot-on. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nI immensely enjoyed the soundtrack of this show: something which I don't say very often, considering that sound in an anime doesn't always catch my attention easily. The soundtrack, put together by Hiroyuki Sawano (who has also done shows like Kill la Kill, Attack on Titan, and Owari no Seraph), is fun, upbeat, and beautifully composed: not only does it nicely compliment the setting, but it's also great to listen to separately. The soundtrack also feels very diverse, going from funky modern beats to melodic orchestral pieces: there should be a track in it that everyone enjoys. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\r\nOne of my main problems with the show was its supporting characters, and it's not because they weren't creative or didn't have much depth, but because they just weren't very interesting. With a few exceptions, a lot of them felt very bland and stereotypical, and their personalities weren't enough to make me want to latch onto them emotionally. I think it's most likely because their struggles and back stories hardly compare to the struggles of the main characters, so the viewer tends to feel like they have less of a drive to them. And we hardly get to see in detail what those struggles and back stories look like. Meanwhile, Rin and Yukio have a very tragic story, which drowns out the history of the other supporting characters so the viewer focuses more on them. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, my rating for character is generous, because even if they weren't very intriguing, I still found them enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nI would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this show. The funny and tricky situations, along with the colorful cast of characters, gave some good humor to the show. There are good moments to it, especially good heartwarming ones, bits that I won't forget. My attachment to the main characters was what got me through it, and it's definitely worth watching for that reason. My only problem is that the show's certain shtick can get a little old, but overall, it was amusing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\r\nI'd say that to anyone who's interested in action-comedy anime, this show is worth your while! The show has a nice story, with cool animation and a great soundtrack. While the supporting characters could use a bit of an upgrade, they are still fun to watch with the well-written main characters. And as for anyone in which action or comedy isn't exactly their cup of tea, I still recommend that you at least give the 1st episode a watch. \\n",

            "content": "Imagine you\u2019ve lived the last 15 years of your life with your priest foster father at a monastery along with your twin brother. You\u2019ve gone to school, maybe gotten into a few fights, but as far as the world at large is concerned you\u2019re normal. Now imagine that, on what may as well be any other day, you are attacked by a demon, saved by your foster father who turns out to be an Exorcist, and told that you\u2019re the son of satan. And then your foster dad is killed by your real dad. Sweet. For Rin Okumura, all that is an unfortunate reality.\r\nBefore hecan stop to really take stock of what has happened Rin is thrust into a world where demons are a part of everyday life and one of the country\u2019s most prestigious high schools is actually the True Cross Academy for training Exorcists. Oh, and his brother has been going there for years without him knowing. And he\u2019s now Rin\u2019s teacher. Double sweet. Rin vows to grow stronger to take revenge on satan for what he has done, but before he can do anything he needs to learn to get on with his classmates and, y\u2019know, study.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist starts off very strong, throwing both you and Rin into unfamiliar territory before you can stop to ask any questions. Learning about Rin\u2019s heritage, the actual state of the world and the ways of True Cross Academy will very quickly grip you and get you interested in both the characters and plot itself. While the middle of the series is still very entertaining, it sags a little as the writers can\u2019t seem to decide whether they want to advance the plot, develop characters or just randomly muck around. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, every episode is just as good as the last on its own, it\u2019s just that the way they come together to tell the overall story isn\u2019t as well done as it could have been. The ending, while still on par with the rest of the series quality-wise, felt very premature, with little indication that the conclusion of the story was coming up before the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI probably say this too much, but Ao no Exorcist could very easily have been a longer series. As it was, it felt like the writers were rushed into the final arc before they had laid down the groundwork for it (and the manga is still continuing, so there you go). Side characters that were really quite well done weren\u2019t given the attention they deserved, being presented as important but remaining relatively insignificant to the main plot. The variety of abilities they possessed had a lot of potential that was never realized, and their role within True Cross Academy and the True Cross Order of Exorcists could also have been developed further. There\u2019s also a slight problem with consistency in power levels, with Rin simply powering up DBZ-style to tackle any obstacle that comes his way. I was left waiting for a training sequence that never came (well, it was mentioned, but never really explored).\\n\\n\r\nIt may sound like there\u2019s a huge amount the series fails to get right, but the only reason I\u2019ve identified so many faults is because of how much I enjoyed watching the series in the first place. These aren\u2019t problems that need to be fixed, just areas that could have been improved to make the experience even better than it already was. It should say something about the concept itself that it can have so many gaps while still supporting such an engaging tale.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was also of a very high quality; from facial expressions to background scenery, everything is pleasing to look at and the character designs themselves are also excellent. The animation studio can be very proud of their work here.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist, a shounen which has become immensely popular in both anime and manga, loved by many but also disliked/hated by others. A show which started well enough, but soon went downhill quickly due to many plot holes and filler crap.\r\nI'm just going to put this out here right now: the anime version of Ao no Exorcist has filler 2nd half and ending. Yes, the 2nd half is mostly a filler. It does not stick with the manga for the most parts and is therefore punished by it. For those who are looking to watch Ao no Exorcist, I suggest you to watch thefirst half of the show, (about until 16-17 episodes or so) then go read the manga for the rest, especially if you don't want to be disappointed by the filler half. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 6/10\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is interesting enough. Satan, demons, exorcists, and the two separated worlds of Gehenna and Assiah, the concept of this show seems pretty good at first, however, it turns out to be yet another typical shounen, set mostly in a school setting with some flat romance. \\n\r\nThe first half is good enough, mostly keeping with the manga. The first couple of episodes are probably the best episodes of the series, showing the main characters, bits of our main antagonist, and introductions of the True Cross Academy, and both Gehenna and Assiah. It's decent enough, and I was actually enjoying it up to this point (like up to episode 8 or so) However the episodes that follow don't do the same. The 2nd half which I have said before, is mostly a filler arc, which doesn't stay true to the manga, and just makes their own story up which turned out to be, well, horrible. There are just so many plot holes in the anime as a whole, and a rushed ending makes the quick downfall of the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the series comes from the Art/Animation. Although some character designs were lacking in parts, it is still very acceptable. The art is mostly comprised of bright colors, but also feature some darker aspects depending on the scene. I have to say that it complemented the scenes well. The animation is smooth and the characters move well. Overall it is very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7/10\\n\r\nThe composer of the show's soundtrack is Hiroyuki Sawano, who has also composed other stand-out soundtracks for many popular anime like Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, and Kill la Kill. The battle osts are pretty epic, and it fit the scenes well, however, outside of those osts, nothing else stood out. The OP/ED were catchy enough, I personally didn't like it, but maybe you could find them likable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters were good, but didn't have much depth into them. Rin was by far the best character of the series, with bits of calm and cool personality showing through as the show went on. Yukio, although he is the younger brother, he still acts like the older one and is much more mature in situations than the rest of the gang. Finally, Shiemi is a love interest for Rin,   and is one of the few characters who actually show character development in the series. The rest of the characters were too shallow and lacked depth overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 6/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show for some parts. Like I have said already, the first couple of episodes were good and enjoyable. The rest of the episodes suffered from too many plot holes and filler. The actions were decent enough, but ultimately led to nothing in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 5/10\\n\r\nI was let down by the anime. I love the manga series, and when I heard that Ao no Exorcist was going to get a anime, I was very excited. However, it lacked direction, and couldn't stay true to the manga for the most parts. Ao no Exorcist is interesting enough at the first glance, good and enjoyable first couple of episodes, but the rest that followed were a mess. I enjoyed parts of it to be fair, but still disliked the series as a whole. I wouldn't exactly recommend this, but who knows, others could find it enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "Well, I don't know that there's a lot to be said about this anime, considering its age and that it's already pretty widely viewed.\r\nThe story is pretty standard. Nothing too original, and honestly, there weren't very many twists or surprises along the way. That's not really to say that it's boring--don't get me wrong; it was interesting all the way through. There's just a lack of suspense. The main thing that kept me going throughout the series was the charisma of the MC moreso than the plot or anything like that. \r\nThe art is one of my favorite things about this anime. It's all verysmooth and modern and makes it very nice to look at. I also really like the colors and most of the character designs. There are a few moments where if you pause, the art is worth laughing at, but for the most part, the animation is consistent and fun to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound is good. I'm not a big fan of the second opening/ending themes, but as for the soundtrack, it's good. Not really much to say here. \\n\\n\r\nUuh, with characters, honestly, I would have liked to see more development and focus among the side characters. The only one who really go through any kind of dynamic change is  Shiemi, of all characters. Everyone else pretty much stays the same, and the anime never really goes into anyone's backstory, which is also annoying. The one saving grace is that many of the characters are very charismatic. They make me want to know more about them, which is why I kept watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was okay. Like I said, the plot wasn't particularly fascinating, and the characters left a bit to be desired, bu this is by no means a 'boring' anime. It's a good piece of entertainment if you're bored. It's just not amazing, either. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I rate this a 7. Definitely worth the watch, but I don't think I'll be watching this anime again.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist is a pretty decent shounen.\r\nThe story = GOOD\r\nSon of Satan wants to avenge his father by becoming an exorcist and killing Satan.\r\nCharacters = GOOD\r\nThere is a diverse cast of characters. They are Rin's classmates. Each one of them has their own motives and backstories. If you don't like Rin, you can always enjoy the other characters! However, I personally found the character designs to be quite plain.\r\nHumor = PRESENT THROUGHOUT ANIME\r\nThere's humor present throughout the whole series, so it's not one of those super-heavy-and-dramatic animations.\r\nAnimation & OST = PRETTY DAMN AWESOME.\r\nAo No Exorcist has the most badass Opening and Closing themes!\r\n***Consistency =NOT VERY CONSISTENT. THIS IS THE ANIME'S MAIN PROBLEM. THE ANIME STARTS TO LOSE ITS GRACE ONCE IT STRAYS FROM THE MANGA ON EPISODE 16.\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime was pretty damn good. There was character development, lots of action, and a substantial amount of conflicts. The pacing was pretty good and the plot progressed pretty well. I could start to envision this series as one of those good shounen animes with 100+ episodes. \\n\r\nHowever, after episode 16, the anime became a bit boring and cliched. I didn't like how the plot was heading and I started to cringe at some stereotypical-shounen scenes. And by stereotypical shounen, I mean one-hit battles and an unreasonable \"let's be unusually kind and save everyone (even if they don't deserve it) and torture ourselves for the sake of saving others\" type of crap. It annoyed the shit out of me. The fights started to suffer in quality too.\\n\r\nIn other words, the anime started out good but it didn't end that well.\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion: Had the anime followed the manga, it would have been a great series, but I would still suggest watching it anyway because everything else about it is good.",

And I'm pretty sure you'll like it if you like anime with action, demons type stuff in them.\r\nSword fighting, gun slinging, magic, summonings. It's all in this anime though the major action is swords and guns. This anime is what you think, a boy who awakens his demon powers trains to become an exorcist to defeat his father, Satan.\r\nComedy is in every episode. The character designs are good and story is nice.\r\nPower ups come just as you'd expect of a shounen anime.\r\nSo, lastly, I'd say that it's a good animeto watch.

The anime itself was very adventurous and it was also kind of mysterious because of the twins' past, not really knowing  how they were born until the end. Which I thought was very interesting.",

            "content": "If a person out of the \"blue\", no pun intended had asked me which was the better one of two series that revolved around exorcism, would it be Blue Exorcist? or D.Gray-Man? in all honesty, i have to go with the former, as it has a more realistic portrayal towards the side of exorcism itself.\r\nBlue Exorcist is the story of two young men, twin brothers, the older but dumber Rin Okumura and the younger but smarter Yukio Okumura, as they alongside family, friends and allies battle the forces of Satan himself, determined to take over not only Hell but also Earth, as well.\r\nThe series focuseson the relationship between these two brothers who are, as different, as both day and night whilst learning to become exorcists, the primary defense force for Humans against Satan who use religious aspects of all different religions known to the world to help them in their war against the ever invading forces of Hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe major theme of Blue Exorcist itself is about family, of how strong bonds exist between family members, be they blood related or not, such is the case for the Okumura brothers, having been raised by the church all their lives without knowing the true identities of their parents and instead were primarily raised by their foster father, the priest of the church named Shiro Fujimoto.\\n\\n\r\nDue to certain circumstances, Rin, the primary protagonist of the story discovers from Shiro that both he and Yukio are actually the sons of Satan and that Satan needs at least one of them in order to open the gates of Hell to the Human world for Satan himself cannot, being trapped on the other side.\\n\\n\r\nRin unlike Yukio upon reaching maturity had already awakened without him knowing Satan's blood within him, giving Rin the ability to see things that normal Humans cannot and even more so especially, the ability to produce blue colored flames, the signature of Satan.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, Rin is targeted by Satan to be used, as the means of freeing himself from Hell, however, in a desperate attempt to save his son from Satan's evil machinations, Shiro gladly gives up his life to allow Rin to continue living a life of his choosing and not of others.\\n\\n\r\nUpon Shiro's death, the order of exorcists that he belonged to, the True Cross Order find Rin and give him the option of a peaceful death at their hands, for now that Shiro is dead and he was the only one capable of protecting both Rin and Yukio from the order in secret all their lives, now that Rin has awakened to the devil's blood within him, the exorcists have been given strict orders to eliminate him before he becomes a potential threat to the safety of all Humanity...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Rin shocks them, as he remembers that Shiro gave up his life for Rin, wanting to honor the legacy of his father, Rin decides for himself that instead of dying he will instead learn to become a exorcist himself by using the demonic power born within him to destroy Satan, he will learn to become an exorcist one way or another and will take on any that gets in his way, be they demons or exorcists alike...\\n\\n\r\nMephisto Pheles, a close friend of Shiro's and the one in charge of Rin's execution finds the idea of \"a demon killing Satan\" to be amusing, simply just because of this, Mephisto being the only one who knows about Rin from within the order decides to hold off his execution and allow Rin to be inducted into the order, as an exorcist in training, wanting to see how far he will go to prove his determination of vengeance, will he die along the path or will he actually be able to kill Satan? either way, its sure to be amusing...\\n\\n\r\nThus Rin's career and adventure into being an exorcist begins, what will await him remains unknown but either way, he intends to cut through fate itself and  prove his Humanity, by using but denying his demon heritage, Rin intends to avenge Shiro and live up to his legacy, to honor the man that gave Rin what was ultimately needed for him: a choice and a chance to live life on his own terms.\\n\\n\r\nBlue Exorcist is a great series to get into, it may not feature a whole lot of fight sequences but i think just the personalities of the characters alone makes the series enduring, it can be slow paced in some certain areas but it gradually builds up over time, the character of Rin Okumura is especially amusing, as he has a few things notable about him that are different to standard Shonen genre based series protagonists, the character Mephisto Pheles can easily be declared the series' breakout character due to his personality and charm, especially given his particular to blur on whose side he's truly on, an adding point to the success of Mephisto's character goes to his Japanese Seiyu voice actor Hiroshi Kamiya who gives the character a form of swag that makes him all the more likable.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall deserve high points each, Blue Exorcist is a more or less relatively new series but it certainly does have the potential to grow into something bigger then it already is, not much to say besides that other then to definitely give the series a bash, it might end up, as a fan favorite on your list of Manga/Anime series.\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping this Review was helpful.",

            "content": "Ao No Exorcist is a very average anime in my eyes, and one that I think most casuals or newcomers to anime will thoroughly enjoy but when I am afraid that when it comes to people who have already seen a decent amount of anime it will fall into mediocrity and soon be forgotten. \r\nThe characters are rather bland and have very clear-cut personalities, with the main character Rin Okumura being an average teenage guy who tries his best to be a good guy but is lazy and shirks his responsibilities. Rin is one of the most generic looking anime characters that I have everseen, he truly is just a normal black-haired teen who wears normal clothes. His only defining traits appearance-wise are his horns and tail that protrude when he becomes angry. He is also hot-headed and quick to act without thinking. Of course his younger brother Yukio is the responsible type and often does his best to keep Rin's priorities straight. These two personalities clash and provide a decent amount of humour in the show but the roles themself are certainly nothing ground breaking. Rin is also a character whom I feel is meant to be an avatar that the viewer can live out their fantasy through, similar to Kirito from Sword Art Online. Ironically, Rin and Kirito also have the same english VA which may have influenced me thinking of him like that. \\n\r\nSpeaking of voices, the overall english dub is well put together and features veterans of the field such as Johnny Yong Bosch and Kyle Hebert, and since the cast is experienced it makes for an excellent dub. As for the rest of the sound aspects, the music is not very engaging and does not hype up action scenes much or impact serious scenes as much I would like. Additionally the OP/ED's are average but easy to forget. \\n\r\nAction in Ao No Exorcist is few and far between and normally not very entertaining. You will either be watching characters shooting at generic demons, reading bible verses, or ending battles with a single swipe of a sword. This is when battles are shown, as the series frustratingly has action taking place out-of-frame frequently during big moments and instead decides to focus on the spectators' reactions to the fight rather than showing the battle itself. There are many times where it seems like two characters are about to seriously duke it out 1v1, but Ao No Exorcist never successfully capitalises on these fight opportunities. Fight scenes are very short and the animation behind them is far from spectacular.\\n\r\nWhere the series really shines is in it's comedy and slice of life elements, but as funny as the comedic bits are they don't come up quite enough to keep the viewer as engaged as they should be. Almost every episode has a hysterical laugh-out-loud moment, but episodes should have MORE than one moment like that. The series also abandons comedy altogether for some episodes and especially near the end of the series. It almost feels as if this show was supposed to be a long-running shonen because the main character only finds out he has powers right in the beginning of the anime and then must work to properly learn to harness them as the series progresses. But the thing is, hardly any progress seems to be made in this area yet Rin still seems to win most battles with ease.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an average show to kill some time, Ao No Exorcist is a good choice and it should keep you entertained for most of the runtime, but don't expect any lasting impact. There are far better shows with better plot, characters, fight scenes, and takeaways, but Ao No Exorcist is a wonderful show to turn your brain off and enjoy!",

            "content": "Ok... second review here! and I'll be doing Ao no exorcist, exciting and fun as it may be it has one fatal flaw: following shouen cliche's BY THE BOOK.\r\nStory: The story is about rin Okimura, He is basiclly the son of satan and was adopted by a preist who adopted him and his brother, and saved him with his dying breath from satan who tried to darg rin back into hell. Because of this Rin decides to learn the ways of an exorcist to kick satans ass. As exciting as it sounds its much more basic than one would think. As you go through theepisodes you can almost just ask yourself: \"what story device are we gonna use today?\" Eventually the second part kicks in, and knowing the manga only had twenty something chapters at the time, I knew they would have to make up a filler ending, but... really? If you haven't seen the anime, I'll just leave it at that, but if you have, then you know what I'm talking about. Basiclly the result of trying a story device that dosen't mesh well with the environment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: While the story is a bummer almost everything else is emensely enjoyabe. Like art for example, its pretty frikkin good and its awseome when you get to see Rin fight. the one gripe is that they use CGI too much, but they at least did it well enough that id dosn't just stick out from the environment and you can enjoy a shot without seeing some wierd thing on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending themes are ones you're bund to like, I loved the first opening and second ending and while the others aren't my favorites they are pretty good too. the music always fits with the scene their trying to convey and some of the tracks are just mindblowingly awesome *Lit: OST track 7: symponic suite devil third movement exorcist*\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Like I said before, it follows story tropes and cliche's by the book, but if done right, you acctually don't really care. Post episode 19 and beyond, Rin is very likable and you can root for him to fry some demon ass and for him to reach his goal, he's also pretty funny and has one of the best derp faces I've ever seen in a while in anime. Yukio is another story... He has some intresting things going on but thats kind of all his character has, he's the serious type character and when the rest of the cast is more lively you tend to be the odd one out, plus its obvious as crap what they intend to do for his character that the 'intresting' bits about him are kinda drowned out by the fact that you have a clear guess on whats gonna happen. the rest of the cast such as rins classmates and Meifisto and other characters are lively, enjoyable, threating, etc. whatever character trope they try to fill they fill it right. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: cliche as it may be they hype and animation really payed off as I did have a fun expirence watching the episodes each week... up until a certian point but I'm sure you'll get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Cliche'? yes. boring? No. One way or the other you'll have fun watching through the series and seeing all the cliche tropes be played out well.

I like the fact that he is satan's son, I haven't watched another anime with that yet so its a new thing to me. \r\nArt 10/10: The drawings and how the characters look are amazing. I love how everything is drawn and animated. It looks really well thoughout the whole show so far, even in thefighting scenes, which is a plus since other animes don't look good during some fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I love all the music that they chose for the anime. It all flows great together. For the voices they sound great and it is very clear and not low and choppy at any time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: I love all the characters, though some might say the characters aren't original I personally think they are. I love how they made all the characters look and gave them all unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: It was extremely enjoyable for me to watch the anime. I don't have many negative things to say about the anime, well because there isn't any. I am looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes when they are aired.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: A great experiance for anyone. Though the anime idea may not be original I HIGHLY recommend this anime if you enjoy demon's, exorcists, action, suspense and adventure. It has some twists and turns in it as well. Very good anime in my opinion",

The characters were not bad either. The problem with this anime was the rush to get to the ending as well as the ending it self. Endings are a crucial part of an anime and I don't think this anime's ending was good at all. Thisis why I gave this anime a 5/10.",

            "content": "Well Ao No exorcist is an anime  that comes out just as advertised. Its an above average shonnen about the son of Satan.. Who  ironically becomes an exorcist. Its  really just a good show to burn some time. Tough id say its  much better than most shonnens,  its about as good as SAO(1st 15 episode SAO> AO NO EXORCIST>last 16-25) both above average, but falling short of true greatness(IMO). Shall we get on with the review?\r\nStory:8/10 Story was where it was hit the hardest, it had a great base idea. Son of Satan fighting to kill daemons and eventually Satanhimself? Sound pretty epic right? It is for the most part. Yet, epic plot holes are left. I cant rly judge it though I mean it ends on filler and there is probably a season 2 so ya... just because of that it gets a 8/10  for an  above average  shonnen story line.  Satan's back-story episodes are the best in the series(IMO).\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10 Just good id say. They didn't go anywhere crazy with the art direction. No shaft style battles or hidden symbolism. Yet it kept nice flow in fights and had so fluid motion. but it did suffer at one point from sub par CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10 This track is epic. The main battle theme \"exorcist\" has found its way into my heart. It truly gives you the feeling of fighting daemons for the sake of the world.... just epic. Though it did go into the beauty category, these mainly played in the flash backs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 Now i would have given characters average, because that is what the vast majority are.... all the humans, but Shiro Fujimoto are average characters. Yet, its the demons that have the best characters. Namely Satan himself and Mephisto... that clever clever bastard. but besides these 3 the characters are pretty much average... yes even the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10 it was good,  i mean better than most, yet i couldn't call it great or amazing. its just above the norm. All in all Ao No exorcist was the 2nd best shonnen of 2011 (1st being HunterxHunter IMO). Thus i give Ao No exorcist  an 8/10\\n",

            "content": "Right, Blue Exorcist. A world in which there are cute demon boys, where exorcists fight with weapons rather than just recite Bible verses, and telling the story of two brothers with a rift between them.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSurprisingly enough for a shounen series, Blue Exorcist is actually pretty heavily character-driven, so going into too much detail on the story would lead into a character discussion.\r\nRight from the start, the story is pretty trope-y, and it progresses in what you'd call the most logical manner. Twin brothers, sons of Satan, one of whom has demonic powers and the other one who is an exorcist fighting them. Rin, ourmain character who has Satan's powers, decides that he'll become an exorcist to, in his words, \"beat the shit out of Satan.\"\\n\r\nHonestly, if you just watch the first episode and drop the show, you'll probably think that this is super cliched of a premise and not very interesting. However, if you continue, you'll see how the characters are written, and that is where the show truly shines.\\n\r\nDespite A-1 Pictures usually being pretty faithful to the source material, with Blue Exorcist they decided to go off-script and do an anime-original ending. The show basically crashes and burns when that happens, and it's painfully obvious when the show does move into anime-original. It develops plot up the ass, it gets super forced and over the top, and it's impossible to take seriously. Not to mention the characters are out of character and basically destroy the premise of the show. We get to see history on Rin and his brother Yukio's mother, but it's written really ridiculously and is basically a lot of \"Awwww Satan, you're not evil, just lonely\" and \"I LOVE YOU SATAN, AND ALL THE EXORCISTS IN THE WORLD COULDN'T STOP OUR LOVE\" and is just so bad you can't help but laugh. I didn't feel any sort of emotional attachment to these last few episodes, but kept watching in the hopes that it'd redeem itself (it didn't).\\n\r\nIt's such a shame that they did go anime-original, because the plot was doing so well up until that point. So why did they? One of my friends said it was because the arc the manga was on wouldn't have made a very good ending, but honestly, anything would have been a better ending than what they gave us. If they couldn't possibly have avoided anime-original, they should've hired better writers that didn't make cringe-worthy material.\\n\r\nThe story still gets 7/10 though, just because it was doing so well up until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting choice of narrative was having this be focused on Christianity (though the religion itself isn't used much; it's mostly as support for the exorcist scenario), which isn't a common religion in Japan. I think this might be an alternate universe where Christianity is the leading religion in Japan, since all the relevant characters are Christian and the school Rin goes to is basically its own town, and I doubt there's many Christian schools like that in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nBlue Exorcist also has a lot of comedic relief to lighten the mood. Normally in other shows it's ineptly done and can ruin the scene, but I actually found the comedy to be quite funny and not disruptive like I was expecting. It definitely made me laugh out loud a lot, and I think that says something as compared to most other shows.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here. It was good, as expected of A-1. I didn't really notice any problems, but there weren't really any moments that were amazingly impressive. The character animation and the opening and ending sequences were fine, though I have some issues with the second ED sequence since it's mostly stills and textures and the animation is done around the stills as a transitional effect like a PowerPoint.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe openings and endings of this show are really good. The first OP took a little getting used to, but it grew on me. They're overall really catchy songs and fit well with the show.\\n\r\nThe OST of this show is really good as well. It's done by Hiroyuki Sawano, and while I can't say I'm as fond of this soundtrack as I am of Attack on Titan's and Kill la Kill's, it was pretty good still. The soundtrack was ambient noise a lot of the times, with good stuff happening during the battles. There was a large variety in sound too, and I don't really recall hearing the same tracks over and over again, which is always refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub of this show is really good as well. Bryce Papenbrook is perfect as Rin, and the other actors were all doing great work. I haven't seen the Japanese version (except for the first episode a while back), but I'm sure that's really good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThis was easily the strongest point of the show until it all went downhill, but I'll get to that later.\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Blue Exorcist is pretty character-driven for a shounen series, and the characters are really strong. We see a lot of focus on their backstories and motivations, and time is even set aside for the minor characters developing on their own, not necessarily because of Rin or to establish relationships with him.\\n\\n\r\nRin himself is a pretty generic but relatable shounen lead. He's angry a good portion of the time, wants to fight everyone, and has something to prove. He also is a strong believer in doing what's right, and at this point you're probably groaning over how cliched he is. Yet despite his temper, Rin is shown to be surprisingly sensitive and sympathetic to other characters, and is actually just a big softie. Plus, he's a really good cook, and uses his skills to make others feel happy. That's not really a trait you see in many other shounen protagonists. Even as a child, before he knew he was Satan's son, he was shunned by parents and their kids, and called a \"demon child.\" This has a big role in leading to him being compassionate as a teenager. Rin's aggressive toward those that show him animosity, but around his friends, he tries as hard as he can to be kind.\\n\r\nSince he has Satan's powers, he's the embodiment of the creatures exorcists are supposed to fight, and often has trouble keeping his powers under control around his fellow exorcists-in-training. This can lead to some humorous moments with the whole \"I can't let them find out about me\" thing.\\n\r\nRin also has a complicated relationship with his twin brother Yukio. This was another really good choice of character, since siblings in anime are usually either really close or want to kill each other. Yukio finds Rin to blame for some of the stuff that's happened to them, and Rin often loses his temper around Yukio, but the next minute they're laughing and joking together. It's a pretty accurate depiction of real sibling relationships, actually.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yukio, as much as I tried to dislike him for his initial harsh treatment of Rin, I ended up liking him just as much. You can't really blame him for the way he acts sometimes, and he's shown to attempt understanding toward Rin. Like I said, they also display moments of their former closeness on occasion, so it's not all hate.\\n\r\nYukio's also interesting because he too is the son of Satan, but since he was in too poor of health as a baby to handle Satan's powers, he is basically a normal human being. He doesn't face the same discrimination as Rin, which goes to show how much some blue flames and a tail can affect a person's perception.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of interesting characters in this show, so I won't spent time detailing them all, but they are shown to be realistic characters with their own motivations and agendas, and we get backstory on most of them. The surprising depth to these characters really makes you care about them, and it's always exciting to see where they'll go next.\\n\r\nThe other characters include Shiemi, the shy and clumsy girl who despite her timid nature has a strong willpower (though I have issues with the implied love triangle between her and the twins); Ryuuji, who's the tryhard classmate with a bone to pick against Rin; Izumo, the bitchy girl that takes advantage of Shiemi's kindness; Shura, who is basically a copycat of Yoko from Gurren Lagann but who is interesting nonetheless; and many others.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of that changes once the show decides to deviate from the manga. The characters are reduced to their basic tropes and a lot of the depth is lost, and combined with the ludicrous narrative, it does not make for a good recipe. The characters were doing so well before then though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI had a hell of a fun time with the show up until it became, very noticeably, anime-original. It was funny, action-packed, had well-written characters, and there was a lot of depth. As soon as it did deviate from the source material, I didn't enjoy it at all, unless you count that it was laughably bad. Which is why I need to read the manga.\\n\r\nEven despite the cringe-worthy last ten episodes or so, I still powered through the show in four days just because it was initially so addicting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nSo, should you watch Blue Exorcist? I say yes, at least until the anime-original story.\\n\r\nIt's a strong shounen story that's pretty character-driven, and overcomes the flaws of its genre, only to later fall into the trap of \"creative liberties.\"\\n\r\nAnyway, I feel like I haven't stated this enough: Blue Exorcist was really good until that point. I would have given it a 9 or something if it had kept up. Honestly, the only reason it's still as high as an 8 is BECAUSE it was so good until then, and it's a real shame that it had to change.",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist is a quite known show that was very popular, but as many people I think have already told you it went down the hill too fast with too many plot holes. I want to make one thing especially known, and that is the second half of the show which is quite literally a useless filler\r\n(The story 5 out of 10)\r\nThe story had so much promise and I mean that whole-heartedly. It has this premise about Satan, exorcists and the church and this was something I found myself quite interested even though demons and exorcists is not something in anime shows.\r\nWhat caught myinterest was the two separated worlds, but at the same time connected as a mirror. Of course, you may have figured it out by now that I am talking about Gehenna and Assiah. Many shows just use the underworld or Hell as a place where demons live.\\n\r\nOkay back on track. The first half is good and it keeps itself up with the manga and not doing anything very outrageous. The best episodes would have to be the first couple of ones. It shows a bit about the protagonist, the main antagonist, main characters and of course True Cross Academy. I liked the show up to episode 7 and 8 after that; the episodes did not have the same impact on me anymore.\\n\\n\r\nArc number two is just what I would call a filler arc, which does not follow the manga and instead try to come up with a story that is in a nice way to put it horrible! The reason I think this is because of the many plot holes and take this together with a rushed ending and you have a disaster. It could have gotten a higher score if it did not have any fillers, because I feel that a 24 episode anime should never have fillers.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters 6 out of 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great, but most of them did not have the depth. You could compare it to an unpolished diamond and a shiny glass. Most of them were good, but the only ones I think worth mentioning is Rin, Yukio and Shiemi.\\n\\n\r\nRin was a character that would be the one that was very well with a great personality of being calm and cool and at the same time could show a bit of comedy too and that is always good.\\n\\n\r\nYukio was one of the characters I liked very much too. He was kind of the younger genius brother, but at the same time acting as the more mature one among the group of characters. \\n\\n\r\nShiemi was the love interest of Rin and only one among the others ones except Rin and Yukio that got any kind of character development. Most of the other ones were kind shallow. Ryuji was interesting with his backstory but then it was not that kind of interesting anymore.\\n\r\n(Art 8 out of 10)\\n\r\nThe art is good and I will not deny that in any way. Even though several of the characters were kind of lacking when it came to the designs of them it was still good. It was mostly composed of bright colors, but a darker shade in the more serious scenes and when the situation called for it. This is a part they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound 8 out of 10)\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that I loved the openings and the endings too. I was in love with the first opening song and I would love to see it used in the future again in other shows. Hiroyuki Sawano did a very good job with the soundtracks and sound effects and he deserves praise for it.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment is a 6 almost on 7)\\n\\n\r\nI think it was a good show to watch if you are waiting for a new episode coming from another show. Although this is not the problem. My problem is that it lacked directions. I myself love the manga, nothing will change that and my blood boiled with anticipation when I found out that they were going to make an anime out of the manga. Even though it lacked several things, I loved the show.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall 6 out of 10)\\n\\n\r\nIt was interesting and a fine story but it lacked several things, I would have given it a seven out of ten if it had a better story or better characters outside of Shiemi, Yokio and Rin. If they had tried to make the animation better made, it would have been very enjoyable. I will recommend this show to my friends, but only if they do not have time or are bored or if they are looking for to kill some time. The show is a good one, but not if you are looking for some complex story or high quality art that you can appreciate or even deep characters. \\n",

            "content": "At the very beginning of the series, I fell in love with it. The art style, the opening scene and music, all of it worked for me. However, the series seemed to end a bit too... prematurely for my taste.\r\nAo no Exorcist has some good fights and a typical knuckle headed hero (my favorite kind) and the supporting cast isn't that bad either. The whole twins concept was an interesting story element throughout the series, and the fact that the \"younger\" brother had the leash on his older brother was pretty hysterical. Even though Rin was a trouble maker who seemed to do nothing right,I found his redeeming quality of culinary arts very different compared to his exterior attitude.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of a half demon fighting yokai with a giant swords (stop me if that sounds familiar) has been given a bit of a fresh twist on it.The motivation of the main character to do so was something I had yet to see done in any series I've seen (admittedly not many overall) and it's definitely not comparable to Inuyasha; the fanservice is directed way more toward the male audience as a true shounen series. And what fanservice there is really isn't over the top.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as I stated earlier, the reason I harbor any bad feelings toward Ao no Exorcist was how it ended after setting up a perfect introduction to a second season. I know that some anime are just to promote interest in the original manga, but the ending just made my jaw drop and say \"...AND?!?\" It ended on a bright note which works for me- if the story feels resolved and not just yanked away from you to put your imagination to work. No one had come close to reaching their main goals, and the series just felt like a big tease to encourage reading the manga.",

Characters are thoroughly thought out, I liked all the characters but overall, my favorite would have to be Rin's (the main character) brother, Yukio. I enjoyed the anime from start to end and liked how smoothly time progressed. This is a good recommendation for all,even if there are a couple dull moments.",

            "content": "The first thing that I would say on Ao no Exorcist is that the Soundtrack Music is A-list Hollywood quality.  I fell in love with the soundtrack around episode 4, and since then, the music has never ceased to amaze me.  The composer and arranger, Hiroyuki Sawano, has managed to make a soundtrack that varies from tear-jerkingly beautiful to Hans Zimmer-quality Epic.  But, before I bore us all making love with a picture of Mr. Sawano, onto the rest of the story.  \r\nIf only the rest of Ao no Exorcist was as amazing as the music.  The premise is quiteShounen - You`ve got the son of Satan and a talented Twin - the typical rash sibling / calm sibling duo seen in everything from Fullmetal Alchemist to Clannad.  That said, the first few episodes stayed true to the manga, and seemed to be departing from its notably shounen premise.  That said, Ao no Exorcist`s plot, for the majority of the season, seemed quite reasonable, with a good pacing that seemed to suggest an ending similar to the manga and perhaps a sequel.  Yet, after around the 17th episode, things get weird.  Odd characters appear out of nowhere, and seemingly mundane characters return for odd cameos.  By no means is the plot bad - but it has long since lost the coherence of the first 10 episodes.  Instead, the plot has become something of a train wreck - still enjoyable by all means, but rushed and confusing.  The show is nearing its end now, with 22 out of 25 episodes under the belt--and though I look forwards to the ending, I am afraid it will be something that is so clearly cobbled together (As this last arc seems to be) that it will disappoint me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special - it is perfectly competent, and overall, the quality is never bad, but it brings little new to the table.  The characters as well are not deficient in any way, but they are nothing really revolutionary--as in most shounen anime, the focus is clearly more on the plot, which, in this case, does not help Ao no Exorcist`s case.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, I continue to enjoy Ao no Exorcist--but only as a typical shounen anime.  It`s not bad by any means--but it just seems to fall short of the greatness it seemed to suggest in its first half.",

            "content": "This anime is a real \u201eCliche Anime\u201c (I use this term to describe anime shows that are usual examples given by people who don't understand anything about anime ex. Naruto, Death Note, Bleach...).\r\nOne Cliche Anime appeared in 2011 and with a total of 25 episodes it managed to get a rating of 8 on My Anime List.\r\nMay I present...Ae no Exorcist or better known as The Blue Exorcist\r\nPlot and Storyline:\r\nI read a couple of reviews on this anime and all the writers share one taught. This anime is just another shounen anime set in an ordinary school setting. But I don't think so. First ofall, a lot of people mix up the school setting where it would be unusual to have an exorcist class and those where that's not the case. In The Blue Exorcist the school is used just as a facade for the outside world as a cover for the \u201eexorcist education\u201c. I hope you get what I'm trying to say here. This is a very interesting storyline about a boy with demonic powers, his relationship with his brother and interaction between the human world-Assiah and the demon world-Gehenna. \\n\r\nThe story begins 15 years ago when Satan, the god of demons, wants to take over Assiah. For that to work out he needs a human body powerful enough to contain him. For that reason he creates Rin and Yukio, his sons from a human woman. The only thing that didn't come to his mind was : \"What if my sons don't want me? What if they don't become evil as I am?\". Well, Mr.Satan, you should have thought about it earlier. \\n\r\nA good plot that didn't lack in action and background stories that really bring up some emotions.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime really are something. The diversity of the personalities is incomparable. We have The determine class number 1 Kamiki, The lazy yet talented Rin, Konekomaru the cry-baby, The funny Shima, The family's prodigy Yukiro, the little daisy-girl Shiemi etc.\\n\r\nStill, the only character development occurs within Shiemi. She really developes from a naive little girl to a determine fighter and exorcist that despite everything doesn't lose her kindness and will to help others. A sunshine and optimist, round of applause for Shiemi. \\n\r\nHowever, my favorite character stays Rin, and not because he is the main character. I love him because he sometimes reminds me of my self. We both have potential and power but we are just too lazy and it is damn hard to motivate us. But when we actually find something we crave for than we'll gonna make it, no matter what.\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIf I were to rate the animation and the looks of this anime I would definitely give it a 9/10. The characters look awesome, demons look also great, and the screen-diversity, Epic. Special commend goes to the look of the True Cross Academy. It surely is a little extra that makes you remember the story as a whole. \\n\r\nThe only bad thing about this anime is the very end. The end idea was great, but the way it was brought over to the watcher was crappy. Why on Earth are laser-like beams doing in the gate between Assiah and Gehenna? Some of my friends think about it in the same way, I'll leave it to you to discover it.  \\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAe no Exorcist is indeed an anime I strongly recommend. With a low violence level it is suitable even for younger watchers, boys or girls. The anime is for me a 7/10. Minus points to the poor ending and lack of awesome fights. There was action but I definitely excepted more from a sword carrying half-demon. Furthermore I'd like to mention the unfinished love story, not fair at all.\\n\r\nOn the whole, this anime is in fact worth the time. It is another yet different demon story that despite some lacks streams the way into your heart and stays there for some time.",

I watched it when I was a kid and I enjoyed it to the fullest, but since I'm a bit older I can say for an older audience this might not be the show for you. Did I enjoy the show, somewhat yes, but the shows enjoyment level was like a roller coaster for me. The show had it's really fun times, then it had its pretty bland and lame times. The beginning of the show is what made me want to watch it til the end, because that beginning was truly just too epic. Although the beginning was grand,the middle part was alright, and the end was kinda a let down. There were too many convenient factors in the show, which made me question some parts of the show. I also didn't really like the side characters, they were strange and unfitting. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNow the story is pretty cool, it's about a boy who has inherited the powers of Satan by unsheathing a sword which has contained his powers. With his new powers and with his cool new sword, he wishes to defeat Satan and bring piece to Earth. Along side with his powers he trains to be an exorcist, but he must keep his powers hidden so his classmates, so they won't know his relation to the evil ruler of the underworld. This story sounds pretty cool, and the beginning was amazing, but after the whole fireworks display of a opening for a show, the glamour of the show declines as he \"trains\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are alright, they all seem to have no other characteristics besides the ones they were assigned. The angry dude is always angry, the quiet one is always quiet, things like that. Then there are the side characters, the 'comic relief' that this show tried to offer. They aren't funny, and they are more annoying than anything. Then the brother character, he was a little annoying because of how many things they tried to role into one character. They tried a little too hard with him, and not any of the other characters. Overall if you have a favorite character, you'll end up not really liking the other ones as much because their personalities almost never change.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing much here. There were some cool affects here and there, some detail was good, but other than that just standard art styles. The music was bad, except for the first opening song, that song was good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was fun rewatching this show, but I probably wouldn't watch it again. I enjoyed it as a kid so that's the important part, since this show is for kids.\\n\\n\r\nPros; Good first anime, cool story, some nice action scenes\\n\r\nCons; Not for an older audience, convenience in some scenes\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n::SPOILER::\\n\r\nThe end is anticlimactic. It had a weird set up for a never to be season two. Although if you're still wanting more at the end, there is a movie (which if I remember the movie could have been better than the show)",

That scene reminded me of a scene from the TV series Lost, when John Locke in the episode \"Walkabout\", shouts, \"Don't tell me what I can't do!\" close to the end. The two scenes follow a similar structure: redemption+great music. Here is the \"Walkabout scene\": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfKHVdmjzQ . It gives chills, man.\r\nThe buildup is just as great. The beginning was well thought because 1) it showed our main character's normal life and 2) showedwhat tore his life all apart. The main character's goal and reason are also clear. I like the father, I bet he will be iconic in our main character's life.\\n\\n\r\nAt least whoever thought this show up knows what in \"Inciting Incident\" is, because in the anime, that's what the first two episodes is all about, the \"inciting incident\". Each scene is amazing because of its mini climaxes.\\n\\n\r\nThe brother was introduced smoothly, like really smoothly. I didn't notice it until I looked back. And also the father, I didn't realize how deep his character was. But I bet he is still filled with secrets.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes were great, I'll keep on watching. If the rest of the episodes have quality storybuilding like this, it'll be a great series.",

Remember Bon about how will he kick satan's as but he's good for nothing he's weak and does not understand what's really happening. And Konekomaru, he is a coward bald.I really hate him how he reject rin and his baldiness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Good .. I'll say no more, But overall it's Great",

There is also the perfect amount of drama, seriousness and fighting. I can't say this goes for every episode as I have yet to watch more, but if this is how epic the first episode is, I can't see the others failing in any way.\r\nA definite recommendation for anyone who likes supernatural anime's withgreat humour, and great looking main characters.",

I thought the idea was original enough, and there was some interesting concepts. This was the anime that made me interested in classic demonology so I give it a plus in that. However, lazy editing and cliche dialogue ruin what could've been a very good story.\r\nToo much exposition. Like seriously. \r\nArt was mediocre. Nothing more to say.\r\nSound was great! I loved both opening and ending themes, plus Rookiez is Punk'd is an awesome band all together. While I didn't like the anime, I gotta admit thatthe soundtrack was amazing for a shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Good enough I say. Some of them were a bore, and needless romance was... Unneeded. \\n\r\nThe mane character, Okumura Rin, is a decent mane character, but I personally enjoyed the struggles of his brother, Okumura Yukio a bit more. Other characters were good, mediocre at worst.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very mediocre shounen anime with a huge potential. If it gets remade, with new animation, better dialogue and more expansion on the characters and concepts of the universe, I'll give it another watch. Until then, I'll stick with other anime.",

Because of the filler the first half followed the manga very well until episode 17 it started to go full anime only route. Which makes me think if the anime creators where going crazy or not.\r\nI did read the manga up to volume 4 and I can tell the huge difference in the plot from the anime and manga. I am not saying that it is a bad anime the music and visuals are beautifuland amazing to see on you're screen. And you can also read the manga it is amazing compared to...this.\\n\\n\r\nBut that ending was a bit disappointing too I mean how can they defeat the strongest demon in the world with the power of friendship? I mean the anime is okay but I recommend reading the manga then watching this.\\n",

            "content": "Overall not as good as I hoped it to be but still worth the watch. It's very classic shonen. The story was pretty lacklustre in the end and despite having a lot of potential it didn't do anything interesting at all. Characters received very little to no development and were either illogically set in the ideals or annoyingly fickle with little middle ground. The best character in Shiro Fujimoto was unfortunately only in it for about 2 episodes with a few cameos later on too.\r\nThe biggest failure for me though is the motivations for pretty much all the characters in the show. The entire castof protagonists motivations can be boiled down to getting stronger to \"protecting my friends\" / \"get revenge on Satan\". Takara was the most interesting character in this respect because we're still in the dark on him. He has a small but cool scene where he was just watching the fighting and quoting some lines from mythology or something. The way he acts throughout is as if he is far stronger and knows far more than he lets on. Mephisto I think is equally as good, basically acting as the Izaya Orihara of Blue Exorcist. Although far less in the shadows than Takara, its clear there's more to him and what he wants than just playing games with people.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys were even worse though. All the demons just fight or mess with people because hey they're demons it's what they do. Ernst came out of nowhere by suddenly seizing the entire Vatican totally inexplicably and somehow convinced all the exorcists that opening the gate to gehenna was in any way a good idea. Earlier on they even admitted that they had no way of fighting back against Satan which was the whole reason they let Rin stay alive and then they decide to go and sacrifice him to get to Satan. Sure they had the Messiah bomb but it was never shown that they tested it to check it's efficacy and guess what, it ended up doing fuck all. They tried to give Satan something by having his motivations come from Yuri who is this lovable person that's get wrongly persecuted. Which could've worked great by making us understand his side of just trying to bring the two worlds together but then he continues to act like a complete dickhead and attempts destroys the city.\\n\\n\r\nOn to some of the good. It was generally pretty well animated and the fight choreography wasn't too bad but the attacks and power ups did get a little samey. Voice acting gets no complaints and I liked the music during the show overall. The OP and ED were more than skippable though. The character interactions between the students specifically were well done and I got a few laughs throughout. Also the part with Blackie was done well enough to work a tear or two down my face, although that's maybe not saying much considering my disposition to cry rather easily.\\n\\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist gave me the feels from episode one.  It starts off as any conflicted hero show with a tragic beginning but there is something about Rin Okumura's emotions and reactions that really grabbed my attention.  He's a character that knows his weaknesses but powers through them.  Even when others get down on him, he presses forward sometimes through sheer ignorance.  The brother dynamic he has with his twin Yukio is also very interesting.  As a sibling, I think anyone can relate to their emotions of jealously, protection and frustration.\r\nI also appreciated that Rin wasn't simply the strongest character.Every character had their own special strengths.  Rin learned lessons from each person and grew with each interaction.  But these characters also learned from Rin which was great to see so many characters develop in one series.\\n\r\nThe animation was magical.  As the devil's son, one would think Rin would transform into a hideous demon or something resembling an over sexualized vampire.  I'm happy of the direction of the animation of all the characters even the overly busty and scantly clad Shura Kirigakure (one bad ass teacher that apologizes to no one).\\n\r\nI can't stop rewatching this anime when I'm in need of an action fix.  I look forward to more adventures with Rin and his friends.\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nBlue Exorcist has a soft spot with me, mainly because it was the second anime I watched fully, which was about almost 2 years ago now. I wanted to rewatch this when the second season came out, but I got sidetracked by other things and I thought I'll rewatch it now when I had time. Even after 2 years it's still a great anime.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story concentrates on Rin Okumura, a half human and half demon who turns out to be the son of Satan, along with his brother Yukio he trains at True Cross Academy to become an Exorcist to kick Satan'sass.\\n\r\nThe story is really simple, boy/girl has an unnatural power and they train to use this power for a certain goal aka kicking Satan's ass, but what I really love about the story is how progressive it is. It goes at a very decent pace with Rin discovering his powers and then learning how to use them along with learning the ways of an Exorcist with his other classmates, while also keeping his Demon side a secret.\\n\r\nThe first half of the series is pretty slow, but each of the episodes were really fun to watch as we see Rin and the others develop as Exorcists and characters, which is what I like since most series that have a large cast of characters usually have the supporting characters in the background, yet Blue Exorcist tries to make sure most of the characters get a chance to shine.\\n\r\nThe second half of the series is where the situation gets a lot more serious, episodes 13-17 are the episodes that still connect with the manga (I'll get to that in a minute). These bunch of episodes were really well done as we see Rin and the others have a camping trip mission that shows how well they can work together, but also a huge plot point happens where Rin finally exposes his demon powers to the others.\\n\r\nEpisodes 18-25 are episodes where the series diverges from the manga and usually this ends up being a very bad move for most anime's \"cough\" Tokyo Ghoul \"cough\", but Blue Exorcist manages to make it work in some way. We see Rin having to gain the trust of his friends once more as they now see him for what he truly is and some of Rins friends are truly tested with how they feel about him.\\n\r\nThe final episodes have Yukio dragged into a plot by the Vatican where they are planning to wipe the Demons off the planet and launch a missile to destroy Hell. Rin ends up being used for this and Yukio breaks into a rage that manages to bring Satan through and for a final confrontation this was pretty good, not brilliant, but still good and the series ended in a satisfying way. The only reason why I won't give the story a 10 despite it being really fun and entertaining, the diversion from the manga does hurt it a little and even if it was a good diversion it's not something to be praised.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in this show are absolutely great, despite a huge number of characters each one manages to shine in their own way that makes them very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nRin Okumura is honestly my favourite male character in anime, you can hate me, but he's awesome. Rin is quite different from you're usual Shounen protagonist, true he has the normal loud scream and can be pretty damn angry like most Shounen MC's, however he's actually more restrictive with his anger than I originally realised and he can be a very funny and clumsy guy mostly, making him an instantly likeable character. He also isn't overpowered when using his demon powers, he can easily beat small fry demons, but he can have a hard time taking them down and most of the time needs help from the others, but when he loses control you better stay away from him. He's also immensely protective of his friends wanting to make sure he uses his powers for good and to make sure he would never harm anyone close to him, plus he's a great cook too.\\n\r\nYukio Okumura is Rin's twin brother and despite being younger than Rin he is actually more mature than him and is a teacher at the academy. He's strict and formal, yet he does this to protect his students and Rin, he can be a badass when it comes to fighting with dual wielding pistols, which is always fun to see. He and Rin always butt heads with each other because they can never come to an agreement, but they never lost sight of their bond as brothers.\\n\r\nShiemi Moriyama is the female MC and is a gardener of her mothers shop and a tamer at the academy. Shiemi is absolutely adorable, despite being clumsy and not being used to a social life, she's always a positive person and wants to make sure everyone is safe and happy including Rin, despite not much of a fighter she's very handy in battle when it comes to supporting the team as a medic with her extensive knowledge of herbs. Her fun personality just makes her a constant ray of sunshine whenever you see her.\\n\r\nRyuuji or Bon, Renzou and Konekomaru are a trio of friends, who lost their families to Satan's blue flames. Bon has a bumpy relationship with Rin as he usually gets annoyed at his lack of concentration in class, but the two do form a close relationship over time. Renzou is you're typical ladies man and has a fear of bugs, but he is willing to help his friends whenever he can and Konekomaru is the brainy guy who offers a lot of knowledge on Demons and their powers. These guys work really well together and even though their relationship with Rin was tested when they found out he was a demon, they eventually stood by his side once more in the end.\\n\r\nIzumo Kamiki is your typical Tsundere, however despite being a bit of a bit*h she isn't entirely dislikeable and has some moments showing her soft side making her seem like she isn't always a pain in the ass.\\n\r\nShura and Mephisto are the two higher up characters at the academy, Shura used to be a student under Rin and Yukio's adopted father and is a friggin badass with a sword, even though she does look like a discount Yoko from Gurren Lagann. She can be a really fun character though. Mephisto is the headmaster of the academy and is actually another son of Satan, he is a very random guy. His excessive clothes and personality make him a really funny guy, yet he also has a scheming side and even though he's training Rin to be a weapon against Satan, I have this sneaking suspicion that isn't the true case here.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle in this anime was actually pretty good, the academy looks really incredible with the different types of buildings all put together like a weird puzzle. I also really like how detailed each of the characters are showing how diverse the cast is and that they each stand out in making them recognisable whenever you see them, especially Mephisto and Shura. Plus the design of the Demons and monsters look pretty cool as well. \\n\r\nThe only downside to this is the CGI, luckily the CGI wasn't that much of a concentration in the entirety of the series and was only used in small snippets and luckily wasn't used for the demons and monsters, but the gate to hell looked pretty damn bad I'm going to admit that and really stops the artstyle from getting a 10.\\n\r\nI also liked the uniforms, weapons and powers the Exorcists used, it looked really awesome and showed how powerful of an organisation they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat Blue Exorcist did really well was the op's, I liked both the first and second op's they had a badass beat to them and really fitted with the image of Rin's demon powers. The ed's is a different story, the first ed was actually pretty good and I liked how it traversed the academy with the characters dancing to the music, but the second one was pretty meh, I skipped it after listening to it the first time and never bothered with it afterwards.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was definitely good, it had a great mixture when it came to action moments and made the scenes feel really intense.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nAs Action comes this had some pretty damn good action and it was nicely spaced out in the series, it wasn't a constant thing and had some episodes concentrate more on comedy than action. It was always fun seeing the characters kicking ass against Demons and finding ways of defeating them, since there are many different types of demons that require different ways of defeating them.\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show was really good, it was always fun seeing Rin getting into clumsy situations and mocking his brother from time to time and his clumsiness was also a good source of laughs too.\\n\r\nThere's also a little bit of a romance plot there too, although it's more of a love triangle between Rin, Shiemi and Yukio. However this isn't really that big in the whole series and only touches on it quite rarely, but whenever it does it can be cute with the scenes that have Rin and Shiemi together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very fun and entertaining series and will always be a nostalgic anime for me, since it was the second one I watched fully and had a huge cast of characters to make it such an enjoyable anime to watch.",

            "content": "I was knitting while watching the second half of this show. Which was on subs by the way. I was hardly paying attention, thats the only way I got through this. \r\nIts an understatement that I was disappointed I didn\u2019t like this more. To be honest, it\u2019s not about the popularity of the show, as if the hype ruined expectations, but because of the main character himself. \r\nI\u2019ll explain. \r\nRin and Yukio are twin brothers, and the sons of Satan. Alright, already interested. \r\nRin is rebellious but also sweet and sensitive to others\u2019 plights. BOOM, I love his clashing personality already. I\u2019m sold everyone, letshop on the bandwagon. Yukio is the opposite, serious and sticks to the rules. The trope is there, all you need is the execution and these brothers should carry the show on their shoulders right? \\n\\n\r\nNo, no it did not happen. \\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like Yukio until the last episode. He was mysterious, condescending, jealous, uptight, overprotective in a twisted way and the show decided to justify him AT THE VERY END. In a way, this approach to his character was smart as it creates tension for the upcoming plot, but if I just dislike him and he takes up half of the screen time as a main character, it\u2019s just not going to sell.\\n\\n\r\nNow Rin. I. Love. Rin. I loved him so much I was imagining him being in any other show, without a brother, and different circumstances to make for a better experience. There were so many ways to sympathize and adore him, even though he falls into the \u201cwoe is me, tragic backstory but super powerful and will save the world\u201d trope. Which, again makes me realize why they wanted that twin brother, to add an interesting conversation of this contrasting sibling with similar circumstances but different approach. Them being siblings makes this show different and great, I must say, but god dammit it was tedious execution.((AT THE END OF THE SHOW, I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT. HONESTLY. BUT I DISLIKED ALL THE EPISODES LEADING TO IT THAT I HAVE TO GIVE A LOWER REVIEW. IM SORRY))\\n\\n\r\nSo Yukio didn\u2019t ruin the whole show by himself, I would never drop a show based on one character unless that character had all the screen time. This show has many side characters\u2014 mainly being the classmates in their special demon hunting school. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the classmates were fine. They had cute moments, funny dialogue on occasion, and fine backstories. Their designs were nice, but I didn\u2019t click with any of them. Perhaps, as students, I never felt the dire tension of their arcs? For Rin, it always felt dire because of his growing power and being in an unfamiliar situation where he has to make friends, without revealing his nature, and actually attempts to study. For the students, their pasts with demons are haunting them to move become hunters but the way its presented in the show feels abstract. I forgot a lot of the first half of the show, I apologize, but it shows I didn\u2019t find the impact of their tragic past a reason to sympathize with them\u2014 which is more of a fault with the storyboarding of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAs individual episodes go, as I\u2019ve made clear, any that focused purely on Rin\u2019s arc, I enjoyed. There are episodes focused on the classmates and I blanked out on those, not finding them too important. Also once you get to the end of the series, the only reason those character are focused on is to create a familial bond to boost the positive outlook on the main characters. I didn\u2019t need entire episodes for that; it doesn\u2019t take long to like a character. If you need an entire episode to like a character, they need to be a complicated piece of work that makes you think, \u201cthey're worth it\u201d at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe Father, Satan, and the mom are also characters I liked but its not like they were shown often. A damn shame. \\n\\n\r\nOther random comments, the placement of the music in the show was nice and the action scenes were very fun to watch. I remember watching a scene that blasted the music during a certain camera angle and thought, \u201cI would think this is so badass, if I didn\u2019t care so little.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t expect to write this so sorry if the review is all over the place, but I had to air my frustrations. \\n\\n\r\nGive me the character Rin, make an entire new show around him, and I\u2019ll eat it up. Honestly, he was the only reason I finished it.",

            "content": "Since I've read the manga I fell for it, so, if it wasn't for the manga, I don't know if this anime would deserve more than an 8. Besides, I don't know if someone that did not read the manga is capable to talk about the characters or story, cause they get much more interesting after the anime's end. I can't say if it is a \"classical Shounen\" cause I did not like the other Shounens I've watched and always thought they were boring and repetitive, which makes me unable to compare (respect it, I just have no patience to see 400 to 600 episodesof a story that focus on fights and have lots of fillers and others useless chapters that are forgotten as the story goes on). If someday I watch Naruto, that looks really nice, I can think about Ao no Exorcist being cliche or not.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7 of 10:\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist is the first anime I've saw that focus on exorcists, but that's not important. The autor somewhat mixed real life and its beliefs (Vaticano, Illuminati) and her fiction on the story, and some of this fiction is also inspired in real life beliefs (Satan) what I thought that was very interesting. And Gehenna and Assiah, the both worlds presents in the story, are not names picked up from nowhere. Gehenna is a small valley in Jerusalem which is the Jewish and Christian analogue of hell, and Assiah is the region where the Ofanim rule and where they promote the hearing of prayers, support human endeavor, and combat evil. Even if I'm the only stupid that didn't notice it in the same second, I got really excited with the idea of using something like that in the story, cause it somewhat make it looks like the story could really be true (I don't think it is but... you got it). Ao no Exorcist is a lot more complex than it looks like. Actually, I just didn't gave it a 10 because I know that exists better storys. But, if it's like that, why did I gave a 7? That's cause, after half of the anime they changed completely the course of the story and it became shit. I wouldn't recommend this anime from the half on, but they are now making an second season that ignores the invented half of the first season and follow correctly the manga, which deserves a 9 in the plot. So, if you ever watch Ao no Exorcist, stop at the 15 episode and jump for the second season. The story is also really funny (if you don't laugh at chapter 65 in the manga it has something wrong with you).\\n\\n\r\nArt 7 of 10:\\n\r\nJust like the story, the art of the anime is worst than the art of the manga, but that's cause the animation wasn't really well made. You can notice that they sometimes use some artifacts to hide the bad animation but that doesn't work, and its not really fluid or consistent, but not so bad that you can't stand it. Is possible to ignore the bad art (which isn't exactly terrible, its enjoyable and have its moments) and it keeps being better than lots of other Shounen, whose animation really collaborate for me to not want to see the anime. But this so-so quality doesn't get worse in the battle scenes. Actually, I think it gets better. In the manga, what piss of sometimes is that the artist can't always finish drawing in time and lots of pages get an art obviously incomplete, but I think that just happen 2 or 3 times, and in a manga with almost  90 chapters that's not really much. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8 of 10:\\n\r\nI didn't disliked the voice of the characters. Actually, I liked them very much, mostly Rin's voice, that I think it really suited him. Even the characters that have accent can dub very well and the voice doesn't piss me off like in some animes, where I really want to turn the sound off. But the anime lose points in the openings and endings, that aren't very interesting and give a wish to jump them and just go to the story. I usually don't pay attention to the background music, but when they are bad I usually notice. Since I didn't noticed anything strange or boring about the anime sounds I think they were at least acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10 of 10:\\n\r\nI just have fallen in love with basically all of the characters. Though you can't notice in the anime only, in the manga they get really complex. Sometimes you don't know if the character is a hero or a villain, they not always make the right decisions and that make you simpatize with them. I'm not gonna tell how that happens, but some characters that really surprise you with time are Izumo, Shima (MY FUCKING GOD, this guy really surprised me! You will know why if you read the manga) and, unexpectedly, Shiemi (yeah, she's more strong than she looks like). Ryuuji take a little more time, but he surprises you too. You will never understand Mephisto and, until now, I don't know if Yukio is a nice guy or if he's gonna surprise me and become a bad guy. Every time I look at him I imagine him becoming a villain. I think the strong point of Ao no Exorcist is how all the characters learn more about themselves and become better with time, not only in power but psychologically talking as well. In the most part of the animes I watched the characters were always good since the beginning and just were misunderstood. The coolest part is that not always they become better, some of them become worst as well, like they discover a new part of themselves and, even if that means betray they friends, give up their pride or stand up to they parents/responsibles, they're gonna make it in favor to do what they want to do. The relationship between the brothers (Yukio and Rin) is really interesting as well. Yukio envy the charisma of Rin, the way he inherited the father's flames, got protected by everyone and was treated as someone special, but Rin envy the way Yukio is strong and intelligent, got the chance to train side by side with Shiro and saw him show his power. The most cliche about the characters is Shiemi's stupid kindness and Rin's stupid optimism, but with time they get more complex and interesting and, if you wanna know, I wouldn't change Rin's personality never in my life, he's just too cute, I wanted to bite him and hug him 'till he begs for air. His smile is just perfect as well. And I think his ability of cooking is really creative.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 of 10: \\n\r\nWhat can I say? I couldn't sleep because I wanted to get done watching first. When I started the manga it was almost impossible for me to stop and I got surprised all the time. I know that not everybody is gonna like Ao no Exorcist, but I have to at least make my part and recommend it for you. But I recommend specially de manga and, if you are the type that just watch anime you probably won't notice all the perfection I described here. But if you already saw the anime, don't worry, that won't get in the way if you want to try the manga. Actually, I think is nice to compare the both. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 of 10: \\n\r\nAnime:  (7 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 10) / 5 = 8.4\\n\r\nManga: (9 + 8 + ? + 10 + 10) / 4 = 9.25",

            "content": "This review contains spoiler! \r\nStory 6/10:\r\nAo no Exorcist indeed deserves its popularity. It has the potential to continue its quality. However, the story remained very one dimentional.\r\nDemons in this anime portray a very interesting role, taking on both the  part of traditional images of demons and gods. The idea of depicting demons as ancient forms with a curious mind is a very good idea. They needn't to be sympathized with, nor understood. In some way, they lack complex thinking, but are more powerful than humans. This make them decide very easily rights and wrongs as though their first experience in assiah. Those whose actionhasn't been denied by humans continues to help and protect humans, the others turn \"evil\" and take revenge on humans.\\n\r\nThis way of representing mythical power and forms is in some way very accurate. As Rin said in the end, humans have to hear the voices of these demons. Demons are not a kind destined to be hated or loved. The point of their appearance on earth is to integrate in Assiah and be accepted by humans. \\n\r\nNonetheless, this anime failed to display the one thing it is suppose show: make them listen to eachother. Throughout the entire show, there is not a moment where one message is successfully passed on. The people are either yelling, being stubborn, too lazy to explain, or successful in solving the problem by shouting a few short sentences which missed a whole lot of informations. In the end, right after Rin said his sentence (the one above), he took out a sword and is ready to knock the demon unconscious. The most irritating part is the false message passed around the main family. Yuri's (Rin and Yukio's mother) message to Satan is misunderstood. When she said she wanted a world with demons and humans, she meant an integration, not a destruction-filled takeover. Satan's (Rin and Yukio's biological father) message to his sons is misunderstood. He wanted to complete the world their mother wished, not distroy Assiah. Yukio, receiving the memessage did not care about it's contents. He and his brother Rin then slashed the gate of Gehenna and shouted to their father: we don't care about your reason, we just care about our situation.\\n\r\nYes, so much for listening. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt a tiny bit rushed. There are less dramatical pauses than other animes. Although it is not a huge problem once you get used to it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show really is something to look forward to, but is flawed with communication problems, making it - fair(6).\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe art is quite unique, and captivating. The characters do not have giraffe necks and googly eyes. The movements are fluid and the color fits very well with the theme.\\n\\n\r\nSounds 8/10:\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are very good. Their voices really matched the characters, or their coices brought the characters to life. The background music, however, doesn't fit sometimes. The hype is way to high sometimes for certain scenes. It's a relief that it only happens once in a while.\\n\r\nThe opening and endings are all great. The production team chose them well.\\n\r\nAll together, the sound is very good(8).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10:\\n\r\nCommunication problem, disability, makes reader fustrated\\n\r\nAs pointed out before, the characters are reluctant to listen to eachother. There are a lot of shouting consisting of short sentences, which is then followed by silence or a loud (also short) response, or useless happy talks. When the problem is magically solved without real exchange between the characters, it is just frustrating. This really makes one wonder if they have communication disabilities.\\n\r\nIf not for this big dent in their design, the characters are quite likable. I hope the sequel improves on this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven though I have just written an (perhaps in some viewers' eyes unfair and) harsh review. The show is still enjoyable to those interested in this genre. It is not the top, but it is certainly not the bottom. It's a good anime that needs to improve a bit on it's writing.",

This anime is one of the reasons why tropes got to be so common; everything about it just works.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is typical; take a common element but add just enough unique to make it cool (in this case it is a demon possessed exorcist does special magic cram school). It does all of the following tropes very well: slow played story that builds until the final episode climax, character dies to promote the \"vengeance\" arc, main enemy ismisunderstood but still evil, MC is not likely initially but everyone grows to like him over time, the POWER OF FRIENDSHIP COMPELS YOU, there are subtle hints of romance but nothing comes to fruition, and of course the final and best trope: MC powers up at all the right times to always be able to save the day. That said, it does them all excellently and truly builds a straight forward but solid story with a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThings look good and the fights are done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nGood. Nothing out of the ordinary but the opening song is pretty badass.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where the story shines. The following tropes appear and are all done well: Tsundere girl, strong but kind of air head girl, girl with funny local accent that is translated \"a lil like dis don't ya know\", useless group member who does nothing, mysterious group member you never quite learn about, scared group member who turns on MC because of jealousy, rival for MC who can't stand to be beat by him and hates that he excels without much effort, girl with big boobs who kicks ass, brother who is jealous and holds some internal resentment, \"good\" character who turns out to be secretly evil, \"evil\" character who turns out to be secretly good, did I mention THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP COMPELS YOU!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. I watched it consistently during most of my free time until I finished it. All of the elements come together well to form a solid experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a solid shounen with a neat concept look no further. There is also a movie I am yet to see and it turns out as of a few days ago a new season is being released in 2017, so something to look forward to!",

            "content": "Blue Exorcist is focused on Rin Okamura, a teenage boy who is a half-demon born between his human mother and the demon Satan. With the death of his adoptive father, Rin seeks to become an exorcist to slay his father and any demons that threaten humanity.\r\nAt a glance, Blue Exorcist doesn't really break any new ground for a shounen series and it certainly shows with its premise. An action-loving young boy outcast from others due to differences in his origins seeking to prove his worth through hard work and perseverance has been hammered out a good deal with a number of other similar titles likeNaruto and Black Clover. The characters found within the series are also nothing groundbreaking either as many sport character types you may have come across in one form or another from other anime titles as well. The plot is also nothing spectacular with a school devoted to training exorcists and some \"demon of the day\" episodes or arcs have something similar found in other anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the series seems to have a good sense of what it is and chooses to just go along what it offers up. It offers a solid amount of world-building to introduce the major elements of its series involving exorcists and demons without being too focused on its action. The characters, in spite of their archetypes, get a good deal of dimension to show there is more to them and are rather likeable as the series doesn't exaggerate their character types to obnoxious levels as titles like Naruto often got in the annoying habit of. The plot of the series juggles the mundane days of Rin's interactions with the student body of True Cross Academy, while dispatching any demonic threats without revealing his demon origins to others. While the first half of the series sticks with this storytelling approach, there are some engaging developments for the show's middle section that test Rin's bonds with his classmates and other exorcists start to view Rin as a possible threat. It also doesn't hurt that the series is nicely animated sporting character designs with a good amount of detail, vivid scenery shots, and fluid battle scenes that play out.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does gradually slip up toward its final episodes. As the manga this series was still ongoing (and still is as of this review), the show's creators winded up creating anime-only original plot developments that explore how Satan and Rin's mother birthed our lead character and a grand finale that attempts to tie up loose ends with the conflict between demons and human exorcists. However, this still left the series open-ended with the conflict still ongoing. Matter of fact, the later plot developments of this series were totally disregarded for its later sequel, Blue Exorcist: Kyoto Saga.\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing groundbreaking, Blue Exorcist still makes for solid entertainment with its world exploration and focus on Rin dealing with his demon origins while bonding with the teenage exorcists of Blue Cross Academy. In spite of its anime-original developments towards its second half, I would still say it is at least worth a single viewing for fantasy-adventure anime fans to check out.",

            "content": "I'm dropping this anime so this is just a short review, mostly for me, so that I can memorialize my thoughts. Maybe I will continue watching this someday, but I don't think that will be the case. \r\nI'm 11 episodes in and, although I won't pretend to be an expert on the show, around 4 hours of a good show should provide something to give the audience a reason to continue watching. This show just didn't do it for me. \r\nThe show has a lot of things that are reasonable in a vacuum, but just don't make sense in the context of the show. Basically,in every aspect of the show, there is no element which answers \"Is this a show I should continue watching?\" positively. I'll run it down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very episodic. There's nothing wrong with that generally, it works to great effect in tons of shows. However, it is absolutely non-traditional for the genre. A lot of mediocre adventure/action/angst anime are held together solely by the promise of a climactic plot structure. ANE may have that in the end, but I can't see any sign of it. There are certainly signals that -something- is happening in the background, but I'm halfway through the series and I don't really have a sense of what that is at all. \\n\\n\r\nGood episodic series succeed because they execute well within each episode. That means they must have something that entertains the audience. But it doesn't. More on that later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nOK. The art isn't bad at all. A 7 at worst. It is certainly stylistically uninspired and the character design isn't super engaging, but generally, everything is well-drawn. Even the CGI is done pretty decently. However, since it is uninspired, the art won't be the reason you watch it. This is the anime review zone. You're not going to watch an anime 'because it looks like anime'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't bad in a vacuum. The tracks are actually stylistically sort of neat. However, they don't make any sense in the context of the show. Nothing else about this show is stylistically inspired or gives a hint that these are the sorts of tracks that should be playing. Often times the tracks just evoke the improper emotional response for the situation as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also annoying. All lines seem forced and angsty. It's not natural. I can't blame sound entirely for that though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are bad. No exceptions. The crux of the problem is just in how they act. Forget the backstory. Really, there are only 2 notable states for the main group of characters, super angsty or hyper-emotional. It's not realistic at all. There is no character I can think of that has any positive, relatable traits. It seems that way because, whenever the characters are not in this state, they fail at imitating normal human behavior. Nearly all attempts at humor fail. There is never and subtlety or semblance of delicacy with how the series handles human interactions. Everyone takes their turns for their lines and the all feel so forced. Nobody has anything interesting to say, ever. Don't watch this show if you care about characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nObviously, so far there is nothing worth enjoying. It could have bad animation or sound and be worse, but whatever. Something that can normally save these types of series would be good action. ANE have simply OK action, and it isn't happening often enough. It isn't enough to make you want to watch. \\n\\n\r\nJust to reiterate, each of these things alone is not good enough for you to want to watch the show: art, world building, sound, characters, plot, action, humor. What else could a series like this have to offer?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\n4 seems like the appropriate number, but my experience with the show thus far has been mostly negative, and MAL calls 4 decent. A 3 at worst. If somebody talks me into watching the whole show for whatever reason, I could continue. But this is where I end for now.",

            "content": "***** SPOILER FREE *****\r\nIn order for an anime to be successful in my eyes, it has to meet three criteria:\r\n1) Compelling Story\r\n2) Strong Character Development\r\n3) High Overall Entertainment Factor\r\nAn anime should be created in the order of 1-3. Skipping around will leave other criteria lacking. Once all three of these points have been met, an anime will leave the viewer satisfied and fulfilled for spending eight hours of their life in front of a computer screen. \r\nAo no Exorcist fails at all three of these points.\r\n--- Story (2/10) ---\r\nThe synopsis for this anime is written at the top of this screen. What I am writinghere is very brief. Rin Okumura and Yukio Okumura are the spawns (sons) of Satan, but only Rin has awakened his demonic powers. This alone was what sold me.When I watched the first episode, I was immediately hooked and was curious as to how the story would unfold. It's a shame that episode 1 was the only good episode in the entire show. When a story unfolds, a crucial element is the problem the characters are tasked with solving. Rin is faced with the task of defeating Satan (for reasons explained in episodes 1 and 2), the only problem is his lack of control over his power and his unbelievable stupidity. If a character is faced with such a daunting obstacle, the story has to keep a decently fast pace in order to show the development of the main character. The pace for Ao no Exorcist is UNGODLY slow. Why should Rin go to a school for exorcists when he has no skill in exorcism? Why didn't he learn to control his powers since episode 2 instead of waiting until the climax? Why was Mephisto (a demon) not overseeing the development of Rin if he was his godfather? Why is Rin soooo stupid? I get that ignorance from the main character is comical and serves an overall purpose, but Rin's IQ is less than 50 and pisses off the viewer more than entertaining the viewer. There are so many unanswered questions that make you wonder why certain plot lines were even explored. If a plot line is exposed, it better add to the depth of the story, otherwise it is a waste of time to introduce it. Ao no Exorcist leads the viewer away from the main path onto so many irrelevant bunny trails that it leaves you stranded in the middle of a forest wondering \"What am I supposed to get out of this anime?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Character Development (2/10) ---\\n\\n\r\nRin Okumara and Yukio Okumura are introduced as the lead characters, but the anime makes it especially clear that Rin is the MAIN character right off the bat. If the production team decided on Rin as the main character, then it would make sense that Rin should get the spotlight at the end of the show... right? Apparently, such a strain of thought is illogical, but hey, what do I know? I'm just here to criticize their failure.  \\n\\n\r\nShiro Fujimoto is the guardian for Rin and Yukio. He is probably the one character that served his purpose effectively. Without giving too much away, his life was what character development should have been. The viewer learns about Fujimoto through a handful of flashbacks that were scattered far and thin. My only criticism is that these flashbacks should have told more of his background due to the fact that he is a pivotal character in the story.\\n\\n\r\nShiemi Moriyama is Rin's crush, although his affections seem to fade.. Why? Who knows. She is one character that is very entertaining and shows the best development in the entire show. From shy and timid to outstanding and vocal about her opinions, she was truly the only character that was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nRyuji Suguro, as well as some others, are Rin's classmates. My only quibble is that if a character has a foil, the foil should develop as fast or faster than the main character. Suguro is introduced as the foil to Rin, but it looks like the production team decided not to waste their time with him and transferred the role of foil to someone else. Make up your minds people!\\n\\n\r\nShura Kirigakure is an upper class exorcist that \"trains\" Rin. The word train is used very loosely as the only role she serves in this show is for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nMephisto Pheles is one of the most enigmatic characters in the entire show. His motives are kept hidden from the viewer... for the entire show! Seriously, if you're going to introduce such an amazing character, at least have the courtesy to do him justice. It's such a shame that an incredible potential to better the story line is lost entirely. \\n\\n\r\nKuro and Ukobach are two very cute characters (one being a talking cat, and the other a cooking imp). Too bad they were introduced and left to rot. The lack of attention to these characters annoys me to no end.The production team randomly gave, Kuro, the giant cat, the ability to fly in the middle of the last fight scene so as to allow the good guys to win. Why??    \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\n\\n\r\nSATAN is probably my favorite character in the entire show. You never see Satan, you only hear his voice. The voice of Satan is phenomenal. Saying anything more about him delves into spoiler territory. All I can say is that Satan is done justice. It is truly remarkable how characters that have less that 30 min of screen time tend to have the highest character development. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Art (7/10) ---\\n\r\nThe art design was decent. The transformation of Rin into a demon is very stereotypical, especially with the elf-ears, and doesn't provide the \"awe\" factor. I would expect some more thoughtful creations. The various demons that the characters encounter are somewhat creative. Nii was a smaller version of Cacturne. I don't understand how art can be so difficult to incorporate into a story. If the production team lacks art creativity, then the story should revolve around that aspect. It's like trying to make a science-fiction film with the budget of a romcom. It just won't work. Either increase your budget, or stop with those high aspirations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Sound Production (9/10) ---\\n\r\nThe only reason this category got a 9 instead of a 10 is because I absolutely loathe the voicing of Rin Okumura in the english dub. It's the epitome of annoyance. Besides that, the sound production quality is exceptional. Hiroyuki Sawano is a musical genius. Absolutely brilliant background score. I loved it so much, I purchased the entire soundtrack. The first opening was catchy with the jazzy intro, but the second opening definitely stole the spotlight. Both endings were beautiful. It's a shame that such wonderful accompaniment is given to an undeserving show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- The Final Verdict ---\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist is an anime that had an excellent premise for a game changing show. There were so many instances where deep, thought provoking, philosophical themes could have been explored but where left to catch dust instead. The overall pace was pitifully slow. There were many times that I wanted to quite watching, but my OCD for leaving a show unfinished is what helped me get through it. An unnecessary amount of comic relief was used in areas of the story that were fine without it. I might have completely missed the point, but what I saw was a disgraceful excuse for an anime. Due to the PG-13 rating, I judge that this show was meant for children. If that's the case, efforts to include dark, spiritual content should be avoided entirely. If an anime decides to explore grim themes, it should fully commit, not make a half-assed attempt at a godforsaken excuse for entertainment. I really see no reason to recommend watching this show. If you are an audiophile, I recommend listening to the entire background score. Otherwise, only watch Ao no Exorcist for the sake of adding another anime to your list. \\n\\n\\n",

In fact, given the material it's based on (well, for the most part), it absolutely should have been good. The problem is twofold: almost comically poor English voice acting and a terrible ending to the story. While it is certainly understandable to have a somewhat sub-par ending when, as in the case of Ao no Exorcist, the anime gets ahead of the manga from witch it is based, but the butchery that was committed in this case is frightening. Worth watching (in SUBS!!), but acolossal disappointment for those who follow the manga.",

The first is the world in which the humans live, Assiah. The other is the world of demons, Gehenna. Ordinarily, travel between the two, and indeed any kind of contact between the two, is impossible. However the demons can pass over intothis world by possessing anything that exist within it. Satan ,the god of demons, wanted to be in Assiah. But there's one thing that he doesn't have, and that's a substance in the human world that is powerful enough to contain him! For that purpose he created Rin & Yukio, his sons from a human woman, but will his sons agree to his plans?\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nRin & Yukio, Satan's twin sons, ending up being raised by an exorcist. Eventually, satan tried to possess their human father and caused him to die. Now, will Rin and Yukio end up in being Satan's vassal? Or will they kick Satan's ass?\\n\\n\r\nThe story turned out to be more of school setting-based. Rin became a student and Yukio became a teacher. Though they're twins of the same age, Yukio is pretty much more matured than her older brother. The plot itself is very contradictory. Rin and Yukio are being trained as an exorcist despite being demon themselves. But that makes the story interesting, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nRin being a pain in the ass but being a hero either way; Yukio being more matured than Rin and good enough to look over his big bro. Both of them were great. Though they are the total opposite of each other, that makes their bond and relationship stronger.\\n\\n\r\nThough some of the scenes were cliche, it is great for a shounen genre anime. Also, you'll really love the twists: Expect the unexpected! \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about the art is that it is really well-drawn, not shabby.Their looks compliments the action scenes. The effect when their battling and the surroundings were well-drawn as well. Thumbs up! The colors were good, every detail was great. In fact, it was just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor in this anime is good, I wasn't bored. The action scenes will keep you watching. It can get excited all throughout. I was like \"what will happen next?!\" \"why did that happen oh gawd\" \"next episode!!!\" No jokes. This anime is amazing for an entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist, a heart pumping, mind thrilling anime. Makes you wanting for more.",

This review will be pretty short because I can't say too much about it.\r\nStory(6/10)\r\nThe story is pretty decent, though far from original. It has the typical shounen concept with a young boy with potential works to overcome some all-mighty enemy. The part that makes it interesting is what some of the characters bring into the world. That, and it has demons and exorcists, which is kind of a nice theme to follow.\r\nArt(6/10)\r\nI'm not really sure why, but I found the animation to be somewhat sub-par. The art itself was decent other than afew thinks that looked really odd, like some character design. It was all fine, and it didn't distract me from the story or anything, but the show could have benefited to have some more time put into the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10)\\n\r\nTh sound was good, but nothing memorable. That is all I have to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\r\nOverall, the characters were pretty solid. My main complaint is that half of them were utterly useless in the plot.  Many of the characters simply added nothing to the plot, or they just did nothing that impacted the world. Other than that, there was a decent amount of backstory and a number of characters that had some interesting goals and motives, which is always nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7/10)\\n\r\nI would say it is certainly entertaining. There weren't many moments where I was bored to death, but at the same time, I ever really moved to the edge of my seat. It kept me watching, and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, o no Exorcist is a pretty good show. I is FAR from anything special by any means, but it is worth your time. If you have nothing better on you watch list, this will be a good use of your time. I recommend this to anyone who likes shounen, demons, or cool action. If you are looking for something special, this isn't where you will find it.",

            "content": "Ao No Exorcist. Wow. Where do I even begin? \r\nA long while ago, I discovered this anime through a blog I was reading, and decided to give it a go. I got to episode 7 of the anime, I think, but I got a bit bored of it by that point. At the time, I kind of limited myself to strictly non-shounen animes because I basically found the general idea of them to be unrealistic and crap. But, oh, how wrong I was. A few months later I started watching again, and got to about episode 10 before deciding to buy the DVDs from eBay.(I got an incredible deal, by the way.) It was worth the wait, I tell you.\\n\r\nOne thing that especially drew me in to Ao No Exorcist is the art. I love how clean and bright the art is in this anime- it's one of the nicest and sharpest I've seen thus far. Very easy viewing on the eyes.\\n\r\nNext, the voice actors. This is the first anime I've watched that only has the option of watching in Japanese with English subtitles, so I was a bit jubious from lack of experience. But the voices were fantastic, all fitted the characters imensly. My favourite is probably Yukio or Mephisto- their voice actors did such a good job. And Rin, naturally. Oh yes, Bon and Shima were awesome as well. \\n\r\nStory line! The slightly important part, might I add. (I'll try not to spoil anything.) Wow, just wow. The story line is, excuse my French, fucking amazing. Maybe I only think so because I've never watched a shounen before this one, but honestly. Even though I at first got bored, that never happened again. I was completely captivated by the storyline and characters, and I spent two whole evenings doing nothing but watching the episodes I had left on DVD. Slightly anti-social... I got so emotionally attatched to Rin and Yukio, that whilst watching the last episode I cried. Quite a bit, embarassingly enough. I assure you that you will not feel that you have wasted time by watching the series.\\n\r\nLastly, sound/music. I absolutely fell in love with the first opening: Core Pride by UVERworld. I know most of the words too, which considering I don't speak Japanese is quite sad. When I found out there was a full length version of the song on the bonus DVD, I was a tad excited. The ending, firstly by 2pm, was very good as well. Found myself singing along everytime. (The dance the characters did to the song was hilarious, as well.) The second OP and ED was good, but not as enjoyable, to me anyway. Although I did listen to the 'Wired Life' song a lot. The soundtrack used throughout the anime was wonderful, to be completely honest. All the music seemed to fit in very well for the scenes that were taking place.\\n\r\nI'd better finish this here and not waste anymore of your time. My final verdict is a 9/10. Can't really fault it on much. I definitly recommend this to anyone, no matter what your taste in anime is. (Unless you perhaps are into Shoujo...) I assure you that you will enjoy this amazing anime based off of the works of Katou Kazue. \\n\r\n-Mia",

Yeah yeah, here's the whole demon fighting thing with a Japanese twist, but adding the whole \"son of Satan fighting his dad\" thing is pretty darn awesome, if you ask me. The only thing I really didn't like is that the story of the anime deviates from the manga, which \r\nI think, personally, is better (as many people say about a lot of anime). Fillers were typical fillers (I know, right? In a 25 ep anime!!!).  \r\nArt: I actually really like the art style,it may not be too unique, but I love the designs for the demons, especially. There's just something about it I can't put my finger on... Kinda whimsical, I guess? \\n\\n\r\nSound: Pretty good soundtrack, there are a few tracks like \"U and Cloud\" I have gone out of my way to listen to on Youtube. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters have pretty good development, that said, though, the manga goes WAAAY more into depth (it's amazing). Makes sense, it's only 25 eps long, and they probably originally intended to make more than one season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime, fight scenes were pretty good, unique. The protagonist, Rin, is really likeable and funny. \\n\\n\r\nWorth a watch?: Yup!!!",

            "content": "I watched this anime in July and I'm now re-watching it, when I first heard about the anime I was a bit worried that it would be really heavy, dark and evil but it wasn't that bad. It is very emotional and dramatic and has a feminine touch( for example, the gay head master mephisto) (not a typical \"shouen\" anime)   A lot of the reviews say this anime is terrible but it's great anime!!\r\nStory:\r\nI began to watch the anime and loved it from the very first episode!!\r\nGood characters and plot development, I really enjoyed meeting all the characters in the anime.\r\nEveryone says thestoryline was slow and boring but I think you kind if need  some time to work out the characters and the plot .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nLoved all the characters, especially rin, he's such a funny character and made me laugh throughout each episode, I also like amaimon for his randomness and his childish side ( and of course for his awesome clothing!!) I would have liked more development with the characters as I couldn't really connect with their strong characteristics as there were no backstories.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art, amazing characters and brilliant designs ( such as amaimons clothing and rins awesome flames!! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c)\\n\r\nI thought the art was modern and clean, great action scenes!\\n\\n\r\n Sound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth openings and endings were great; really enjoyed listening to them, I really like the mixture of English and Japanese I thought they worked great together.\\n\\n\r\nI some how see this anime being like frozen because  rin and yukios relationship within the anime develops from distant to close. \\n\r\nyukio has to help control rins demonic powers but rin seems to shut himself out and pretend like he doesn't have his powers. ( like elsa)\\n\r\nAlso yukio was very isolated as a child ( like Anna) from seeing demons and being bullied at school. Rin also has a talking companion kuro ( like Olaf) which he acts like a guardian. Then by the end of the anime rin realises that he needs help from others to control his powers especially yukio ( like the ending of frozen)and it makes them stronger . \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime, it made me laugh and surprised at moments and it's all over great anime, I would highly recommend watching it; hope this helps.",

            "content": "So, a show about somebody going after Satan and the person who wants vengeance happens to be his son? Well, of course this idea isn\u2019t new but it\u2019s something.\r\nHumans live in the world of Assiah, demons in Gehenna. The two dimensions are not meant to interfere with each other, but demons still possess creatures in Assiah in spite of this. The humans who can fight these demons are known as exorcists. Rin Okumura is a boy who bears the curse of being Satan's illegitimate son. His foster father sacrificed himself to save him from demons. To avenge his foster father's death as well as toprove himself, Rin decides to follow the path of an exorcist.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s just not original which most people have been saying about this show, that is the same type of shounen series that all have seen before but does it mean that it\u2019s terrible? Maybe to some, but it\u2019s not about them. The story may have been done before but it did entertain me as it goes around.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show does have a bit of religious tone and I am not a religious guy at all but it didn\u2019t get too overbearingly religious as it\u2019s also more like Hellboy in a way but let\u2019s not get carried away.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, there is very cookie-cutter, run-of-the-mill characters in the show like Rin, who wants to overcome his chances of beating Satan but while training he\u2019s all brawn and little brains, would charge into an attack without knowing a strategy but Rin can be a likable character and goofy in a good way into later episodes albeit he has to keep his secret hidden from mostly everyone. Yukio, Rin\u2019s brother, does get more interesting as the show goes along as he never jokes or bullshit around about his studies of being an exorcist and I do like the relationship between Rin & Yukio as brothers as it wasn\u2019t too feely-sappy but it wasn\u2019t angsty as most people make it out to be. Two other interesting characters in the show are Mephisto Pheles, the Chairman of the True Cross Academy and he\u2019s always bring his eccentric personality whenever he is on screen & Shiro Fujimoto, the foster father of Rin & Yukio and a priest at the Southern Cross Monastery and while this character was killed off in the second episode, he does appear in flashback sessions of the show that gets us to know him as a character. Other characters like Shiemi Moriyama, Izumo Kamiki, Ryuji Suguro, Renzo Shima, & Konekomaru Miwa are okay as well but they happen to be very stereotypical and run-of-the-mill character tropes like the forced romantic interest, tsundere, the rival kid who would turn to be a friend later on, the playboy & the smart kid, respectively and there\u2019s Shura Kirigakure, an Upper First Class exorcist under the guidance of Shiro and she is mostly the fan service character of the show and honestly, it needed that.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, A-1 Pictures, the offshoot animation production company of Aniplex, did want most shounen shows can\u2019t do well and that is make great fighting scenes in the animation and visuals itself. The art style is very much like Soul Eater in terms of the designs, especially the True Cross Academy outlook. The music was a bit okay with the first opening sequence \"Core Pride\" by UVERworld, that grew into me and the same can be said for the second OP \"In My World\" by ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D, but I liked the first theme more. For the ending themes, as much as the first ED \"Take Off\" by 2PM didn\u2019t fit, I actually liked it (I don\u2019t know why but I do) and the second ED \"Wired Life\" by Meisa Kuroki was more fitting with the tone of the show. The background music is very orchestral sounding in all the right places and it was remarkably decent.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Aniplex/Bang Zoom! Dub that debuted on Neon Alley, when it was announced that Bryce Papenbrook and Johnny Yong Bosch would portray the main characters, I initially thought Bosch would be Rin but I\u2019m glad he was Yukio as Bosch in a reformed character like him would be better suited and not be type casted as much and Papenbrook was good as the character of Rin; Sam Riegel was excellent as Mephisto, Kirk Thornton as Shiro excelled at being a good father figure and character and as for Christine Marie Cabanos as Shiemi, while I dig her voice, it sometime becomes too panicky in a non-panicky situation. Kira Buckland as Izumo nailed it with the character\u2019s bitchiness intact, Wendee Lee as Shura remind me a lot of Faye Valentine\u2026..well, mostly in the sound of her voice and the way she dresses and Stephanie Sheh as a demon cat? That\u2019s an automatic win for me.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Now this show isn\u2019t groundbreaking or new, the execution was handled pretty well in my opinion. It\u2019s not the best that can be offered in this genre but compared to stuff like Naruto & Bleach, this is a good choice but I will say that you should probably watch Soul Eater but I would recommend this series to you, too.\\n",

            "content": "The anime itself is pretty old, but I thought I'd review it now, according to today's standards. As you may or may not have noticed, people either love the anime or hate it. I personally liked it, but I'll try to be as objective as possible.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nNeedless to say, the story was something unique. The way it openly talked about religion and Satan amazed me, as a person that's not very convinced with the whole thing. It had great potential and I believe it used it to make a great story. I know a lot of people would drop it from the second episode, theywould freak out and say \"what is this satanic bullshit?\". But I don't regret watching it, the story was overall great with not a lot of plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was okay. It wasn't anything special that I haven't seen before, but what made it up for it were the fight scenes, hence the 7/10. It was obvious that it was well made and that it took a while to draw. The reason it has a 7 is because it never stood out to me, I had to come here and think about what score I'll give it. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I only put a 5/10 is because the sound was extremely mediocre and average. I don't even remember one soundtrack, and I finished rewatching it a month ago. It was nothing special, but worse than the art. If we're talking about the openings, they weren't my favorites but they weren't bad either. Just neutral.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though mediocre as they can get, the characters were surprisingly good. The recklessness of Rin and the discipline of Yukon balanced each other. Of course, until the other characters came it. I was afraid that it was going to get bad after so many characters came in, but it was the complete opposite. Some characters I loved and some other I hated, but that created a balanced character panel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally adored the anime. It had its flaws but it was an amazing experience for me. I enjoyed it a lot, more than I have enjoyed any other anime. I think it's because it contains humor, fantasy, action and some failed mystery. There's not something to hate about Ao no Exorcist. I wish there were more anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThat's the math. 7/10. Overall, it's an anime worth watching but not worth dying for. I know you must be confused, since I just said it was amazing, but that's just my opinion. I know other people won't like it like I did, but it was a good anime, either way.\\n\\n",

As fate would have it the two of them are the offspring of Satan himself, thus they must learn how to wield their power and use is for goodinstead of following the demonic foot-steps of their dad. \\n\\n\r\nIn order to master their skills and learn how to use their power for good Rin and Yukio are shipped off to an exoricst school ran by none other than Mephistopheles. \\n\\n\r\nAlong his way Rin meets fascinating fellow students who each - as usually is in anime and manga - have their own stories to tell and reasons that keep them motivated at perfecting their exorcist skills. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the beautiful animation to the killer soundtrack, Ao no Exorcist is a great anime, not to mention that it does have some very unexpected (sort of) plot twists. Keep in mind that with this little jem not everything is what it seems.  \\n\\n",

More so than anything else though, it doesn't fall to cliches unlike other anime.\r\nIt's nice that something that seemed unoriginal could become it's own entity.  The only thing that feels like it's missing is villain motivation. The villain isn't all that present and is more talked about, not seen.

            "content": "Ao no Exorcist is very biblical, it involves exorcists who fight against demons. The biggest demon of them all is of course Satan and the story revolves around his sons, Rin and Yukio Okumura. Rin seems to cause trouble everywhere he goes and lacks ambition while Yukio is more responsible and unlike Rin, knows the existence of demons and exorcist and has trained to become an exorcist since he was 7. Rin discovers that he has Satan's demonic powers and with the help of Mephisto Pheles, attends True Cross Academy with Yukio in order to become an exorcist and fight his father, Satan. \r\nThe storyis pretty fast paced, which I do like, it doesn't linger on certain conflicts over multiple episodes and plot points throughout the series do end up mattering in the end. There are some holes and unanswered questions but nothing that can't be answered in the next season. The action is exciting to watch as Rin can't use his sword or else he will expose his demonic power to everyone. Though when he does use his sword, nothing can stop him. The blue flames look pretty damn cool too. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are very entertaining, the comedy is really fun to watch when character clash with each other. I can't say I really disliked any of the characters in the series, as they were all really enjoyable to watch, except maybe the kid with the sock puppet, I don't know what his deal is and his mysteriousness intrigues me. Shiemi is definitely my favorite character though, Rin is a close second.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a series about exorcists, demons and it involves a lot of biblical references. The series doesn't take itself too seriously and by no means does it make fun of church and religion. It is a very entertaining and interesting anime and I really enjoyed myself. Action, comedy and supernatural demonic beings.\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\r\n-Shiemi, she's sweet and caring and I can relate to her in more ways than one. Plus she summons the most adorably badass green creatures.\\n\r\n-Blue flames, this might just be because its my favorite shade of blue but whatever.\\n\r\n-Rin and Yukio, their personalities compliment each other in a way that I can only compare to Edward and Alphonse.\\n\r\n-I'm not a religious person but when the characters use biblical verses to fight demons, it gave me chills\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\r\n-When Rin uses his demonic power, he has long, pointed ears and sharp fangs, when he's normal, you still see the smaller yet still pointed ears and sharp fangs and nobody seems to notice or care.\\n\r\n-Mephisto Pheles, not as person, I just still don't know what his motives really are and I don't know what to think of him.\\n\r\n-If Satan exists, does that mean God does too? I don't know but if he did, he didn't do anything the whole series.",

The story is good and starts great, the idea of the anime is intriguing, the main character development is ok, but i felt the story could've gone more far with more detail. What i'm trying to say is that the story takes some necessary plot twists, but it takes them too soon. And it also introduces new characters throughout the story that don't get the development they deserve. With all that being said the end of the series getsa bit predictable, and it feels like it ended roughly and very soon. Nontheless its a good anime and you'll enjoy watching it, i'm certain of it, just don't expect a great one cause this ain't one.",

Incorporating all of the elements that make anime so expressive of human thought, this show not only has a solid plot, but an entertaining animation style with excellent development, even in the lonesome filler episodes. \r\nThe main character has very similar qualities to the infamous Naruto, taking the risk of leaving the anime in the hands of a boisterous and obnoxious character to carry the show. Yet the series excels at focusing on a number of other characters as well, creating a well-rounded selection of individuals to captivate watchers into a shounen supernatural. \r\nThecreative labour put into each character is one of the show's more notable qualities, making it difficult not to grow attached to the individuals that spark your preference in terms of personality. \\n\r\nIn terms of scripting, the simple-minded comedy makes it a casual watch, although moments are carefully placed throughout the arcs to grapple your emotions to heights of anger and sadness as well.\\n\r\nSlightly relevant in addition, is that the English dub is not a horrible job, which is a common complaint in revoiced animes. Although the English voices don't quite capture the charm of the original voiceover, I hold this show as one of my personal favorites with it's simple charisma and amusing story.",

            "content": "So, I have been dying to write a review and flex my writing muscles, so that I can find a good way to make up for not having English class (Which I sorely miss), and what better way to do it than by writing a review of Blue Exorcist.\r\nStory - 5 - Now the story, if you read about it already, it looks pretty genuine. It would've helped if the protagonist's father's name was NOT Satan, and could've been Ifrit (Which, mind you, also has a demonic background and sounds way more badass), because that's what struck me a lot. OH LORD, our hero isthe spawn of SATAN. Let's throw in a bat so we can shoe-horn in an Ace Ventura joke.\\n\r\nBEGONE! WINGED SPAWN OF SATAN!!!! - Never gets old. :-))\\n\r\nOkay, let's give it the benefit of the doubt that, Satan is not OUR Satan, but that does not change how generic and predictable the plot is. No, SERIOUSLY, IF I gave you the spoilers, you won't be surprised. TRUST ME! I mean the series was SO forgettable, that I only remember the important plot lines and forgot the fillers. OH YES, there's fillers, but it's only for one episode yet it serves no purpose to further the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7 - Now I have to admit, the artwork is pretty good. The school looks breath-taking and the character designs, while some awkward, is pretty good. Heck! Why don't I enroll into True Cross Academy and learn how to summon Ifrit, OR #@$*!&% BAHAMUT! I mean, the classroom looks pretty well drawn. And never has a Principal's office looked so good. And good lord, THE BLUE FLAMES, they looked so gorgeous, yet so dangerous, That I want one of these for my screensavers. PERIOD!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 - The openings are #@$*!&% awesome. Not kidding, it has to be one of the most awesome OPs I've ever heard. If only the series stayed true to that. As for the OST, well, the series was so forgettable that even the OST is forgotten!!\\n\r\nAs for the Anime Voices, I watched it in dub, and I have to give the crew some credit, they did it pretty well, especially with Johny Yong Bosch voice acting as Rin's brother, Yukio. And Rin's voice actor did a pretty good jod of capturing the spirit of a young, confident, hard-headed (is that even a word?) protagonist, that you can't help but love the guy. Everyone else, especially Bon's voice actor, did a pretty good job. Can't judge the subs, but I can tell that the subbed works for some scenes in the anime than the dubs, especially in the summoning sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6 -  Now let's get to, what may be the first time I have seen good characters get bogged down by a weak story. Rin makes for a pretty badass protagonist, who looked is down upon society. Yukio..........umm, he's a good brother, so there's that. And everyone else is genuinely, hmm how do I say this, basically riddled in anime tropes, except for Bon, even HE is not safe. The story and the characters are so cliched, that you can play 'Anime Trope Bingo'! \\n\r\n(1st Prize - A body pillow of your favourite Waifu/Husbando / An illegal copy of that one episode of your favourite anime that isn't released yet!\\n\r\nLast Prize - THIS ANIME >:-(()\\n\r\nThe character lacks substance, hence they are less memorable. Even with their own character arc, NOTHING can save them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4 - Guys, It's basically a poor man's Soul Eater. You can tell by just looking at it. And like I said, FORGETTABLE.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6 - The anime had great potential, but tripped harder than a school girl falling on a guy, with no pants on! (Who would forget THAT?!?!). In my opinion, GO WATCH SOUL EATER!!!! It's considered one of the best Shounen anime to hit the screen and has excellent art direction and OST, and the opening is helluva lot better, since the tone match so well with the show. This...is a sluggish train wreck. You sit down and the ride looks pretty pleasant, but by the time you realize it, BOOM! You are now suffering a slow and painful death, and you're begging someone would clobber you with an Asuka body pillow and then smother you to death, and what are your chances of encountering THAT. It's a bad way to go.\\n\r\nBut at least the OP is badass!",

            "content": "I had heard many good things about this anime in the past. The cover of both the anime and the manga looks good and interesting, and so do the characters.\r\nMy expectations for AnE were very high, honestly. I was excited to watch it, and the first two episodes or so were enjoyable, but as soon as they made it obvious that it was going to be school-setted it was a bit of a turn off for me. Do not get me wrong, as a shoujo lover I obviously enjoy school-setted animes where the protagonists met and fall in love, etc etc, but since we're talkingabout Shounen anime, I expected the fighting scenes to happen in different, more interesting places, I expected the plot to develop much more. Also, there were way too many episodes that looked like fillers, which was also a turn off for me.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering that the first season has 25 episodes, the manga sold well in Japan (because that's how it works), which made me believe, after watching few episodes, that maybe the main characters would have a really good development and we'd get to see, for example, Izumi evelop gradually from being the typical tsundere rather than only seeing her \"change\" when she is afraid or in a stressful situation.\\n\r\nShiemi had some growth. She was also a little bit of a stereotype, the male main character's love interest that likes flowers and eventually gets the power of healing. Still, her personality was nice and she was not as weak as other character's with her role in other anime's. The \"love triangle\" between her and the Okumura brothers was weird, and did not help the already confusing plot at all.\\n\r\nI enjoyed Bon's character, because he was coherent, which was something that lacked the plot as well.\\n\r\nShima was obviously the comic relief which was okay, the show did have a nice touch of humor to it.\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Koneko seemed to be that character that you just care for a lot because he's so tiny and afraid of everything. I did feel that way about him in the beginning, but after that he was just annoying for a while.\\n\r\nOh, I almost forgot about the obvious disposable character due to her \"boring\" looks (compared to the main characters) that I'm still not sure why she was a thing, Noriko. That girl had \"I'm not a main character, don't worry\" written all over her.\\n\\n\r\nI may be critisizing the show alot, but that's only because it really gives us high hopes until the first two episodes or so. Even so, I did enjoy it, Rin was a very lovable (yet, typical) lead and Shirou also proved to be lead-material. The ending was not that good, but the backstory of Satan and Yuri was surprisingly refreshing and sweet.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the first opening and the first ending, the second ones weren't as good. Very nice art style and, overall, an enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "The absolute dominant reason that Blue Exorcist sticks out amongst other anime is because it succinctly captures all the core aspects of a good show in around 25 episodes. It deserves a watch (not to mention that it is also on Netflix). The overall anime is solid - no question about that. Blue Exorcist ties together lots of unique elements into a neat story: religion, magic, ostracized youth, etc. The show is almost like a combination of Naruto and \u2026 Harry Potter. If that sounds really intriguing\u2014good! Then this show is probably for you. \r\nOne element that stood out to me in particular is brotherlylove - especially how far can one go to protect those they hold dear. A lot of anime try and tackle this question, and many do quite a great job. However, what this anime does especially well is demonstrate the blinding effect that brotherly love can have (for context, the main two characters are twin brothers). \\n\\n\r\nI cannot wait to watch the next saga to this anime, which (if you did not already know) is currently airing after a few years hiatus.",

            "content": "\"Ao no Exorcist\" is a fun anime with nice graphics.\r\nThe series is set in a world where exorcists and hell have a sort of secret struggle going on in which they try to hinder Satan and his followers from conquering the Earth. Everything is centered on the story of two sons of Satan, one of whom inherits its power. It is grown and protected by an old exorcist like a normal human being who, having become a boy, decides to attend school for exorcists in order to better understand the power he inherited from his father, to use it against demons.\r\nEverything is at the limitof the banal, of the little studied and sought after. The way in which themes like friendship and family are dealt with and their importance; the pivotal incipit of the \"anonymous boy who, mysteriously, turns out to be endowed with super-powers and therefore unique\"; the characterization of secondary characters, studied in the maximum span of an episode and then returned to almost complete anonymity; the structure of the events: everything in the norm, everything \"already seen\", nothing particularly singular, original, memorable. Even the final episode, a theatrical triumph of theatricality, while being particular, knows a little predictable, taken for granted.\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist follows the story of two twins, born of a human woman and Satan, especially of Rin who shows immediately that he has the blue flames of Satan. This world is divided into two, the world of human Assiah, and the world of the demons Gehenna. Satan, the lord of all demons, will do nothing but try to take possession of Assiah and to do so he will try to recover something he has created, namely Rin. His son, however, will not accept his father and will try to do his own thing by becoming an Exorcist.\\n\r\nThe technical section came out well, the characters are well characterized but the only thing that doesn't suit me is the all too obvious plot. Fortunately, there are shots that make us forget what is taken in this anime. Ao no Exorcist is a good product that I really liked very much but not crazy. I still recommend seeing it.\\n\r\nIn conclusion I can not help but recommend \"Ao No Exorcist\", first of all because it is a very special anime and has very original ideas, secondly because it was made almost flawlessly (perfection does not exist).",

The thing I remember most about the show is the pretty blue flames, it was quite a nice-looking show with a solid plot. Though the characters themselves could be better and less bi-polar and no I actually don\u2019t mean the main characters \u201cultra -evil-over powered\u201d mode. I mean all the other characters and their constant we are all friends\u2026except when we aren\u2019t!  Lastly while I remember this show as being pretty good, I have no desire to see the second season and I\u2019m not entirely sure why.Maybe its because I feel like the show ended in a good way or maybe I was just kinda done with it not too sure \u2026oh well. \\n",

            "content": "This anime may not be to the liking of many of you, in fact you might find it cliched and had already been done before. But I found this anime when I was just new to watching animes, and let me tell you- it still stands as my third favorite out of the seventy five I have completed. \r\nHere's why:\r\n(I will try to avoid spoilers the best I can!)\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nYes, this may be your average story with your average main character, who sucks at school and has some daddy issues early on. But, I started this when I myself was just transitioning to middle school,and this couldn't have made Rin anymore relatable! Minus the whole... what else he's got going on, hah. But struggling with school work, I gotta side with Rin on that. The story towards the end sort of goes off and doesn't really stick with the manga (I've heard they took a bit of a step back in the second season to remedy that. I haven't gotten around to really watching it yet though, so I'm not sure how reliable that info is.) It's such a different story though, Rin being the Son of Satan. He's the guy you would expect to be bad, but he isn't bad. Yet, everyone starts off not liking him, thinking he's evil or weird. Throughout the story, you can't help but root for him and for people to open their eyes! (Though, some might have a reason to be a bit afraid of Rin, but you'll know why if you watch the show!)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love how squish-able their faces look, or how cute Rin is with his hair up in a hair clip, or just how adorable the cast can be in general. The zoomed out shots of the place they live in, every time I see them, it leaves me breathless. One day I hope to be able to draw the scenery like how they do.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Subbed version is enjoyable. The Dubbed version is enjoyable. (That's a win win right there!) I loved every single OST in this show, and still listen to them to this day!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the lowest I'll score on this series. There is some to be desired for the characters. They do take time to flesh them all out, but sometimes the way a character reacts to something... can really get under your skin. Like those moments in Romance animes where the main girl is literally TWELVE FEET away from the main guy, and all she has to do is GO HAND HIM A THING but instead she stands there, cries because of something tragic happening, then runs away. (I'm looking at YOU, Kimi ni Todoke. Still love the series though =3=). It just, they all have those dumb blonde moments you REALLY wish they wouldn't have. Because you know in your heart, what they're about to attempt is the absolute worst choice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI binged this series, I loved it so much. I watched it in sub before the dub was out, then watched it in dub when it was released. I couldn't approve more of the dub. Some voices still match the character perfectly, while others, although different, still fit the attitude of the character. This is my third favorite anime for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a bit of cliche here and there, I highly recommend you watch this series. You've got your cute mascot and relaxed main character who does things that will surprise you. If you go into this with an open mind, you won't be disappointed.",

The strong emotional feels you get when watching the struggles of our beloved characters taps into the heart really hard, but then your also thrown some humour in there just to soften the blow.\r\nIn terms of characters I was pleased with just about all of them, in this group offriends you get just about every sorta character that succeeds in the anime community, however, Yukio's random change of heart near the end of the season sort of started to make me dislike him. He was too cocky for his own good that to me it seems like he forgot how to be a 15 year old kid, despite the fact he is too, a teacher.",

A good vs. evil situation spiced up with comedy, school day stuff and some nice fights. Some typical characters - good guys, bads guys, weird guys and girls in skirts... Do we except something else from this kind of series?\r\nSound:\r\nThe soundtrack was very catchy and a feastfor my ears.

Unfortunately, the characters are so BLINDINGLY STUPID, it'shard to fully enjoy the anime. The concept is brilliant, but unfortunately, its delivery is just awful because of the characters. You can't try to portray demons in a sympathetic light, when the main character (who is Satan's son), is constantly ruining the lives of other people, and then saying its his style. \"Looking for the good in everyone\" is the main premise of this show. Unfortunately, the characters seem to add to the tagline: \"Looking for the good in everyone while being willing to sacrifice the innocent.\"",

There was alot of potential, but it ultimately got squandered. there are some really good parts of this anime, but there are these small flaws (and one big one) that prevent it from being several echelons better. First off, it has some filler episodes that kill continuity and momentum, which reminds me. This anime, if anything, knows how to kill momentum. Its impossible to find an anime that can build and squander momentum better than Blue Exorcist. It does it just about as many times as Gantz replaces itscharacters. Since i should try to not spoil things, ill just say i disagreed when it came to direction of the plot, and that this anime's ending follows the first law of anime. And for those of us who do not know the first law of anime, i will use a metaphor. Anime endings go much like conducting a Schrodinger's cat experiment would go if you shot the box with a PTRD-41, we all know that cat is dead, but you have to check anyway, cuz the scientific process is retarded. But overall, i still recommend watching it.",

            "content": "Okumura Rin\u00ac is 15 years old teenager who has been raised by a priest, Father Shirou Fujimoto. He is constantly involved in fights and isn\u00b4t able to maintain any part-time job, neither he wants to continue is studies. His twin brother, Okumura Yukio, is a brilliant student who has won a scholarship to True Cross Academy and is trying to become a doctor.\r\nSuddenly, Rin begins to see what appears to see bugs, but they are completely ignored by everyone except him. Those bugs are in reality, small demons that focus on evil people and possess then. This leads to a series of events, which endrevealing the true identity of Rin, he is in truth a human-demon hybrid, whose father is none less than Satan himself. His brother doesn\u00b4t have any demonic powers, and Rin\u00b4s powers were sealed inside the demom-slaying blade Kurikura, which is beginning to fail to completely seal Rin\u00b4s powers, attracting a group of demons to attack the monastery in which he lives and kill Shirou (he is possessed by Satan, who is only able to possess Rin and Shirou, since only they are powerful enough to be his vessels). After that, Shirou is revealed to be a Paladin, the highest ranking member of the True Cross Order, a group of exorcists, which Rin joins so he can become strong enough to defeat Satan.\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist is a 25 episode anime that presents a interesting history which develops slowly at the beginning, but reveal itself to be fast-paced after the third episode. The characters are well developed, interesting and pretty much unique, in spite of following some stereotypes ( Bon is the one who becomes a exorcist to avenge the \u201cdestruction\u201d of his shrine; Izumo is somewhat tsundere; Shiemi is the shy one; even Rin being the sun of Satan isn\u00b4t at all a original concept). The artwork and the history are also another strong point in this anime, but the OST is nearly always ignored by the viewers (with the exception of the \u201cExorcist\u201d, and the second opening; both endings are simply bad and the first opening is decent).\\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of Ao no Exorcist is without doubt that from episode 17 onwards, there is not a single \u201ccanonical\u201d episode\u2026 yes, this means that 25% of this anime is a filler arc. By another words, Ao no Exorcist joins the group of manga adaptations who were released to early and because of that becomes different from the manga; even so, to my own surprise, the filler arc is well accomplished and remains interesting unlike the filler arcs from the Three Great series (I am referring to Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, and no I do not hate them, in fact I am a great fan of Naruto and Bleach but both of them presents us some really boring fillers, like the Bount arc and the Konoha History arc).\\n\r\nAnother necessary point that must be refered is that this is a shounen anime, so more mature viewers will probably dislike it. Also, although the anime itself is quite addictive, in my opinion it misses the most important thing in any history, that is the viewer doesn\u00b4t feel really connected with the characters with a exception for Rin and Yukio.\\n\r\nConclusion: Ao no Exorcist is a good anime, I would give it 7 out of 10 points. The history is interesting and quite addictive, the graphics are good, and the characters, although stereotyped are interesting and well explored. The weak point in this anime is most certainly the music, which is nearly always ignored by the viewers. The lack of attachment to the characters and the fact that the filler arc is huge can also be negative factors to some of the viewers.\\n\r\nThis article is only my opinion and therefore you may completely disagree with it.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish I just began a blog, If you visit it you will find my review, and other articles about characters, msuic and more.

            "content": "This is going to be a quick review of this anime going through the things I liked and disliked.\r\nHonestly, I didn't think the strong point of this anime was from the story, which pretty much talks about a demon kid who is trying to become a strong exorcist in order to become stronger. The strong points I felt were the music and the characters.\r\nI'm not really sure of the name for this song, but it played during the blacky the cat episode. Was I even supposed to cry during this episode? Well I did anyways. No, I'm not saying the story of that episode wasn'tsad itself, but the music that was playing made me have feels and all teary eyed. This was one anime that legitimately made me cry and I have to give props to that, which was mainly because of the music. The 2nd opening song is also another song I have note because I love that opening so much and is probably my favorite opening.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that characters were another strong point of the anime. You see several people mature throughout the anime and have good development. Not to mention all the characters are lovable. My personal favorite characters would be Mephisto, Fujimoto, and Shima. \\n\\n\r\nThe only things I felt that detracted from the anime would be the pacing of the show. Sometimes I felt the show was getting a lot slower. The anime did however pull things that I did not expect to happen that early. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is a well done shounen anime with good music and characters. Definitely on the top of my list.",

Like any other poor male lead in a shonen action anime, Rin Okumura is born in a very unfortunate circumstance which has outcast him from society, for he is Satan's son. However, Satan kills the man Rin loved the most, compelling Rin to become an exorcist to kill Satan, and that is where our story lies. I personally have always been a person of Shonen anime, the fictional action fascinates me.\r\nArt - 10. Blood, Gore, Exploding, and fluent animation, can there be anything betterthan such fantastic art?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10. the sound was definitely in sync with the animation. Plus, the soundtrack was the elegant music a pianist most definitely would look for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10. Everyone was an individual with a goal they'd stop at nothing to achieve. That's obviously not realistic though, so they even took the time to throw in the people who WEREN'T pursuing a dream, and was just there to, live a highschool life pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10. I enjoyed the show very much, I feel that the beginning expressed who our male lead was and what he did for a living quite well, and once they got to the actual plot, it was fast paced and intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10. That's another 10 on my list. I enjoyed this anime very much, and feel that it deserved the rating I gave it.",

            "content": "Although I\u2019m only halfway through the Blue Exorcist/Ao no Exocist anime series, I can say that it\u2019s so far so good. There were only a few twists and turns I encountered, but I enjoyed them as they were bone-chilling and exciting. There were times I got interested and shifted to a different anime, but I somehow get back to ANE all over again.The first few episodes of Blue Exorcist caught my interest quickly, and so my Blue Exorcist fandom started. I liked the story-line because it was so straightforward. I'm not saying that they jumped straight to the plot, I meant that they introduced thecharacters at the right time, they formulated the events in the right order, and they knew how to captivate an audience. Let's just say they put the puzzles pieces together, perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nBlue Exorcist isn\u2019t as boring as it sounds. It\u2019s actually action-packed and has a handful of cliff-hangers. I liked the action scenes a lot, since it was drawn well, and you could understand most of its parts, unlike other animes I've seen. The quality wasn't as good as I expected, but still, it's pretty cool.The art style of the anime itself is good, and the detailing is pretty cool. I wonder how long they came up with True Cross Academy. It must have been a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art was okay-ish. I think they just overdid it this time, though. Rin's demon form wasn't that, let's say.. Appealing to the audience. I asked most of my ANE friends and they thought it was totally off. I have to agree with that. He looked like he was picked out from an alley, drunk, and had a furry tail attached up his behind. Other characters' details were fine. I especially liked how cute they made Shiemi's character, and how tsundere they made Izumo.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the sounds. There's a reason why I picked \"Outstanding\" as the rating for sound. The voice actors fit perfectly along their characters, making it look as if they were meant to play that role. Well, they were since they WERE chosen.. =='' Eto.. The Opening and Ending songs were plain awesome, and the sound effects were sublime. They really did a great job on that. They have my rare compliments for sound.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first-half of the anime. I'm actually not sure what it'll turn out to be, now that they have a lot of twists. But I hope Blue Exorcist turns out to be as I expected and wanted. I wish it would satisfy me completely, since I rarely find animes that have. I'm looking forward to continuing the rest of the series sometime this week, since schoolwork and everything else get in the way all the time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI know I can\u2019t wait for the next episodes of Blue Exorcist. I\u2019m actually on the edge of my seat, waiting for more of the epicness.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFeel the thrill\u201d -AnimeRokka18",

On top of having great characters, it has a really nice setting. That HUGE private school campus is absolutely amazing. It makes you wish you'd be able to go to a school like that.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was very good; it was really well thought out and it gives you a lot of shifting and watch-on-the-edge-of-your-seat moments.\r\nArt:\r\nThe drawings are usual high quality like any other very good Anime with good art.\r\nSound:\r\nI really likedthe intros, and music during combat.

            "content": "The concept of the story is nothing new but I'd like to believe it is something anyone can get into. The execution of it, however, is disconcerting. Situations were overly dramatic when it did not need to be and lighthearted situations were longer than they needed to be. And the plot twist at the end of the anime was randomly thrown into the series to give it an epic closer. Which backfired in my honest opinion. \r\nThe animation was very clean. Character designs followed shounen trends for the most part having the cast in their uniforms for a majority of the series. Backgrounds did nothave a significant impact on the series but satisfied more than enough for a shounen series. In certain episodes of Ao no Exorcist, there were animation spikes where character movements were extremely fluid and scene composition were more powerful than normal. And then there were the drops in animation quality. Where all the care character movement was kept to a minimum, uninteresting backgrounds, recycled animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Ao no Exorcist has a few good listens. The music in composition with the anime has miss and hits. The presence of Folly sounds were very well placed and used very often. Foot steps, contact with objects and ruffling of clothes in certain scenes where it had more impact than others. The voice actors did a good job portraying their characters, of course not to say the characters were the best lot. \\n\\n\r\nMost people would not take a liking to typical shounen characters but I'd have to say I like them a lot. Like humans, the characters have flaws. As long as the series itself does not delve to deep into side characters or characters that have less influence on the story then it's fine with me. However, the introduction of a certain cat spirit or cooking imp character took up unnecessary time. I could live without them because those characters do nothing important for the progression of the story. The main characters stupidity drives the story for the most part and is not properly resolved in the series. Unless you could argue that a couple of candles can solve an adolescent boy's anger issues. Yukio has a lot of favorable traits. He's intelligent, he's dependable, charismatic, good-looking, and is Jun Fukuyama. The one real flaw about his character is at the end of the series where he decides to be an idiot to give the series and epic battle to conclude the anime. Overall, no specific character shines but the character interactions were enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI like the world. I like Izumo Kamiki. I like Eri Kitamura. I like Izumo Kamiki. I like this anime. I like it at 6.",

            "content": "Ao no exorcist...\r\nOne of the best anime series I ever seen, this is could have been my favourite... but the mistake of this anime was probably the lack of episodes, and characters (in my opinion) you may be asking why? (for those who don't agree with me)...\r\nFor starters the female's in this anime is, somewhat very boring... but the males are very focused on looks and power, and this is bad because this has no balance on male and female what's so ever. Now many people might disagree with me on this but, I really hated how the manga artist made the female; because theywere all weird. But, looks might not be the case of these anime, but still doesn't take away the fact that the anime was very unbalanced when it came to male and female... \\n\\n\r\nMales might not agree but it reduces the amount of anime viewers because of the fact that they are put of how 'unattractive' the females characters are... I thought that the only decent female character was \"Shura\" or \"Sura\" Can't remember how her name was spelt :D... \\n\\n\r\nAnyways back to the point, she  did not look weird at all and also her power was very powerful, which proves it when she Rin tries to take her on. However the other females like Shiemi which has a little green demon, which can make plants grow out of itself was very... disappointing because I was expecting something like \"Small but terrible\" but no it didn't happen. Furthermore that green demon of hers, only seemed to Defend (which broke easily) and heal (pretty decent) and not much 'Superpower' going on... unlike Shura she wasn't able to help much in action scene's which made her a very uninteresting character. \\n\\n\r\nnow on a positive point, you guys are probably wondering why I put a '8' on the overall. The only reason was because I liked the whole anime's Story, because unlike most superpower anime's which has a battles in nearly every single episode, this had a balanced effect to it. They actually had to make a decent reason to fight before engaging anything else, I liked this because this prevents the \"other\" Powers to be seen and this prevents the story from being rushed. Also I liked how the enemies are very unique, because most 'bad guys' have a lot of spikes sticking out them, or big swords, or lots of blood on their clothes; the bad guys on Ao no exorcist is very hard to take seriously (in my opinion) because they all looked like clowns which made me have a liking on the anime even more. \\n\\n\r\nthanks guys for reading my review on what I though about the anime for people who is looking forward on Ao no exorcist, please stay tune for there is a \"MOVIE\" coming between September to October sorry guys for not being accurate :P",

            "content": "While watching this I couldn't help but notice somethings, like how the plot to this series seems like it takes bites out of bleach, FMA bro, and fairy tail. Honestly it seems like a combination of a whole bunch of popular anime... but then again most popular anime do. Regardless the show seems to acknowledge that fact, spit in its face, and continue moving on.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nLike I said before it seems like the story borrows from many a source, but that's no reason to deface it, nor over look it. The plot is brilliantly done, setting its own pace in regard to how important certainparts of the story are. It isn't held down by having to please action hungry little kids by having a battle every chance it gets. This very reason is why I do not consider this anime to be a shonen. It takes its sweet time when developing characters in depth. The last fight scene in the ending battle was a bit too short in my opinion, but other than that I see no problems.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOutstanding effects, and stunning visuals. the protagonists and even the supporting cast all are drawn differently which says a lot for their artistic genius. Rather than just pick a base model and draw everyone accordingly, each character is an individual. The scenes are realistic and not in the least repetitive, really well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nBoth opening themes are amazing, though I favor the first. Both ending themes are ok (the first is some kind of Japanese N Sync, the second sounds like Brittney Spears) just a grab for attention by using more popular bands rather than meaningful songs... no matter though. The sound track seems a bit borrowed, but it is utilized well throughout the show. The voices fit the characters well, nicely done. No dubbed version is available yet, but seeing how its so popular, its just a matter of time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nvery nicely developed characters. The series does its characters justice developing them at different paces and in different ways as well. The supporting characters are developed quite nicely as well. The cast often times grows together but even then they develop in different ways rather than a generic growth for all of them. Realizing different things while all together. There is great mystery involving many characters and the show does well to keep it a mystery until it wants you to know.\\n\r\nMy only problem with the cast is, I would really like to know more about Fujumoto. The dude was such a badass! Alas it was not to be...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAction sequences that will leave you begging for more, relationships that will keep you smiling, and grievances that may just touch your heart. The show employs few twists, but when they come, you'll have no idea what hit you.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but I heard it goes beyond this point. So it is very likely there will be more to come, but don't hold your breath. I just hope they don't turn this into another shonen disaster (naruto, bleach, one piece, ect...)",

I will admit Rin is pretty cute, but sometimes he acts very stupidly. The anime is not very enjoyable and seriously in episode 3 or 4 or something they fight a FLOWER. I understand it was a demon flower or whatever but they couldve made it something better. I also think its a bit weird Rin wants to be an exorcist if he's a demon himself, wouldnt that mean he'd have to kill himself? Overall I just do not really like this anime.",

            "content": "Shonen series are often a hit or miss for me personally. Some of them can be really good and instantly draw me in with its premise (i.e FMA Brotherhood) and some can often fail to capture my attention (i.e Fairy Tail). \r\nAo no Exorcist (also known as Blue Exorcist in the US) thankfully leans more towards the former.\r\nIts premise drew me in straight away with its great character designs, the 'Supernatural' style chemistry between the two leads, an amazing 'Harry Potter' style school setting that we have yet to see outside of Negima and the overseeing struggle between humans and demons. After reading the firstfew chapters I was instantly hooked, eager to read more about the journey of these two Okamura brothers. When I discovered an anime was in the works I was delighted. I could finally see this work of art in its full animated and visually impressive glory. \\n\\n\r\nStory (5)\\n\r\nThe story of Ao no Exorcist basically revolves around Rin Okamura who is the son of the demon lord known as Satan. After his father kills his guardian Shiro, he decides to take vengeance on his death by vowing to hunt down Satan and enrolling in True Cross Academy's cram school to become an exorcist. The greatest strength of Ao no Exorcist's story lies within the first half of the series, aka the half that actually follows the manga. While some scenes were altered, they were actually changed for the best. Episode 2 in particular was very well executed in both emotion, atmosphere and voice acting and to be was one of the very few occasions in which the anime managed to be better than the manga. The school scenes in particular were highly detailed and showcased a lot of supernatural features almost reminiscent of the 'Harry Potter' series. As a shonen itself, the manga and anime stands out amongst other 'Shonen Jump' franchises such as 'Naruto' and 'Bleach' by becoming more of a coming of age/journey-based shonen like many young adult novels and manga such as 'Fullmetal Alchemist' rather than your stereotypical battle manga with tournament arcs and friendship powerups. Granted there are still cliches that remind you its a shonen, but it doesn't seem to be overused like other series. The first half of the anime focuses more on the school life experience with audiences being treated to interesting scenes in which we learn more about the demons and analyze ways in which to combat them. It allows for a refreshing take on the shonen genre that usually consists of characters going through various powerups to become stronger. There's very little of that here for characters actually learn their skills through a classroom setting.\\n\\n\r\nSo far it was a great adaptation. Sadly that did not last very long. Once the second half rolled along the anime soon diverted away from the manga to suddenly set in to tell its own original tale. The anime original part of this anime which begins at the end of episode 15 and carries on until the final episode had failed to captivate me as much as the first half did. Instead the anime had me nodding off at how uninteresting it made the characters seem, the dull plot that seemed to be too generic of most other action series and the introduction of a villain who seemed too 1-dimensional to me. Needless to say I did not care so much for the series. I wished the anime would instead adapt the more superior Impure King arc which while it had its fair share of flaws had managed to create a rather interesting and compelling story. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also two noticeable flaws that irritated me. The first was that there are 3 filler episodes that contribute little to the overall story. The first one had some comedic moments but the other two were simply a pain to sit through. The second gripe I had with this anime's storyline was the lack on depth on some of the characters past and background. I want to see more of Bon's family and more of Izumo's rather tragic looking past as shown through a short 1 minute flashback, but the anime does not touch on this issue again.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation (8)\\n\r\nThe animation in Ao no Exorcist was done by A1 Pictures who were also responsible for animes such as 'Black Butler', 'Working!' and later went on to animate popular works such as 'Sword Art Online'. For the most part it is clear that they had some pretty good funding for the animation is rich and detailed with character designs looking very similar to the manga. The fights were relatively fluid and also fast-paced so you won't have characters constantly staring at each other during fights like some of the well known shonen adaptations. I was also particularly fond of the blue flames that the demons and Rin's sword let off.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki completely nails the soundtrack for this anime. The music for this anime is covered with ominous and demonic chants, some epic choir scores that would make other orchestral soundtracks envious and the expert use of a violin during the more emotional and relaxing tracks. No OST sounds the same, each one is different from the other while still maintaining an outstanding quality throughout. There is so much goodness in here to list that it would take me all day to gush about it. So I am going to recommend you to listen to the soundtrack! It is absolutely worth it!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6) \\n\r\nThe characters within this series in both the manga and anime are what I would consider to be some of the weaker aspect of both mediums. Rin to be me came off as a rather typical shonen protagonist with his determination to never give up fighting and always jumping headfirst into all out brawls. The relationship between him and his brother Yukio was handled pretty well with some sequences involving the two working together to defeat their foes. Their chemistry reminded me of Sam and Dean Winchester from the 'Supernatural' series so if you like that show you may find this choice appealing to you. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters however felt undeveloped apart from Shiemi who evolves from a shy lonely girl to one who is determined to protect her friends no matter what. There's one character that is smart but aggressive towards the main lead (almost like a Sasuke from the 'Naruto' series), another who appears to be fitting the role of a comic relief, another who is so full of herself, another who is your stereotypical team pet, another who appears to be there to introduce some fanservice and so forth. So to be true to my opinions, I found a lot of them to be rather generic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\r\nThis series was a rather huge disappointment to me personally. It started off so promising but later collides off the rails into a cluttered mess of unappealing original characters, unlikable plot lines and twists and a final battle that is as generic as other shonen series out there. However despite all this I can definitely understand the popularity. It has some good supernatural elements to it, an absolutely outstanding soundtrack, some exhilarating battles and an interesting world which encourages you to want to find out more about it. So my recommendation is that if you are a fan of supernatural shonen along the lines of 'D Gray Man' or 'Soul Eater' then give this one a try or at least read the manga version whose second arc completely trumps the anime original arc.",

That's going to be quiet a long review...\r\nThe story is a bit complicated and I have some problems with remembering names for stuff and places, but it's really interesting and doesn't have any parts that get you bored. There's so much in it; action, humour, drama. Everything! I love that type of stories.\r\nThe lines in the manga are amazing, and before watching the first episode, I thought that anime is going to have worse art, just like other anime(s), but thenwhen I watched it, I was like \"Holy sh**!! This is so fu****g gorgeous ! Please, tell me I'm not dreaming!\". Really, my jaw went open and I was watching the rest of the episode with my mouth hanging open.\\n\\n\r\nSound is not bad as well! It gets you really in the mood of the situation. Music is played almost all the time during it, which I really love. I like the ending song the best. It's really something. I can't really say anything more then that it's very impressive, because I'm not a music expert!\\n\\n\r\nI'm basing the opinion of the characters on reading manga, because the anime didn't properly introduce all of them yet.\\n\r\nUsually characters like Shiemi really annoy me. They are all really weak and fall in love with the main character, usually too sweet for me. However, the author made Shiemi different; I can't state what kind of thing it is, but it's something that makes you like her. Other characters are very well developed and kept in character all the time. I love the fact that none are acting the same or looking too similar. They all have something that makes you remember them and think what they will do in the future episodes and chapters.\\n\\n\r\nHa! If you still ask me about the enjoyment, I think you need to re-read everything from the beginning! But if you have to know - Yes, I do enjoy it very much!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is pure awesomeness, full stop. There's nothing more I could say. I can't find words that describe how amazing this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nI really to recommend it! You will love it!\\n\\n",

By itself, however, I would easily call this series \"Very Good\" or 8 out of 10. Though unoriginal in some aspects, \"Ao no Exorcist\" is a superbly made, exciting, and humorous fantasy/supernatural series.\r\nThe characters are simply adorable: in animation, development, and not to mention sound-- several excellent voice actors such as Kana Hanazawa feature in \"Ao no Exorcist.\" The excellent writing managed to make the story  charming and exciting, despite someunoriginal tropes (the son fighting the father, the boy who is part demon, the universe comprised of two domains like earth and a spirit world, an overpowered main character, childish jokes, etc.). A few elements were refreshingly original, however, such as the system of magic used by Exorcists. The psychological nature of the backstory of Rin's mother is particularly surprising in an anime that is often more light-hearted. In fact, that's my favorite aspect of the series, this backstory of Rin's mother and its implications to that world's \"Church\".\\n\\n\r\nWhy should you watch it? If you want a funny and action-packed fantasy tale, \"Ao no Exorcist\" is a great choice, especially if you're looking for something that isn't twenty seasons long. If you like supernatural stories where there's a god and a satan, as well as any other magical creatures, again \"Ao no Exorcist\" is great. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, regarding the anime's treatment of \"The Church\", it is acceptable for Christians, since there is a God and Satan. But it's also acceptable for minority religions where demons or spirits are worshiped, because the \"demons\" of this Series are not entirely evil. In this way, I think it attracts a larger audience. \\n\\n\r\nSo try it out if you want some explosive fantasy fun.",

The story, to put it lightly, needs a lot of improvement because it is very unoriginal and extremely predictable. After the first couple of episodes I personally just watched the show for the characters and quite frankly, they did excellent jobs at showing their growth throughout the anime. I personally wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone who would want anything great but rather something tospend a couple afternoons on and relax while playing a phone game.",

            "content": "Shounen? Demons? Was this just a Kuroshitsuji rip-off?\r\nNot at all. \r\nI wasn't expecting to like this series, but it really amazed me and I can safely say that it's one of my favourite anime. \r\nHowever,  every anime has flaws, so I'll do my best not to rave about this one and point out criticisms.\r\nStory :: 7\r\nThe story, as far as I know, isn't something that's been done before. It struck me as a unique and engaging plot, with a lot of potential. While Ao No Exorcist did come running out of the gate and got me hooked almost immediately, it did begin to slowdown in the middle of the series. I have to admit that I was a bit bored watching several of the episodes, sitting around and waiting for the plot to move forward. Nevertheless, even the trivial episodes do contribute a bit to the plot and character development. It's simply unfortunate that they didn't keep the \"adrenaline\", shall I say, going. Ao No Exorcist does have a great ending, though, and I'm glad I persevered through the impatience!\\n\\n\r\nArt :: 9\\n\r\nI'm rather picky about the art in the animes I watch, but Ao No Exorcist most certainly fulfilled my expectations. The action scenes, which are perhaps the most vital, are well-drawn, and the demons, also an integral part of the plot, are mostly uniquely designed, though at times they don't always appear, well, intimidating. Regardless, I did like the designs of all the characters, who are easily distinguishable due to their different physical qualities that set them apart from each other. Alas, with all the blue flames and darkness, the backgrounds don't receive much attention. The only ones that I can say stood out are Shiemi's garden. It is necessary to take into consideration that the exorcists are attending a school where there won't be many ornate designs, though. My last complaint about the art would be the exaggerated \"angry faces\" of Rin, something that I would describe as Eren Jaeger-esque, though perhaps not as ridiculous-looking. Though it helps to convey emotion, it can sometimes look comical and detract from the seriousness of battles or situations. \\n\\n\r\nSound :: 7\\n\r\nThe background music doesn't stand out at all. This is both good and bad; it's not extraordinary enough to take notice of, but then again it also complements what's happening in the anime. Personally, I would have preferred for the background music to be more memorable. As for the OPs and EDs, I did enjoy all of them, though I really love the OP and ED from the first season and the ED from the second season. Pay attention to Meisa Kuroki's \"Wired Life\", which is the second ending of the series, I think that the lyrics are beautiful and it's as though the song is made perfectly for Ao No Exorcist [ though they can also apply to life as well ]. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter :: 8\\n\r\nOne of the things I appreciated most about Ao No Exorcist is that each character is distinguished from the others. I can name at least five unique personality or history traits about each character, even some of the background characters. Every one of the many characters gets a little bit of back story and thus I really felt as though I could understand them more due to this. Some of them, however, didn't enjoy as much development as they could have had. I empathized with a lot of the characters as they faced moral conflicts. Additionally, there was a clear distinction between Rin and Yukio, despite the fact that they are twins. However, the part where Ao No Exoricst fails is in adequately developing Yukio's character. At the end of the series, I still don't know that much about him, except that he wants the best for his brother and is determined to keep him safe. If you put the brotherly devotion aside, though, there isn't much left.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :: 9\\n\r\nI prefer slice-of-lifes, so watching Ao No Exorcist was really a result of having no other anime to watch on Netflix. Thus, it was a wonderful surprise to find that I really enjoyed this anime! I can't give this a 10 because it's not the best anime I've ever watched, due to the errors listed above and the aforementioned slowing down of the series in the middle that made me wonder if I should even finish it. Though Ao No Exorcist redeemed itself by the end, I can't say that I enjoyed the entirety of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :: 9\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an action-filled anime with a unique plot, characters that you can relate to or simply be entertained by, and not have to dwell on dark themes or plot holes, then Ao No Exorcist might be good for you. The end of this series was not a cliffhanger in the least and left me with no outstanding questions that will nag me for all of eternity, so fear not! It is by far not the most engaging anime or the best that you will ever watch, but some of the messages in it will resonate with you.\\n\\n\r\nAmusez-vous! - SSaurus\\n\\n",

My opinion on the story is typical shouen. At first it started as something different with a serious mood. That was at first. The serious mood is still there, but comedy is more apparent.Art\\n\r\nThe art is great. It seems like your typical anime, but there are some unique things about it. I've never seen a character drawn like kamiki. Her eyebrows are like a fox God. It doesn't suit her and it's funny.\\n\\n\r\n                               Sound\\n\r\nThe sound is so freaking good. It is so good even if you have the lowest computer you will still be able to hear the sound.\\n\r\n                              Character\\n\r\nThe characters are the only things that upset me. So typical of a shouen anime. You have the main character Rin as the badass, funny, immature character. His twin brother is more serious like usual. the girl Rin likes is innocent, sweet, and has a huge rack (its covered by the kimono's she wears).  there is a annoying girl(kamiki) and bad guys that are supposed to be by Rin's side.\\n\r\n                            Enjoyment\\n\r\nEven though some elements of this anime is typical shouen, I am a huge fan of shouen so I like it. So far there hasn't been any big twists so I can't wait for the future of this show.\\n\r\n                         Overall \\n\r\nI rate this show 7 firetrucks out of 10. THE REVIEW YOU JUST READ IS BASED SOLELY ON ONE PERSON'S OPINION. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS REVIEW TO HEART AND PLEASE CHECK OUT THE ANIME. JUST BECAUSE THIS PERSON MIGHT NOT LIKE DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL AS WELL.",

I'm just going to head straight into the review.\r\nStory - 8 \r\nRin and Yukio were raised by a priest all of their life yet were also the sons of Satan himself. There were two 'worlds' I suppose you could say, Gehenna, where the demons live. Then there was Assiah where the humans live. I thought the story was pretty unique and interesting, there were plot twists that had me thinking, which I am always happy about. Sure there were some holes in the plotbut it was overall forgivable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art is one of my favorite things in this anime. It fit really well with the action scene's and the fighting was phenomenal. I think the character designs were really well thought out as well. I found it all to be amazing. The only reason it did not receive a 10  was because some of the animation wasn't smooth if that makes sense? It didn't flow.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were great and catchy I loved them to pieces it is just the music used within the anime sometimes HELPED with the scene, and other times, not so much. I think they would over-use some songs, especially during the fighting moments. Overall the sound was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nOh my goodness the characters. I love the different personalities within the anime and how some clash while others link. I love the voices and the development. Though some characters hadn't developed as much as others which I found extremely disappointing. Overall the character were amazing",

Really enjoyed the plot those two episodes had.\r\n...and then the story just disappears and is thrown straight to the thrash can. Ao No Exorcist ends up being a very generic school shonen.\r\nStory - 3\r\nApart from the first two episodes, the storywas practically nonexistent. They set up a good plot in the first two, did some random stuff for 20 episodes and then wrapped up some loose ends from the first two episodes. It was pathetic.

I noticed that you, A-1 Pictures, like superpowers and the sort, and normally i would just brush it off as another power fantasy, but you A-1 Pictures made it lookawesome, and in general, really fun, so thank you, A-1 Pictures, and especially you, Koichi Hatsumi, for directing such a beautiful show, and now, on to the review.\\n\r\n(End of Prologue)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story of ANE is kinda simple, and i think that is one of its strengths, the story isn't too complicated to the point where you need a damn calculator to figure out what the actual hell is going on, but not so simple to the point where it feels like you've seen this premise a hundred times already. ANE has a premise of a loudmouth kid named Rin Okumura, born as the son of satan, but he doesn't know that, living in a church under his legal guardian, but after he is killed by his real father, Satan. The story leaves you with more questions than answers, in a good sense though, it isn't too confusing, but it leaves you kind of curious, Rin adventures leads him to all sorts of demons and misfortunes, but never fails to warm your heart with some light comedy and moments where we can kinda relax with Rin and the cast. The story blows up to some pretty awesome proportions in which Rin is forced to use his brain and not just his flames. It makes you think, and the show makes sure to let you know that Rin, despite all of his misfortunes and troubles, is still just a teenager, and he will make mistakes, but he has fun with it sometimes, screaming a lot, and having competitions with his friends. the only thing that i could take away from this story is that sometimes, the show takes itself a bit too seriously, Rin can be brash, which kinda takes away from his street smart charm that A-1 showed us in the first couple of episodes, which threw me off a bit, but i still enjoyed the shows premise, because Rin had all of these things to handle such as other demons, his father Satan, an dother Exorcists, the show really handle itself as it were real people in this actual situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI have little to nothing bad to say about A-1's choice of artstyle, Minoru Sasaki was probably the best hire they could have made in a while, and everything looked like a fantasy should in anime's real world, the only bad thing that i have to say which i wish could have seen fixed, is that the show is kinda meh, it shades waaay too much, which makes the anime kind of hard to watch because i can barely see it, but other than that, i can see the amount of effort and passion making the attacks, such as 7 square acres of fire burning down shit, makes the show really worthwhile, with it's over the top spectacle of fire and the effort that went into the magic system, and how  it worked, such as the prayers, and the monsters, and the demons, and what they looked like, and what powers they had, and Rin, and the animation felt really fluid, is what i really loved about this show, because as dark and gritty as it may be,  the fluid style of animation left me almost speechless and was one of the greatest reasons that i continued watching the Kyoto Saga.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI loved the music in ANE, the first opening was so jazzpunk that it is one of my favorite openings of all time, and i wouldn't change anything about it, the only reason i didn't give this a 10/10, is because besides the opening and endings, everything actually in the anime, is kinda forgettable, and nothing really touched deeply, even though this is on my top 10 anime of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThis is the show's greatest weakness in my opinion, and the fact that i ave to give it a 6 is because everyone besides Rin is kind of a group of tropes.\\n\r\nI mean, come on A-1, you really had to do this? Here is basically the cast.\\n\r\nRin Okumura: loudmouth/ main character\\n\r\nYukio: caring brother\\n\r\nShiemi: ditzy airhead\\n\r\nKirigakure: fanservice\\n\r\nMephistopheles: weird mentor\\n\r\nAmaimon: chill step brother\\n\r\nAstaroth: plot device\\n\r\nSuguro:  rival\\n\r\nKamiki: Tsundere\\n\r\nKonekomaru: shy guy\\n\r\nShirou: Dead Father\\n\r\nThat's kind of lazy, wouldn't you think so?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDespite all of ANE's flaws, i still enjoyed the hell out of this show, and i thought it was wonderful, because, by god this show if awesome, its one of those things that seems meh at first, but is really cool because damn, call me a demonic worshipper or not, i love demons, Lucifer, Astaroth, Mephisto, Rin, even Satan himself. They all played a larger role than the show gives them credit for and i love that because it really gives you a sense of hype, and that basically what the show is here for, FUN! This show is utterly fun and that's really all we need, right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, i like this show, and i would highly recommend this to any of my friends, because believe it or not, this show is really good, and i think you should really watch it, and you should have fun too!",

            "content": "Whether it\u2019s a book, a movie or an anime, I always love it when there\u2019s supernatural theme in them. So after crying my eyes out watching Your Lie in April, I decided to look for some supernatural anime and tadah! I came across Blue Exorcist (Ao no Exorcist). It\u2019s honestly my first time hearing about this anime so I don\u2019t really know what to expect. But when I watched its very first episode, I was really surprised how it easily captured my attention.\r\nAs usual, for this review, I am going to break up my thoughts through the following points:\r\nPlot\r\nI absolutely LOVE the plot plus Ilove that it was straight to the point and gave me what I wanted. There\u2019s no dilly dallying and Blue Exorcist gave me action as early as its first episode. We can already guess that this anime is going to include some praying and chanting so I kind of anticipated some boring chanting scenes in this anime, but surprise, there\u2019s none. There was obviously some chanting and reference about Vatican and church and things like that, but for me I guess that made this anime even more interesting. Plus the exorcists here we\u2019re kind of badass, *wink.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only 12 episodes in each season but it felt enough for me to get to know the important characters especially, Rin. Personally, I prefer season 1 from season 2. The second season was kind of a letdown for me, there\u2019s some slight difference from the first season plus I wasn\u2019t a fan of the drama. But it was still a decent watch though, plus the final episode was really cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI absolutely love the main character. It also didn\u2019t help that he has a twin brother (I\u2019m a sucker for twins!) but unlike him, didn\u2019t inherit their father\u2019s power until on the last few episodes in season 1. The character development was good too and I love seeing how Rin is improving in controlling his power. He\u2019s troublesome alright, but he genuinely like to help everyone and doesn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt. His twin brother on the other hand is alright. Well, he was actually alright in the first season but he started to get under my nerves in the second season. His issues are warranted but it\u2019s just annoying to watch, that\u2019s all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of annoying, there\u2019s this 1 particular character that I learned to hate when I watch season 2. She\u2019s so annoying that I just mentally erased her entire existence in this anime, haha lol. Excluding her, I actually think that Blue Exorcist has some great character line-up plus I love Kuro!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics\\n\r\nI absolutely love the animation and think it was of high quality. From facial expressions to background scenery, everything is just so pleasing to look at plus the character designs are also excellent. The animation studio should be proud of their work in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\r\nThe first time I heard Blue Exorcist\u2019s OP and ED songs, I didn\u2019t instantly became a fan. But as I get to listen to them everytime I watch a new episode, I learned to really appreciate the music. I guess you could say that it\u2019s one of those that gets better everytime you hear them, *wink.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, didn\u2019t I tell you that Blue Exorcist is one of those rare anime that I watch from the very beginning \u2018til its closing song in every episode? So yep, I guess that speaks a lot from this anime eh?\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice Actors\\n\r\nI actually don\u2019t have any complaints at all. I think the voice actors were able to portray each character so well, there\u2019s no need for me to elaborate more eh?\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDespite the letdown in season 2, overall, Blue Exorcist is still a very enjoyable watch for me. Haven\u2019t read the manga counterpart yet but I\u2019ve been hearing that it suffered from the usual adaptation pains, with a rushed ending and lack of power development which is quite unfortunate but luckily not enough to ruin the experience. It may not have reached greatness, I still think that Blue Exorcist is a good series to watch.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8/10 \u2013 Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMovie \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it right after watching the first season and some may say it was more of the same but I genuinely enjoyed it. If you liked Blue Exorcist, be sure to check out the movie once you finish the series, *wink.",

            "content": "Alright. First of all I want to say that I'm new at this and apologize if there's any mistake.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe first time I saw the synopsis of the manga Ao no Exorcist I was thought it is boring and stuffs, but I was wrong. When I decided to check this out, I found it more exciting than it is written in the synopsis, and decided to follow the anime. However, as this serial goes on I feel as if everything is able to be expected. I expect more than the characters and story plot, but I don't think there's a development. Everything is normal. Youcan find them in other anime, and nothing is even special anymore. It's getting boring. I expect more than this, to be honest. Every excitement, it doesn't last long. I expect this to have a unique feature that separates it from other anime, more than it is currently. An unexpected scene, or catastrophe. But no, I think the Blue Exorcist has weakened as time flies. (I know I am not in a place to judge, so you can ignore it)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nEverything is just fine, I think\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nI feel as if I'm watching without any soundtrack, to be honest, or at least I'd rather so. The soundtrack is just normal, and sometimes doesn't match the situation. I know an anime which has better soundtrack than this one does. Disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "Overall, I liked the show even with the flaws and there were some major ones.\r\nStory  (7):    One problem I had with the show was that I think that the pacing and direction of the story line was flawed because for a good chunk of the show you could cut out and it would changed how the story went. I did enjoy a lot of went on in those chunks, but it caused the ending and the story in general to be given less time to develop than what could have been accomplished in a 25 episode long series. I also believethat there were some holes left unfulfilled by the end. For example, at the end I found my self asking how the motivation for a few characters were became twisted. \\n\r\nArt   (7):     The art wasn't bad, except I thought it could be a little better at points in the show.\\n\r\nSound  (9): I quite enjoyed the sound behind this anime and I thought it went well throughout the show, but the the intro and outro music weren't the best for the beginning half of the series(in my opinion), so I deducted 1 point for that. I based the score more on the music during the show.\\n\r\nCharacter  (7): I liked some of the charters well enough, but there were sometimes where I thought the characters were lacking. For example, I disliked some of the conversations between the characters because at multiple instances I would get annoyed at there conversation because one or both parties would seem hypocritical from what they were talking about and this usually seemed to occur when the main character, Rin Okurmura, was being scolded or was arguing with another character in the series. This became quite tiresome near me and it affected my overall enjoyment of the show also. Also some of the characters action would contradict themselves from one episode to the next or even in the context of the same episode.\\n\r\nEnjoyment  (7): As I previously mentioned, the acts of hypocrisy diminished from some of the enjoyment I received from the show. The show was enjoyable most of the time, whenever, I wasn't left questioning a character's actions.\\n\r\nOverall   (7): I did enjoy the show and I would recommend people watch it even with it's flaws. I know I didn't say much of any of the positive points through the review, but it is a good show and I just wanted to state some of my problems with it. I did think the show was original enough for an anime fan to watch and not just be bored with thinking of all of the cliches that go on in the show, but instead sit back and watch an enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "One has to ask the question whether a repeated formula for success is something that works because it works or is it something that gets very tiring, boring, old hat, and repetitive. The concept of a lead character in his teens having his world shattered with the truth about his or her birth or origins and being thrust into a world of magic where they are the one thing that stands in between the world and evil (often with a sword at their side) is something I have seen time and again in not just anime but many genres. \"Ao no Exorcist\" or \"Blue Exorcist\"does this same thing again, but it also does it well enough to keep a viewer's interest and entertain them along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around teenage Rin and his brother Yukio, the former being the rough around the edges delinquent type and the latter being a more studious, straight laced kid. One has constant bedhead and the other has short hair and glasses. The are opposites, but the sense of brotherhood between these two is well established. They don't always get along, but they do watch out for each other. They live in a world where demons exist and come into our world via demonic possession. Exorcists are there to deal with these fiends. Their father is one of the best around, while also being a loving and caring man. Then, the plot kicks in. Their father is killed during a confrontation with Satan himself, the truth that Rin and Yukio are both children born of Satan (but with only Rin inheriting his true father's blood- not that the pointed ears and fangs was hint enough) and the two are sent to True Cross Academy, a veritable Hogwarts if ever there was one, and their education in demon fighting begins. Because if anime didn't take place in a school, it might not take place at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here the anime really starts. After such a ghoulish opening with lots of blood and the proverbial sh*t getting real, it then becomes a school story, with lots of humor and the daily conflict of the day being resolved usually by episode's end. A supporting cast is introduced, fellow students, teachers, and the school president- Sir Mephisto Pheles (a name not given to him by accident) each establishing themselves as notable, if not somewhat cliched, side kicks. True Cross Academy itself is very much like Hogwarts or other magically inclined schools, but it is not without it's own individuality. It's normal enough to pass for a school, but has it's own quirks so that it's a fun place to want to see more of. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the action in this show is fair to mediocre, the show itself does remind viewers of what the stakes are. That Satan and his cohorts are out there and prove themselves to be worth and vicious adversaries. A very PG-13 atmosphere if ever there was one, where the bad guys are capable of some very awful things with blood and a body count not beyond the realm of possibilities, but still keeping it tame enough that viewers aren't going to crap their pants. I think this is where the show finds itself a comfortable level and manages to produce a product that appeals to many viewers. Fun, action oriented, and with just enough spooky to catch some off guard. \\n\\n\r\nA strong artwork showing also helps this show along. Many of the demons and characters on display are creatively designed critters that are neat to look at. They use many tropes of anime with exaggerated reactions and funny faces, it is a cartoon after all, but when the spooky stuff does come out it has the same care and attention to it as the fun stuff. A wonderfully balanced contrast as one would come to expect from the fabulous studio that is A-1 Pictures. Adding in a wonderful cast in both the Sub and Dub categories with many well known veterans on either side giving typically strong performances and I feel safe recommending either one depending on your preference.\\n\\n\r\nI could certainly nit pick enough to knock off some points, such as the character of Shura always having her massive breasts on display in a tiny bikini top and for the reason that the tattoo on her chest is somehow essential to her powers (I am reminded of the character Quiet from the \"Metal Gear Solid\" franchise) and that is the reason she's so scantily clad. The build up to the ending is strong with some twists to be had but one I frankly found to be underwhelming, but I must also allow the premise that this is but the beginning of what appears to be a franchise that is here to stay. But, honestly, not of that is enough to take away from what is truly a good show.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect the world from this series or see it as a knock off of something else, it is what it is. A solid 7/10 from top to bottom. It's french fries in a world trying to constantly re-invent the potato. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "The Blue Exorcist was a refreshing addition to the Shounen anime genre, providing viewers with a new representation of the plot and characters one might have viewed earlier in series such as Naruto. The positive part of the series is the introduction of the occult, the protagonist's relationship with his brother. This anime is a by the numbers Shounen, i.e., (i) the typical scarred childhood; (ii) death of a father figure; (iii) becoming and outcast; (iv) having extraordinary potential/raw power; and (v) friends assisting the protagonist in overcoming his obstacles (making up for the feels). Despite the stereotypical plot the anime manages to pour ina life of its own due to the theme being displayed by it, and the exceptionally well portrayed characters of Yukio Okumura (who has much more depth than the protagonist) and Phelis Mehpisto (who will keep you guessing and in suspense for the entire duration of the series). The animation is remarkable and the background score definitely makes the show gripping at the crucial moments, making you hooked onto the series despite the simplistic story. The choreography of several action sequences has also been executed with great sophistication, which makes the show all the more enjoyable. Overall the show is visually appealing, and a good way to pass some time. However, it comes nowhere close to pulling off emotional scenes or character development as compared to Naruto. Therefore, all in all this series is definitely good, just not one of the best out there.",

I think I had to get through the first few episodes of story setup before I really started enjoying it. \r\nHowever, I did come to love the characters quite a lot. Also, I loved watching Rin learn about his powers and himself and Yukio. His character development was really amazing. \r\nFrom what I read, the last eight episodes of this first season isn't in the manga, which is kind of a shame because I actually really liked the ending of the first season. I thought the characters' developments came to a nice close forthe season while still leaving some plot holes open for the future. All in all, the first season of Blue Exorcist was amazing. I definitely recommend watching it.",

It's just... there.The magic, as well as it's place in the world is solid. The main character, Rin, is a protagonist you would want to root for. The lore of the world is extensive. The villains and obstacles are varied and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a great concept, and offers something new to your list, as it isn't just \"generic.\" I love the concept as a whole, but as far as the execution of those ideas, it falls short. I simply did not find it to have the staying power of other anime to want to come back and watch more.\\n\\n\r\nBlue Exorcist is definitely worth your time. However, I cannot see it as being much more than something that is on in the background, or a series to watch until you find something you actually want to get into.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a solid 6/10.",

After he finds out when he's older and goes through a tragic incident, Rin applies goes to True Cross Academy to become an exorcist, and makes friends, enemies, and complicated relationships along the way, while also learning how to control his powers and emotions through friendship and bravery.\r\nWhat I love about this show is that it has a powerful lesson about self control. Rin learns throughout the series that in order to win fights, he must control himself instead of going berserkagainst his enemy, focusing on simply destroying his enemy. I also love the creativity of the show, the story is imaginative and the designs for the demons are very unique, ranging from adorable to terrifying.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also handles it's emotional moments really well. I have to admit, there were a couple of moments in the show where I got a little teary eyed because I could relate to the message about trusts in friendships a lot, since I have trust issues because of how my previous friends treated me in the past. I gets to me on a personal level and I admire that the show does that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ao no Exorcist is one of my favourite animes, and I give it a 9/10, for its creativity, loveable characters, and very well handled emotional moments which reach to me personally.",

Uhh not really but the only spoiler I would see is when I was referring to a scene, that's about it..\r\nBlue Exorcist also known as Ao No Exorcist is a fine wine anime for any shounen fan out there, or maybe someone who just desire for Shounen for the first time. Published by A-1 Pictures (Fairy Tail, Magi: The Kingdom of Magic, and numerous titles), Blue Exorcist delivers enjoyment along with its varietyof characters including AWESOME animation. The main focus is the ironic idea of a demon killing demons; not just any random demon, including Satan as well. The first episode jumps immediately into the storyline, which grabbed my attention (considering most animes doesn\u2019t do that). The dope soundtrack produced by Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Kill La Kill) keeps bringing that fire through the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis 25 episode anime had an original ending, although I feel one of the weaknesses of Blue Exorcist it felt a tad bit rushed and unfocused. Another weakness would be, there were many unnecessary filler episodes, but hey at least they do focus on the other characters (firing up on each character's development). Overall the series conclusion was not focused on until the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure as I mentioned before the series offers a great variety of characters along with different personalities, and most of the filler episodes help characterize them. Each character is seen as they own person, each with just the right amount of screen time (not too much nor too little). Perhaps one could relate themselves to another character because of this?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an anime with a simple yet fire storyline(pun intended) , then I highly recommend Blue Exorcist. The scenes themselves will have you speechless, while others might have you dying of laughter (One scene would be (Spoiler Alert): where the group is camping and Yukio Okumura is going on about the rules and such, he also mention Kirigakura Shura birthday, which she cut him off by throwing an empty drink can and said \u201cUh-oh my hand slip,\u201d thus angering Yukio and he replied \u201cCut the shit and get to work already\u201d she then said \u201cLook I made him mad.\u201d Considering the fact she was drunk makes it funnier.) \\n\\n\r\nUpon watching this series you would want to immediately continue to the next episode, until you reached the ending. Whether you may be an anime veteran or just a plain rookie on the sidelines, you would fall in love with this series.",

As a result, everyone is extremely scared of him or wants to kill him, which is what makes it so interesting.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nNo, it's not the most original thing ever. But this kind of outline story always leaves room for the author (of the manga) or director (of the show) to place their own twist on it.\r\nOne of my rules for any anime is, if I'm not enraptured by the first episode, I don't watch it. Yup, I'm picky like that. However, this one just yanked me right in. Forget the loopholes(which, by the way, there isn't any); every episode will make you watch the next up until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe main aspect I want to talk about is the females. The female portrayal is excellent in my opinion; I've never seen a (relatively new) anime that has such a variety. Usually, the females are for fanservice so they all have that same cutesy look. And I'm talking about multiple animes, not just one show. But this show has more quality to it and it really shows. And not just the character art, but the other demons and the scenery as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI'm not one to judge for sound. When the music stands out, I can give it praise and a higher rating but this one was pretty normal as any show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nDespite the MC being a demon and all, he's utterly realistic and has his flaws. Yes, ladies and gentlemen: flaws. He gets beat up all the time and every time he stands back up, you can see the character development. That's right! Character development! The other characters were developed as well as they warmed up to their strange friend.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI will say: I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Is it the best? Well...no. But it isn't the show's fault. This was my first shounen, and it was quite interesting, but because of the target audience there were some things that were missing that I wanted more of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIf I were you, I would give the first episode a try. It's a good length, so if you like it the show will hold for a while. Every episode is equally as good as the last and despite some flaws here and there, it really was a solid 9/10 for me.",

            "content": "This is definitely something. Just after watching first two episodes, I am already so hooked into it.\r\nThere\u2019s a very long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nEvery element used in the story are no doubt made sophisticatedly which make the storylines so very interesting and so damn exciting. The plot is really something to look forward to and so every revelation is so anticipating. The drama is not overly done. And I believe it is very rare to see Shounen or action stories with a very well-made drama because most have very clich\u00e9 dramatic moments or it is very tragic. I don\u2019t think making the dramatic element overthe top is necessary just to make viewers cry over it. The humor is genuinely funny as well. Because the storylines are so interesting and exciting, there are absolutely no dull moments in the series. You won\u2019t get bored in any second of it. And I also love series that tackles stories about who\u2019s right or wrong, the good or bad. That kind of storyline is always interesting because it is not merely about who\u2019s right or wrong but there\u2019s always a twist in it. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nCharacters that have dark or evil sides are always a sure hit because it is definitely interesting to see them fight that side of them. Even more interesting because they are playing the fine line of being good and evil, much like Naruto and Ichigo. But this is quite different because it is the opposite. The protagonist does not only have an evil side but he is a demon himself. This is no longer a fight of who you are but a fight of what you are since the beginning of your life and that is really interesting in so many ways. Some characters are really entertaining and some are very mysterious but definitely all of them are interesting in their own way. Most of the characters are really mysterious but I think Mephisto is the most mysterious of all, even more than Rin himself. I just love characters that give you a hard time understanding them or predicting what they are really up to. You just can\u2019t be sure if they are an ally or an enemy. One of the things that I love about this series is that it is not only about the main characters. Every character has their story focused so it becomes more and more interesting and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout OKUMURA YUKIO\\n\r\nOf course let\u2019s not forget to talk about the very gorgeous Yukio. He\u2019s the responsible and mature one compared to his older brother. He looks so hot when he\u2019s wearing his teacher\u2019s uniform and even hotter when he\u2019s fighting with his gun. The combination of glasses, coat, guns and some cold yet kind attitude are just making him even more irresistible. And the fact that he\u2019s the one who takes care of his brother despite the fact that he\u2019s the younger one, makes him so admirable. Plus, the voice of Jun Fukuyama, one of the most talented seiyu ever, is absolutely perfect for his character. Jun is so amazing when it comes to characters with authority roles and of course the smart ones as well. Yes, much like Lellouch.\\n\\n\r\nAbout OKUMURA RIN\\n\r\nRin\u2019s character might be typical for a protagonist in a Shounen type of series but he\u2019s definitely interesting in so many ways. And of course, the most interesting about him is the fact that he is the son of Satan. I also love his very hot-blooded yet still kind-hearted personality. He\u2019s also very positive considering that almost everyone is afraid and even trying to kill him. Plus, he\u2019s so cute with his demon characteristics like his fangs, ears, and tail. He\u2019s definitely one of the cutest demons I\u2019ve ever seen. And he can be so funny as well. Despite of what he is, Rin has a genuine kind heart. That would be because of how he was raised. This really shows that it is not about what you are but what you have become. As clich\u00e9 as it may seem but it really doesn\u2019t matter if ones true self keeps on crawling out because if one is raise with genuine love and warmth, he\u2019ll be just fine. That\u2019s the very reason why, even when Shiro Fujimoto is already gone he\u2019s character is still very much significant to the growth of not only Rin but to all of those that loves him and carries his values.\\n\\n\r\nAbout OKUMURA TWINS\\n\r\nAnother thing that I love about this series is that it is also a story about brotherly bond and love which I really love particularly if it\u2019s quite different from the typical ones. Both are very different and complement one another. The older brother is the hot-blooded, immature, nasty, and simple-minded one while the younger is the calm, mature, sophisticated, and smart one. They argue a lot but it only shows how much they really care for each other. But one thing for sure, both are extremely so cool when they are fighting. Imagine a combination of a swordsman and a gunman. What\u2019s cooler than that? Their relationship is different yet so cute and admiring. And my goodness, these twins are the most gorgeous looking twins I\u2019ve ever seen. I think the biggest difference between the two would be that though Yukio is the smart one, he\u2019s judgment is easily clouded as so he\u2019s easily manipulated compared to Rin who has a strong resolve that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t let what others think of him affect him nor tell him what to do or to believe.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been itching to say it so let me just first mention that the characters are one of the most gorgeous looking characters I\u2019ve ever seen in my countless encounter with hundreds of different animes. And the most gorgeous, hottest, and coolest are the Okumura Twins. I can\u2019t even tell who\u2019s more gorgeous with the two because both equally have their own hotness into them. I am already snapping tons of pictures just after watching the first 5 episodes of it. The animation is just beyond amazing. This is one of the very few series that has a genuine elevated animation much like High School of the Dead. With its very amazing fight scenes, I even think that it will not only compete on par with some of the famous animes of today but can even win over them. This is the reason why I am so damn grateful to see these latest series. I am just so glad that I am living at an age when animations are these amazing. And to think it will only get better and better as the years go by. And let\u2019s not forget the superb uniforms that give more coolness and gorgeousness to the characters. And as if that\u2019s not enough, this series has a major gathering of the most talented seiyus of all time which is extremely rare. By the way, the idea of blue flames instead of red flames is so unique and makes the series a lot cooler.\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely get it why this series is so damn famous. And I totally understand why everybody is saying the same thing; WHY THE HELL THERE\u2019S ONLY 25 FREAKING EPISODES? I am having a hard time understanding why there are not so great animes that are still ongoing but amazing animes like this one ends so quickly. Come on! At least make it 50 or 100 episodes or better yet continue adapting it into animation until the end like those famous anime of today. It is so complete; heart-warming drama, a little bit of romance, comedy, nice dialogues, amazing storyline and plot, interesting and likeable characters, gorgeous-looking and fashionable characters, talented seiyus, great sounds, one of the best animation of today, and of course, tons of heart-pounding fight scenes and actions.\\n",

            "content": "So, at first, I want to mention that this is my first review, and that my English is quite average because I'm French... But I hope it will help some people who wants to know if this anime worth it or not. \r\n-Story : 8/10\r\nThe story is really, really basic at the beginning. At first, I really thought \"Oh, shit, just an other typical shonen story...\". I'll try to don't spoil a lot, but I have to talk about the story in this part, of course, that's quite rational I suppose. It is the story of Rin. Him and his brother are the son ofSatan. One day, the man who have adopt him is killed by Satan... So Rin make the choice to become an exorcist and to kill his father for his revanche.\\n\r\nYeah, it's a really average story, so why did I put a 8 ? Because this is just the beginning. The most you watch the anime, the most the story become good, and a great plot against Rin and his brother is starting. So, even if at first you can think that the story is average, it become really good !\\n\\n\r\n-Art : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is really good in Ao no Exorcist. At first, the charadesign is really good : boys are bishies, shy girls are cute, badass girls are sexy... But I really want to talk about the Gehene door. Everytime you see it, you can see the beautiful 3D Art.\\n\r\nThe color are good too : dark in the sad or important moment, but the characters have all bright color compared to the background.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're listening to an Ao no Exorcist OST, then you are listening the sound of true EPICNESS. The OST are just magical. Fight music are all really EPIC, and it really adapt you to the mood of the moment. My favorites are all the Symphonic Suite Devil Movement. If you haven't watch the anime, just listen to this, and then think that the anime is as EPIC as this fabulous OST and technically you'll really want to watch the anime after that. \\n\r\nThere are \"basic\" OST too and they really make you enter in the mood of the funny moment (yes because Ao no Exorcist is quite funny), so I think they're really good too, because the real goal of an OST is to adapt your mood to the moment and to make your feels stronger, right ?\\n\\n\r\n-Character : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is the strong point of the anime : the character. Because you can have beautiful art and beautiful music, but if all the characters are boring, then the anime will be bad. \\n\r\nBut here, the characters are fantastic.\\n\r\nAt first, there is Rin and his brother, Yukyo. These two are really great main characters. Rin can seem a little stupid at first, and he is a really a sort of clod, but in fact, he has a big heart, and he'll try to prove in all the anime that, even if he is the son of Satan, he just want to protect his friends. \\n\r\nYukyo is quite the intellectual. In fact, he is even a prodigy, he is the youngest exorcist, and has always train himself because he want to protect his brother.\\n\r\nThe relationship between this two characters is really strange, with hate and love, even if we can't really talk about shonen-ai. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there is the \"basic\" characters, like the boy who want his revenge because Satan killed all his familly, the really shy but cute girl, or the tsundere who doesn't know how to be nice with peoples.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course there are other really interesting characters, like Mephisto Pheles. With his gentleman-looking air and his little tricks, it's hard to say if he is a bad guy or a nice guy until the end of the story. \\n\r\nThere is Arthur too, who can seem to be a bad guy at first, but who's in fact only obeying to the orders...\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you want just one good reason to watch Ao no Exorcist, do it for all the fantastic characters !\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It makes you laugh and cry, and sometimes I even got shiver because of the epicness ! I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI could put a 10, but I've watched better shonen that Ao no Exorcist...\\n\r\nBut it really is a great anime, so if you were hesitating, you should watch it, because this anime is totally awesome and you won't regret it !",

            "content": "This is an anime I picked up on a whim, I'm glad that I kept my expectations low. Every aspect of this show is average, though that can be an understatement with regard to certain elements. Let me elaborate.\r\nTo begin with, Ao no Exorcist's story is nothing to write home about. As can be gleaned from the synopsis, it is your typical shounen with a reckless underage hero who is tasked with saving the world from (literally) all evil. Candidly speaking, the 'demon-who-is-oblivious-to-his-true-identity' archetype to which the protagonist belongs is overused. However, this is not to say that the story is 'bad'. It just endsup being a little too predictable and fails to create a lasting impression. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters also fall into well defined archetypes. For example, there is Yukio, the nerdy younger brother of the protagonist, the wise father Fujimoto and the usual bunch of tsunderes, tough guys, weaklings and the like. The only character who stands a little above the rest is the buxom, Kirigakura (yes, she is used for fanservice). In some situations, she is the only voice of reason among the often over-emotional cast. But as is the case with most shounen anime, being audacious when there is no apparent need for the same is considered admirable. A trait which I find very irritating. Not helping matters is the fact that only the protagonist is developed during the course of the series. That too, in a very predictable manner. It is very clear from the beginning that Okimura Rin is the demonic savior of humanity All in all, this is an average cast with passable group dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and and animation...well, they are hit and miss at best. There are some slick action sequences which are animated with very good particle effects. Alongside these is some truly horrible CGI. For example, there is one scene near the end in which insect-like demons explode through an opening in the ground. The whole thing is done in CGI and you can actually see the difference in frame rate between the 3D and 2D portions. This renders the whole scene a broken feel. The character designs are more consistent and generally well done. The blue flames that surround demonic characters lend them an imposing presence. \\n\\n\r\nAurally, Ao no Exorcist is pretty good. The Japanese voice cast does an an almost flawless job. My personal favorite is Rina Satou , as Kirigakura. The soundtrack is also good, although it isn't as emphasized as it should be in the series. I especially liked the second ending 'Wired Life' by Meisa Kuroki.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Exorcist is by no stretch of imagination what I would call a good anime. Sure, it has its moments, but they're too far apart and disjointed from each other to amount to anything. Add to this, the visual inconsistencies and the under-emphasized OST. One can deduce that it had a lot of potential. But in the end, no aspect of the anime creates enough of an impression to make it worth your while. Unless of course, you are a hardcore fan of of the shounen genre or are relatively new to the medium\\n",

            "content": "I want to start this review by saying that I loved the first sixteen to twenty episodes of this show.  Now I will begin the break down of the show.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story seems generic but don't let that fool you into believing this is a generic show.  The plot revolves around the son of satan and his desire to become an exorcist after the death of his step-father.  The first episode won me over as it had humor and drama in good combinations.  Over the course of the anime the humor gradually declined and in the last few episodes the humor wasat such a minimum there were times I thought I was watching a different show altogether.  If the show had remained consistently brilliant even to the end I would have given the score of 9.  The ending, however, was disappointing and felt rushed beyond measure so I give the overall story a 7.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI loved the art style of this show.  The highlight of this style is revealed when people on the show undergo demonic possession.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music for the show was forgettable, the sound effects in general were well placed.  Nothing major to say there.  The voice actors that stood out were Hiroshi Kamiya as Mephisto Pheles/Johann Faust and   \\n\r\nNobuhiko Okamoto as the lead character Rin Okumura.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the true driving force behind why I loved this show.  All the characters are fleshed out to make them unique.  My favorite character on the show is the supporting character Mephisto Pheles due to his ambiguous attitude and overall charisma.  As the series progresses you get a look deeper into some character back stories and most of these are well done.  The bad characters are interesting too for the most part especially Amaimon and Satan himself.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the show until the last few episodes; the mood changed far too much by this point in my view.  If the show wasn't rushed to an ending the enjoyment would have been far greater.",
