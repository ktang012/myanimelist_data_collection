            "content": "A strong cast of characters is sometimes all that is needed. \r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (referred to as HenNeko henceforth) is a romantic comedy that knows its own strengths. Rather than focusing solely on panties, cleavage and harem tropes (oh, there's still plenty of that), it delivers a genuinely refreshing experience that cleverly combines its moe appeal with a strong cast of characters. \r\nThe story follows Yokodera Youto and his hidden perversions. Hidden, of course, as joining the track club solely to gape at girls is not considered socially acceptable behavior. He conceals these thoughts under a facade, acting in part as the averagehighschooler so that his intentions are not misunderstood. But eventually, as just about any teenager would, he grows tired of behaving like somebody that he is not. He decides to visit a purportedly wish-granting statue to ask that he can simply be himself, and in doing so entangles himself with the fate of another: Tsukiko, who instead wishes to conceal her emotions. \\n\\n\r\nImmediately, you will probably find yourself thinking how silly this sounds. And you would not be wrong-- it is very much silly. The entire notion that a cat statue can somehow grant wishes (and just about any wish, really) is supremely contrived and difficult to accept. But HenNeko seldom takes this aspect seriously. There are still the occasional moments of melodrama here and there marring the overall experience, but provided you are not looking for anything more than some lighthearted fun, it is easy enough to tolerate the lacklustre storytelling. Perhaps not forgive, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the story is not necessarily that it is poorly written or abundant with plotholes, but that it relies solely on the cat statue to get anywhere. Characters don't resolve issues or develop on their own-- the statue does it for them. If it's time for some drama, hey, why not have a character wish for something inconvenient? And they do. Again and again. It becomes entirely predictable by the end. How is the audience supposed to empathize with a story that feels so artificial, so reliant upon a single plot device? It is almost too bad that a wish-granting statue doesn't exist in the real world; it could have been used to wish away the show's own issues. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the characters are enough to amend the otherwise juvenile storytelling. Aside from the lustful Yokodera, HenNeko consists primarily of three female characters: Tsukiko, the ojou-sama Azuki Azusa (she's referred to by her full name for some reason), and Tsukushi, Tsukiko's violent older sister. Chances are that if you have any potential interest in the series, moe is one of the first things that you are looking for. And HenNeko provides plenty in that regard. Hell, it is the embodiment of moe. Tsukiko may just be one of the cutest characters in anime history, though Azuki Azusa is certainly no slouch either. The only issue is that Tsukiko's seiyuu overblows the dandere trope. She sounds less monotone and more like an android. \\n\\n\r\nIn standard harem fare, they all come to love Yokodera in some way or another. It is justified in the case of Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa, but Tsukishi's infatuation is shoehorned in from nowhere. It also baffles the mind why she somehow believes that Yokodera and his mythical younger brother (which is just a bluff of his) are separate people, despite looking, sounding and behaving identically. Somehow she is collectively the most dense and mature character of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Yokodera, he is actually one of the series' strongest points. For the harem genre where the protagonist is almost invariably some blockhead with the supernatural ability to inadvertently undress girls in mid-air, a comment like that may as well be considered nonsense. But Yokodera defies the genre's mold. He is honest, knows how to communicate with people, does not run away screaming at the sight of panties, and most importantly, has a brain. He is able to instill value to his interaction with the girls and as a result (Tsukishi excluded) their feelings for him seem authentic rather than forced. HenNeko could just as easily have been another insipid harem title if Yokodera behaved like every other harem lead, but thankfully it is a show that understands the importance of a quality protagonist. I just wonder why other harem titles haven't learned the same. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, HenNeko is pleasing to the eye and uses thick lines to give the show its own visual charm. Character designs are considerably appealing and while the art fidelity may not be enough to impress, it still does the job just fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound also leaves little to be desired. The seiyuu are spectacular all around with veterans like Yukari Tamura and newer names like Kaori Ishihara providing their own personality to the female characters. Yuki Kaji lends his talents to the role of Yokodera and does a stellar job overall (though initially causes some concern for previously voicing a number of aggravating protagonists). And while the background music is restrained and rarely noticeable, the opening and ending sequences are infectiously catchy and adorable. It would be insanity to skip them. \\n\\n\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko does not tread any new ground, but what it fails to provide in creativity it makes up for with a solid cast of characters. If you are expecting a decent story, deep themes or anything beyond some nice lighthearted fun, you will be sorely disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAs for fun, though? There are few better ways to spend an afternoon.",

            "content": "You know one of those days when you're feeling down and is hunting for something, anything to calm your moody day? Well, that hunt might not be easy but if Henneko is something on your hit list, then you might of hit a bulls-eye. That's because this is an anime that will brighten the mood of your moody day. In more ways than one, Henneko caters to the fantasies of a young teenager. It focuses more on Youto Yokodera, a young boy who is going through the journey of adolescence. What he seems to be more interested than sports or academics though is of theopposite sex. Thus begin the story, a tale of The \"Hentai\" Prince and the Stony Cat.\\n\\n\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. (also known as The \"Hentai\" Prince and the Stony Cat) is an anime series based off the light novel and manga of the same name. No contrary to its title, this is NOT a hentai. Rather, it's about a young boy named Youto Yokodera who got nicknamed with the infamous title of the \u201cHentai Prince\u201d after making a certain wish onto a particuarly gifted Stony Cat. Sounds strange right? Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nComing into this series, I already knew what may be expected. It doesn't take long for any viewer to realize this is a typical romantic comedy. The twist here is that it involves some magic at works in the form of the Stony Cat. So begins this strange tale, the story of the Hentai Prince. Note that not everything starts out like this though. In fact, while it's obvious that Youto is seen a pervert to viewers, the series doesn't directly depict these traits until after he makes his wish to the Stony Cat. It's the result of a wish he made and there's a saying that always stays true: be careful what you wish for. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Youto , he isn't very careful and now has to deal with the consequences. \\n\\n\r\nFor Youto, the boy is naturally a pervert. He likes to read 'ecchi' magazines of perverted nature. He joined the track team so that he can actually see the girls in their swimsuits (the pool is close to the tracks). And of course, he often references to shows that he watches to heighten his interests. Despite his faults though,Youto  at the same time is also shown to be a kind boy who often comes to the aid of others especially his female friends. He also seems to be somewhat clever with a crafty mind as he is able to manipulate a certain track leader into believing some obvious false ideas. Needless to say, Youto is the type of boy that's hard to be friends with unless you know his true visage. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the people Youto meets in the series includes the adorable Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi. Being presented as both the mascot as well as the main female character, she is the younger sister of the Steel King and someone that accidentally also falls in the case of 'be careful what you wish for' category. Unlike Yuto, the wish she called for made her emotionless. Now, she is like a cat but without the excitement. At the same time, it seems that she and Youto has a sort of deal to get back what they've lost. It's a relationship of awkwardness and benefits all the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, Youto also establishes connections with other characters in particular with a school beauty named Azusa. As an animal lover, she is admired as a school idol, a wealthy lady, and someone who is to be respected by everyone. Despite her outer self, Azusa seems to be quite insecure with herself and often mistrusts people because of her past. Her first encounter with Youto seems to be some sort of fate because for the first time, we see her insecurities manifest thanks to Youto and his new personality granted by the Stony Cat. So much for being a goddess...\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows more of a story arc telling format rather than a straight out story. However, the most common features of each episode involves Youto and what he does with his new situation. Of the many new changes in his life, one is his more closeness to three of the main female characters in the series. Youto gets closer with Azusa, Tsukushi (the \u201cSteel King\u201d), and Tsukiko as each episode progresses. Despite being labeled as the 'hentai prince', Youto is also surprisingly reliable at key situations. His reliability as well as ability to help others earns him more affections from the girls. As a matter fact, they seems to see the better side of him and even goes to lengths to return the favor at various points. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a whole cluster of moments and gags that calls out 'cute' throughout every episode. The opening song itself is one with the expressions of our main characters. Its animal-like gestures, high pitched vocals, and moe artwork paints this series as a headline for cuteness. It doesn't stop there either with the cutey artwork. There's the way that Tsukiko moves and way she eats that are formulated from the extra gags. Among other moments, there's the tsundere-like behavior of Azusa where she flatly denies what's really on her mind. Speaking of which, Azusa herself also shows her love of animals. Whether you're an animal lover or not, the show goes to portray many analogies. A clear example is Tsukiko likeness of a cat while Azusa seems to be fond of dogs. Naturally, the two sides don't get along just like the two girls. And naturally, Youto is the center of the drama when it comes to the duo.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series having many comedy moments, there is also some serious times when we see that characters are more troubled than what they seem to be. Azusa is one of those characters especially with her past and Youto does his best to help her out. Then, there's also the tensions between the two sisters that balances between silliness and moody at various circumstances. It's hard to take them serious but at the same time, it's clear that there's something deeper going on between them.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the series is cute, there's many overused themes of a typical romantic comedy in Henneko that might turn some viewers off. There's plenty of fan service like the traditional beach episode. In fact, because the school has a pool, it's natural that the girls will be in their swimsuits. Therefore, expect some of those gratuitous outfits to hit the screen some time here and there. Among other little gags in the series are the various misunderstandings. In one fact, among one of these misunderstandings turns into more of a serious admiration for the Steel King. Furthermore, the Steel King is portrayed as the sex symbol of the show with her well developed body (thanks to her status as president of the track team) and sexy moans during exercises. It turns the physical education class into a theme of fan service and one that is presented clearly with both the vocals and visuals. It doesn't stop there either as we also have the master/servant like relationship, the repetitive tsundere-like behavior of Azusa, and later on seemingly a harem being under construction by our hentai prince.\\n\\n\r\nFor J.C. Staff production, this series makes usage of its more colorful atmosphere. The way artwork is enforced throughout the series brings out the fairy tale-like cuteness of most of the characters. It is not realistic but rather overly flows with cuteness and moe. Given the setting of the romantic comedy genre, it does fit the overall idea. I'm not sure what the objective it's trying to achieve but if cuteness was one of them, it nailed it on the spot. At other times though, it tries way too hard and the characters' designs are generic. The petite figure, the flat chest, and the well developed bodies for our three main female characters shapes the different sides of this anime. There's nothing unique to see here but it's kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series clearly is lighthearted. It also seems that a lot of times, it puts more effort into each and every single tiny moment to bring out the cute factors. These can also turn into more lewd moments such as our Steel King and her erotic moans. It does match though with our small cast of main characters and the way they portray is also expressed in their voice actors/actresses. The softness of Tsukiko's voice is a more prominent example as we can clearly see that she lost most of her emotions. Finally, both the OP and ED songs of this series brings out cuteness and moe at its best. The way the OP song is overflowed with adorable moments and gif worthy material. The ED song fits with the same flow with the dancing moments of Tsukiko and her adorable outfits. It's needless to say that in terms of audio features, Henneko brings out 'cuteness' at its best.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the end game of this series is how you might decide to watch Henneko. If cuteness is something you're looking for to brighten up that moody day you just had, then this series is definitely something to hit the play button on. Otherwise, enjoyment can come in different shapes and sizes. For one thing though, the series itself is hard to take serious even with its more moody moments. The fan service and little fun gags can give different results depending on how you view them. Otherwise, Henneko is a series that is probably not a masterpiece for me. I might forget it in the future. However, those cuteness and adorable moments are hard to take my eyes off of.",

            "content": "For an anime with such an evocative title, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is actually a fairly...acceptably clean slice-of-life comedy with some really, really bizarre plot twists and characters. A harem-type anime, HenNeko tries to break the archetype by just being extremely weird, but still keeping comedy and romance at a harem-type best. While it may be a bit overly \"fuwa fuwa\" in both art and character design, Hentai Ouji delivers a compelling and hilarious story of a misunderstood high-school boy and his series of mishaps with the girls around him, all controlled by a mysterious cat statue. Definitely a good anime.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (9/10)\r\nSound (7/10)\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is definitely Hentai Ouji's unique point. The Warawanai Neko acts as the wildcard of the anime, allowing the plot of the anime to justify extending infinitely in any direction. Basically, since the Warawanai Neko can grant any wish at a cost (think Tsubasa Chronicles), anything is game and the world can be destroyed at the whim of the characters. Of course, the foundation of the plot is still the whole \"high-school-boy-with-a-bunch-of-girls-in-love-with-him\", but that's what a harem-type anime is and, frankly, it never gets old. As long as there's enough variation and excitement to distinguish the story, which author Sou Sagara did admirably. Anime, manga, and light novel are all consistent with regards to storyline, which is fantastic. Only grievance? The plot gets pretty wild at times, so the story gets somewhat difficult to follow.\\n\\n\r\nRound, chubby, cute and fluffy. Four words to describe this anime's art style. Just look at the OP - the artists were clearly trying to give people heart attacks. Naturally, not everyone likes this kind of art style. I will agree, sometimes an anime too based in this kind of cuteness becomes hard to watch (I'm sorry, K-On!). But the art is good - you can't deny that. It's really encouraging to see an anime where the artists were clearly given ample time to draw, design, and really give the characters life. \\n\\n\r\nThe music fits with the art style, but it takes the puffiness to another level. Lots of bells, tinkles, and chimes. Half of the OST seems to be played on the xylophone. Creates a great mood, but the theme limits the songs to be just \"cute\" pieces instead of timeless tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Hentai Ouji are full of various controversies. They are...quite stereotypical. The perverted high schoolboy. The silent Nagato-type. The tsundere. The yandere. The little sister. Classic tried and true roles, yes, but almost no effort given to move the characters even a bit out of their roles. The perveted main character, especially, while not often used, is a difficult character role to pull of because of the divided mixed reactions it usually receives - either people love it or hate it. And its still a commonly-used mold. The only character that seems to be a bit unique is Ponta - it's been a while since a side-character's given up hedonism for world peace.\\n\\n\r\nBUT.\\n\\n\r\nThey are so well developed, it's hard not to love them. Despite their actions being predictable, despite their words being overused, despite the fact that you could probably guess every next move in the entire anime, the characters are developed in such a way that you really appreciate them in all their cliche-ness. I particularly like the amount of work and detail they put into Asuna's character - she's beyond the normal tsundere and in a class of her own.\\n\\n\r\nWhether laughing at Yokodera's antics or empathizing with Tsukiko's issues, the anime is quite able to bring the story alive and deliver it in an enjoyable package. The anime moves at a rapid pace - 4 episodes managed to knock out the entire first volume of the series. This change of pace is well-needed, and its refreshing to see Yokodera completing routes so quickly. The ending was one of the best conclusions to a 12-episode anime I have ever seen, nicely wrapping up the plotline while offering a sweet and memorable scene. Any ending that can make characters seem even cooler than they already were is a great ending in my book.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nAll in all, HenNeko is a great anime to watch - funny, charming, and crazy. Would recommend this to anyone in need of some new anime to track in 2013.",

            "content": "Usually, anything with the word \"hentai\" in it is instantly thrown out the window for most people, as its word association is for the most part, is towards porn, as hentai means \"pervert\" in the japanese language.  Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko, or the hentai prince and stony cat in english uses that word in such a way, that it almost means nothing, in this pretty damn good rom-com.\r\nStory (8.05/10): The story of Hentai Ouji (simplifying the title), bases itself around Youto Yokodera, an open pervert, as many can guess from the title.  Through a series of circumstances involving the best friend charactergiving up his pervert ways, and Youto's own desire to be open about being perverted, as well as hearing about a wish granting cat statue thing, Youto meets a girl named Tsukiko, who attempts to also make a wish, only to find out that both of them are discontent with their new lives, and make a pact about getting back what is theirs.  \\n\\n\r\nAbove all, this story is as imaginative and original as they come.  Personally, I have never seen a story quite like this before, and because of that, it piqued my interest.  However, it should be noted that that story only pertains to about 3 or so episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime's plotline is split in about 3 or so arcs where it mainly focuses on 3 of the main characters.  (The last one arguably focuses on 2 at one time.)   Each of the arcs having their own separate focus as a whole.  It's to the point that since the anime stems so far from the original idea, that the story becomes a completely different thing altogether.  However, though this sounds like a terrible thing, the story actually fits together really well, and provides a very good viewing experience.  Personally, I liked how the anime went, because I was never really bored with it at all.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.45/10): These characters are actually pretty damn good.  First, the hentai prince, Youto Yokodera.  First of all, why is it always the perverted guy in anime, that always somehow gets the girls?  Youto is a very interesting character as his pervertedness throughout the whole series is almost non-existent.  Sure, he has porn mags, an obsession with having Tsukiko as his little sister, and above all, has perverted thoughts, but as a whole, he never seems to actually portray that too much.  Rather, he's actually a really kind and nice character.  However, he does at times act a bit denser then he should be. (as all male protagonists are)  His character does get fleshed out at the end of the series, and really provides a nice backstory for him, adding to why he's actually a pretty good character.  \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, backstory is a huge thing that this anime does really well.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiko, as the main female lead, is one of the more...interesting kuuderes in anime.  Because of her wish, she became emotionless, showing absolutely no different tone in her voice, no emotions, no embarrassed facial expression, well, you get the point.  Unlike most female characters that refuse to admit they like someone, Tsukiko...cannot.  Because she literally has no emotions at all, the denseness that Youto has when talking to her makes a lot of sense, as you really can't tell what she's actually feeling at that moment in time.  While yes, she is a good character, seeing as how she acts as Youto's voice of reason, as well as being extremely cute, they never really solve her problem in the anime, basically turning her into this emotionless doll, as they forget her whole purpose for meeting Youto as they did, and essentially, making the original idea of the story, null.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters like my personal favorite, Azusa and Tsukushi also have their part in the grand scheme of things, becoming the other 2 aforementioned main cast, and have very good fleshed out characteristics, that make their characters really good.   \\n\\n\r\nVarious other characters, act as pretty good supporting cast, adding in more to the story, as well as fleshing out the main 4 characters more, which they excel at doing.  Above all, the characters are definitely this anime's strong suit, and it really shows it clearly.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art (7.25/10 and 7.48/10): The sound for this anime is somewhat generic I would say.  It sounds really adorable, I will give it that, and the mood fillers for the anime do sound good and very appropriate for where they're placed.  The OP and ED I would say are good but not overly fantastic.  It's nice to listen to, and the lyrics are as cute and adorable as they would come, but I wouldn't say it would be something that you would remember for a long time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art I would say is above average.  The art is very light colored and somewhat moe heavy, as the majority of the female cast are in fact, moe.  The characters themselves aren't too overcomplicated in terms of design, and are definitely crisp in their design as well.  It's very simplistic and very nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.67/10): Hentai Ouji to Warawani neko is definitely your above-average rom-com/harem show.  (It gets a bit haremy towards the end.)  Personally, I was never bored with the series, and enjoyed watching every moment.  The comedy is pretty funny, I love the characters, and the story was plenty deep and interesting to keep me watching.  I did feel that the story felt a bit incomplete, and would've liked to see more, but for the most part, I'm happy with what I watched.  I did feel like it went a bit side-story like towards the middle; as well as losing a significant amount of its original idea as the story progressed, but it did finish itself quite nicely, and I will say that I was somewhat pleased on how the characters, and everything else turned out in the end.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a rom-com/harem/ecchi (there's not that much) show; or anyone that enjoys a good drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.89/10.  \\n\\n\r\nStill hoping for a second season so we could fix Tsukiko.  It sorta pissed me off seeing that she was never fixed.",

But I'm pleasantly surprised with what I've seen in the first 5 episodes. \r\nBy far the best feature of the show is the comedy. The extreme bluntness of the main characters speeches have me laughing my ass off in the first couple of episodes. \"So I offered up my dutch wife and all my lust disappeared like I'd just had a fantastic fap!\" \r\n The character interactions are incredibly interesting for an anime of this genre. They each havethere own unique characteristics that really help differentiate this from just another school harem. From the violent but gullible Tsukushi, to the emotionless, unreactive Tsukiko and the fantastic rants from Youto. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I think this show may be trying for the award of \"most unpronounceable character name of all time\" With \"Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko\" (Try saying that 5 times).\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside, while the fanservice isn't excessive it is still prevalent in the series, particularly in the very moe openings and endings (though this may be a plus for many). There are also several very generic plot scenarios in the series, such as the old \"walking in while she's changing/washing bit\". \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't mindbogglingly good, but there are a few catchy tunes buried in there. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary the show has started strong mainly due to its strong character relationships and hilarious comedy (at least to me anyway) the series looks set to become my 'guilty pleasure' of this season, I'm hoping it stays this good for the full series and doesn't try and become more serious and through away the comedy aspect. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Boy was I in for a surprise, it turned how to be very good and was unexpected of the entertainment value I receive. How awesome would it be to have a Cat God grant any wish of your desire, but does it come with a cost?\r\nStory-8\r\nThe story centers aroud Youto Yokodera who is rather an \"average joe\" highschool student. Due to his perverted nature, his actions are always being misunderstood thus having a problem of expressing inner self. After hearing a story from achildhood friend he goes to the Cat God statue where it is said it can grant any wish but as a twist of events, there is a give and take consequence which is the downside to it. His wish was to make it impossible for him to lie to help out with his personal problem of expressing himself for a belt of a hug pillow he offered in exchange, the twist to that was he lost his facade about his perverted nature. He later realizes that this has made him painfully honest to others which has caused trouble for others and embarrassment for himself so he then teams up with his childhood friend in Tsukiko who lost her emotions due to her experience of the Cat God Statue, and they are on a mission to reverse their wishes.I also  like how unique and entertaining this anime can get with some of the most hilarious comedy scenes that you will see i assure you the story is fun simple and enjoyable \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nAbout the characters you have Youto Yokodera that has a  perverted nature but besides he is a nice and reliable person that sometimes tries to use his 'facade' to trick the other girls you also got Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi she is the tsundere type and that makes her very likeable the other characters are love interests to the main character.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nIn saying that, the animation was very fluid and maintained a good quality throughout\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nAfter you get past the opening you are all good the OST are pretty good didin't find one that piqued my interest though \\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nI really love and enjoy the story characters even the art well about the sound like i said nothing that you can remember 'avarage'' but that opening oh god maybe its just me but i really find it annoying after the end i demand a second season \\n",

            "content": "Pretty odd show with less than memorable service.\r\nI'll start off by saying that I didn't like how this show was presented. While re-watching Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko I  felt like the producers were adding too many elements to the story at once. One moment I'm hearing about the stony cat, next moment they're talking about losing facades, expressions etc. It's like, I felt that it would've  been better if they let the story plot and events unfold one at a time rather than all at once because it felt like a mess. \r\n(as much as I wanted to like them) hated thecharacters.  Generic, archetypes, expressionless character with lame over used \"sad\" or depressing backstory,  more than annoying \"Rich-ish\" Tsundere, and lastly pure vanilla, plain perverted MC you see in every other harem, romance, comedy. It's like at first I though if I gave them more time then I would open up to them and find at least one of the main characters funny, or at the  very least cute however, to my dismay, I could not. \\n\\n\r\nI seriously considered dropping this show after episode 5 because that is the  episode where I lost all interest however as a upcoming reviewer along with personal reasons its' sort of a \"No-No\" to drop a show\\n\r\nunless they are longer than 30-40 episodes. It really bothered me, or dare I say \"annoyed\" me that I couldn't find any redeeming qualities about  hentai prince and the stony cat. Characters, music, comedy, etc, none of it could really make up for the atrocity that I had been watching.\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters again, character designs were pretty interesting. When I'm looking at characters in anime I always try and point out what makes them different or unique. Sometimes it's the facial expressions, other times it's personalities, in Henneko's case it was the characters eyes. Boobs didn't stand out, panties didn't stand out, they eyes did. I found that most of the characters eyes sort of reflect their personalities. For example, Tsukiko or whatever her name was, her eyes are a dull blue which reflects and in my opinion complements her personality.... boring, expressionless personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUghh, now for my least favorite thing about Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.... the intro or opening song.. It was perhaps the most cringe-worthy and annoying-est song I've heard in a while. I mean, it's great that its' one of those intros that pretty much give you an idea about what the show is about however the actually song is just ewww! Honestly I cannot think of a single person to recommend this show to. Like it tries to be cute, tries to be a bit erotic and it just does not work. From a comedic standpoint though, it does have it's moments of laughter, however for me it's simply not enough. It doesn't make up for the rest of the terrible crap it gave to me. Overall I had to give this how a 5/10 because I just wasn't impressed with what I had just re-watched.",

And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\nI hope my review will pique your interest. I won't say any spoilers.\r\nYour common romcom, as so I thought. There is a love triangle involved, but it didn't seem like it focused much on the love. After a few episode, it seems like your common love triangle. But you know what? It's a very good romcom. I thought why stop halfway, so Ifinished it. If you watch a few episodes in the series, you already know who the it is, and that's as common as it gets honestly. But the point was it surprised me so much. I didn't expect any of this to happen. The twist and turn of events made it really, really, really enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSummary(little more in-depth):\\n\r\nYoto Yokodera, your normal pervert. Who has a problem of not showing his real emotions.  Hearing the big change and rumor of the \" stony cat \" from his equally perverted best friend. He went to see if the rumors were true. On his way, he met Tsukiko Tsusukakushi. She wanted to be more of an adult and wanted the opposite of what Yokodera wanted. The wish can remove a personality trait from someone that doesn't want it. and gives that trait to someone who needs it. Thus Yokodera found the person who has his trait. Azusa Azuki, the most attractive girl that every boy confesses to. Through the adventures of the love triangle comes of only wishes from the \"stony cat\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYoko Yokodera, the main protagonist. You already know. He's your pervert who actually meant more than what he portrays. He cannot express himself truly because his kind of actions are always misunderstood. As it said in the summary he made a wish to the \"stony cat\" but in exchange for that wish, he offered his belt. But realizes soon after that his inner thoughts causes too much problems, because he can't conceal his perverted thoughts. Though his inner thoughts can also be a sweet trait.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiko Tsutsukakushi, which is Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi younger sister. Who happens to be Yokodera's track and field club president. Her wish to the \"stony cat\" was to not show her emotions, because she was a crybaby to her sister. In return, she offered her meat bun. Being unable to express any emotions. She still enjoys time with Yokodera. Even though her emotions doesn't show. There is more to her then the wish she made.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Azuki, Popular, turned down all the boys that confessed there love for her. and is the one that has Yokodera's trait. So she can hide her emotions easily. How they met was through Yokodera's action in front of a large crowd. Though she might be your kind of popular girl. There are usually always something more to them in romcoms.\\n\\n\r\nTsukushi Tsutsukakushi, I just felt that I had to add her to this review. Since she does play a big part in the series. She's your president of the track and field club. Though she might seem like a despicable person. She actually means more than what you would think (She's pretty funny by the way).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like this anime. Like I said on my 2nd paragraph. It doesn't focus too much on the love triangle. I think it really shows that you have to understand each other as friends. What happens in the past stays in the past. You can't dwell in it forever, or change it. You just have to make it work in the present.",

            "content": "Let's get to the point - you are watching this because you like moe.  There simply is no other reason for anyone to watch it.  The story is barely coherent and the plot twists are more like back flips induced by characters to maintain a harem, create an opportunity for hit and miss comedy and create an explosion, LITERALLY AN EXPLOSION, of moe.\r\nSince we now know why you are watching let's get to the good, the bad and the moe.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nThere is no story, or not at least one meant for any decent inspiration or contemplation.  It exists only so that thereare ways for moe to be exploited like a gold mine from the girls.  Which is why I won't mention the characters as you can guess that there also just for moe and harem antics, no development you haven't seen or even care to see.  Of all the LN adaptations in the Spring of 2013, none have as badly cobbled together a piece of plot as it (even the awful Oreimo S2). Clearly a bad, but not a con because who watches moe for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe man behind the art of the series is a genius, well known in Japan for how f****** adorable he makes anime and manga girls.  Those sparkly eyes, beautiful slender bodies and triangular faces are the thing of legend.  The animation is the stock of JC's B team and not worthy of much mention other than thank god it's not like Aku no Hana.  It's average at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI could listen to both the ED and OP on loop for an age and still feel the buzz of moe, it's that irritatingly good.  Surely everyone (even guys) have sung Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call me maybe' and just as that is stuck in our heads so is HenNeko's songs.  But that alone would not garner a 10/10.  What did though is the shocking moe, made for the role, brilliant voice acting of all our leading ladies.  My personal favourite is Ishihara Kaori's Azuki Azusa.  The other great thing is that Kaiji Yuki is not Kaiji Yuki from Guilty Crown and thus not an annoying youth who shouts garbage like a dump truck.  He talks more like a regular human and thus cannot annoy people off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI hate K-ON, I hate Oreimo, I hate effectively every single moe blob show of the last 4 years but I like HenNeko. I haven't converted or anything but the sound and art so damn moe that I am enticed like a drunk virgin to a beautiful prostitute.  I just can't help it.  I don't get annoyed the same way as though shows because I have accepted the purpose of the show is to ultimately wet my pants and buy some BDs (which I will).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nIf I love it so much how can I rate it just a 6?  Because I realize that as an anime its crap but its crap that somehow I love.  Plenty of other people who have not been seduced will know its crap and its better they do.  But as I have explained its crap that I don't mind smearing my face with.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen an anime with extremely strong characters but a really weak plot?\r\nQuite a contrast, isn't it? I've seen plenty of anime with a decent plot line but really weak characters, but this is the first time I've ever seen a flip-flop like this. And perhaps you also agree, if you've already watched this show.\r\nEnter the main characters: first up, Youto Yokodera. A pervert by nature, Youto is basically every high school boy: he will do anything in his power to see girls...... well you get the point. Next up, Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi (say that five times fast). Tsukiko is an emotionless, monotonous girlwho likes to eat food (who doesn't?). Third: Azusa Azuki, a strong-headed girl with a lot of willpower - it's either her way or no way. Finally, Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi (what is up with these names lol), Youto's track captain, and as you'll see later in the anime, an extremely important figure during Youto's younger childhood years.\\n\\n\r\nA simple, small cast of main characters with a lot of potential - which this anime fortunately delivers.\\n\\n\r\nEvery main character undergoes significant development. If you watch closely, you'll learn why Youto can't remember anything from his childhood; why Tsukiko acts the way she does and why she was willing to sacrifice her emotions for another significant person in her life; why Azusa behaves the way she does and how it's basically Youto's fault; and, finally, how Tsukushi's life forever changed when she met Youto.\\n\\n\r\nIf the character development is what allows this anime to take five steps forward, the plot is what makes it take five steps back.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is absolutely haywire. My main problem with this anime is the use of the \"Cat God.\" Need a reason to push the plot forward? Cat God to the rescue! Want to create tension among the characters for some trivial reason? Cat God to the rescue! Want to successfully pull off a deus ex machina? Cat God to the rescue! Too many times does this show treat the Cat God as a gimmick, and for that, it fails on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll also see how many of the side characters fall out the plot after one particular scene. To many people, this seems fine - after all, the story doesn't center around the side characters; but particularly take note of how they exit, ESPECIALLY Morii and Moriya.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, however, this show was very enjoyable. It was comedic, light-hearted, and funny. Characters were all drawn with thick lines; voice acting and sound were decent. All put aside, this is definitely a show worth watching if you're trying to kill off a lazy Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Impressive character development\\n\r\n- Comedic, light-hearted\\n\r\n- Art is on point\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Too many plot inconsistencies\\n\r\n- Too many plot holes\\n\r\n- Side characters exited out of the show unexpectedly - and this was done in  a poor fashion.",

            "content": "HenNeko is a comedy/romance/drama put in order with the former genre being the most prevalent. It's something that you may want to watch to pass time or just for something lighthearted and funny, but under examination this show is lacking and has its own list of flaws and problems.\r\nThe show follows the generic romance formula (which is not necessarily bad) where a boy meets a girl, or girls, and through experiences that they share romance starts to develop. The show takes upon the perspective of Yokodera Youto as he develops relationships with the people around him. The interesting twist with this show is that thereare \"cat gods\" that will grant wishes, but never directly in the way that  the wisher wants.\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\nPremise and outline: I found that the premise of the story to be rather well done, especially during the later episodes. The premise provides enough for interesting character interactions, development and can captivate the watcher. The potential for drama, romance, and mystery are all there and the way the story ends up flowing is quite well.\\n\\n\r\nExecution: Very, very poor. The execution of this anime is what ultimately dropped this show from a potential 8 to a lacking 4 (See my profile for my rating guide). The following is a dissection of the execution.\\n\\n\r\nDrama vs. comedy - The show started off being very lighthearted, unrealistic and for good reason: to be funny. However, starting off a show with such extreme quirky defining characteristics to be entertaining, which it succeeded at, later hurts what the show tried to do later. The final arc within the show ended up being something that was meant to be emotional, touching, and as a way for characters to develop. However, because of the way the show started off, I couldn't take the characters seriously enough to care about their problems when presented in a more serious light. However, to not only present the bad points of the show, the final arc was very interesting and would be excellent if the characters were presented to be more realistically eccentric instead of absurdly goofy(or dumb, in the case of Tsukushi) for the sake of comedy at the start of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSetup of plot - Instead of drama occurring because of events within the character's lives, it ends up being too dependent on the cat gods as a plot device. A character will wish for something without thinking too hard of it, and it will end up going bad in one way or another. Because of this, if you examine the plot carefully, you realize it's written rather poorly that everything only happens because of the convenient cat statues that allow you to defy reason. What makes it worse is that the wishes can be simply reverted if you want; this makes it so all the dramatic issues caused by the show can simply be resolved by a deus ex machina of sorts, where you just cancel the issue by saying \"I want to cancel my wish\".\\n\\n\r\nPlot holes - I will not explain what they are in order to stay true to a spoiler-free review, but let it be known that they are abundant and noticeable. In addition, not only are some of the plot holes just unexplained issues, there are some that are contradictions to the information presented to us. If you want to read a list of the ones I found (spoilers obviously) you can find them here http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=695701\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nAs previously stated, the characters are rather eccentric to extreme levels for comedic effect. However, this does not make them bad, only hard to take seriously during the more serious final arc.\\n\\n\r\nYouto - The main character is well done and a strong point for the show. For the lead male in a harem anime, he is not your typical idiot who is oblivious to the feelings of people around him. He is perceptive and is intelligent enough to deduct the situation at hand and understand what's going around him. \\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi sisters: Nothing special to note. Decent characters who undergo some development as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Azuki: As a character in general, she is unique and not a stereotypical character trope. However, she feels somewhat irrelevant in the later story for a main character. Her attraction towards the main character is also somewhat irrational.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound and Art-\\n\r\nI never let sound and art affect what I rate a show, but I will comment on it. The art is great and the music is nothing special.\\n\\n\r\n-Other thoughts-\\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of moe elements with it and is somewhat ecchi. I have a neutral opinion on moe in general but I feel that it is bad when it's too abundant. The OP and ED felt like JC Staff was cramming moe into the viewers which I wasn't particularly fond of. Personally, I think moe and ecchi are a bad mix together as they kind of contradict each other but to each their own.\\n",

Then it turned into semi-magical anime where a cat statue grants wishes. Then it become a semi-love story with lot of harem. Then it went back to the cat statue that grants wishes, only this time everyone could use it. Then it became a mess of sorts and I got totally confused by the episode. And then it turned into a full-blown sad story through the cat statue where they go into the past touncover the mysteries of the present. And when they return, its back to the harem non-sense.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, it feels like Yami did a mind crush on me. This anime is more random than a random generator. But for all its non-sense, its not a bad anime. I liked it. But I have to say that the last 3-4 episodes were kind of pointless. Its like the author suddenly thought that this anime isn't serious enough, so let's fill it with serious content. Why? Wouldn't it have been easier for the girl to just say \"okay I'm not your first\"?\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it, but you will have to decide on its genre because its fuck all.",

I only limit to to such score co'z the story depends on the said proverb. \\n\\n\r\nArt- fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThere maybe some fanservice that them dogs would howl for by, it was nice that there isn't such intense nudity involved especially when it come to Tsukushi's tits.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for the op and ed, as for Youto's VA, I would have prefer if would have been done by  Soichiro Hoshi since his perverted tone from \"Sora No Othoshimono\" would have been perfect,instead of  Yuki Kaji whose voice is too immature for the said character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for Tsukiko and Azusa since it was these two who contributed to this anime's touching drama, as for Youto, well he's not bad to be this anime's clown.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI like that this anime can shift from comedy to drama, most especially the last 2 episodes of this anime, where it was a Tsukiko and Youto arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so it was a funny and touching anime and the title fit well to this anime's theme, I gave it a 6 for the overall since it ended in a double standard at one hand we have Youto confessing and kissing Azusa and on the other hand we see him doing the same with Tsukiko, what pisses me off was how studio J.C Staff decided to end this anime that is like eating something nice only to spit it out, but that's just me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdios, muchachos.",

            "content": "This anime's strength lies it's 'laugh out loud' comedic inane story, without any deeper meaning behind it. \r\nThis is one those animes which are made for pure entertainment, comedy, with no real intention of aspiring to become a memorable anime and crudely follows a shadowy outline of a story.\r\nLet's just say it's an anime that doesn't take itself seriously.\r\nThough the anime wasn't a disaster, the episodes after the 6th one probably lost my interest in terms of story; there didn't seem to be a solid plot development. The anime's plot did not live up to the seemingly large expectations that was foreshadowed by the firstepisode the narrator (MC) says \"We went there underestimating it's power...\" Though the anime did have some fantasical links within the first episode, it seemed to be dominated by realism, which is why it was a huge 'shocker' when it became almost completely fantasy;time travel, reality distortion etc (on the 7 - 10th episode) it seemed to completely change it's calm realistic setting into a completely nonsensical mutable world.\\n\\n\r\n At the time of writing (ep. 10), the plot seemed unmethodical; without aim. Other animes of similar nature, Hayate no Gotuku, through all it's hilarity, aims to connect to some kind of story. But this anime has no such connection, it merely races through the entire anime, and ironically, becomes somewhat of a harem of little girls, and attempts to make a connection with it's poorly written  story at the end of the anime. Though there seemed to be alot of foreshadowing to the anime's story, the story fails to tie all the knots together in a nice fashion. That being said, the anime had not finished at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside from the 2 large paragraphs about the storyline, I'm going to attempt to lump art, sound, character all into 1 paragraph. Starting off with character, the oversimplified nature of the character development seems to take a sporadic turn due to inherent 'superpowers' that is embedded in the story, the character's personalities switch around so much that it is impossible to see what each character's true purpose is in within the anime, or to be more specific what each character truly are; in that we don't specifically know them well enough before they switch to a completely new persona. Sound, the only world to describe it is 'fluffy' or rather 'cute' the anime resolves heavily on the cuteness of their heroines in order to lure unsuspecting lolicons into watching the anime. But the sounds of the cicadas, water, background characters etc is something that is around the level that would be appropriate for anime of this generation; average. Lastly art, the art style is generic, and that's probably all that is needed to be said. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite all it's flaws, I really enjoyed the anime, even though I heavily criticise the anime. My enjoyment was 10/10, it had me falling off my chair in laughter, and happily face palming at certain moments in the story due to it's utter (stupidly); stupid funny at times. So without doing any mathematical calculations, the score I give, overall, is 7.",

            "content": "Hentai Ouji is JC Staffs moe flavor of the season.\r\nI know I know the industry is cluttered with cutesy school anime and moe girls doing moe things. But Hentai Ouji was nonetheless enjoyable.\r\nI\u2019m actually kinda sad it is over since it reminded me a lot of one of my favorite anime, Denpa Onna.\r\nWhile Denpa Onna is a lot better in my opinion and also my favorite school/moe anime, Hentai Ouji still managed to be one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.\r\nStory\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDespite being just a school anime, Hentai Ouji (HenNeko) actually had a story. Quite simple and more in the background but at leastit followed an overall theme and even had a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s about cat statues granting wishes and a bunch of characters wishing for the wrong things and dealing with the consequences.\\n\r\nIt wasn't really focused though. It just randomly had events going on that were somewhat connected.\\n\r\nIf you are cynical you could say the \u201cplot\u201d was an excuse for fanserice and moe.\\n\r\nAt least HenNeko had plenty of both to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSo I guess I have to warn you, if you are allergic to harem, moe or fanservice you better stay as far away from this show as possible.\\n\r\nIf you on the other hand love cute things, blantaned sexualising of underaged girls and one guy going out with 4 girls at once this is probably what you are looking for.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the show though you will most likely be confused, as the cat statue wishes make the show pretty surreal and trippy at times.\\n\r\nI actually thought this show is more suited for Studio Shaft (and also think they would have made it better but JC staff did an okay job) since it was not only full with fanservice but also had the quirky characters and messy story telling.\\n\\n\r\nOn a bad note though, the drama the show offered can\u2019t be taken too seriously in light of it\u2019s rather light themes and sexual content.\\n\r\nBut again this is an otaku catering show not more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSince it is a harem you have one MC, his male friend who is barely represented in the show and a bunch of girls with different quirks and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nYokodera is our perverted hero, he is thick headed as all harem protagonist and can\u2019t read the most obvious intentions of the girls around him. But he is still entertaining and somewhat cute.\\n\r\nI just loved how blunt they just made his perverted side. He straight out says and does things other harem protagonist are merely forced into. It\u2019s kinda more fun to watch him do perverted stuff than your typical nice guy.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah his character is rather simple and the development doesn\u2019t go anywhere too far out.\\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi, Tsukiko (say that 10 times in a row!) is the other main character of the show, and probably the most important of the girls. She wishes right from the start to lose her emotions(actually more her emotional expression) and thus turns into a sorta Dandere character.\\n\r\nShe is damn cute and her voice is just melting you. Despite her supposed emotionless character she is witty with her comments and has some of the funniest moments of the show. She is also damn cute if I haven\u2019t mentioned it.\\n\r\nHave I meantioned that she is damn cute? No?\\n\r\nWell she is... damn cute.\\n\\n\r\nAzuki is her main rival, though also cute she gets less screentime and less backdrop. Her character is also less consistent. Sometimes she likes MC sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She is not a classical tsundere in this regard just very inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nTsukushi is Tsukikos older sister. She is leader of the track team and starts out hating the MC. Her role starts out as being the dominating arch type, abusing the MC but later becomes more likable. She is also used for the Oppai Fanservice, so if you are into that stuff she already won.\\n\r\nShe is also thick as two short planks as Yokodera makes her believe he is him and his none existent little brother at the same time, she falls in love with later on.\\n\r\nthough adds a lot of comedy to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are rather insignificant but all cute too look at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show has great quirky characters but also has no depth or anything to offer. Just your typical moe archetypes, fun to look at and you wanna cuddle them, but nothing great and deep.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, JC Staff animated HenNeko and we get our usual treatment. Nothing great, nothing bad.\\n\r\nIt was interesting from the surreal point of view but nothing Shaft couldn\u2019t have made better and thus it was a sorta \u201cletdown\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds were typical school settings though sprinkled with some surreal elements whenever the wishes went rampant.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, simple but effective. You will love them if you love moe things, you will hate them if you hate moe things.\\n\\n\r\nThe special effects were actually pretty decent and helped the whole magical feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s not impressive by any means but gives you a decent dose of cuteness and good feelings.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly well done was the soundtrack in HenNeko.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings as sweet as sugar. If you like cutesy popsongs you will like them. If you don\u2019t... well you know the spiel.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was used effectively ranging from typical comedy songs to more dramatic piano pieces for the dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d listen to outside of the anime but was quite good.\\n\\n\r\nGreat were the voice actors as they not only enhanced the moe factor of the show but also were responsible for the sound effects themselves giving your extra sweet moments that you better see your doctor to check if you don\u2019t have diabetes already.\\n\\n\r\nThe super young Yui Ogura did the voice for Tsukiko and was my personal favorite even though Yukari Tamura did her older sister which was at least as good.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen Katanagatari you\u2019ll recognize Yukari, she has a great range and also a very sweet voice.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaji lends Yokodera his voice, proving again his versatility from Eren J\u00e4ger to a Harem lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe last great thing about the show were the sound effects.\\n\r\nI normally don\u2019t recognize them too much in shows but HenNeko had great ones that complimented the comedic scenes well and enhanced the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of enjoyment, Hentai Ouji was a blast for me.\\n\r\nI know I should feel guilty for liking it as much, but I just did, sue me!\\n\\n\r\nI do say to anyone though that hates these kind of shows to just stay away, you are not missing out, this is a full-time pandering show with nothing to offer but good feelings.\\n\r\nAt least for me and some others this show was a good ride and soon will be replaced by the next cutesy show to come out.

            "content": "A strong cast of characters is sometimes all that is needed. \r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (referred to as HenNeko henceforth) is a romantic comedy that knows its own strengths. Rather than focusing solely on panties, cleavage and harem tropes (oh, there's still plenty of that), it delivers a genuinely refreshing experience that cleverly combines its moe appeal with a strong cast of characters. \r\nThe story follows Yokodera Youto and his hidden perversions. Hidden, of course, as joining the track club solely to gape at girls is not considered socially acceptable behavior. He conceals these thoughts under a facade, acting in part as the averagehighschooler so that his intentions are not misunderstood. But eventually, as just about any teenager would, he grows tired of behaving like somebody that he is not. He decides to visit a purportedly wish-granting statue to ask that he can simply be himself, and in doing so entangles himself with the fate of another: Tsukiko, who instead wishes to conceal her emotions. \\n\\n\r\nImmediately, you will probably find yourself thinking how silly this sounds. And you would not be wrong-- it is very much silly. The entire notion that a cat statue can somehow grant wishes (and just about any wish, really) is supremely contrived and difficult to accept. But HenNeko seldom takes this aspect seriously. There are still the occasional moments of melodrama here and there marring the overall experience, but provided you are not looking for anything more than some lighthearted fun, it is easy enough to tolerate the lacklustre storytelling. Perhaps not forgive, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the story is not necessarily that it is poorly written or abundant with plotholes, but that it relies solely on the cat statue to get anywhere. Characters don't resolve issues or develop on their own-- the statue does it for them. If it's time for some drama, hey, why not have a character wish for something inconvenient? And they do. Again and again. It becomes entirely predictable by the end. How is the audience supposed to empathize with a story that feels so artificial, so reliant upon a single plot device? It is almost too bad that a wish-granting statue doesn't exist in the real world; it could have been used to wish away the show's own issues. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the characters are enough to amend the otherwise juvenile storytelling. Aside from the lustful Yokodera, HenNeko consists primarily of three female characters: Tsukiko, the ojou-sama Azuki Azusa (she's referred to by her full name for some reason), and Tsukushi, Tsukiko's violent older sister. Chances are that if you have any potential interest in the series, moe is one of the first things that you are looking for. And HenNeko provides plenty in that regard. Hell, it is the embodiment of moe. Tsukiko may just be one of the cutest characters in anime history, though Azuki Azusa is certainly no slouch either. The only issue is that Tsukiko's seiyuu overblows the dandere trope. She sounds less monotone and more like an android. \\n\\n\r\nIn standard harem fare, they all come to love Yokodera in some way or another. It is justified in the case of Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa, but Tsukishi's infatuation is shoehorned in from nowhere. It also baffles the mind why she somehow believes that Yokodera and his mythical younger brother (which is just a bluff of his) are separate people, despite looking, sounding and behaving identically. Somehow she is collectively the most dense and mature character of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Yokodera, he is actually one of the series' strongest points. For the harem genre where the protagonist is almost invariably some blockhead with the supernatural ability to inadvertently undress girls in mid-air, a comment like that may as well be considered nonsense. But Yokodera defies the genre's mold. He is honest, knows how to communicate with people, does not run away screaming at the sight of panties, and most importantly, has a brain. He is able to instill value to his interaction with the girls and as a result (Tsukishi excluded) their feelings for him seem authentic rather than forced. HenNeko could just as easily have been another insipid harem title if Yokodera behaved like every other harem lead, but thankfully it is a show that understands the importance of a quality protagonist. I just wonder why other harem titles haven't learned the same. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, HenNeko is pleasing to the eye and uses thick lines to give the show its own visual charm. Character designs are considerably appealing and while the art fidelity may not be enough to impress, it still does the job just fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound also leaves little to be desired. The seiyuu are spectacular all around with veterans like Yukari Tamura and newer names like Kaori Ishihara providing their own personality to the female characters. Yuki Kaji lends his talents to the role of Yokodera and does a stellar job overall (though initially causes some concern for previously voicing a number of aggravating protagonists). And while the background music is restrained and rarely noticeable, the opening and ending sequences are infectiously catchy and adorable. It would be insanity to skip them. \\n\\n\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko does not tread any new ground, but what it fails to provide in creativity it makes up for with a solid cast of characters. If you are expecting a decent story, deep themes or anything beyond some nice lighthearted fun, you will be sorely disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAs for fun, though? There are few better ways to spend an afternoon.",

            "content": "You know one of those days when you're feeling down and is hunting for something, anything to calm your moody day? Well, that hunt might not be easy but if Henneko is something on your hit list, then you might of hit a bulls-eye. That's because this is an anime that will brighten the mood of your moody day. In more ways than one, Henneko caters to the fantasies of a young teenager. It focuses more on Youto Yokodera, a young boy who is going through the journey of adolescence. What he seems to be more interested than sports or academics though is of theopposite sex. Thus begin the story, a tale of The \"Hentai\" Prince and the Stony Cat.\\n\\n\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. (also known as The \"Hentai\" Prince and the Stony Cat) is an anime series based off the light novel and manga of the same name. No contrary to its title, this is NOT a hentai. Rather, it's about a young boy named Youto Yokodera who got nicknamed with the infamous title of the \u201cHentai Prince\u201d after making a certain wish onto a particuarly gifted Stony Cat. Sounds strange right? Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nComing into this series, I already knew what may be expected. It doesn't take long for any viewer to realize this is a typical romantic comedy. The twist here is that it involves some magic at works in the form of the Stony Cat. So begins this strange tale, the story of the Hentai Prince. Note that not everything starts out like this though. In fact, while it's obvious that Youto is seen a pervert to viewers, the series doesn't directly depict these traits until after he makes his wish to the Stony Cat. It's the result of a wish he made and there's a saying that always stays true: be careful what you wish for. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Youto , he isn't very careful and now has to deal with the consequences. \\n\\n\r\nFor Youto, the boy is naturally a pervert. He likes to read 'ecchi' magazines of perverted nature. He joined the track team so that he can actually see the girls in their swimsuits (the pool is close to the tracks). And of course, he often references to shows that he watches to heighten his interests. Despite his faults though,Youto  at the same time is also shown to be a kind boy who often comes to the aid of others especially his female friends. He also seems to be somewhat clever with a crafty mind as he is able to manipulate a certain track leader into believing some obvious false ideas. Needless to say, Youto is the type of boy that's hard to be friends with unless you know his true visage. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the people Youto meets in the series includes the adorable Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi. Being presented as both the mascot as well as the main female character, she is the younger sister of the Steel King and someone that accidentally also falls in the case of 'be careful what you wish for' category. Unlike Yuto, the wish she called for made her emotionless. Now, she is like a cat but without the excitement. At the same time, it seems that she and Youto has a sort of deal to get back what they've lost. It's a relationship of awkwardness and benefits all the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, Youto also establishes connections with other characters in particular with a school beauty named Azusa. As an animal lover, she is admired as a school idol, a wealthy lady, and someone who is to be respected by everyone. Despite her outer self, Azusa seems to be quite insecure with herself and often mistrusts people because of her past. Her first encounter with Youto seems to be some sort of fate because for the first time, we see her insecurities manifest thanks to Youto and his new personality granted by the Stony Cat. So much for being a goddess...\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows more of a story arc telling format rather than a straight out story. However, the most common features of each episode involves Youto and what he does with his new situation. Of the many new changes in his life, one is his more closeness to three of the main female characters in the series. Youto gets closer with Azusa, Tsukushi (the \u201cSteel King\u201d), and Tsukiko as each episode progresses. Despite being labeled as the 'hentai prince', Youto is also surprisingly reliable at key situations. His reliability as well as ability to help others earns him more affections from the girls. As a matter fact, they seems to see the better side of him and even goes to lengths to return the favor at various points. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a whole cluster of moments and gags that calls out 'cute' throughout every episode. The opening song itself is one with the expressions of our main characters. Its animal-like gestures, high pitched vocals, and moe artwork paints this series as a headline for cuteness. It doesn't stop there either with the cutey artwork. There's the way that Tsukiko moves and way she eats that are formulated from the extra gags. Among other moments, there's the tsundere-like behavior of Azusa where she flatly denies what's really on her mind. Speaking of which, Azusa herself also shows her love of animals. Whether you're an animal lover or not, the show goes to portray many analogies. A clear example is Tsukiko likeness of a cat while Azusa seems to be fond of dogs. Naturally, the two sides don't get along just like the two girls. And naturally, Youto is the center of the drama when it comes to the duo.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series having many comedy moments, there is also some serious times when we see that characters are more troubled than what they seem to be. Azusa is one of those characters especially with her past and Youto does his best to help her out. Then, there's also the tensions between the two sisters that balances between silliness and moody at various circumstances. It's hard to take them serious but at the same time, it's clear that there's something deeper going on between them.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the series is cute, there's many overused themes of a typical romantic comedy in Henneko that might turn some viewers off. There's plenty of fan service like the traditional beach episode. In fact, because the school has a pool, it's natural that the girls will be in their swimsuits. Therefore, expect some of those gratuitous outfits to hit the screen some time here and there. Among other little gags in the series are the various misunderstandings. In one fact, among one of these misunderstandings turns into more of a serious admiration for the Steel King. Furthermore, the Steel King is portrayed as the sex symbol of the show with her well developed body (thanks to her status as president of the track team) and sexy moans during exercises. It turns the physical education class into a theme of fan service and one that is presented clearly with both the vocals and visuals. It doesn't stop there either as we also have the master/servant like relationship, the repetitive tsundere-like behavior of Azusa, and later on seemingly a harem being under construction by our hentai prince.\\n\\n\r\nFor J.C. Staff production, this series makes usage of its more colorful atmosphere. The way artwork is enforced throughout the series brings out the fairy tale-like cuteness of most of the characters. It is not realistic but rather overly flows with cuteness and moe. Given the setting of the romantic comedy genre, it does fit the overall idea. I'm not sure what the objective it's trying to achieve but if cuteness was one of them, it nailed it on the spot. At other times though, it tries way too hard and the characters' designs are generic. The petite figure, the flat chest, and the well developed bodies for our three main female characters shapes the different sides of this anime. There's nothing unique to see here but it's kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series clearly is lighthearted. It also seems that a lot of times, it puts more effort into each and every single tiny moment to bring out the cute factors. These can also turn into more lewd moments such as our Steel King and her erotic moans. It does match though with our small cast of main characters and the way they portray is also expressed in their voice actors/actresses. The softness of Tsukiko's voice is a more prominent example as we can clearly see that she lost most of her emotions. Finally, both the OP and ED songs of this series brings out cuteness and moe at its best. The way the OP song is overflowed with adorable moments and gif worthy material. The ED song fits with the same flow with the dancing moments of Tsukiko and her adorable outfits. It's needless to say that in terms of audio features, Henneko brings out 'cuteness' at its best.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the end game of this series is how you might decide to watch Henneko. If cuteness is something you're looking for to brighten up that moody day you just had, then this series is definitely something to hit the play button on. Otherwise, enjoyment can come in different shapes and sizes. For one thing though, the series itself is hard to take serious even with its more moody moments. The fan service and little fun gags can give different results depending on how you view them. Otherwise, Henneko is a series that is probably not a masterpiece for me. I might forget it in the future. However, those cuteness and adorable moments are hard to take my eyes off of.",

            "content": "For an anime with such an evocative title, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is actually a fairly...acceptably clean slice-of-life comedy with some really, really bizarre plot twists and characters. A harem-type anime, HenNeko tries to break the archetype by just being extremely weird, but still keeping comedy and romance at a harem-type best. While it may be a bit overly \"fuwa fuwa\" in both art and character design, Hentai Ouji delivers a compelling and hilarious story of a misunderstood high-school boy and his series of mishaps with the girls around him, all controlled by a mysterious cat statue. Definitely a good anime.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (9/10)\r\nSound (7/10)\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is definitely Hentai Ouji's unique point. The Warawanai Neko acts as the wildcard of the anime, allowing the plot of the anime to justify extending infinitely in any direction. Basically, since the Warawanai Neko can grant any wish at a cost (think Tsubasa Chronicles), anything is game and the world can be destroyed at the whim of the characters. Of course, the foundation of the plot is still the whole \"high-school-boy-with-a-bunch-of-girls-in-love-with-him\", but that's what a harem-type anime is and, frankly, it never gets old. As long as there's enough variation and excitement to distinguish the story, which author Sou Sagara did admirably. Anime, manga, and light novel are all consistent with regards to storyline, which is fantastic. Only grievance? The plot gets pretty wild at times, so the story gets somewhat difficult to follow.\\n\\n\r\nRound, chubby, cute and fluffy. Four words to describe this anime's art style. Just look at the OP - the artists were clearly trying to give people heart attacks. Naturally, not everyone likes this kind of art style. I will agree, sometimes an anime too based in this kind of cuteness becomes hard to watch (I'm sorry, K-On!). But the art is good - you can't deny that. It's really encouraging to see an anime where the artists were clearly given ample time to draw, design, and really give the characters life. \\n\\n\r\nThe music fits with the art style, but it takes the puffiness to another level. Lots of bells, tinkles, and chimes. Half of the OST seems to be played on the xylophone. Creates a great mood, but the theme limits the songs to be just \"cute\" pieces instead of timeless tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Hentai Ouji are full of various controversies. They are...quite stereotypical. The perverted high schoolboy. The silent Nagato-type. The tsundere. The yandere. The little sister. Classic tried and true roles, yes, but almost no effort given to move the characters even a bit out of their roles. The perveted main character, especially, while not often used, is a difficult character role to pull of because of the divided mixed reactions it usually receives - either people love it or hate it. And its still a commonly-used mold. The only character that seems to be a bit unique is Ponta - it's been a while since a side-character's given up hedonism for world peace.\\n\\n\r\nBUT.\\n\\n\r\nThey are so well developed, it's hard not to love them. Despite their actions being predictable, despite their words being overused, despite the fact that you could probably guess every next move in the entire anime, the characters are developed in such a way that you really appreciate them in all their cliche-ness. I particularly like the amount of work and detail they put into Asuna's character - she's beyond the normal tsundere and in a class of her own.\\n\\n\r\nWhether laughing at Yokodera's antics or empathizing with Tsukiko's issues, the anime is quite able to bring the story alive and deliver it in an enjoyable package. The anime moves at a rapid pace - 4 episodes managed to knock out the entire first volume of the series. This change of pace is well-needed, and its refreshing to see Yokodera completing routes so quickly. The ending was one of the best conclusions to a 12-episode anime I have ever seen, nicely wrapping up the plotline while offering a sweet and memorable scene. Any ending that can make characters seem even cooler than they already were is a great ending in my book.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nAll in all, HenNeko is a great anime to watch - funny, charming, and crazy. Would recommend this to anyone in need of some new anime to track in 2013.",

            "content": "Usually, anything with the word \"hentai\" in it is instantly thrown out the window for most people, as its word association is for the most part, is towards porn, as hentai means \"pervert\" in the japanese language.  Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko, or the hentai prince and stony cat in english uses that word in such a way, that it almost means nothing, in this pretty damn good rom-com.\r\nStory (8.05/10): The story of Hentai Ouji (simplifying the title), bases itself around Youto Yokodera, an open pervert, as many can guess from the title.  Through a series of circumstances involving the best friend charactergiving up his pervert ways, and Youto's own desire to be open about being perverted, as well as hearing about a wish granting cat statue thing, Youto meets a girl named Tsukiko, who attempts to also make a wish, only to find out that both of them are discontent with their new lives, and make a pact about getting back what is theirs.  \\n\\n\r\nAbove all, this story is as imaginative and original as they come.  Personally, I have never seen a story quite like this before, and because of that, it piqued my interest.  However, it should be noted that that story only pertains to about 3 or so episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime's plotline is split in about 3 or so arcs where it mainly focuses on 3 of the main characters.  (The last one arguably focuses on 2 at one time.)   Each of the arcs having their own separate focus as a whole.  It's to the point that since the anime stems so far from the original idea, that the story becomes a completely different thing altogether.  However, though this sounds like a terrible thing, the story actually fits together really well, and provides a very good viewing experience.  Personally, I liked how the anime went, because I was never really bored with it at all.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.45/10): These characters are actually pretty damn good.  First, the hentai prince, Youto Yokodera.  First of all, why is it always the perverted guy in anime, that always somehow gets the girls?  Youto is a very interesting character as his pervertedness throughout the whole series is almost non-existent.  Sure, he has porn mags, an obsession with having Tsukiko as his little sister, and above all, has perverted thoughts, but as a whole, he never seems to actually portray that too much.  Rather, he's actually a really kind and nice character.  However, he does at times act a bit denser then he should be. (as all male protagonists are)  His character does get fleshed out at the end of the series, and really provides a nice backstory for him, adding to why he's actually a pretty good character.  \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, backstory is a huge thing that this anime does really well.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiko, as the main female lead, is one of the more...interesting kuuderes in anime.  Because of her wish, she became emotionless, showing absolutely no different tone in her voice, no emotions, no embarrassed facial expression, well, you get the point.  Unlike most female characters that refuse to admit they like someone, Tsukiko...cannot.  Because she literally has no emotions at all, the denseness that Youto has when talking to her makes a lot of sense, as you really can't tell what she's actually feeling at that moment in time.  While yes, she is a good character, seeing as how she acts as Youto's voice of reason, as well as being extremely cute, they never really solve her problem in the anime, basically turning her into this emotionless doll, as they forget her whole purpose for meeting Youto as they did, and essentially, making the original idea of the story, null.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters like my personal favorite, Azusa and Tsukushi also have their part in the grand scheme of things, becoming the other 2 aforementioned main cast, and have very good fleshed out characteristics, that make their characters really good.   \\n\\n\r\nVarious other characters, act as pretty good supporting cast, adding in more to the story, as well as fleshing out the main 4 characters more, which they excel at doing.  Above all, the characters are definitely this anime's strong suit, and it really shows it clearly.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art (7.25/10 and 7.48/10): The sound for this anime is somewhat generic I would say.  It sounds really adorable, I will give it that, and the mood fillers for the anime do sound good and very appropriate for where they're placed.  The OP and ED I would say are good but not overly fantastic.  It's nice to listen to, and the lyrics are as cute and adorable as they would come, but I wouldn't say it would be something that you would remember for a long time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art I would say is above average.  The art is very light colored and somewhat moe heavy, as the majority of the female cast are in fact, moe.  The characters themselves aren't too overcomplicated in terms of design, and are definitely crisp in their design as well.  It's very simplistic and very nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.67/10): Hentai Ouji to Warawani neko is definitely your above-average rom-com/harem show.  (It gets a bit haremy towards the end.)  Personally, I was never bored with the series, and enjoyed watching every moment.  The comedy is pretty funny, I love the characters, and the story was plenty deep and interesting to keep me watching.  I did feel that the story felt a bit incomplete, and would've liked to see more, but for the most part, I'm happy with what I watched.  I did feel like it went a bit side-story like towards the middle; as well as losing a significant amount of its original idea as the story progressed, but it did finish itself quite nicely, and I will say that I was somewhat pleased on how the characters, and everything else turned out in the end.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a rom-com/harem/ecchi (there's not that much) show; or anyone that enjoys a good drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.89/10.  \\n\\n\r\nStill hoping for a second season so we could fix Tsukiko.  It sorta pissed me off seeing that she was never fixed.",

            "content": "At first, I thought this anime was an ordinary ecchi anime, which showed a boring story, putting ecchi art like any other anime. as with just looking at the title \"hentai\". however, still can not judge just by its cover. after watching it to completion, the story is incredible.\r\nAt the beginning of the episode, the story begins with a silly and outspoken main character. then began to emerge an interesting path like the power of a cat statue, and how the personality can move on to others. and of course I did not expect it.\r\nthen the story began to continue how the power of thecat was indeed influential and really work. it is very interesting and of course that makes the audience feel something else in the anime ecchi genre. so of course for me that is a new thing.\\n\r\nespecially when the story continues at the climax. where the main character goes to the past to understand what really happened. it's really impressive how the author created many paths that made me and possibly other audiences amazed. the ending was also satisfying, making the audience happy because there is no odd and disappointing decisions. really this anime is unique and great.\\n\\n\r\nabout music, I can not say much because it is an anime is different story. as is not expected from anime with this kind of genre. but also quite interesting where the background music can make the moment more tense or boring.\\n\\n\r\nabout the characters, quite impressive because the author really creates a character without emotion. such as how they feel sad, happy, scared, embarrassed, yet still show a flat and innocent expression.\\n\r\nand about other characters are also quite fun how they try to make this anime stay alive and not feel weird. such as interspersed with a lot of humor, sadness, and of course the ecchi itself.\\n\\n\r\nabout art is pretty good. how the character designer can make a fixed figure put up a flat face while feeling different things. but basically, everything is very nice and amazing. good work, JCS.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation, if you are looking for anime different from anime humor, ecchi, and romance usually, this anime is very worthy for you to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a good anime.",

            "content": "At first I was extremely tentative to start watching this show, expecting mindless fanservice, a half-arsed plot and a full baking tray of cookie cut characters. But I'm pleasantly surprised with what I've seen in the first 5 episodes. \r\nBy far the best feature of the show is the comedy. The extreme bluntness of the main characters speeches have me laughing my ass off in the first couple of episodes. \"So I offered up my dutch wife and all my lust disappeared like I'd just had a fantastic fap!\" \r\n The character interactions are incredibly interesting for an anime of this genre. They each havethere own unique characteristics that really help differentiate this from just another school harem. From the violent but gullible Tsukushi, to the emotionless, unreactive Tsukiko and the fantastic rants from Youto. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I think this show may be trying for the award of \"most unpronounceable character name of all time\" With \"Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko\" (Try saying that 5 times).\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside, while the fanservice isn't excessive it is still prevalent in the series, particularly in the very moe openings and endings (though this may be a plus for many). There are also several very generic plot scenarios in the series, such as the old \"walking in while she's changing/washing bit\". \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't mindbogglingly good, but there are a few catchy tunes buried in there. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary the show has started strong mainly due to its strong character relationships and hilarious comedy (at least to me anyway) the series looks set to become my 'guilty pleasure' of this season, I'm hoping it stays this good for the full series and doesn't try and become more serious and through away the comedy aspect. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Boy was I in for a surprise, it turned how to be very good and was unexpected of the entertainment value I receive. How awesome would it be to have a Cat God grant any wish of your desire, but does it come with a cost?\r\nStory-8\r\nThe story centers aroud Youto Yokodera who is rather an \"average joe\" highschool student. Due to his perverted nature, his actions are always being misunderstood thus having a problem of expressing inner self. After hearing a story from achildhood friend he goes to the Cat God statue where it is said it can grant any wish but as a twist of events, there is a give and take consequence which is the downside to it. His wish was to make it impossible for him to lie to help out with his personal problem of expressing himself for a belt of a hug pillow he offered in exchange, the twist to that was he lost his facade about his perverted nature. He later realizes that this has made him painfully honest to others which has caused trouble for others and embarrassment for himself so he then teams up with his childhood friend in Tsukiko who lost her emotions due to her experience of the Cat God Statue, and they are on a mission to reverse their wishes.I also  like how unique and entertaining this anime can get with some of the most hilarious comedy scenes that you will see i assure you the story is fun simple and enjoyable \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nAbout the characters you have Youto Yokodera that has a  perverted nature but besides he is a nice and reliable person that sometimes tries to use his 'facade' to trick the other girls you also got Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi she is the tsundere type and that makes her very likeable the other characters are love interests to the main character.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nIn saying that, the animation was very fluid and maintained a good quality throughout\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nAfter you get past the opening you are all good the OST are pretty good didin't find one that piqued my interest though \\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nI really love and enjoy the story characters even the art well about the sound like i said nothing that you can remember 'avarage'' but that opening oh god maybe its just me but i really find it annoying after the end i demand a second season \\n",

            "content": "Pretty odd show with less than memorable service.\r\nI'll start off by saying that I didn't like how this show was presented. While re-watching Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko I  felt like the producers were adding too many elements to the story at once. One moment I'm hearing about the stony cat, next moment they're talking about losing facades, expressions etc. It's like, I felt that it would've  been better if they let the story plot and events unfold one at a time rather than all at once because it felt like a mess. \r\n(as much as I wanted to like them) hated thecharacters.  Generic, archetypes, expressionless character with lame over used \"sad\" or depressing backstory,  more than annoying \"Rich-ish\" Tsundere, and lastly pure vanilla, plain perverted MC you see in every other harem, romance, comedy. It's like at first I though if I gave them more time then I would open up to them and find at least one of the main characters funny, or at the  very least cute however, to my dismay, I could not. \\n\\n\r\nI seriously considered dropping this show after episode 5 because that is the  episode where I lost all interest however as a upcoming reviewer along with personal reasons its' sort of a \"No-No\" to drop a show\\n\r\nunless they are longer than 30-40 episodes. It really bothered me, or dare I say \"annoyed\" me that I couldn't find any redeeming qualities about  hentai prince and the stony cat. Characters, music, comedy, etc, none of it could really make up for the atrocity that I had been watching.\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters again, character designs were pretty interesting. When I'm looking at characters in anime I always try and point out what makes them different or unique. Sometimes it's the facial expressions, other times it's personalities, in Henneko's case it was the characters eyes. Boobs didn't stand out, panties didn't stand out, they eyes did. I found that most of the characters eyes sort of reflect their personalities. For example, Tsukiko or whatever her name was, her eyes are a dull blue which reflects and in my opinion complements her personality.... boring, expressionless personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUghh, now for my least favorite thing about Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.... the intro or opening song.. It was perhaps the most cringe-worthy and annoying-est song I've heard in a while. I mean, it's great that its' one of those intros that pretty much give you an idea about what the show is about however the actually song is just ewww! Honestly I cannot think of a single person to recommend this show to. Like it tries to be cute, tries to be a bit erotic and it just does not work. From a comedic standpoint though, it does have it's moments of laughter, however for me it's simply not enough. It doesn't make up for the rest of the terrible crap it gave to me. Overall I had to give this how a 5/10 because I just wasn't impressed with what I had just re-watched.",

And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\nI hope my review will pique your interest. I won't say any spoilers.\r\nYour common romcom, as so I thought. There is a love triangle involved, but it didn't seem like it focused much on the love. After a few episode, it seems like your common love triangle. But you know what? It's a very good romcom. I thought why stop halfway, so Ifinished it. If you watch a few episodes in the series, you already know who the it is, and that's as common as it gets honestly. But the point was it surprised me so much. I didn't expect any of this to happen. The twist and turn of events made it really, really, really enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSummary(little more in-depth):\\n\r\nYoto Yokodera, your normal pervert. Who has a problem of not showing his real emotions.  Hearing the big change and rumor of the \" stony cat \" from his equally perverted best friend. He went to see if the rumors were true. On his way, he met Tsukiko Tsusukakushi. She wanted to be more of an adult and wanted the opposite of what Yokodera wanted. The wish can remove a personality trait from someone that doesn't want it. and gives that trait to someone who needs it. Thus Yokodera found the person who has his trait. Azusa Azuki, the most attractive girl that every boy confesses to. Through the adventures of the love triangle comes of only wishes from the \"stony cat\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYoko Yokodera, the main protagonist. You already know. He's your pervert who actually meant more than what he portrays. He cannot express himself truly because his kind of actions are always misunderstood. As it said in the summary he made a wish to the \"stony cat\" but in exchange for that wish, he offered his belt. But realizes soon after that his inner thoughts causes too much problems, because he can't conceal his perverted thoughts. Though his inner thoughts can also be a sweet trait.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiko Tsutsukakushi, which is Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi younger sister. Who happens to be Yokodera's track and field club president. Her wish to the \"stony cat\" was to not show her emotions, because she was a crybaby to her sister. In return, she offered her meat bun. Being unable to express any emotions. She still enjoys time with Yokodera. Even though her emotions doesn't show. There is more to her then the wish she made.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Azuki, Popular, turned down all the boys that confessed there love for her. and is the one that has Yokodera's trait. So she can hide her emotions easily. How they met was through Yokodera's action in front of a large crowd. Though she might be your kind of popular girl. There are usually always something more to them in romcoms.\\n\\n\r\nTsukushi Tsutsukakushi, I just felt that I had to add her to this review. Since she does play a big part in the series. She's your president of the track and field club. Though she might seem like a despicable person. She actually means more than what you would think (She's pretty funny by the way).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like this anime. Like I said on my 2nd paragraph. It doesn't focus too much on the love triangle. I think it really shows that you have to understand each other as friends. What happens in the past stays in the past. You can't dwell in it forever, or change it. You just have to make it work in the present.",

            "content": "Let's get to the point - you are watching this because you like moe.  There simply is no other reason for anyone to watch it.  The story is barely coherent and the plot twists are more like back flips induced by characters to maintain a harem, create an opportunity for hit and miss comedy and create an explosion, LITERALLY AN EXPLOSION, of moe.\r\nSince we now know why you are watching let's get to the good, the bad and the moe.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nThere is no story, or not at least one meant for any decent inspiration or contemplation.  It exists only so that thereare ways for moe to be exploited like a gold mine from the girls.  Which is why I won't mention the characters as you can guess that there also just for moe and harem antics, no development you haven't seen or even care to see.  Of all the LN adaptations in the Spring of 2013, none have as badly cobbled together a piece of plot as it (even the awful Oreimo S2). Clearly a bad, but not a con because who watches moe for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe man behind the art of the series is a genius, well known in Japan for how f****** adorable he makes anime and manga girls.  Those sparkly eyes, beautiful slender bodies and triangular faces are the thing of legend.  The animation is the stock of JC's B team and not worthy of much mention other than thank god it's not like Aku no Hana.  It's average at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI could listen to both the ED and OP on loop for an age and still feel the buzz of moe, it's that irritatingly good.  Surely everyone (even guys) have sung Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call me maybe' and just as that is stuck in our heads so is HenNeko's songs.  But that alone would not garner a 10/10.  What did though is the shocking moe, made for the role, brilliant voice acting of all our leading ladies.  My personal favourite is Ishihara Kaori's Azuki Azusa.  The other great thing is that Kaiji Yuki is not Kaiji Yuki from Guilty Crown and thus not an annoying youth who shouts garbage like a dump truck.  He talks more like a regular human and thus cannot annoy people off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI hate K-ON, I hate Oreimo, I hate effectively every single moe blob show of the last 4 years but I like HenNeko. I haven't converted or anything but the sound and art so damn moe that I am enticed like a drunk virgin to a beautiful prostitute.  I just can't help it.  I don't get annoyed the same way as though shows because I have accepted the purpose of the show is to ultimately wet my pants and buy some BDs (which I will).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nIf I love it so much how can I rate it just a 6?  Because I realize that as an anime its crap but its crap that somehow I love.  Plenty of other people who have not been seduced will know its crap and its better they do.  But as I have explained its crap that I don't mind smearing my face with.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen an anime with extremely strong characters but a really weak plot?\r\nQuite a contrast, isn't it? I've seen plenty of anime with a decent plot line but really weak characters, but this is the first time I've ever seen a flip-flop like this. And perhaps you also agree, if you've already watched this show.\r\nEnter the main characters: first up, Youto Yokodera. A pervert by nature, Youto is basically every high school boy: he will do anything in his power to see girls...... well you get the point. Next up, Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi (say that five times fast). Tsukiko is an emotionless, monotonous girlwho likes to eat food (who doesn't?). Third: Azusa Azuki, a strong-headed girl with a lot of willpower - it's either her way or no way. Finally, Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi (what is up with these names lol), Youto's track captain, and as you'll see later in the anime, an extremely important figure during Youto's younger childhood years.\\n\\n\r\nA simple, small cast of main characters with a lot of potential - which this anime fortunately delivers.\\n\\n\r\nEvery main character undergoes significant development. If you watch closely, you'll learn why Youto can't remember anything from his childhood; why Tsukiko acts the way she does and why she was willing to sacrifice her emotions for another significant person in her life; why Azusa behaves the way she does and how it's basically Youto's fault; and, finally, how Tsukushi's life forever changed when she met Youto.\\n\\n\r\nIf the character development is what allows this anime to take five steps forward, the plot is what makes it take five steps back.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is absolutely haywire. My main problem with this anime is the use of the \"Cat God.\" Need a reason to push the plot forward? Cat God to the rescue! Want to create tension among the characters for some trivial reason? Cat God to the rescue! Want to successfully pull off a deus ex machina? Cat God to the rescue! Too many times does this show treat the Cat God as a gimmick, and for that, it fails on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll also see how many of the side characters fall out the plot after one particular scene. To many people, this seems fine - after all, the story doesn't center around the side characters; but particularly take note of how they exit, ESPECIALLY Morii and Moriya.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, however, this show was very enjoyable. It was comedic, light-hearted, and funny. Characters were all drawn with thick lines; voice acting and sound were decent. All put aside, this is definitely a show worth watching if you're trying to kill off a lazy Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Impressive character development\\n\r\n- Comedic, light-hearted\\n\r\n- Art is on point\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Too many plot inconsistencies\\n\r\n- Too many plot holes\\n\r\n- Side characters exited out of the show unexpectedly - and this was done in  a poor fashion.",

            "content": "HenNeko is a comedy/romance/drama put in order with the former genre being the most prevalent. It's something that you may want to watch to pass time or just for something lighthearted and funny, but under examination this show is lacking and has its own list of flaws and problems.\r\nThe show follows the generic romance formula (which is not necessarily bad) where a boy meets a girl, or girls, and through experiences that they share romance starts to develop. The show takes upon the perspective of Yokodera Youto as he develops relationships with the people around him. The interesting twist with this show is that thereare \"cat gods\" that will grant wishes, but never directly in the way that  the wisher wants.\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\nPremise and outline: I found that the premise of the story to be rather well done, especially during the later episodes. The premise provides enough for interesting character interactions, development and can captivate the watcher. The potential for drama, romance, and mystery are all there and the way the story ends up flowing is quite well.\\n\\n\r\nExecution: Very, very poor. The execution of this anime is what ultimately dropped this show from a potential 8 to a lacking 4 (See my profile for my rating guide). The following is a dissection of the execution.\\n\\n\r\nDrama vs. comedy - The show started off being very lighthearted, unrealistic and for good reason: to be funny. However, starting off a show with such extreme quirky defining characteristics to be entertaining, which it succeeded at, later hurts what the show tried to do later. The final arc within the show ended up being something that was meant to be emotional, touching, and as a way for characters to develop. However, because of the way the show started off, I couldn't take the characters seriously enough to care about their problems when presented in a more serious light. However, to not only present the bad points of the show, the final arc was very interesting and would be excellent if the characters were presented to be more realistically eccentric instead of absurdly goofy(or dumb, in the case of Tsukushi) for the sake of comedy at the start of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSetup of plot - Instead of drama occurring because of events within the character's lives, it ends up being too dependent on the cat gods as a plot device. A character will wish for something without thinking too hard of it, and it will end up going bad in one way or another. Because of this, if you examine the plot carefully, you realize it's written rather poorly that everything only happens because of the convenient cat statues that allow you to defy reason. What makes it worse is that the wishes can be simply reverted if you want; this makes it so all the dramatic issues caused by the show can simply be resolved by a deus ex machina of sorts, where you just cancel the issue by saying \"I want to cancel my wish\".\\n\\n\r\nPlot holes - I will not explain what they are in order to stay true to a spoiler-free review, but let it be known that they are abundant and noticeable. In addition, not only are some of the plot holes just unexplained issues, there are some that are contradictions to the information presented to us. If you want to read a list of the ones I found (spoilers obviously) you can find them here http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=695701\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nAs previously stated, the characters are rather eccentric to extreme levels for comedic effect. However, this does not make them bad, only hard to take seriously during the more serious final arc.\\n\\n\r\nYouto - The main character is well done and a strong point for the show. For the lead male in a harem anime, he is not your typical idiot who is oblivious to the feelings of people around him. He is perceptive and is intelligent enough to deduct the situation at hand and understand what's going around him. \\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi sisters: Nothing special to note. Decent characters who undergo some development as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Azuki: As a character in general, she is unique and not a stereotypical character trope. However, she feels somewhat irrelevant in the later story for a main character. Her attraction towards the main character is also somewhat irrational.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound and Art-\\n\r\nI never let sound and art affect what I rate a show, but I will comment on it. The art is great and the music is nothing special.\\n\\n\r\n-Other thoughts-\\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of moe elements with it and is somewhat ecchi. I have a neutral opinion on moe in general but I feel that it is bad when it's too abundant. The OP and ED felt like JC Staff was cramming moe into the viewers which I wasn't particularly fond of. Personally, I think moe and ecchi are a bad mix together as they kind of contradict each other but to each their own.\\n",

Then it turned into semi-magical anime where a cat statue grants wishes. Then it become a semi-love story with lot of harem. Then it went back to the cat statue that grants wishes, only this time everyone could use it. Then it became a mess of sorts and I got totally confused by the episode. And then it turned into a full-blown sad story through the cat statue where they go into the past touncover the mysteries of the present. And when they return, its back to the harem non-sense.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, it feels like Yami did a mind crush on me. This anime is more random than a random generator. But for all its non-sense, its not a bad anime. I liked it. But I have to say that the last 3-4 episodes were kind of pointless. Its like the author suddenly thought that this anime isn't serious enough, so let's fill it with serious content. Why? Wouldn't it have been easier for the girl to just say \"okay I'm not your first\"?\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it, but you will have to decide on its genre because its fuck all.",

I only limit to to such score co'z the story depends on the said proverb. \\n\\n\r\nArt- fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThere maybe some fanservice that them dogs would howl for by, it was nice that there isn't such intense nudity involved especially when it come to Tsukushi's tits.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for the op and ed, as for Youto's VA, I would have prefer if would have been done by  Soichiro Hoshi since his perverted tone from \"Sora No Othoshimono\" would have been perfect,instead of  Yuki Kaji whose voice is too immature for the said character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for Tsukiko and Azusa since it was these two who contributed to this anime's touching drama, as for Youto, well he's not bad to be this anime's clown.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI like that this anime can shift from comedy to drama, most especially the last 2 episodes of this anime, where it was a Tsukiko and Youto arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so it was a funny and touching anime and the title fit well to this anime's theme, I gave it a 6 for the overall since it ended in a double standard at one hand we have Youto confessing and kissing Azusa and on the other hand we see him doing the same with Tsukiko, what pisses me off was how studio J.C Staff decided to end this anime that is like eating something nice only to spit it out, but that's just me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdios, muchachos.",

            "content": "This anime's strength lies it's 'laugh out loud' comedic inane story, without any deeper meaning behind it. \r\nThis is one those animes which are made for pure entertainment, comedy, with no real intention of aspiring to become a memorable anime and crudely follows a shadowy outline of a story.\r\nLet's just say it's an anime that doesn't take itself seriously.\r\nThough the anime wasn't a disaster, the episodes after the 6th one probably lost my interest in terms of story; there didn't seem to be a solid plot development. The anime's plot did not live up to the seemingly large expectations that was foreshadowed by the firstepisode the narrator (MC) says \"We went there underestimating it's power...\" Though the anime did have some fantasical links within the first episode, it seemed to be dominated by realism, which is why it was a huge 'shocker' when it became almost completely fantasy;time travel, reality distortion etc (on the 7 - 10th episode) it seemed to completely change it's calm realistic setting into a completely nonsensical mutable world.\\n\\n\r\n At the time of writing (ep. 10), the plot seemed unmethodical; without aim. Other animes of similar nature, Hayate no Gotuku, through all it's hilarity, aims to connect to some kind of story. But this anime has no such connection, it merely races through the entire anime, and ironically, becomes somewhat of a harem of little girls, and attempts to make a connection with it's poorly written  story at the end of the anime. Though there seemed to be alot of foreshadowing to the anime's story, the story fails to tie all the knots together in a nice fashion. That being said, the anime had not finished at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside from the 2 large paragraphs about the storyline, I'm going to attempt to lump art, sound, character all into 1 paragraph. Starting off with character, the oversimplified nature of the character development seems to take a sporadic turn due to inherent 'superpowers' that is embedded in the story, the character's personalities switch around so much that it is impossible to see what each character's true purpose is in within the anime, or to be more specific what each character truly are; in that we don't specifically know them well enough before they switch to a completely new persona. Sound, the only world to describe it is 'fluffy' or rather 'cute' the anime resolves heavily on the cuteness of their heroines in order to lure unsuspecting lolicons into watching the anime. But the sounds of the cicadas, water, background characters etc is something that is around the level that would be appropriate for anime of this generation; average. Lastly art, the art style is generic, and that's probably all that is needed to be said. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite all it's flaws, I really enjoyed the anime, even though I heavily criticise the anime. My enjoyment was 10/10, it had me falling off my chair in laughter, and happily face palming at certain moments in the story due to it's utter (stupidly); stupid funny at times. So without doing any mathematical calculations, the score I give, overall, is 7.",

I had expected a harem go-lucky anime, but this anime has a real plot, a real good plot. (along with plenty ecchi stuff).\r\nThe Plot gets slightly darker as you dwell further into the episodes. The Story is nice. At first it starts off as a normal ecchi stuff, but gradually progresses to unveil the real plot.\r\nArt : Good\r\nSound : Normal Effects were good. But the OP/ED weren't really very catchy. So it is just ok.\r\nCharacters: The Neko God was real savage.\r\nLeaving a 10 ratingsince it is quite underrated. Otherwise I would have given a 8-9 rating.\\n\\n\r\n~Recoder",

I was somewhat satisfied with the ending and how the story developed.

The plots and subplots and chaos was nice and refreshing. \r\nIt is not  piece of art, but you would not waste your timeif you watched it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all this I've said, I have to add this: if I ever knew the hero, I would punch him.

Suffice to say, what was promising in the beginning seemed kind of dull midway. It had its moment of laughter but then the story drags on. The only thing which I thought this anime had its weightwas during the last episodes. I am not gonna spoil it, but yeah, the last episodes were really good. Heartfelt stuff. Too many feels. In my opinion, this anime had good stuff only during the beginning eps 1-3, and the last episodes. The inbetweens were sorta meh.",

            "content": "Hentai Ouji is JC Staffs moe flavor of the season.\r\nI know I know the industry is cluttered with cutesy school anime and moe girls doing moe things. But Hentai Ouji was nonetheless enjoyable.\r\nI\u2019m actually kinda sad it is over since it reminded me a lot of one of my favorite anime, Denpa Onna.\r\nWhile Denpa Onna is a lot better in my opinion and also my favorite school/moe anime, Hentai Ouji still managed to be one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.\r\nStory\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDespite being just a school anime, Hentai Ouji (HenNeko) actually had a story. Quite simple and more in the background but at leastit followed an overall theme and even had a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s about cat statues granting wishes and a bunch of characters wishing for the wrong things and dealing with the consequences.\\n\r\nIt wasn't really focused though. It just randomly had events going on that were somewhat connected.\\n\r\nIf you are cynical you could say the \u201cplot\u201d was an excuse for fanserice and moe.\\n\r\nAt least HenNeko had plenty of both to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSo I guess I have to warn you, if you are allergic to harem, moe or fanservice you better stay as far away from this show as possible.\\n\r\nIf you on the other hand love cute things, blantaned sexualising of underaged girls and one guy going out with 4 girls at once this is probably what you are looking for.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the show though you will most likely be confused, as the cat statue wishes make the show pretty surreal and trippy at times.\\n\r\nI actually thought this show is more suited for Studio Shaft (and also think they would have made it better but JC staff did an okay job) since it was not only full with fanservice but also had the quirky characters and messy story telling.\\n\\n\r\nOn a bad note though, the drama the show offered can\u2019t be taken too seriously in light of it\u2019s rather light themes and sexual content.\\n\r\nBut again this is an otaku catering show not more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSince it is a harem you have one MC, his male friend who is barely represented in the show and a bunch of girls with different quirks and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nYokodera is our perverted hero, he is thick headed as all harem protagonist and can\u2019t read the most obvious intentions of the girls around him. But he is still entertaining and somewhat cute.\\n\r\nI just loved how blunt they just made his perverted side. He straight out says and does things other harem protagonist are merely forced into. It\u2019s kinda more fun to watch him do perverted stuff than your typical nice guy.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah his character is rather simple and the development doesn\u2019t go anywhere too far out.\\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi, Tsukiko (say that 10 times in a row!) is the other main character of the show, and probably the most important of the girls. She wishes right from the start to lose her emotions(actually more her emotional expression) and thus turns into a sorta Dandere character.\\n\r\nShe is damn cute and her voice is just melting you. Despite her supposed emotionless character she is witty with her comments and has some of the funniest moments of the show. She is also damn cute if I haven\u2019t mentioned it.\\n\r\nHave I meantioned that she is damn cute? No?\\n\r\nWell she is... damn cute.\\n\\n\r\nAzuki is her main rival, though also cute she gets less screentime and less backdrop. Her character is also less consistent. Sometimes she likes MC sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She is not a classical tsundere in this regard just very inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nTsukushi is Tsukikos older sister. She is leader of the track team and starts out hating the MC. Her role starts out as being the dominating arch type, abusing the MC but later becomes more likable. She is also used for the Oppai Fanservice, so if you are into that stuff she already won.\\n\r\nShe is also thick as two short planks as Yokodera makes her believe he is him and his none existent little brother at the same time, she falls in love with later on.\\n\r\nthough adds a lot of comedy to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are rather insignificant but all cute too look at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show has great quirky characters but also has no depth or anything to offer. Just your typical moe archetypes, fun to look at and you wanna cuddle them, but nothing great and deep.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, JC Staff animated HenNeko and we get our usual treatment. Nothing great, nothing bad.\\n\r\nIt was interesting from the surreal point of view but nothing Shaft couldn\u2019t have made better and thus it was a sorta \u201cletdown\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds were typical school settings though sprinkled with some surreal elements whenever the wishes went rampant.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, simple but effective. You will love them if you love moe things, you will hate them if you hate moe things.\\n\\n\r\nThe special effects were actually pretty decent and helped the whole magical feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s not impressive by any means but gives you a decent dose of cuteness and good feelings.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly well done was the soundtrack in HenNeko.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings as sweet as sugar. If you like cutesy popsongs you will like them. If you don\u2019t... well you know the spiel.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was used effectively ranging from typical comedy songs to more dramatic piano pieces for the dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d listen to outside of the anime but was quite good.\\n\\n\r\nGreat were the voice actors as they not only enhanced the moe factor of the show but also were responsible for the sound effects themselves giving your extra sweet moments that you better see your doctor to check if you don\u2019t have diabetes already.\\n\\n\r\nThe super young Yui Ogura did the voice for Tsukiko and was my personal favorite even though Yukari Tamura did her older sister which was at least as good.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen Katanagatari you\u2019ll recognize Yukari, she has a great range and also a very sweet voice.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaji lends Yokodera his voice, proving again his versatility from Eren J\u00e4ger to a Harem lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe last great thing about the show were the sound effects.\\n\r\nI normally don\u2019t recognize them too much in shows but HenNeko had great ones that complimented the comedic scenes well and enhanced the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of enjoyment, Hentai Ouji was a blast for me.\\n\r\nI know I should feel guilty for liking it as much, but I just did, sue me!\\n\\n\r\nI do say to anyone though that hates these kind of shows to just stay away, you are not missing out, this is a full-time pandering show with nothing to offer but good feelings.\\n\r\nAt least for me and some others this show was a good ride and soon will be replaced by the next cutesy show to come out.

This anime does not have any hentai in it at all, and the fan service is more tame than others. But what really makes this anime stand out from others, is the writing and characters.\r\nStory (7) - The story isn't outstanding unfortunately. It does have it's sad and happy moments, but nothing strikes off as memorable. In a nutshell, it revolves around the main protagonists wishing towards the Cat God (hence the Stony Cat in the title), but wishes will always come ata cost. Though I have always been wondering myself that if they would have worded the wish a bit differently, that there would really be any disadvantages.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) - The art isn't the greatest either, but it just fits and doesn't really do anything wrong. I don't really have anything else to say here. It's definitely not a work of art, but it's just good.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7) - The voice actors aren't necessarily bad, but I really disliked Youto's voice in the first episode. And while I absolutely adore Tsukiko, it is undeniable that she had the easiest voicing role in like... ever. Tsukiko has a monotone voice (which you understand when you watch the anime), which doesn't change throughout the entire anime. The rest of the voice actors are okay, but nothing spectecular. While the opening and ending themes are, of course, personal preferences, I really liked them!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9) - I'm mainly going to focus on the two main characters from this anime: Youto and Tsukiko. While the others are good too, these two are what the anime revolves around the most.\\n\\n\r\nYouto - I like him because he strays away from the typical Harem King theme. Instead of being the cat, he is often the mouse. While he is a pervert, his actions barely come to life and he often doesn't want to get involved with them either. That's why I like him more over the regular Harem Kings.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiko - Everybody's favorite, and definitely mine too. Tsukiko is not only a very cute character, but also the main cause for the earlier mentioned happy and sad moments. The biggest reason I probably like her is that we are pretty similar, but in reverse. While she has emotions, I don't have many. While she can't express them, I have no trouble with it. And both of us talk in a pretty monotone voice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) - One of it's genres is Comedy, so there's bound to be some enjoyment here. And there is. This is mainly due to the writing, which is genius. Youto is a pervert after all, and they all react to it in a different way. And it does help that Tsukiko is the regular 'Black Hole Belly' stereotype of the anime. She can eat a lot, and those are often funny scenes to watch as she keeps talking in a monotone voice while eating so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) - Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is an anime with a missunderstood name. The story isn't anything special, but the characters and writing more than make up for it. If you're interested in something fresh that strays away from most of the clich\u00e9s other Harem anime have, give it a go!",

            "content": "Hot damn, where to start... \r\nTitle\r\nEhe how bout dat title. Don't be fooled, or get discouraged from watching this gem, simply because the word hentai is emblazoned in the frickin title. Just having finished watching this series, I would say this is actually my #1 favorite title of all time. There's just something about how frankly it captures the essences of our two main characters (who are static for most of the show)...\r\nStory\r\nHave you seen Future Diary? Yeah, I'm talking about that psychological thriller with future-predicting cell phones and that insane-crazy pink-haired yandere Future Diary. Welllll, now that I look back on Henneko the plotscales at exactly that pace. First half of the show is your typical what-you'd-expect from reading the series description. The plot sorta just moves at a snail's pace as the series has you get accustomed to the characters. Then in the second half, you go from \"oh hey the plot's actually going somewhere,\" to \"ok sure plot just slam my face on your way out the window\". But don't worry. The show builds itself up well, and ends with a satisfying (possibly unexpected, yet in the expected direction) conclusion. Oh, and I found it surprising how much material they were able to fit in just 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIntro, ending, and background music is nothing atypical of a harem/romcom, but there's just something about Tsukiko's nonchalant lightning-speed munching sound effects that I just can't seem to get enough of, which completely and utterly make up for it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nIn the beginning the main characters may seem dry or like they've been done already, and you'll find that some of the decisions that the characters make will seem over the top or out of place, but just trust me when I tell you the characters are like that for a reason which comes around later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI started watching this show, expecting to play out like your typical harem/romcom, and I mean yeah, sure I wasn't disappointed. Yoto is a huge pervert, and Tsukiko is basically an emotionless moe. But unlike most other harem/romcoms that I've seen, \\n\r\nthe employed plot devices throughout the show fascinated me. Following what cat god power was where, and which were in play at a given time was sort of hard to follow, but still pretty entertaining and opened up character development possibilities and plot points which would otherwise take much longer to get across.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI thought it was awesome.  9/10",

            "content": "\u201cMaking one person happy may be different from making everyone happy, but I still don\u2019t want to make any girls cry. No matter what.\u201d \r\nMemories and emotions are crucial in defining who we are as people, and if one were to lose one of those, they would certainly be in a pinch. Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko or \"The Pervert Prince and the Stone Cat\" is a tale of sacrifice, self-discovery and wishes. What seems on the outside as a mindless tale of erotic tomfoolery and comedy featuring a cast of many girls, turns out to be a story that holds lessons and morals thatwe can all appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nThe story in the first good portion of the series centers around three characters, being Youto, Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa. The plot is decent at this part as it follows the Stone Cat, a powerful deity who can take away something you have and give it to someone who needs it. At this point, Youto makes a mistake by giving away his ability to control his perverse thoughts, and must struggle to get them back from Azuki Azusa. But where the series really started to ring for me was the final 3 or so episodes, in which the story takes a turn to a much more serious tone, truly exploring the power of wishes that can be granted by a deity, and tackles the ideas of sacrifice and family. I would have wished that the series could have been more like the last episodes in the series, but there are positives and negatives to both. If you enjoy romcoms, then you will undoubtedly find enjoyment within the many lighter scenes and episodes of this series, as it seems everyone is trying to capture Youto. What adds to the atmosphere of this is the idea of an entity or deity in this case that can grant wishes, which adds a whole other dimension to the plot. I wasn't really sold in the first three episodes as it seemed like the series was going to drag on as a harem type plot in which nobody truly wins and it's just a battle of love interests, and thankfully I was mistaken as a I braced myself to continue the series. Don't be mistaken, there is plenty of comedy and times where the romance aspect does conflict between characters, there's just other things that help the anime to be more balanced and surprisingly emotional. In the end, it's a bit of a mixed bag. If you're looking for an anime that will only focus on the drama and discovering morals, then you might be disappointed. However if you're alright with the light-hearted \"perverted\" nature of this anime, and still enjoy your occasional drama (think Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka or Chuu2) then by all means, go for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this tale is beautiful, as the characters are very well drawn, and the scenery is also extremely well done as well. There shouldn't be many places where you can complain about the artwork in this anime, as even the animation in the OP and ED are surprisingly good. Watching the anime was a visual pleasure, to see all the characters fully interact and look great while doing it. For the sound, the OP and ED are enjoyable, although admittedly very feminine in nature. That shouldn't really stop you from enjoying the series too much as you can just skip them, so moving onto the soundtrack, it wasn't really anything notably good during the normal school/daily life themes but the piano tracks played during the emotional scenes are pretty solid. In all, the sound in this anime never really jumped out to me as \"spectacular\" but never left a bad taste in my mouth either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are crucial, and although some of them are pretty good, some left something to be desired. Simply put, there are a TON of characters in this show. However, you should quickly know that the main elements of the plot revolve around pretty much 3-4 characters. Those being Youto, Azuki Azusa (more in the first half), Tsukiko and Tsukushi. That being said, I'm disappointed that Emi wasn't more developed as there was an arc that heavily featured her. Additionally, it feels that Azuki Azusa is left in the dust in the last few episodes, as she almost completely disappears from your mind. Besides development, there's the obvious question, are they enjoyable to watch? The short answer is yes, the more complicated answer is going to follow. Youto is a very interesting individual and by interesting I mean he's pretty much a pervert, and you figure that out quite quickly. You might cringe a bit in the first few episodes, but please do not drop the show because of Youto's personality. He does tone down because of certain plot events, and he becomes a character that you heavily respect and adore by the end of the series. That being said, although it isn't officially labeled as a harem, most of the female characters are heavily attached to Youto by the end, and since there's no real other male characters, it's mostly fine. Some might grow to dislike certain characters, but overall, there were no characters that I flat out hated. No, you will not be throwing your computer out the window because you hate the MC so much (like a certain anime named School Days) but you may still find somethings to dislike. Basically, you should just stick with the anime, as the final arc, I feel really makes things worth it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy HenNeko? Absolutely. I love romcoms, and I came for a straight up romcom/harem in which hopefully one of the girls that I favored won, however I left with something much different. The emotional part of this anime is truly something else, and I won't spoil it because it's something that you should experience yourself. I'll put it this way, many people may spend their wishes on the Cat God for immediate benefit. For example, you may want a new car, or you don't want to have feelings for someone anymore. But what happens when there's a chance for you to give someone something that's very important to you, but they really need. Where does the joy of cherishing something dear to you meet sacrifice for your friends? How much are you willing to do? These are all things tackled within this anime (specifically the last part). \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 8/10. Great watch for those who will stick to the end.",

            "content": "Despite the title of \"Hentai Prince\" the show is not an ecchi/fan service title and is really some strange supernaturalish romantic comedy. The show is about how the wishes granted by the Nekogami affect the characters and the world they live in.\r\nThe Stony cat grants a wish in a rather particular way. For instance, the main character wants to be more open with who he is so he asks the cat to take away his facade. At the same time the cat will give what it took to someone who needs it. This along with the rather unlimited power the cat has is the basisof the show and how just about all the situation evolve.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is rather fresh at first and honestly, pretty funny. It goes out of hand during mid to late episodes with some questionable archs until the last couple of episodes which are heart warming and explains just about everything\\n\\n\r\nThis show has the benefit of having two of the most entertaining, and rather likeable leads of the season. Youto (the hentai prince), can't really talk to people, not because of being shy, but because he, after all, is a pervert and can't express himself correctly. So he wishes that the Nekogami take away his inhibition... which causes to be problematic. Tsukiko on the other hand has always relied on her emotions. I'm sure you can see where this is going. They try to help each other to regain what the cat took from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is somewhat a harem so other girls are present too. Among the most notable is Azusa, who starts out as a troubled and somewhat bullied character that looks like she might get some nice development, but unfortunately gets stuck in a rather poorly done later arch along with another character. Tsukushi (Tsukiko's older sister) is somewhat more important later on in the show, but never really gets the development she's due til the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a lot of the characters do get significant development, but not always in the way that might be the best. For having such strong main characters the side ones range from completely annoying to average.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat is a show you should not pass over due to its name. It has very entertaining and endearing main characters with enough of a moe factor to keep fans watching past some of the more questionable middle parts.",

            "content": "Henneko ( the pervert prince and the stony cat) is one of those shows great for watching during the weekend just for fun, when the really great shows aren't out yet. I am not saying this anime is bad or anything but just don't be expecting it to be around the best you have ever watched. This show is full of moe and some fan service; however, I guarantee you that there is more to it, like the characters for example. A strong cast can almost always make everything work out in the end, somehow.\r\nCharacters: 8.2/10\r\n\tWhile the main cast wasn't a shining example of thebest character we've seen in anime, they were, for the most part, handled very decently. The main character, Youtou Yokodera was much more than your usual harem (did I mention this series is also a harem?) block-headed perverted main character. Although this guy is also pervert, he isn\u2019t much more so than the average teenage guy surrounded by kawaii girls, apart from his sometimes wild fantasies and desire to openly be a pervert at the beginning of the series. As the episodes go on, he shows more and more behaviors typical of a nice guy, because he is actually a very selfless person. Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, the main girl is also a decently developed kuudere character, however make no mistake kuudere lovers, she may appear cold because she lost her emotions due to her wishing it but deep down she is so innocent and cute you may start drooling... The other characters were okay too, some of them were even memorable (which is always a great plus because good side characters aren\u2019t easily forgotten, most of the time) but I personally liked these two the most.\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\n\tThe story was plainly average. This is a slice of life romantic comedy and it was good in its genre, there were even some very decent emotional moments in the final two episodes. My main problem with the show's plot is, the shoddy attempts to add in a little flair of mystery. There were a few times it actually did the trick but to me, most of the time it felt forced and somewhat out of the blue. Maybe that's just me. I should also point out the stony cat that grants wishes was used A LOT as a plot device and often it did not serve any purpose whatsoever other than a chance to develop characters. That was about it for the \u201csupernatural\u201d part of this anime.\\n\r\nArt style/ Presentation: 9/10\\n\r\n\tThe character designs were cute and adorable, standard for what you would expect from a moe show made in the last three years, especially from J.C. Staff (my favorite studio, actually)\\n\r\nMusic and Voice acting: 6/10\\n\r\n\tThe voices of the characters were good but not a single performance stood out. The same goes for the music. It did its job and nothing else. Average.\\n\r\nEntertainment: 9/10\\n\r\n\tIt somehow managed to keep me interested enough to almost marathon it.\\n\r\nThe verdict:\\n\r\n\tWatch this show whenever you're bored or in need of a moe shot, with a decent anime along with it.\\n",

            "content": "From the depths of my heart, I can say that this was the cutest anime I've ever saw in my life! I wouldn't expect something like that, since my \"hunt\" is based on random encounters, but this one was really worthy, not to mention that a single twist would be able to impress me so much on an comedy anime.\r\n{STORY - 8/10}\r\nSeeing pervert Yokodera right on the beginning may let you wonder if this one would be like any other ecchi anime. Way wrong! This one is absolutely different from anything I saw before!\r\nThe plot focuses on a particular cat statue, able to give peoplesomething they need, in exchange of something they don't. That's a pretty unusual power, but other variants from this same statue have other features. However, every one of them is based on this \"Neko God\" being.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Yokodera decided to be more honest with his own thoughts and, on his way to ask for this statue's help, he finds himself with Tsukiko, a very emotive girl. She came to the same hill in order to find a way on hiding her facial expressions, her feelings.\u2029\u2029Both had issues with the statue and that's where the first part of this beautiful story begins. Obviously that Yokodera regreted his decision, just like Tsukiko. The struggle now was to fix these two problems.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, powers from the Neko God shouldn't be underestimated, as it was responsible for an even deeper and exciting scheme, that is soon revealled, as the plot suffers a small twist later on.\\n\\n\r\n{ART - 9/10}\\n\\n\r\nI became amazed with the relatively simple design used on Henneko. Visuals are really smooth and beautiful to glaze at. Eyes' style is totally basic, but also quite unique and really nice. I particularly loved how female characters have small blush signs on their cheeks all the time, even when they're not embarassed. It makes them so adorable...\\n\\n\r\n{SOUND - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nA cute anime needs both OP and ED themes up to it and that's  what they did. Seeing such accurate sequences, combined with cheering and beautiful songs was something to be remembered. Can't say much about the backgrounding during the anime tough.\\n\\n\r\n{CHARACTERS - 6/10}\\n\\n\r\nYokodera is a really odd pervert. He's not crazy for boobs like Issei. Still, he has no shame about his actions, just like Toori. Despite that, he hides a gentle and sweet personality under this disguise and can show affection very well.\\n\\n\r\nDirectly into Tsukiko, the girl from which I was unable to turn my eyes away. After having her prayer granted, her face would never change again, as her voice tone. That's what makes her so lovable. You just want to hug her and hear her making cute noises while eating and breathing all the time!\\n\\n\r\nThere are really few characters on this one, but that's not a problem to me. We also get to see two tsunderes, both Azusa and Tsukushi, both who fall in love for Yokodera. Others characters, like Ponta and Emi have a brief appearance on some episodes.\\n\\n\r\n{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nWatching gorgeous anime is an priority, but seeing really amazing plots and well made twists are essential for me to enjoy the anime. Great one, for sure!\\n\\n\r\n{OVERALL - 9/10}\\n\\n\r\nHaving the chance to make a wish is something everyone would like. However, none of us is able to say what we really want and things could get messed up in the process. Why Yokodera can't remember about his past? Where Tsukiko and Tsukushi are related to his memories? The Neko God will give you anything, but it has its consequences. A wrong move and you can end up on a trouble bigger than you could ever imagine!",

            "content": "First off for this review if you are reading this to determine whether or not you are going to watch it you should note that while it has hentai in the title, this is not necessarily a super ecchi anime. if you were looking for that stuff id recommend going elsewhere.\r\nStory+Characters:\r\nThe summary for hentai ouji is accurate but it doesnt encompass how much more the story is. The cat statue is there throughout the story and it does play a vital role but the summary doesnt reveal how deep the characters are and how they form relationships. This may look like one of those animesthat takes the cliche character types and throws them into  a school and harem setting where it all is duct taped together and presented too quickly; its definitely not one of those. it may be at a school setting, but the scenes arent really at the school often at all, which makes it quite a bit better than the animes which mainly consist of just school meetings because there is a nice linear plot that changes the scenery often.\\n\\n\r\n although the title is about prince pervert its not really that ecchi a lot of the time. in fact the first few episodes have it the most and it really calms down after that. if ecchi is not your thing at all then maybe this isnt for you. however fanservice here is next to none at all, so if you can stand the ecchi situations without the fanservice then you should be able to enjoy it overall. the characters were great; each had a really different personality and they had a reason why they were different. what this anime does a lot better than most is when explaining the pasts of the characters its at a good pace without anything feeling rushed or out of place. that brings us to the comedy. the entirety of how the story can intertwine the comedy with the somewhat serious plot makes it shine. every episode made me laugh in one way or another because the comedy was not always innocent but it felt right with what was happening. even during the serious moments it shone wonderfully through both the characters and the actual scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nnot much here for the sound because it didnt stand out too much nor did it ruin the mood. it was mostly limited to background music. although the occasional song sung by the girl was cute.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art was great the characters were really fluid and drawn well. the body shapes were natural looking as were the facial expressions (with the exception of a certain someone) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime i thought the whole thing was good from the pervert prince to the whole wishing to a cat statue actually coming true. i laughed a lot but i also got the feels on multiple occasions. the animators and story directors did a good job with leaving on a finished story at the end of the episode but also adding something new that makes you yearn to see the next one. i suppose that could also be called having a lot of cliffhangers but they werent the bad kind where it drags on. something odd that i liked about this anime is that it doesnt start anything the same. from meeting different characters to eating a meal there is always a different perspective and viewpoint as well as dialogue. some animes tend to slow down in the middle or lose their sense of story and get side tracked but hentai ouji does an excellent job and expands on its own plot with wonderful characters you cant help but enjoy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nif you are into a story that really surprises you in a good way and keeps on surprising you then you should give this a try. \\n",

There's still a lot I want to tell you about!)\r\nThe above quote is from the OP with is EXTREMELY moe-moe, but don't worry, this time, this anime ISN'T just cute girls doing cute things: there's actually a plot. (*GASP*)\r\nNOTE: skip to the end of the review to for a \"quick summary\" of why you would or would not like this show.\r\nUPDATE: I just checked the rules and saw that you're not supposed to add pointless stuff in the review. I know that's obvious but added them anyway so... removing emnow. (JMURNIR's questions seem like what  prospective viewers might ask, so I'm keeping them)\\n\\n\r\nalso added minor stuff i apparently missed in the rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n> wait... an anime with hentai in a title actually having a plot? are you SERIOUS?!\\n\\n\r\nyep, just read on my just-made-up-right-now-imaginary-reader. or JMURNIR(hey, are you Nordic?)\\n\\n\r\nanyway, yes. the plot can be read in the anime's synopsis area, check it out.\\n\\n\r\n> JMURNIR: Okay, so it's about a pervert and an overly emotional girl who\\n\r\n> wishes to change by praying to a Cat-god... how is this awesome?\\n\\n\r\n...it's awesome because their wish actually worked. and very effectively to the point it affected their social lives. and this is where most of the plot's conflicts arises: from the Cat-god.\\n\\n\r\nexplaining that part further will just be too much spoilers. so let's drop the subject and move on.\\n\\n\r\nAs said, the \"genie kitty\" is the show's major source of conflict, the character's decision greatly affect their relationships with each other. everyone grows a bit and change because of these experiences. in other words, there's plenty of character development.\\n\\n\r\nbut aside from that, there's also the humor. the show uses it's Cookie-Cutter-Cutout-People (CCCP for short, nothing to do with the codec pack)  to set up jokes. pretty normal, except as said, some of these gags actually develop the plot. (surprise Bondage and Humiliation anyone?)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:10/10\\n\\n\r\n the art style is cute, the environments are nice (hard to find badly made backgrounds these days, if you see one, message me.), I haven't seen off model moments as well. so yeah, no complaints on this department.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, is the art style memorable? to me, it is, The face designs are very recognizable, the uniform designs, not much. then again, why would you need that when you have a solid plot? no one complains that everyone wears suits in a well written mafia movie.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the nice special effects. which wasn't exactly what I was expecting in this anime. because why would a Slice of life need complex sfx? anyway, detailing what particular SFX was used would be a spoiler, so just see for yourself. (around EP 7, if i recall correctly)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't skipped the op or ed ever since I started watching. seriously, it's THAT catchy.\\n\r\nthe songs in the anime itself are pretty good too. mood setting music is great. everything fits well. however, it's pretty standard fair for this kind of anime. nothing memorable save for the op/ed. but why is it STILL 10/10 you ask? because it still made me wanna watch the anime with HQ speakers.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting (briefly) detailed the character section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n> JMURNIR: Alright, now you're just overrating this anime!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...This deserves a 10 for two things.\\n\\n\r\n1. The voice acting is top notch.\\n\r\nTsukiko's VA Yui Ogura did a great job portraying her. I'm singling her out of the rest--who all did excellent jobs themselves, but it's just Tsukiko's character is unique for what she is because her delivery and lines do a great job of making the character seem more than meets the eye. (no, she unfortunately does not yell \"TRANSFORMERS ROLL OUT!\" at any point in the show, but explaining how she acts with the character will be a spoiler)\\n\\n\r\n2. The characters have Personas.\\n\\n\r\nNo, not the firefox term for Themes nor Atlus's franchise. They're WAYY more than what they are supposed to be(for this kind of show, that is, otherwise, they'll pale in comparison to any decent mature anime)\\n\\n\r\nWatching them interact with each other we learn that they're more than CCCP, they have dreams(no matter how childish, they WERE kids when they made it after all),\\n\\n\r\nthey have normal pasts that most people can relate with. even the ones that come out as petty are actually less petty than they seem once you get to know them.\\n\\n\r\nIn case we aren't clear persona=facade, so for example, that nice girl you helped on the way home actually cursed and found you disgusting and showed that only when no one was looking.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have well thought out pasts and aspirations and hence come off as more than just yet another Moeblob, Tsundere, Ojou, Hentai, etc. in other words, they are not just mere Stock Characters/Stereotypes, they're actual characters.\\n\r\nSo yeah, save for THE stock characters (ganguros, main character's best friend) this anime is some sort of Lite Deconstruction for some anime stereotypes. with \"Be Careful What You Wish For\"  as the main driving force of the plot.\\n\\n\r\n> JMURNIR: whoa, they sure seem deep. Now I wanna see this even more!\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to repeat, even if you say they're deep. they're still deep only if you compare them to others in the genre. don't expect Evangelion level character depth here.\\n\\n\r\n> JMURNIR: fair enough. I won't expect that much then. \\n\\n\r\nanyway:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I watched for the moe and stayed for the character development. It has excellent humor and tasteful fanservice. There is no dull moment in this anime. even on slower segments you'll feel like you're right there with the characters, sitting like an unseen observer. It's rare for me to be this absorbed on anime. the last time I got this hooked was on Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n> JMURNIR:whoa, big words there, pal. I'll just have to see\\n\r\n> for myself if it's as good as you say then!\\n\\n\r\nYes, please do.\\n\\n\r\nand now...\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor people who like: moe, character development, cute characters, anime stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nNOT for people who like: Madoka-level deconstruction(EDIT: as in it's not to Madoka's level, hence not worth watching exclusively for it), ecchi on young looking characters, serious shows.",

The first few episodes are fun, in a manner that one expects from the title, but there's far more to come. I was thoroughly impressed by the great depth and complexity the that the plot line was able to develop in just a short 12 episodes. The characters and story line all become well developed, especially considering the brevity of the series. I encourage anyone to watch this anime--it is fun, silly, light-hearted, surprising and touching. The only limiting factor I found to this anime was thatthere are only 12 episodes, which isn't enough time to really flesh out the characters and plot in a really thorough manner, but this anime does do a great job with the time it has! I think anyone can enjoy an anime like this, and will also be surprised at the twists it throws at you.",

            "content": "Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (in short Henneko) is a anime where Yokodera Yoto, male protagonist, and Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko, one of the heroine(?!), makes wishes to the Stony cat statue, which has a rumor of being able to grant wishes when given a offering. Yoto wishes to get rid of his habit of lying and his facade, and Tsukiko wishes her true feeling not show so easily anymore. \r\nThe entire story of Henneko revolves around Yoto solving the troubles that the cat statue causes from the wishes that the main characters made to it (if you seen the up to ep 7, you will knowwhat I'm talking about). So without further a do, let's get into the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Explanation:\\n\\n\r\nYokodera Yoto: the Hentai Ouji of the story. 24/7, Yoto always thinks about perverted stuffs, but he shows exceptional obsession towards school swimsuits (this is why he is in the track team). His raison d'\u00eatre is hentai. However, people around misunderstands him, thinking that he is a honest, hard working man. After making his wish, Yoto is unleashed; his perverted thoughts does not end as a thought, but becomes words and actions, which ultimately makes him called the Hentai(Perverted) Ouji(Prince). Yoto later gets his facade back, but soon after that, gets rid of his feeling of shame. Yoto is a great fan of Oscar Wilde, making quite a reference of Wilde's works. Aside of Oscar Wilde, Yoto is quite a reader, and knowledgable of not only sexual/perverted areas, but also with common sense and academic. But during usual, Yoto tries his best to harass Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa, which ends up him being kicked to the face or be threatened of making him to live in prison for rest of his life. Yoto and Tsukiko and Tsutsukakushi family met in the past, however Yoto doesn't seem to remember it well (a bit cloudy).\\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi Tsukiko: the Warawanai Neko of the story. Cuteness itself. Just, Cute. She is a underclassman of Yoto. Tsukiko wishes to be more adult-like, which lead for her to wish for her feeling not to show so easily anymore (this is Tsukiko's image of an adult). Tsukiko's personality is like that of a \"Cat\", as Yoto says. After losing her expressions (due to her wish), her habit of showing her embarrassment is her touching her side-tail. Tsukiko is quite a eater, or rather, a food champion; she loves eating, cooking foods, but for the most, loves watching people eating her food. Tsukiko often refers Yoto as \"Hentai-san\" and \"Senpai\" and frequently threatens Yoto by telling him that she will call the police and have him arrested. Tsukiko met with Yoto before she entered high school, which Yoto doesn't remember, and from then, she might have fallen for him(smirk).\\n\\n\r\nAzuki Azusa: If Tsukiko is the cat, then Azuki Azusa is the puppy. She is in the same grade as Yoto, and the girl that gained the facade that Yoto gave away to the stony cat statue. With her beauty, many boys in the school confess love to her, and due to the facade that she has, Azuki Azusa rejects them in a harsh stinging way which for male students feels as if it is a prize from the queen (people refers this act as Azuki Azusa's Prize Time). As said earlier, Azuki Azusa is the \"Puppy\" and Tsukiko is the cat; they often face off each other because of Yoto, but later becomes BFF because of Azuki Azusa's incident (ep 2~3). Azuki Azusa is quite a important character of the story, next to Tsukiko. Azuki Azusa refers Yoto as her \"pet\" but in real, she is more like the pet of her being obsessively all over Yoto all the time(smirk).\\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi Tsukushi: the Steel Queen of the story and older sister of Tsukiko. Through out the story, Yoto refers Tsukushi as  Queen of Steel, or Steel Queen; the name came from Tsukushi's personality of being stubborn like steel and expressionless like a inanimate object. She is the president of the school track team and is very passionate towards it. Tsukushi is, even more than track, very passionate and all over Tsukiko; she wants to marry Tsukiko. Steel Queen is, however, very stupid or more like a child, lacking common knowledge of living in the world. Tsukushi believes that Yoto is a diligent passionate track runner like her, and give her utmost trust to him, even wanting him to success the president of track team. Because of her childish acts, she gets involved with most of the troubles regarding the Stony Cat Statue. Tsukushi is also referred as a \"Lion\" because of her noble and outgoing actions that she makes.\\n\\n\r\nEmanuela Pollarola(Emi): She is called the 100% girl, and the reason is that her smile is pure 100%, as Yoto \"believes\". Emi in past, met with Yoto while she was in Japan. However, she had to go back to Italia, and makes a promise with Yoto for that Yoto will write hand written letters to her even when she goes back. Emi has a beautiful voice and sings like an angel; she was in the church quoir while she was in Japan. When she came back to Japan, Yoto had no idea who she was, which \"pissed her off.\" Yoto believes that Emi is a cute, innocent girl until he remembers her true nature, a devilish angel that is. She looks like a rabbit or a \"Bunny\". She often says \"Pumpkin\" when she is mad, pissed, or badmouthing Yoto.\\n\\n\r\nThat was quite a explanation, or rather a spoiler (especially for Emi), but in summary, all the girls are all over Yokodera Yoto. So in short, this is story of Perverted Prince and a Stony Cat, Tsundere Puppy, Childish Lion, and Devilish tsundere Bunny. \\n\\n\r\nAbout seiyuu, absolute gorgeous lineup: Kaji Yuki for Yokodera Yoto, Ogura Yui for Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko, Ishihara Kaori for Azuki Azusa, Tamura Yukari for Tsutsukakushi Tsukushi, and Terakawa Ayumi for Emi. THANK YOU FOR HAVING OGURA YUI FOR TSUKIKO!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nTamura Yukari sang the opening theme \"Fantastic Future\", which is very upbeat and very addictive. Ogura Yui sang the ending theme \"Baby Sweet Berry Love\" which drew two different Tsukikos, one before she made her wish and one after becoming \"Stony\". Just absolute cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Henneko is a typical school romance love comedy anime, but full of Cuteness and story.\\n\\n\r\nOgura Yui, Henneko Forever.\\n",

First the summary is accurate for the first few episodes but then goes on a strange twist and focuses only on the male character making the girls feel like love sick puppies. While the harem effect seems obvious I was still hoping for more character development form the girls.\r\nAlong with the plot of \"discovering what they lost\" the episodes don't all make sense unless you watch it all. (At least for me)\r\nThe only thing I really liked about this was the slight resolution of why the main character was they way he wasand how the characters all seemed happy in the end.",

            "content": "Let me start of by saying this 100% opinion based on my perception of the anime. With that said I don't care if you object to it. Constructive criticism is welcome.\r\nNow let's start from the beginning, literally, I loved the theme song so much that I would purposefully go back to the beginning just to hear it and start dancing in my seat. Yokedera is a high school boy who manages to maintain a misconception of him being a Good Samaritan. This becomes a problem for him because I keeps making him busier and busier when he only really wants to focus on you think,women. Desperately wanting to get rid of this facade he has he hatches an idea to wish it away after his freind tells him about a cat statue that has the power to grant wishes because it is part of the embodiment of a deity. Upon reaching the cat statue he \"meets\" one of the main female protagonist tsukiko. Tsukiko is there for a similar reason, to lose something they don't need. The way this cat statue works is it takes something you do not wish to possess and gives it to someone else. Now that I've given you a brief synopsis it's time to give you the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off I found it very hard to become attached to the characters. I didn't feel alot of emotional connections, I couldn't really relate to them either. I also didn't feel like they made any real revelations or significant progress. Small development though. Yet I found myself fascinated by the characters. They're all very dynamic from each other and it's worth it just to see how these characters interacting and play off of each other. How different they are from each other and the fact they keep these close relationships with each other is one of the best things about the show. For an ecchi anime it's incredibly light hearted, it's not another \"i must absolutely obsess over the main character and have his cock\" kind of anime. Going back to what I said about the characters being incredibly different from each other, the situations they are placed in is one of the best parts and redeeming qualities of the show. They're thrown into these sporadic and off the wall situations and its humorous to see how they'll behave and cooperate with each other. I adored the art style of the anime as well, all of the colors seemed to fade and shade perfectly. I also loved the voice acting, every voice seemed to match the character absolutely perfect in every way, to tone, pitch, appearance of the chacter to sound of the voice, to the personality of the voice itself. \\n\\n\r\nPossible spoilers ahead so be warned: \\n\\n\r\nNow for a little more gripes. There were some major holes in the story that could have been fixed with a simple wish. Magic is already a complicated thing to explain in a story but later down the rode we deal with memories and time travel. I felt like some of the perversion was overdone just a tad and could have been easily avoided if the main character could communicate properley. The story gets very confusing at times but most of it is explained in due time. The confusing parts are actually one of the main reasons you'll want to watch more of the show.",

It tries to be different but still feels cliched but it will mange to entertain you just fine.\r\nArt- As expected of J.C Staff(fun fact - My first romantic anime Golden Time was also by them.) the art is good and the character designis nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The Characters were the strength of HenNeko.you can watch it for Tsukiko alone.and after a long time I got a pervert harem MC.\\n\\n\r\nSound - You know I mentioned I got melancholic from  some anime that does not happen  because of a particular  scene  or something, it happened every time because of a piece of ost. HenNeko had that one heart stringing OST  for me too,but the overall OST   was also great,it fitted  every scene perfectly. The MC who is a pervert is voiced by Kaji Yuki who has also voiced Hyoudou Issei(one of the biggest perv, I have seen in anime).so his voice was perfect.I would also like to give a applause for VA of Tsukiko(she was perfect as a expressionless girl)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I would have I enjoyed more If had not been struck by melancholy. but still it was good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:I would rec HenNeko\\n\r\n1)for Tsukiko ,the perfect expressionless girl.\\n\r\n2) for watching a good harem.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for wasting your time reading this.",

            "content": "I am not an emotional person. So you have to believe me when I say that this anime brought me to tears. Most people regard YLiA and Angel Beats as anime that brought them to tears among others, but they never made me cry and yet Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko made me cry? Why? Because of the brilliant characters.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAs with any Harem anime, there is a string of events joint into a thin plot which is also consistent of many harem tropes, but the place where this anime stands out is *how* strongly the arcs are linked. It revolves around a CatGod who can grant wishes, but the twist is that it takes what you don't need and gives it somebody else. Our MC Yokodera makes a wish along with a girl named Tsukiko and it takes off from there and at *any* point of the anime you'll realise that the events string and link together. I have given an 8 because it links events strongly but also because of the excellent final arc. I won't spoil it but see for yourself and you'll thank me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing developed by JC Staff it's not surprising that it looks amazing and colourful. It perfectly fits the mood and the character too. Although not at the level of Kadokawa who IMO make the best looking anime in terms of art style that doesn't make it any lower. Although it feels a lot of the effort has been put into the art in just the OP and ED so the main story art feels inferior to some.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I'm not a fan of the opening the ending was really fun to listen to IMO. The opening felt bland and forced but the ending nailed it. Now for the voice actors I liked nearly all the voice acting except for Azuki. Her voice didn't sound so good and felt forced too... Apart from her the voice actors did an amazing job especially Tsukiko and Yokodera.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, here is the strong point of this anime. The characters are very well developed (amazingly for a Harem anime, which usually has tropes for characters) and gives each character an important part to play. It felt as if each character had something special and different within them. Here are a few of the characters I liked a lot and I felt left a lasting impression:\\n\\n\r\nYokodera: He's your run out of the mill pervert but unlike your typical Issei he has his own problems (such as his memory) and highlights his struggles and how he overcomes them. Very rarely do I see such a well built male MC in anime. The way he tackled the problems in the last arc is mainly the reason I have given the 'character' section a full mark. It brought me to tears for the first time ever since I started watching anime and that's pretty much a big deal for me because as I mentioned I'm not an emotional person. Watching the final arc alone will prove to you how much of an amazing character he is\\n\\n\r\nTsukiko: From being a person scared of showing her true emotion to being an outright savage, Tsukiko has improved well as a character, although it may feel monotone to you (pun intended) I found Tsukiko pretty relatable along with Yokodera too. Once again I'd like to mention the last arc as her actions were pretty strong too as she had a strong resolve to fix everything.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa: Now this is in the spoiler section so I'd like to remind you about how reading this part could get your experience ruined if knowing a little bit of a person is a spoiler to you so ***Spoiler Alert*** I loved the way Tsukasa behaved and her dedication to her daughters. It was very heart breaking to see her live about alone without her daughters and yet her dedication remained as she sewed clothes for her children into the late hours into the night assisted emotionally by a young Yokodera. Tsukasa's relationship with Yokodera is a other reason I was brought to tears. It's a really sad story if you think about it... ***End Spoiler***\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I really enjoyed the anime because like Sakurasou no pet na Kanojo, it showed a lot of different emotions. How people are happy, how they tackle sorrow and how they tackle living with no emotions or memories. This shows me how an anime gets so powerful it enters into a league of it's own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the strongest points being the Characters and Story I really recommend this to anyone who wants a strong set of characters and a bit of a harem thrown into the mix! If you like to be moved to tears, then this is good for you too, although you'll have to wait till the final arc so get those tissues ready!",

Well, the mc was good enough - but still pretty dense though. But he was still likeable. The girls were okay. I liked only one. But others weren't annoying at least.\r\nThe art was cute. It is similar to Chunnibyou (I guess - maybe a little low idk). Both the opening and ending are cute and the music was alright too.\r\nThe story started average, got a little bit crazy in the middle but ended nicely. I love it when they actually conclude romances.And this anime does it. There is a proper conclusion to romance. There are no unfinished business.\\n\\n\r\nI already have a bad image of harems - they usually have no plot and when you mix in supernatural I expected shitty plot. But surprisingly I liked the supernatural elements in this series. They made enough sense. I liked the plot twists too - very rare to see smart twists in harems.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I concluded I will throw away my prejudice towards harem and give them a try before turning away.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, I give this series a 8 on 10.",

            "content": "People always wants to get rid of their flaws for the better...but what if \"just being yourself\" is the better way to go?.\r\nDon't let the name of the anime \"HENTAI Ouji to Warawanai Neko.\" fool you, this anime is much more than a typical ecchi anime...it's a sincere and thoughtful ecchi romcom!.\r\nIf Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. has anything going for it, it is it's characters and their sincerity they outright display mainly form our main protagonist Youto Yokodera voiced by Yuki Kaji the resident pervert of the series. The other hook is that the plot is also kinda interesting to what surmounts to oneof those typical \"trickster genie\" plotlines in the form of the cat god statues with various effects on the wisher.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is kinda a character focused narrative, LA will move onto characters. LA already talked about Youto Yokodera but LA will go into a bit more depth with him. He is one of the major forces driving the plot forward, if not he's one of the causes of many of the wishes gone wrong and he wants to protect everyone or befriend them in order to help with both his own problems as well as others. He is a slightly unusual main protagonist in the sense but still has one of the trappings of \"wants to protect everyone schtick to him, though once again his sincerity and dedication can easily make up for his pervertedness and especially his trappings that irked LA by the halfway point. Next are the harem members...Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi voiced by Yui Ogura, one of the main female protagonist in which she wished to express less emotions thus can't express ANY emotions, she is for the most part was a supporting character though her character development does arise from her issues of wanting to express herself but can't, that and her connection to Youto before the start of the anime also helps her to get away from her supporting character status and becomes important in certain plotlines. She was one of LA's favourite characters in the series because of her interesting dilemma and driving force of the anime. Next is Azusa Azuki voiced by Kaori Ishihara, the ojou of the series or so it would seem and adds to Youto's love triangle in a sense. Her character development arc was probably what sold LA in this series as it was more or less visceral on how it went. She later on has more importance later on but her introductory arc definitely added the impact to the anime really was going for and what it would become and like Tsukiko is an important character to the plot outright. Next is Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi, Tsukiko's older and much brasher sister voiced by Yukari Tamura and is the one that gave Youto the title of \"Hentai Ouji\", she is at best a comedic character what with her naivete and her brutishly powerful strength that makes for pretty slapstick comedy when with Youto, but because she's Tsukiko's older sister yes...she has a bit of importance to the plot as well but going any deeper would be spoiler territory and she also with her younger sister were LA's favourite characters in the anime, Azusa story-wise however had the better plotlines and impact to the anime (sans the finale arc which had more to do with Youto and Tsukiko which would make sense). Finally we have Emanuela Pollarola voiced by Aimi Terakawa, a mysterious young girl who knows Youto and her importance has some ties to Azusa but again spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nWhy LA dived into the characters is that these characters do have some certain themes, the typical \"just be yourself\" is there and accounted for, but also \"be careful what you wish for\" added in and executed VERY well allowing these character to flourish in a sense and really make these characters with flaws such \"perverted and completely open minded about it, expressing too much, being different to being selfish and clingy\" really really likable and \"human\" and what allows the anime to be different from those typical romcom animes. LA also especially liked how Tsukiko, Azusa and Emanuela's animal theming coincided with the harem dynamic of the cat, dog and rabbit respectively. \\n\\n\r\nThere is fanservice in this anime, there's no mistake in that but it's just not to the focus of the anime. The fanservice in the anime does mainly consist of the harem members going through many fanservicey outfits and certain ass shots but other than that it's pretty vanilla nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.'s plot elements has the typical stylings of a harem but it also has a bit of mystery mainly with it's wishmaking scenario's it has with it's characters. The mystery usually revolves around \"who is the wishmaker\" and \"how to make them revert it\" because of this insight it allows us to develop the wishmaker in question and drives the intrigue of the plot forward with Youto developing relationships or solving it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by JC Staff, the character designs were polished and moe and LA really loved the designs, the backgrounds also had to give a bit of mention as the anime does go into some \"weird territory\" what with the wishmaking scenario and does emphasis the bizarre nature of the anime at times and all to the polished state similar to the character designs. JC Staff nonetheless did a really good job in the animation department in Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the voice acting was actually pretty spot on for the entire cast. Though Yuki Kaji is typecasted as the lovable pervert in this anime (*cough* Highschool DxD *cough*), he is still a standout in this anime nonetheless and able to flex his harem drama vocals. Now LA had been annoyed by Yui Ogura to a certain extent a couple of times on LA's reviews but LA will be straight with you here, Yui Ogura is a GREAT voice actor (see her roles as Athena from Campione!, Yuzurina Houshou from Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!, Hanbee Takenaka from Oda Nobuna no Yabou, Rinne Berlinetta from ViVid Strike! and Toki Onjouji from Saki Achiga-hen: Episode of Side-A..all coincidentally all have deadpan or loli tones in them in some sense) but Yui Ogura can sometimes be a caricature of her own roles and that easily spills into her vocals of the typical genki loli vocals, however her role as Tsukiko is one of her better roles to date for LA, sure her vocals are that of a deadpan loli but even then she has \"range\" to it utilizing both her loli and deadpan in the best mix possible and absolutely avoiding the annoying tone in her vocals at all for her role as Tsukiko and LA LOVED her performance because of it...she still wasn't LA's favourite voice actor in this anime though...that goes to Yukari Tamura AND Kaori Ishihara, Yukari Tamura because...it's Yukari Tamura voicing a brutish tsundere! and Kaori Ishihara for her voicing Azusa and her RANGE was more or less amazing in this anime. Even though this anime's voice cast has certain annoyingly squeaky voice actors, this voice cast managed to divert that COMPLETELY. LA just loved this voice cast...what else can LA say?.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale arc as LA mentioned above looked at Youto and Tsukiko's rather mysteriously missing backstory of their first meeting which surprisingly Youto seemed to have forgotten, this finale arc brought some loose plot threads as well reverting the focus back to Tsukiko proper (as Emanuela, Tsukushi and Azusa took her limelight for a while with their development respectively) something LA was kinda wanting ever since Azusa's introductory arc and finally bringing Tsukiko out of the \"supporting comedic role\". This finale did get rather serious with some \"family issues\" as one of it's biggest crutch to the finale and executed well as the conflict was visceral (or took the turn for the dramatic...though Azuki's arc was like this too) in a sense, nonetheless LA liked the change in atmosphere while still balancing it's more comedic antics in check when it is needed. The only thing this finale had though if you paid attention to the plot is that the entire \"missing backstory of Youto\" is predictable in the sense that if you connected all the dots and took all the subtle hints...it became obvious what this finale arc was leading too, but still even if this ending was predictable, LA still liked this ending for developing not only Youto's missing backstory but Tsukiko and Tsukushi by an extent and giving a \"happy\" ending with a self-sacrificing result from Youto in the process but still a \"happy\" ending either way.\\n\\n\r\nLA really has to talk about flaws in this anime and it'll be more ironic that LA will in this review as LA already said that Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.'s themes of just being yourself even with your flaws but nonetheless the flaws needs to be addressed and LA did see some flaws in this anime as a whole. As much as Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is a refreshing take on the ecchi romcom anime, it still has most of it's cliches accounted for from the typical harem setting and MANY of the misunderstandings drives the plot forward in a way (mainly from Tsukiko from comedic reasoning, Azuki from the plot), but as a defense to this LA will say that even though they use the typical harem romcom cliches, it's the underlining interesting plotlines with it's even more interesting characters that keeps it away from being stereotypical of it's genre even with it's cliches. The only other thing that might irk some people about Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is Youto himself and his open-minded pervertedness and sometimes his white lying does kinda cross the line for the sake of comedy at times...some might see him as endearing...some might see him as another typically annoying Yuki Kaji genki pervert...take your pick...LA was in both camps for that.\\n\\n\r\nWe all have flaws that we know or people point out that might make us a better person, but if ridding these flaws makes you a better person, it'll strip your individuality and being \"perfect\" is nothing but a flaw in itself and Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. projects this in it's characters and what makes Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. something refreshingly different in it's genre. LA will say this again, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.'s characters and their flaws are the defining trait and strength of this anime and just it's sincerity and charm it has to it all coming from a white lying pervert and an emotionless girl as our main leads is anything to go by.",

The outrageous plot got me interested, the character development kept me watching. The art and sound are both good but this series really shines in its cuteness and humor. The pervert jokes never really get old. It's too bad that the transitions between the humor, bizarre story arc, and surprisingly heartfelt moments are often jarring. There was some missed potential here that almost earned it a 7 but overall it was highly enjoyable as a funny and heart-warming slice of very bizarrelife. \\n\\n\r\nTsukiko's \"expressions\" were likely the cutest and simultaneously funniest parts for me, if I ever watch it again it will be because of her.",

            "content": "\"Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.\"\r\nA perfect phrase for this series. Wishes. Wishing will always be a part of being human. You wish because you are human. But if you don't get what you wish, you end up disregarding others right? And then that's where desire comes in. There's a big difference between wishes and desires. Wishes are meant to be wishes, what I mean is. You pray in God's name, you throw coins on wishing wells . And you'd know there's a chance that it won't come true right? Unlike desire. When you desire something, you don't prayon something. You tell yourself you want that thing, that you'd get it no matter what the cost is. So enough with the wishing and desire lecture! Let's start with this review!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9\\n\r\nAs you can see, I rated the story really high. I'll be a little unfair here. I gave it a 9 since it's one of my favorite series. Well, I shall tell you why! So we have our lucky guy Yokodera who is a pervert in every way, he has the ability to sugarcoat things really good. Basically he's good at lying. He then met a girl who has the total opposite of his personality. The main girl Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko who doesn't know how to hide her facial expressions and is honest, they prayed on a stone cat who grants wishes. That Yokodera's facade to be gone, and for Tsukiko to hide her facial expressions easily. And that's when the chain of deeply good plot starts with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nHentai ouji just came out this spring. So we should expect art that's really good, since art nowadays are mostly done by CG's. Well this is not a mecha or some action series. So you wouldn't need a lot of CG editing here. But I gotta tell you. In this day and age, this kind of art is really good. So expect some good art on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nI can't actually say what the characters' personalities are, since you'll end up cursing me, because it'll spoil the series really good. And you'll know them very well as the series progress.  The characters are not that original, considering a lot of rom/com anime with the same pervert protagonist came out. BUT! Hentai ouji characters are easily known. They have their own personalities that make them stand out, which gives them their own identity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 8\\n\r\nNot much to say on this one, they don't have much music. No songs were played by the characters during the show. But the opening theme and ending is quite cute. Oh wait, there were times that Tsukiko sings a couple or three nursery rhymes(?), not that it was worth mentioning, she's totally tone-deaf, but its kinda cute too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show, I'm not that hard to please when it comes to watching. If it piques my interest, ill gladly devote my time on it. And this one really piqued me. So I ended up missing my cram school watching the series overnight. Its really worth watching, with the mild echiness and the progress of the story is quite fast so there's never a dull moment for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\nOf all the ecchi/harem romcom series I've watched, hentai ouji surely is one of my favorites, why? Like I've mentioned before, its not your everyday harem/ecchi romcom series. Because its not just about giving pantyshots, bouncing breasts, perverted positions, lewd scenes(well it still contains some of it.) It has a deep plot, easily recognizable characters and a little bit of drama. So that covers my review on this series! Enjoy the series if your going to watch it!\\n",

The characters really develop, quite deeply, and they don't disappear once they've been developed. I couldn't stop watching it, once the first part where you meet everyone is over, it takes quite a turn story-wise. A turn for the better, but also the emotional. \r\nIt's a very well written turn, I thoroughly enjoyed the development although it made me quite sad. \r\nIn between there was a lot of humor, and of course ecchi. I really liked the proportions, it seemed tohave just enough humor, boobies and seriousness to make it a very worthwhile series. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally I'd love to see more, but I'm afraid this isn't one of those series. The story has been told, well, and the only thing we can hope for is (another) swimsuit OVA.",

            "content": "Well to start off the thing that caught my eye in this anime is the genres. I mean typical, comedy, romance, school. And when I thought it couldn't get worse, Harem. But then I saw there was no Ecchi and there was seinen plus supernatural. This got me thinking \"this is an unusual combination of genres, so I looked into it. I was there just for the sake of curiosity. But to my surprise this is how I found it:\r\nStory: 8\r\nOne thing I found good about this is that there was an actual plot. The characters had something they were looking for. There is alsochange in consistency of the story and because it changes it doesn't get repetitive. In my opinion great. And when I thought it would end like any harem anime it had a \"twist\" of the past which reveals all the truth about the little details that didn't make sense throughout the anime. And adding the supernatural aspect made this anime different (I know there are so many harems with supernatural, but if you watch this you'll understand).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nOf course it's good, but even if the standard of 2013 art is high this type of art was still good and in some ways different. And the characters were drawn very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI found the opening quite catchy and the ending sometimes made me listen to it till the end (which I normally don't). I think the VAs did a good job but not something to go in my trophy room.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I put 8 was because of the consistency of the characters as they change \"like that\" with a \"wish\". But while it lasted, the main character was the opposite of all harem MCs as he actually would like do embarrassing stuff and kneel down in front of a girl. It's quite typical as there is tsubdere and deres. But even so there was also the drama aspect that also made it interesting to watch the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I really enjoyed this anime because it was so different to other harems as there is a lot that doesn't happen normally in harems (like the MC actually picks a girl in the end). You won't find the story to be the best thing ever as it is half episodic. But it isn't the typical hot spring, beach, festival episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see I have been quite positive in this review. So I will break it to you that it isn't perfect. Like the fact that they had used the supernatural aspect to make a great plot but then they change it back like it never happened instead of using it to an advantage. But it's good that they managed to make something out of it. It may seem very complicated to understand but I have been trying to be spoiler free. In my opinion I would check it out as it keeps you entertained and you can judge from there forth.\\n",

            "content": "This anime begins being very interesting, as the protagonist seems to be a pervert with little shame. But this soon leaves place to other matters, with the series involving some all-mighty cat statues which grant wishes. One would think that with anything having the chance to become possible, things will become serious at any moment. Well, they don't. The series mostly involves a lot of monotonous slice of life.\r\nCharacters seem very weak. One extremely big error is to deprive the feminine protagonist of her emotions at the first episode. This is not cute at all, it's as depriving Goku of becoming a super saiyan. Oneway to be cute is to show emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, with the protagonist being called \"The pervert prince\", one would expect a pervert, not a guy who wanders into an occupied bathroom by chance. I'm not impressed at all by his pervertness.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also some filler episodes, even given the short episode spam, which do not add a lot the series (the extra imouto episodes).\\n\\n\r\nYou will find some kind of story on the last two episodes, though. Things get a little emotional and briefly interesting, and then the anime ends as it could have ended on the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nOne terrible thing is that music is almost non-existant.

            "content": "When I first saw the way how this show was titled, I was convinced that this anime would be sort of a running joke. Never read the manga, I decided to check out the anime for the first time. Mainly, I think of myself as the manga reader before I become the anime watcher, and this show was not an exception. The interesting thing about this anime was the simple fact that the main character, Y\u014dto, is that he wants to feel like an actual person, despite the fact that he's well-known of being a pervert. These type of stories are just the ones whereyou sit back, relax and not really think things through. I'm not saying he's the worst character, but he really isn't that interesting when it comes to wanting to have real emotions and getting rid of his perverted thoughts. It was not until I saw the Golden Cat, where I thought, \"Hm. I could stick around with something like this. It's not that original, but at least its somewhat entertaining.\" \\n\\n\r\nThat's how I felt when watching the first half of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half started to bring in some life, despite the fact that it was up to the female characters in the last three episodes to do this. When Y\u014dto and Tsukiko transform back to their younger selves, I see that Tsukiko's mother was more fond of him than her own daughters. It started to add a little bit of context through it all. Y\u014dto treated Tsukiko's and Tsukushi's mother with more respect, that he wanted to give all to her. In the end, wishing your thoughts away is the only ordeal which started to make me wonder I watched this anime in the first place. Some of the supporting characters (with the exception of Emi) couldn't really stand out that much to me. It's not a bad anime, but if they started it out with characterizing the fact that he wants to be accepted by people as a person with real feelings and things to say, then I think they wouldn't have to strangely delve into the fact on why he's such a pervert through the first two episodes. If anything, my expectations were a bit high on this one.",

            "content": "(If you're looking for an interesting romance, comedy, slice-of-life and ecchi (that's not too outrageous) then \"Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko\" is what you're looking for. It also has a hint of harem.)\r\nI liked Henneko because it had an interesting developing plot more so towards the second half of the series.\r\nI liked Henneko because it had an interesting cast of characters even though it was this genre of anime (comedy).\r\nI slightly disliked Henneko because the main character is/was incredibly dense most of the time. He becomes less dense further on, but it is a bit frustrating.\r\n\u03b8 STORY: The story is very good. The story iscentered on Tsukiko and previous memories that the main character does not remember. It's also centered around the \"stony cat\" you notice in the English title. The stony cats grants their wishes and it takes them in unexpected directions. The plot is semi-serious, so there isn't too much bullshit. It focuses a lot on Tsukiko's family, romance of the characters and Yokodera's memories. The anime doesn't have too much ecchi in it, but there are some body shots. It's not too dramatic, but more comedic(?).\\n\\n\r\n\u03b8 ART: The art is very good. The animation style is very clean and I rather like the cel shading. It's really high quality. The dancing on the ending theme is a bit awkward to me; not the dance, the way it flows is awkward. Can you get what I am saying?\\n\\n\r\n\u03b8 SOUND: The music is great. I usually rate it by how catchy it is or by how memorable it is to me. The music in the anime is very memorable to me. I'm in \"baby sweet berry\" love with it. It's nice. But what the heck is \"baby sweet berry love\"? Any ideas?\\n\\n\r\n\u03b8 CHARACTER: The characters are good. They are memorable in personally, but the aren't too outstanding. For example, I don't usually see blonde tsunderes or black haired kuuderes (Tsukiko is on the outside). They are comedic in their own right and fun to watch on scene.\\n\\n\r\n\u03b8 ENJOYMENT: The enjoyment was oustanding. I really liked watching Henneko. The plot twists in the story kept me wanting to watch it to see what was going to happen next, as it does get semi-deep.\\n\\n\r\nI may be slightly bias because I particularly like this genre, but I like this better than some others I have watched.\\n\\n\r\n\u03b8 OVERALL SCORE: 8!\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend watching it for yourself for a good \"WTF\" moment. Don't let your family catch you though...\\n\\n\r\n- PlumAppleJuice, August 2016 \\n",

Youto the beginning of the struggle to regain the pretense is quite unique, but after that, it's like anime do not know what to do. The story lost its purpose, repeating the problem that the color just on different characters with new details plus-add later, so the confusion to another important part of the beginning, which is about Tsukiko and expression, was eventually abandoned entirely. Worse, this anime is also repeating the pattern of the same story every time - no one is expecting something, hope it is granted in an unwanted way, andchaos ensued. Not much variation in how he builds the story, then when he reached the third case of the characters are still making the same mistake by asking for things that do not make sense, this anime was soon lost its appeal. Or whether this is intended only aspart of a comedy? Apparently not, because in truth, this anime still has a message in it. Messages such as \"Be careful with what you would expect\" or\"Better be yourself\". And that means, he still wanted the audience to pay attentionto the story. Unfortunately, however, tryto find an audience, anime story feels empty without meaning. - Audio Visual (Art, Animation, Voice Acting, etc.): The visuals are nice, but it is more prevalent in this anime is its voice-acting. There is nothing new or amazing, but at least the voice-acting have succeeded in making comedy, which is probably the most important part of this anime, tasted funny as it should be. Tsukiko monotone voice, Azusa who stuttered a moment of panic, and both sides Tsukushi - it's fun tohear every time.",

One of the first reason (if not the most important) it's the evolution of facts; I don't want to do any spoilers, but the plot written on MAL cover only 3 episodes of the anime, and for me this was a lovely and unexpected surprise. Another thing is the number of genres thisanime has: Supernatural, slice of life, drama, romance, harem, ecchi (not so excessive), school, comedy elements, and maybe others, and they are, in my opinion, well combinated both in time and in enviroment. Characters are not really original and fresh, but they are characterized in a good way. This anime surprise me more and more, in particular in the last episode, that conclude in a bittersweet way the entire story. Opening and ending aren't a masterpiece, but they can listen more and more time without boring you. Art style is standard for me: simple but efficient. As I've already said in this review, I really loved it, and all anime lovers should give a chance to it, you'll not regret, I promise you.",

Btw,Love Tsukiko-chan :3 I love all the cute imoutos that there are and Tsukiko can be in my top 5 with that cute look of her.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Enough said 12/10. As expected from J.C.\\n\\n\r\nSound - So-so but mostly at the good side. I found myself loving 'that one' instrumental that sometimes played in the back and the ED is cute and catchy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH!!!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Very worth a watch for a romance anime. Got nothing on your list or just want to take a break with others anime or simply looking for another romance anime just like me? Go ahead pick this anime and it'll filled that empty void of yours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It went from being something quite mediocre to having a face paced, interesting and entertaining plotline, with more story arcs in 12 episodes than most series get in 25.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of WaraNeko starts of as your typical cliche boring ecchi romance: perveted mc who's in a love triangle with a kuudere and a tsundere. But it quickly becomes so much more and this is where it excels. The later arcs involve consequences of wishes, dead parents, time travel, the importance of memories and some truly touching moments, all leading up to a suprisinglysatisfying conclusion.\\n\r\nThe ecchi is a bit unnecessary at times and in a couple of curcumstances it ruins the moment, but overall, once you get past the first couple of episodes, it's actually very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nApart from the overall loli style, that may annoy some, the animation is good and fluid, with few derpy moments. The character designs are a little bland, but they each fit the characters well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe voice acting is fairly solid and both the op and ed fit the show, but are pretty forgetable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are where the show falters a bit.

The plot is flimsily handled and is not apparent until the middle of the show. This show is mostly focusing on \u201cmoe\u201d, which does jumble everything with pointless episodes only for showing the cast of girls. But when there is an episode driven by the story it is handled a lot better, and more interesting, but still quite flimsy.\r\nCharacters: 7/10\r\nMostly the characters are stereotypical such as Tsukiko, the monotone shy love interest orthe short \u201ctsundere\u201d blond. The main character is very interesting though. Yokodera is a very perverted teen but has a very odd kindness to him. Unlike in most harems, he is interested in every available girl causing him to get into some major \u201cpervy\u201d situations. The characters although are quite well written and loveable.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\n This is the show\u2019s strongest aspect. The character designs are beyond adorable. The backgrounds are quite beautiful to look at. The 3-d models are also handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\n The Voice acting is nothing short of fantastical.  Ogura Yui, the actor who plays Tsukiko, perfectly captures the monotone voice. The Music is actually enjoyable and is worth listening to. \\n\\n\r\nIt ends quite quickly and has a very rushed, awful ending. But for what it\u2019s worth the characters are a treat along with the Art. If you are a \u201cmoe\u201d fan you will enjoy this, if not it\u2019s still quite fun to watch.\\n",

Overall Hentai Oujo is one of the better sort of harem/romance anime, though not one of the better supernatural mystery anime. \r\nGood: As someone who hates harem endings, the anime makes it somewhat clear early on who the MC is going for. The backstory of the characters is compelling and really the backstory and how they tie it up in the end is the main thing boosting the story above other similar anime.\r\nBad:I feel like the creators were a bit haphazard with plot and characterization. Sometimes going with generic cliches, other time breaking with it, but overall making things a bit confused at times.",

However after episode 4, the arc ends and they needed to find a new way to drive the plot forward.  This is where the problem is.\r\nAs far as art and sound go, there was nothing wrong with it.  Nothing amazing, but nothing bad or jarring.\r\nThe characters were all mediocre and achetype based, although that is expected from this type of anime.  At least they were cute.\r\nFor the rest of the episodes, the plot abuses the gimmick of the stony cat to forcefully drive the plotforward, along with plenty of forced drama between the characters (which makes them use the cat) over very petty things.  The plot became so atrocious from this point forward that it was difficult to get myself to finish it.   Make MORE stony cats, use the stony cats by ACCIDENT, PERSONIFY the stony cats, throw in a haphazard BACKSTORY for the stony cat relative to the characters, all of it was just done so poorly.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some nice moments towards the end, but ultimately they were approached too poorly for them to achieve what they were intended to.\\n\\n\r\nI would give episodes 1-4 a solid 7 for the overall score, but for the series as a whole:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nOverall:  4\\n\\n",

            "content": "I clearly stated it on my 'Sakura no Pet' review that I wish I could take back the time I wasted watching 14 out of its 24 episodes~~\r\n~~well, looks like the stony-cat itself grantedt me that wish, the entire 12-episodes of Hentai Ouji anime somehow compensated the 14eps I wasted on SakuraNoPet---and it works! Hentai-Ouji to Warawanai Neko is a lot more enjoyable and more watchable than the SakuraPet, and here's how:\r\nSTORY = 7\r\nA story about wishes, and a newer elements with the 'cat god'---ofc there's the anime \"Nekogami Yaoyorozu\" which 'cat god' is also its element---but this one is a different version altogether sogiven with the creativity of a stony-cat (statue), a hopeless pervert guy lucky enough to be voiced by Yuki Kaji, and although it has harem elements on it, but yep, give it a go of 7.\\n\\n\r\nART = 9\\n\r\nJC Staff created this, so no qualms about the art. Now if they also focused on the characterization+plot rather than \"fanservice\", then~~\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 8\\n\r\nI really didn't give much qualms on the op.ed.songs~~ but this anime has a powerhouse of seiyuus who can pull off this harem into a rom-com: \\n\r\nYokodera voiced by Yuki Kaji [Eren from SnK]; \\n\r\nTsukiko voiced by Yui Ogura [Alice from Heaven's Memo Pad];\\n\r\nAzusa Azuki voiced by Kaori Ishihara [Madoka from Rinne no Lagrange]; \\n\r\nand Tsukushi (Ms. Steel) voiced by Yukari Tamura [Sakura from DC Da Capo; Rika from Higurashi, yep she's veteran]; \\n\r\nThat much, and you know why this portion has a high score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 6\\n\r\nI don't get harem stereotypes. They don't jive with the character-development, and it's like there's an unseen force or a \"god of harem\" [or just the writer] who manipulates elsewhere where the shoujo ends falling to the shounen without a definite reason or outcome or as how the plot went on.\\n\r\nYou juz end up scratching your head and say \"wtf~\" after failing to comprehend as how exactly do they end up falling---as I'd like to call it \"anti-feminist\" but okay, we can work that as to give it the benefit of doubt to support logic.\\n\\n\r\nI'm usually strict about character developments. I don't like it when writers just make their characters \"end up\" without due reasons. In harem anime, it's either I rate them as with a low score, or I don't write a review at all, as not to give them any score.\\n\r\nIn Hentai Ouji, however, there's a \"stitch\" of characters, an interaction of characters (you'll get it by the ending) as to put the harem into action with enough reasons why.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 6\\n\r\nOriginally rated as 5, I placed a 6 on this portion because of the final 3 episodes. Also, I enjoyed this MORE than the SakuraPet, so it has its merits getting a rate of 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 6\\n\r\nAfter watching Outbreak Company, I settled with the thought that anime in this kind of fashion will be my most basic anime to watch. Any less than that with its all nonsense like To Love Ru and Sakura-pet, and I'd drop it flat. [Except for Asobi ni Iku Yo, which has a powerhouse-seiyuu cast]\\n\\n\r\nHentai-Ouji was droppable for me juz by the first sight of it--however, because I was running low of anime to watch, as much as trying to keep an open-mind that no harem anime are alike.\\n\\n\r\nPS: The reason why I kept mentioning SakuranoPet here is because they're frequently discussed having a lot of common. Well, it might be, but I won't press to say that by characterization, Hentai-Ouji and SakuraNoPet share the \"deep character relationship\" because no---Hentai Ouji is what has deep character relationship, not to be compared with SakruaNoPet's shallow implications.\\n\\n\r\nI could recommend better rom-coms than this anime; however I can give this a slack: Hentai-Ouji is lighthearted enough for hopeless-romantic girls who thinks there's a guy out there that no matter how perverted he is in mind, but does not so in actions (yes, there are guys like that---a rare breed). Anyway, those who have a huge attention span with romcoms may juz enjoy this anime to their smiles' content.",

            "content": "3rd Review: (And maybe some spoilers...)\r\nRemember that time that you believed wishing wells actually granted your wishes and you would always throw money carelessly down that well so that they would come true? Well, it's back in the form of a cat. A cat statue to be precise.\r\nThat is the plot device of \"Hentai\" Ouji to Warawanai Neko.\r\nBy the way, because this is cat-based, I will be typing meow in random parts of this review. Meow.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\n  It seems like something is either wrong with you or the world is gonna end when a statue of a cat can actually grant your wishes andthat is exactly what happens to our fellow main characters. Although, things don't go as well as they should and now, they may have just gotten a turn for the worse and I love it. All the chaos that a wish-granting cat can ensue is pure genius, but also a little restricting considering that the main characters can't even pull their own weight and turn to their cat friend instead. Meow. Now, where's a well when i need one?\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\r\n  The art is...beautiful? Is that even the right word? No. Meow. The art is very cute and is clean. The characters were detailed and the eyes just spurred emotion from them. The transition was also quite smooth. Some improvement can be done for some parts to show more of the emotion, though. No complaints otherwise!\\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]\\n\r\n Meow. The opening was quite catchy and the ending was decent but, nothing too memorable can be dug up from that. However, the voice actors did quite a good job for this anime and they were stable for the most part, especially a black-haired emotionless girl that we might know. The music for the entire anime didn't stand out very much, so nothing to comment on there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter[8/10]\\n\r\n  Seems like the try-to-be-noticed pervert by the name of Youto Yokodera may not be as bad as he is at second glance, which would make him favorable despite his perverseness for a majority of the anime. Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi(too many T's, people!) could also be likable despite the emotionless situation she's got herself into. Or maybe people like Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi( who actually believes Youto has a twin brother)  and Azusa Azuki (at some points, I thought she looked like a cat. Meow.) are one's preferred type. Either way, all these character's interactions with each other are what made the difference in this story and I like it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment[8/10]\\n\r\n  I love cats(so, go away dog lovers). That is one particular reason I could enjoy this anime. The characters somewhat unexpected interactions are what kept me interested. However, what really got to me was the potential of the almighty cat statue. It is like the ultimate plot device of this anime because anything and everything that happens is because of it. Meow. Storms, personality change, the end of the world, you name it and I loved every second of the stony cat's crazy wish-granting. Period.\\n\\n\r\nOverall[8/10]\\n\r\n  By the end of this anime, I learned two very essential things:\\n\r\n1. Do NOT underestimate cat gods...or statues...or even rocks that look like cats. Or cats. Especially cats. MEOW!\\n\r\n2. Do NOT make wishes that you will probably regret in the future. Note to kids, don't randomly throw money down a well because you will probably regret it in the future too. (I've probably ruined all the children's hopes and dreams now..)\\n\r\nBetween perverts, airheads, the uncaring and the popular, I do not have many complaints about this anime and enjoyed it through and through. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, did any of you realize Tsukiko looks like a replica of Rikka Takanashi from Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!?\\n\\n\r\n~~Nyaaaaaaa!!~~\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The plot changes significantly from something childish to something deep.Although its not something original or is it a masterwork but still a fine anime to see if u r seeking to pass time\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are very likable, except from the usually cliche tsundre blonde (already forgot the name). There is the main character yokodera 'hentai ouji' the pervert prince who got his title after his wish was granted to throw away his facade, so he is forced to say whatever is on his mind, which causes him alot of trouble as one could imagine, although he is like the cliched main character of an ecchi+harem show, dumb,dense,no redeeming qualities. But he manages to make u laugh. then there is the emotionless tsukiko who lost her emotions due to the wish she made to the cat. She is a very cute and lovely character and would be liked by moe fans. the vioce actor does a great job to utilize her emotionlessness for some great laughs.\\n\\n\r\nmusic was not very noticable, niether did i find the op and ed to be rememberable, but thats because i dont like moe type songs\\n\\n\r\nit is a really enjoyable show if u can ignore the fanservice, and if u don't view it as a critic. i m glad i gave this a chance and would recommend to anyone who can't find an anime to spend time or is bored out of their skulls\\n\\n",

            "content": "***This review might contain very light spoilers***\r\nI do not care what everyone might think of this anime; yes it is a no nonsense comedy and yes the main character is a huge perve but despite all of this there are many heartfelt and amazing scenes inside this 2013 anime.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is a story about cat gods that make wishes and the unseen consequences of said wishes. The story follows Youto who is for all intents and purposes a huge pervert with a heart full of gold (and most likely blood too). He ends up becoming the reason Tsukiko, the younger Tsutsukakushisister loses her ability to show emotion. Along with her older sister Tsukushi and an annoying blonde ditz Azusa, they all go through different trials and events due to the cat gods wishing powers.\\n\\n\r\nSo first off; this is a harem. If you do not like harems then leave now you will not like this show. For you who are still here, there are many great things this show accomplishes. First while this is a fanservice heavyish anime, pretty much everything is tied to a gag. Youto gets into many different situations because like 99.9% of the boys his age, he is a perve. All of these scenes (and believe me there are tons) are so funny and yes I actually did \u201claugh out loud\u201d during many moments of the show. The scenes with Tsukiko are especially funny since even when she is extremely embarrassed, her monotone, no expression acting makes it so much funnier. It is a really funny show take my word for it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the show ended up lacking on is what shows in this genre usually end up doing; leaving out important information and having excessive plot holes. A large amount of information seems to be pulled out of nowhere or just not looked into enough. It just seemed a little off putting when a character would bring up something like it\u2019s common knowledge in the show but you cannot remember when (or even if) it was brought up. Also there will be large amounts of time where a main character will just up and disappear without any notice for three or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow pertaining to the actual plot of the show, you can kind of split this show up into three or so parts. Essentially we start with the whole Tsukiko emotionless thing but then later on you are introduced to Azusa who ends up wishing for stuff. So essentially as the show progresses you will see Youto have to deal with various issues with various individuals. Everything seems to flow quite nicely EXCEPT the last sort of story arc (I guess the last four or so episodes). Everything begins to rush to a certain point of the plot and I feel as if some more time was needed. I do have to say that the final episode was very enjoyable as we FINALLY got to see some back story for Youto. Overall the story is passable and enjoyable even if the show suffers from pacing issues towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is really good thanks to the character models, lighting, AND THE EYES (I\u2019m a weirdo). Each character is very detailed and has a constant quality throughout the entire season. Also the eyes are extremely well done. There are many scenes where characters will seem more believable just because of how they are looking towards each other (eyes are important man). The color palette was pretty good in my opinion; nothing looked bland and the backgrounds were pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main star focus of the sound in this anime are the voice actors. Even though Tsukiko was monotone for like 95% of the show, just the way her voice actor presented herself with the different mannerisms made her character\u2019s performance much more believable. The rest of the cast also did a great job especially Youto. As for the soundtrack for the anime, all I can say is that it was pretty average. Other than the really catchy opening song, everything else was there but just not over the top awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAzusa sucks. She was by far the most annoying female character of this season (yes even more than Tohka from Date a Live). That being said, the rest of the cast did an amazing job providing us with some very interesting scenes.  The chemistry between Youto and Tsukiko is awesome to see unfold throughout the entire season as they do become closer and closer. Also due to some certain events later on in the show, Youto somehow gets on Tsukushi\u2019s good side which makes things even more interesting later on with all three main females gunning for Youto. Most of the characters get pretty extensive character development so yeah overall this anime did a great job presenting us with interesting characters (fu#@ Azusa though\u2026annoying b!%ch).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was a real shocker for me. When I saw \u201chentai\u201d in the title for the show, I automatically assumed it was going to be a stupid ecchi anime. What I found out after twelve episodes was that masked in this gag comedy anime, there are some really cute, interesting, and serious moments that I will remember for the years to come. I strongly encourage you take the time to sit through this show. You will be too busy laughing your ass off to point out the plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "At times Henneko resembles its lead character, trying to put up a fa\u00e7ade of its very own. It often tried to portray itself as dramatic and moving, but because of its poor pacing, repellent fanservice, and borderline ridiculous drama, it was extremely easy to see through this fa\u00e7ade. These are just a few of Henneko\u2019s many problems, which you will learn if you continue reading. I don\u2019t enjoy writing negative reviews, but warning you against this show is practically public service.\r\nStory\r\nThe premise of Henneko, two characters searching to reclaim that which they carelessly wished away, is uninspired. Be careful what you wish for scenarios area dime-a-dozen and I\u2019m sure that there are many better executed examples out there. Instead of exploring in any real depth why Yokodera and Tsukiko wished to rid themselves of that which they considered burdensome and undergoing a thorough dissection of their characters and motivations, this show chose to be nothing more than mindless entertainment, which would be fine, if that entertainment didn\u2019t come in the form of unfunny, un-titillating (come on, people, these kids may be legal, but they look about eight), and offensive fanservice. Henneko also flip-flopped as to whether the cat gods were benevolent or malevolent. It waited until the show was mostly over to set them up as the villains of the piece. Additionally, one of the characters becomes ill to the point of being at death\u2019s door, because of mildew. These things were poorly timed, poorly thought-out attempts to create additional conflict, because Henneko\u2019s central conflict was resolved just a few episodes in. It should come as no surprise then that that which was intended to keep me invested and tug at my heartstrings prompted nothing but bewilderment and frustration.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like a single character. What\u2019s there to like about an immature, teenage pervert whose defining trait is his ability to put up a fa\u00e7ade and lie to other people about his true intentions and an emotionless husk of a girl? And that\u2019s just the two lead characters. The other female characters compensated for the lead\u2019s lack of personality by being too loud and too over-the-top \u2013 caricatures of actual, real people. More upsetting was the female characters\u2019 reactions to Yokodera\u2019s advances (accidental or otherwise). On the whole, they appeared shocked, but otherwise flattered to find themselves in degrading, mortifying positions. What kind of poisonous message does that send out to anybody watching Henneko? That girls secretly enjoy being assaulted or will, at the very least, resign themselves to their fate should they be so misfortunate as to find themselves in that position? To imply that in today\u2019s day and age is absolutely disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nArt and music\\n\r\nHenneko\u2019s art was alright. It was an improvement on that of JC Staff shows gone by, anyway. Its background art and character designs were acceptable, if not excellent. Henneko\u2019s music was equally passable. I didn\u2019t especially like the opening or ending tracks, but that\u2019s to do with my aversion towards extremely high-pitched female vocals, but some background pieces were rather nice and enhanced the mood of the scenes they were played during.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I got out of Henneko was the undiluted relief upon finishing it and realising that my torment was over. Its story was uninspired, poorly paced, and lacking believable conflict, its characters were intolerable, and its fanservice, offensive. I would strongly advise you not to watch Henneko. Even if all you\u2019re after is fanservice, you\u2019d be scraping the bottom of the barrel to turn to this show.",

It fell short of my expectations. The clever use of small signals and timing was perfect to convey the feelings of a character who couldn't show emotions, and it often made her just as likeable as any female protagonist in a romantic comedy. However, in the end the lack of progression was just frustrating...\r\nThe outcome (SPOILER) where they just continue on living out their daily lives, him with a lack of memoriesand her with a lack of emotions, was interesting, and maybe a good universal message about living and making others happy, but it left me personally feeling frustrated, incomplete, sad, and lonely. It doesn't seem to be the happy pick me up that others write about in their reviews, and it doesn't satisfy an emotional need like watching a romance or romantic comedy usually does. Maybe those are cliche or something... but that's what I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nStill a great anime though. Couldn't stop watching it until I ran out of episodes. so I still gave it an overall 8...",

            "content": "The title says it all. Yokodera Youto is a pervert, or more precisely, someone labeled a pervert. His interests seem perfectly normal for a teenager, what makes him special is that he's quite open about them. This honesty will be one of the major gag sources and also the way to gain girls's trust. Just watch the opening. It represents the show quite well.\r\nOne other thing apparent in the OP is an overflowing of cutesyness. This is going to be the main armament of the less equipped heroines. Fortunately it's treated by healthy appreciation on Youto's part, without melting away. Well, save for the customarygoing back to childhood-part, the barely hidden steamy reactions to each other's younger forms are hilarous.\\n\\n\r\nTsutsukakushi Tsukiko couples this charm with the acquired inability to express emotions, the hit representative of which is the disenchanted munching sound she makes when indulging in her favorite hobby -- sweets. She's going to be the girl always near the protagonist, perseverant but tempered.\\n\\n\r\nNot like Azuki Azusa, for sure. Thinking back, her character seems not as well thought up as that of the others, I might go as far as stating that it is the weakest point of this show. She starts with the r\u00f4le of the haughty spoiled girl admired by all, but quickly falls for Youto, and after that she only appears as a mock image of affection gone overboard. Maybe all this was only a plot device to draw out Youto's gentler side.\\n\\n\r\nAh, Koutetsu-san! The elder sister of Tsukiko is certainly the stacked flagship of this series. She wears the objects of all the boob jokes in an unaffected way, which together with her utmost na\u00efvet\u00e9 makes her an interesting character. Thankfully her extreme affection for Tsukiko is quickly subdued. That's done much better by her sidekick, with her boisterous perverted ranting.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a comedy with a merry atmosphere and unexpected dramatic tones, where all the drooling over female characters is made explicit and jokingly self-referential.",

            "content": "Henneko is a wacky show about a stone cat that grants wishes. We're not talking about a stingy genie in the lamp with just three wishes, with this cat you get unlimited wishes. And even better, make your wishes today and you can UNDO any of your previous wishes at will, no commitment necessary! Now at this point any sane person would rightfully be suspicious of this infomercial of a show; indeed there is a caveat in that the cat will grant the wish however he sees fit. If you're wishing it were cooler, don't be surprised to find a blizzard outside.\r\nWhile obviously not themost realistic of shows, Henneko has its humor points. The show vaguely reminds me of the style of Inukami with lots of random ecchi moments and harem-based situations. That being said, I wouldn't expect any deep relationships or focused plot line from this show. It's a slice of life in the same way that ToLoveRu is, i.e. anything but ordinary days at school. If you're looking for a light, harem-based ecchi comedy with some semblance of a plot, feel free to give this a try.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is fair overall. The animation style is fittingly simplistic and colorful, as the overall mood is generally light. Don't expect lavish backgrounds or awe-inspiring light effects. The characters are all readily distinguishable and the stone cat is less stony than you might expect (it seems to be able to change its expression and grows/shrinks with the amount of wishes it is burdened with). The expressions can be a bit hard to trace at times as one of the main heroines has wished away all of her expressions.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the magical nature of the stone cat, there aren't any fights or other heavy action scenes. As for ecchi, expect pretty much everything short of exposed nudity. You have your accidental grabs, falls, as well as a lot of verbal sexual harassment that earns the protagonist the title of hentai ouji.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is sung by Yukari Tamura and thus made me do a double take as I thought I was watching B Gata H Kei for a second. It's a playful tune though it reminds me too much of the aforementioned series. The ED has Yui Ogura singing a playful tune in her non-monotone voice, which I guess we should be thankful for considering her monotone humming in the actual series. The BGM is standard fare with nothing all that worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is fair overall though I personally didn't find the return of Accel World's South Park character all that great. If anyone deserves praise for effort, it would probably be Kaori Ishihara for her role as tsundere Azuki.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is loosely arc-based as our protagonist interacts with the different heroines. It eventually meanders its way to a final conflict that presents itself a bit tad darker than the other issues up to that point. With the final mystery solved, the show ends without giving any sort of closure to the characters. Thus I conclude that there will either be a second season or the producers screwed up and ran out of money.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, there are a few loose ends that the story never explains. Given that there's a cat that can grant any wish, you can assume that anything is game in terms of possible resolutions to conflicts. While there is ample character-based humor in the show, I did find myself questioning the intelligence of the characters as they apparently don't learn that the stony cat tweaks their actual wish.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not the most coherent or detailed of stories, it's a fair and entertaining progression overall. It's just a tad short on the resolution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf you were hoping for a protagonist that openly proclaims his inner desires, unfortunately you'll be disappointed. The protagonist is more of your standard, nice guy who happens to be in the right place at the right time over and over again. The majority of the character value in this show comes from the heroines, who all have something to do with the stone cat at one point or another. Unfortunately, their struggles over the hentai ouji fall upon deaf ears as Youto is quite slow when it comes to love. Apparently there is a lot of viewer hype about Tsukiko. It was interesting seeing her compete for Youto with her outward lack of emotion but I don't think it was worth all the hype.\\n\\n\r\nThough there is some character development, I don't find it fair to call it such if it's as a result of an abnormal influence such as the stony cat. Don't expect any significant romantic developments.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nIf you watch this with a notebook and a serious expression, prepare to be utterly disappointed. This is a light-hearted show that is meant to be watched accordingly. Sit back and enjoy a few laughs at the protagonist's idiocy. A decent, entertaining watch with only slight re-watch value.",

A story that wil for sure make you laugh a lot, leave you confused, make you curious from time to time and of course will make you have an emotional shock!\r\nYes, let's get started then!\r\nThe protagonist of the anime series is a guy Youto Yokodera, who is a total pervert! And the storyline goes on with his encounters of several different girls. Yeah, the name seems like the anime is a total comedy butit is not, well it is but it is not. Starting from the first episode the storyline will make you laugh out loud for real, then at some point it becomes a little more, uhm, interesting. Correct, it becomes interesting, makes you curious that you will wonder what will happen next. While doing it still makes you laugh, while moving on darker plots. Tragic events, a mysterious past almost no one remembers... And at the end a final you can call SUPER, a really good happy end, outstanding!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the story, we still shouldn't forget that we are talking about an anime series. Then we have to make some comments about its art too. Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko really has a good art. The way characters designed and drawn are warm and really matches the atmosphere of the series. Of course, the girls are completely cute, especially our little Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko-chan. I find the artstyle of Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko outstanding, so good that I can't imagine it in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nNow we are down to the Sound! Well, let's begin with the OP and ED. Both the OP and ED of the series were good, but I can't tell they were a miracle that carved themselves in my mind. The voice acting however, was quite perfect, especially the voice acting of Yokodera and Tsukiko was really good. Though I still can't say many things were special about the voice acting of the series, thinking that there are many anime series that has good voice acting. Speaking of Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko, the voice acting was very good.\\n\\n\r\nI have written down everything in my mind about the story, art and the sound and now it is time to comment the characters! Not to give any spoilers, I am going to cut this part short, and write my ideas about them straight. The characters of the series were pretty funny, each with a potential of making you bound to itself. Each introduced character gets a good part in the storyline, and doesn't leave any questions in your mind, except Ponta, our protagonist's friend. Well, counting all these, I believe the character introductions, the way they take part in the storyline and their personalities were pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nNow, probably the best and the most important part: Enjoyment...\\n\r\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is an anime series that really has a well designed storyline, colorful characters and of course a good art supported by a good voice acting. The way it makes you bond of the characters and watch every episode without breathing, I can say it was quite enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nOverally, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is a great anime series I believe everyone should watch. So on, my review comes to an end here, I wish you a great time watching anime!",

            "content": "The \u201cHentai\u201d Prince and the Stony Cat\r\nArt: The art in this show, is pretty generic but has good aspects that make it stand out from other shows like it. Majorly, what I found that liked the most was the colors. Everything was bright and had a distinct look to it. One of the things that was different than the generic were they eyes. Now I found that the eyes had a little less detail than average, but it really worked. For example, one of the main characters loses her ability to show emotion on her face, and this way of drawing eyes relative to herface makes her look emotionless, not like she was inanimate, but more like she was just indifferent to everything. If this wasn\u2019t the way they took that character and made her like that it wouldn\u2019t have been believable, and I\u2019m glad they did.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is where the show falls short for me. Not saying the music and sound was bad by any means but the story sucked me in that I lost track of where I was. Sometimes there were places where the sound makes the show really good, but others, it just sounds a bit cheesy. This being said I really loved the introduction animation. The song was catchy and the animation was fun to watch, albeit a bit repetitive. As for the closing, most times I was so eager to get to the next episode I would just skip over those endings, and while I know i shouldn\u2019t do it, I felt like the endings--when I did watch them--didn\u2019t really add much and weren\u2019t worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nStory: This story was fresh and amazing. A story about a student named Youto who has a bit of an obsession with dirty magazines (even so, Fan-service is present, bu not abundant) but he has a fa\u00e7ade that he puts up so no one can see the real him. When he is fed up with living a lie he hears about a stone cat idol on hill with a tree that grants wishes and gives what it takes to someone that needs it. So Youto goes and offers his fa\u00e7ade and wishes it to be gone so he can be who he truly is. While there he runs into Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, a first year looking to try to get rid of the way she has whatever she is thinking is shows up on her face. The Cat God responds by taking her emotions and removing his fa\u00e7ade. Now, even if he wanted to lie about what he is thinking, he can\u2019t hold back from saying what he is thinking. The story then revolves around the relationship between Tsukiko and Youto, and how even though he never seems to realize it, things never seem to work out the way they are anticipated. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: This show has been on my \u201cto watch\u201d list for the past two years. But I have a pretty strict rule about not watching shows from my list until I come to them, and this show makes me want to start breaking that rule. I say this because this show was so good and made me feel so many things inside, and it has been on my radar for so long, If I had chosen to watch this show earlier I could appreciate it more. It is a show that I will recommend and I will watch again. Some may be turned away from this show simply because the title has the word \u201chentai\u201d in it, when that word is just Japanese for \u201cpervert\u201d. Also, while Youto may seem really hard to deal with at the beginning, he does get better and the show does at times become really heartfelt and it is hard not to like this show. Please, watch The \u201cHENTAI\u201d Prince and the Stony Cat.\\n",
