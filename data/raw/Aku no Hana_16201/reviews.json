            "content": "DISCLAIMER: FOR THE SAKE OF THIS REVIEW I WILL BE OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMTION THAT THERE IS AN UPCOMING SECOND SEASON. The anime said there would be a part two and I\u2019ll trust that for now. If there is no season two then I'd have problems with the conclusion and the score would have to be lowered. But the anime created interest in the manga, they haven't exhausted the budget, they previewed pt. 2 scenes that they've supposedly finished, some of the most powerful scenes have yet to come, etc. At this point, it seems very safe to assume there will be a second seasoneven if the anime sales haven't been great. \\n\\n\r\nAh, adaptions. The bane of all manga readers. Understandably, this is simultaneously claimed to be one of the best and worst anime adaptions there is. It has attracted much criticism and ridicule due to the huge change in character design, but this change was actually approved by the mangaka and I would tend to agree with him that it was good stylistic choice. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, fans think all anime characters, besides the comic relief ones, must be attractive. They can\u2019t take ugly characters seriously or treat them like humans, but they have no problem falling in love with cute bug-eyed alien creatures. That\u2019s superficial to a disgusting degree. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are often ugly, but why does that matter? Do you hate all movies with unattractive actors? Not all actresses look like supermodels, nor do the vast majority of women, so why should all anime characters be beautiful? I actually didn't like how, in the manga, Nakamura was meant to be ugly or plain, but the mangaka drew her attractive. It's like the manga version of \"Hollywood Homely.\"  When I read the manga, I was kind of annoyed that something like that tried to evoke a masterpiece like \"Les Fleurs Du Mals.\" In the anime, I wasn't offended by the reference, and it heightened my appreciation instead. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is a work about descent into decadence, libertinism, and the meaning of freedom; mental and physical. Should the characters really be moe? Is it really important that their eyes cover half of their face? This adaption took advantage of all of the manga's squandered potential. This is exactly what a good adaption does, rather than following in every folly of its predecessor. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be noted about the realistic nature of the character\u2019s faces is sometimes they look better than others. Like a real person, some of the screenshots will make a character look ugly and some will make a character look normal, although normal is ugly by anime standards. The point is that you shouldn\u2019t assume all the characters are ugly based on a couple unflattering screenshots. They\u2019re not poorly designed, they\u2019re real. \\n\\n\r\nI love the collision between realism and minimalism in the character designs, additionally contrasting with the fact that the city is one of the most realistic I've seen in anime; kind of emphasizing the insignificance of humanity more subtly than the manga ever did. It should be noted that the fact that the city seems to be \"decaying\" or in poor shape is a reference to a major theme of Les Fleurs du Mal. This animation captures the atmosphere really well and if it was done differently it would have flopped thematically. It had an interesting and creative artistic direction that had a clear purpose to it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is much of symbolism and depth to the art, just as there is in the general plot, and it is arguably the best aspect of the show. The animation seemed a bit choppy at times, but the art was generally flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere created by the art was enhanced by the incredible OST. The first OP perfectly captured Kasuga\u2019s character, the second OP Nakamura\u2019s, the third Saeki\u2019s, and the fourth was like a victory lap that captured the very essence of the anime. The BGM complimented and accented the atmosphere perfectly while the ED always kicked in with genius timing, changing subtly as the series progresses, culminating in it playing for half of the finale and a new ED coming on at the end. The ED is one of the creepiest things I\u2019ve ever heard. All in all I\u2019d say this is the one of the best and most fitting anime OSTs out there. It certainly has to be the only OST I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s influenced the atmosphere of a series and my opinion of it to this extent. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems a bit generic in the description, but unlike similarly premised titles, it is not a hentai or a comedy and it plays out very differently. The show is more about presentation than plot, but the plot is still engaging, unpredictable, and unique. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were among the stronger points. Kasuga\u2019s development was the entire point of the show (it appears to be a bildungsroman) and it was very well done. Under the guidance of Nakamura (a great character in her own right) we see him go from a mindless puppet who can only spout out the thoughts of others, but longs to be unique, to a free individual. At first he can only express himself in Baudelaire poems, poems he clearly doesn\u2019t really understand, but looks down on others for not getting although he doesn\u2019t really want anyone else to read them either. This whole concept infuriates Nakamura and she tries to \u201cbreak down his walls.\u201d Later, even in the classroom scene, he\u2019s just writing what Nakamura says. It isn\u2019t until he faces the prospect of losing her that he really manages to form a thought of his own, in an incredible scene and finale episode. \\n\\n\r\nNakamura helps him, and seems to treat him like dirt, but she also needs him. Her character is very interesting and the changes to how the audience views her over time were well done. Saeki is a foil to her character and there are many parallels and contrasts between them, both subtle and overt. She wants to understand Kasuga, but she can\u2019t. She would accept him no matter how he is. Some of her character developments towards the end and alluded to in the preview/flash-forward were very unexpected and her character is as complex as any. All of the side characters are also interesting and serve their purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment would be the hardest category to score. I enjoyed it more like I would enjoy a horror movie than a thriller, romance, or comedy. My eyes were not glued to the screen and sometimes it was hard to watch. I couldn't take it in more than one episode at a time, which is a testament to how powerful the atmosphere is. The whole thing was slow paced and tense and chock-full of second-hand embarrassment and humiliation. You really feel for the characters, and as they are dejected for most of the anime, you will be too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is arguably the best of its season and the best in years, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to most people. If you appreciate the decadent literary movement, if you thought the manga could be better, if you aren\u2019t bothered by unattractive characters, if you\u2019re looking for something different or more realistic, or if you are just open minded then this anime is for you.",

            "content": "Whenever people watch a film or show, regardless if it\u2019s anime or not, they want to be enticed into a deep and complex world that is full of mystery and wonder that they can solve for the benefit of their humanity. It seems as though Aku no Hana was meant to be something that was going to be the \u201cchange\u201d some people were looking for in the wake of entertainment controlling the masses. But boy did it fail at doing that on almost all accounts.\r\nTo get this out of the way, no the animation is not horrible. It is flawed yes, but not to theextent where it should be castrated out of someone\u2019s psyche after viewing the first episode. For starters, the animation that the studio decided to use is called rotoscoping, a style of animation where people are filmed in live-action and animators draw over the film frame-by-frame. Considering that this is the first anime show to do this style of animation, how is the quality of the rotoscoping? Not too well that\u2019s for sure. The lip-syncing is atrocious, the facial expressions are devoid of any expression and don\u2019t fit well with the emotions that the characters are trying to convey, and given how low the budget was the animation isn\u2019t very fluid in most places. Though with these flaws mentioned, the show isn\u2019t necessarily unwatchable due to the animation being average so it gets a slight pass in this department.\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, however, the art design of the background in the show\u2019s setting is truly spectacular to look at. How the buildings are drawn from every tiny detail of rust and grime in the darker places of the town is something to behold. It fits very well with the tone the show was trying to capture and it\u2019s effectiveness is relatively good. Another thing that also improves on Aku no Hana\u2019s mood is the music. With its subtle ambient and minimalist influenced sound, it\u2019s one of the most beautifully crafted scores that I\u2019ve had the pleasure of listening to.\\n\\n\r\nOn a technical level, the show is mixed with good music and art but really average animation, but how does it compare to the narrative and writing? Not to well that\u2019s for sure. For one, the characters and how they are written are not at all well developed or fully realized with anything that is happening with the plot. To address this even further, the relationships between the protagonist named Kasuga with our two main heroines Nakamura and Saeki are as well put together as one could get from a highschooler\u2019s attempt at writing a story such as this, a bad one at that. What makes these characters so bad in terms of a writing perspective is just how poorly paced it is in giving us a clear indication that Kasuga has a bond with either Nakamura and Saeki. With Kasuga and Nakamura, there is no chemistry whenever they are on screen they just playoff as a couple of degenerate who spout out vapid angsty monologues towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nKasuga himself is not an enticing protagonist to be on-screen. Just because you make him this Holden Caulfield type of character where he is obsessed with a dark poetry book doesn\u2019t make him have anymore depth than any other character in the show. Are we to sympathize with him just because he acts all pessimistic with the world around him with his pseudo-intellectual jargon? Not if it\u2019s done with careful precision in Kasuga\u2019s own archetype, which in reality is not the case whatsoever in Aku no Hana.\\n\\n\r\nNakamura and Saeki are two other characters that are unfortunately not spared in terms of mediocre character writing. The romantic development with Kasuga and Saeki was rushed to the point where we only get to see very few inclinations that they are a couple. We get two awkward dates and a moment where she invites him into his room. Not only that but Saeki\u2019s reasons for liking Kasuga are not at all convincing to the slightest degree. With all of the things Kasuga did, or forced in this case, to Saeki\u2019s property, any normal girl would easily never speak to him again, but just because the writers want to keep the story going, they\u2019ll just have to hope that any person with a half a brain would buy into this. No explanation for Saeki\u2019s reasoning for liking Kasuga, no nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Nakamura, Kasuga\u2019s \u201csidekick\u201d in the show. As you might predict, she is about as explained throughout the show as any of the other characters. This is, of course, the intention because Nakamura is something that we should be wary and suspicious about whether she\u2019s evil or not. Once she forms a contract with Kasuga, the only thing we really get out of Nakamura is that she is nothing more than the show\u2019s attempt at pouring out empty melodrama into the mix to make the plot try to seem too deep than what it already is. Her primary goal to the plot\u2019s theme is never given any deep context other than the fact that she thinks the whole world is bullshit and it should be destroyed. Look, if you want to give me an existential angst plot device at least try to deliver a better explanation than just a one-dimensional written one. That way the character can be portrayed in a reasonably sympathetic light, unfortunately Nakamura just doesn\u2019t cut out to be a deep convincing anti-hero with how poor the writing is.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the tone of the show is solid, the atmosphere itself tries too hard to be frightening to the point where it almost does the opposite effect of what it was initially trying to impose. It happens whenever there is a faint rumbling noise in the background that\u2019s supposed to resemble a heartbeat that is hardly effective at all in establishing a mood or whenever the music starts to grow in its dynamics with a dark droning noise that is unsettling in a wrong way. What\u2019s funny is that some of the build-up of the tone in some of the scenes are not necessary and fail to capture any fear at all. Once you do it multiple times throughout the show, it loses it\u2019s momentum quickly and all your left with is just an empty white noise in the background.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not often I get to talk about the actual \u201cacting\u201d rather than the voice acting in this show. The acting, while good in a few areas, is often overly dramatized and doesn\u2019t reach to that level of greatness of any drama TV show that you could be watching right now. Actors constantly spout out their lines and try to carry out as much emotion as possible in scenes that don\u2019t seem as though it was needed in the first place, such as one that involves a bathroom area.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention of the numerous plot holes that drags down the plot as a whole from making it convincing to anyone watching. Usually plot holes can be forgiven if they are tiny to where they are not noticeable to ruin the flow of the show. With Aku no Hana there are so many coincidences that can easily be accounted for lazy writing such as no one noticing the blackboard writing being blocked out the day after the vandalism scene, anyone could have easily deciphered what the saying was in two seconds flat.\\n\\n\r\nIn the short scheme of things, Aku no Hana is just a failed experiment that probably never should have been fully realized given to its source material. In all honesty, the original manga\u2019s story is quite fascinating and if only they hired more competent writers to fill in the wide gap that crippled Aku no Hana\u2019s chances of becoming an intriguing psychological drama. It wouldn\u2019t be a shock to call this a \u201cwasted opportunity\u201d given how the creators were ballsy in making it with the rotoscope technique; it just goes to show when you want to do something \u201cdifferent,\u201d you might want to focus more on your writing structure than your artistic integrity.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: D+",

            "content": "I normally don't write reviews, but because this series got so much hate, I felt obligated to say something. I thoroughly enjoyed this series for many reasons. First I'll address the elephant in the room that got this series so much hate: the art style. At first I couldn't stand the art style myself. I thought it was going to ruin the series the minute I saw it, but to my own surprise I was completely wrong. After getting into the story, I felt the art style fir the show perfectly. By not having cartoon-looking characters, it made the show much more believable that thesecharacters could possibly exist, which only makes the show even more troubling.\\n\r\nNext thing I want to address is the story. Right after the first episode, this show had me hooked. I found myself eager to watch the next episode right after the last. Even though it is not categorized as one, the first few episodes disturbed me more than any \"horror\" anime ever has. And don't even get me started on the creepy music when the end credits roll. Throughout the story, we see a boy who tries to be different from everyone else because he feels like he does not fit in anywhere. This made me feel like I was going to be faced with a boring protagonist and little to no character development. Once again, I was wrong. After Kasuga spends so much time with Nakamura, we get that hint that these two may slowly be falling for each other. I enjoy how the mood of the show changes along with the opening credits music throughout the series. At first, everything seems very troubling and eventually changes into a story of a boy who is trying to find himself. Because of Nakamura, he questions everything he has ever known, and even later admits he has been lying to himself for his entire life. Because of one girl, Kasuga's entire perception on life is changed and that is what I found so appealing about the story. I must admit, the last episode did kind of disappoint me and I'm really hoping for a part two. One of the only problems I had with this series was some of the dragging scenes. No, I do not want to watch a five-minute animation of Kasuga walking through the streets accompanied by sad music. Besides these minor problems, I really enjoyed this series and recommend to anyone who likes psychological anime.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is by far the most controversial Anime of the Spring Season 2013, receiving by far the most hate and still having quite a big fan base that does like it. Which one of the two sides arguing against each other is right?\r\nStory: The story of Aku no Hana takes place in Japan and revolves around Kasuga Takao, a quite normal boy, who goes to school, loves books (especially Baudelaire's \"Aku no Hana\") and has a crush on what is supposed to be the beauty of the class. One day he finds her sport clothes as he wants to get the bookhe accidentally forgot in the classroom. He takes them out and hears a sound. In the hurry he just takes them and leaves quickly. Later on the psycho child of the class, being Nakamura Sawa tells him she saw him stealing the clothes. From then on she makes him do things that...well are kind of awkward. The whole story is really well executed and as far as I know follows the Manga quite well (didn't read it). It is really enjoyable to watch and it keeps unfolding in directions that the viewer doesn't expect to go to. It was a good story, but no masterpiece! 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are the shining point of the show. Even though the only ones that get any focus at all are the three main characters that everything revolves around, they are that good developed that that is no problem at all! Kasuga Takao seems to be one of the most normal students we've seen in a while in Anime. He likes books, has a crush on a girl and doesn't have any powers or things he is really good in. That is until he gets seen by Nakamura stealing the clothes and his life gets more and more messed up, just as his mind. Nakamura Sawa is a psycho. That's what everyone agrees upon. But it is a kind of psycho, that seems more pleasant than the \"I'll kill you all\" type, and rather is someone that is claims himself to be a deviant and searches for people that are the same as she is. Saeki Nanako is the girl Kasuga has a crush on. She is a kind and good looking girl. I am not gonna talk a lot about her since I'd just end up spoiling. One must be said: The characters aren't likable at all! It is hard to really like them, but that is the point the series wants you to be in. It's a point were you can look down on the show from a spot a lot higher, which makes every single character a lot more human and makes their built up incredibly well done. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well....the first thing that comes to your mind while watching Aku no Hana is the character design, which looks to say it in a polite way different. It is not a bad thing to make them look this way, since it is just another point that makes you feel more distant to the characters. The point were the art fails is the animation itself. The characters suffer from either to much movement at the same time and you just can't seem to concentrate because the characters look as if they would tremble without a reason or they don't move at all. The amount of still screens in this show is incredibly high and makes the show feel as if it was something based on an incredibly low budget, which it probably is. Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple. It mostly consists of tones getting louder and louder which creates a suspense that really fits the show as something dark and awkward. Aku no Hana has one of the most memorable endings ever created. A song only sung by a computer voice singing about the flowers of evil definitely is really creepy and fits the whole show really well. Just as the 4 Openings do. Every single one of them is weird in it's own way but still it fits the show so well that by now I really enjoy hearing them on their own. The voice acting is nothing that really stands out. While it definitely is not horrible, it is nothing I do love. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have no idea how to score this...honestly! This show is nothing you will enjoy! However it is something that makes you want to shut down your browser and never open it again. At parts I couldn't watch an episode in a single sitting, but had to constantly pause it to calm down a bit, since my nerves were blank, but this is what makes this show so good! 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is not a show everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. It is hard to watch and if you aren't into thrillers or that kind of stuff you really should stay away from this, but if you like them or if it even interests you a little, go watch this and make your own picture of it.\\n",

            "content": "This is not an anime for the fainthearted. It is the single most disturbing piece of fiction I have ever been witness to, and rightly deserves to be named a psychological horror. \r\nBut this is not an easy anime to watch, as  it is broken and incoherent at times. What you can expect is a lot of cringe worthy moments which build an incredible tension that borders on fetishism. The protagonist is placed in a position of utter despair contrasted with sheer bliss. He goes from one to the other at a moments notice, further adding to the tension we are witness to. \r\nAnimation:10\\n\r\nThe drawing and animation style is difficult to adapt to at first. However, it is perhaps the primary reason to watch this incredible anime. The simple lines and faded colors are inherent to the surrealist style which this anime pays homage to. The animation allows the unease of the story to truly materialize and overwhelm the audience.  It is the only animation style fitting for this great work, and should not deter viewers from watching it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is difficult to follow at times, and may seem stagnant at others. However this is done with the very specific purpose of disorienting those who watch the anime. You experience the anime as a whole, the story is merely a tool used to alter the experience the viewer is subject to. The story manages to do what it was intended for beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters have incredible depth. Each character is crafted as a riddle which refuses to be solved. They each have fetishes, perversions, imperfections, and desires. Few animes can claim to fully explore the psychological depth of their characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:0\\n\r\nThis is an incredible anime, but it is truly painful to watch. I wanted to rip my hair out, tear at my skin and gouge my own eyes out. The anime has such a profound affect on the viewer that they cannot but help constantly feeling uneasy. And this feeling continuously builds, never letting up. If at any point it lets up, that is merely to betray you moments later with a feeling that is much much worse. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Don't watch it if you can't appreciate a masterpiece. This is not some silly plot driven flowery anime that does nothing to explore its characters. This is dark and real. If you decide to pick it up, push through a little bit at a time. Otherwise you will be overwhelmed and scared to continue.",

            "content": "OVERALL-realistic plot, art and characters where everything is comprehensible, fitting music during the anime, unusual but cool end-theme\r\nwhat does it make interesting? the realism combined with good characters, which make you experience intense emotions\r\nSTORY-I have to say that as far as I've seen it, the story is very good. It shows in a realistic scenario how a simple, impulsive action can bring one in a very ugly situation. There is an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness throughout the whole anime and you can basically feel the emotions of the characters.\r\nART-Well, the Art. What to say about it. It definitely is unusual. I wouldn't say thatit's bad, but I'm sure it's not everyone's taste. There are not many typical anime characteristics and it is, like the plot, very realistic. Sometimes it even looks like a movie and not an anime. But I think, that this style is appropriate considering the story. It just fits.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS-As I already mentioned in the Story-part, you can feel their emotions, which makes it easier to find a connection with the characters. I personally think the character development is good, so far. With every episode you get to know them a little better. But also here, they go with the rest of the anime, realistic. No totally unexpected reactions or behaviour. Till now there are many clich\u00e9s. However not Anime-clich\u00e9s but real world-clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-I like the opening and the end-theme. The end-theme is some electronic bad ass voice, which would probably creep you out if you listened too long to it. The rest of the music fits the anime, it supports the atmosphere. Nothing special, though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-I think this is a matter of opinion. Since the story is realistic, it's somehow like the real life and not everything turns out well. So if you want to watch an Anime with an intense and realistic slice-of-life plot, you will enjoy this one.",

            "content": "\"You piece of shit!\" \" Eat shit and die!\" Nakamura constantly screams these words, or some variation of it. To whom, you ask? Mostly to Kasuga, the ever spineless and submissive male protagonist in the midst of budding puberty. To the audience as well, who silently watched Nakamura wither away in a boring, stagnant town, in which she chooses to embrace all that is depraved and immoral. Twisted, perverted, unnatural, yet oddly beautiful. Loathed by all who know her; loved by those who think they understand her. These are feelings towards Nakamura, or maybe befitting of the anime itself. It's awkward. It's dark. Frustrating andcringe-worthy at times. But more than anything, there is beauty beneath the decayed surface, and yet decay equally lies underneath this beauty. This is Aku no Hana, a dark and perverse take on the classic adolescence story.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is the end product of artistic vision seldom experienced in the medium of anime. A masterpiece, some will say. For others, a hit-and-miss anime. Still others, a laughable, steaming pile of excrement. My verdict? Straddling the lines of masterclass and tragically missed opportunity. Aku no Hana is a veritable master of atmosphere. A King among kings. The haunting and minimalistic music, the morbid yet excruciatingly detailed art filled with decay, the omnipresent feeling of dread and perversion. An orgasm of the eyes and ears that can leave you limp and wheezing. Even HD quality video and my expensive headphone, amp and DAC system does not give the experience justice. Aku no Hana lies submersing and drowning in its own pool of narcissism and sheer artistic ambition and vision. I say: C'est magnifique!\\n\\n\r\nRotoscoping: the animation style of Aku no Hana. It's a daring and ambitious adaptation of an otherwise very plainly and standardly drawn manga of the same name and story. It expresses in animation what mere pen and paper can only dream of, and is, for just about everyone, the source of this series's extreme scrutiny. It's virtually alien to anime. An animation style that few know of and even less appreciate, relegated to the knowledge banks of movie nerds and hipsters. It defies all the clich\u00e9s and identifiable traits Japanese animation has come to represent and likely ever will represent. Tired of big eyes and panty shots? Want realism? Be careful of what you wish for. It's anime only in the sense that was made in Japan. You either love it, hate it, or deal with it. In the beginning I struggled with the rotoscope. It's weird, I told myself. Why did they change the art style I was expecting, my second thought. Eventually, I accepted it for what it was and learned to deal with it, even appreciate. And now? I feel that it was a choice by the director to visualize the heart and soul that Aku no Hana seeks to tell, and I respect it. What that means? That's for you to try and understand after watching. You may or may not agree with me. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana's inconsistencies?  It's a daring vision that, within the confines of a 13 episode series, struggles to strike an effective balance with the atmosphere, story pacing, and character progression.  In a way, it drowns in the very narcissistic pool that birthed it. Story progression and pacing suffers considerably. Arguably, its slow progression is an aspect of the entire artistic package, but for me it's an unnecessary burden. The art? Background art aside, the character line art would fade as distance increased. Missing anatomy. It's hard to distinguish whether the art is sublime and infused with meaning, a flaw of rotoscope, or a result of rushed deadlines. One other point of contention is the ending. It cuts off at a point that there should be more story to tell. Is this a sign of a second season? Maybe. Maybe not. I see the ending as an artistic device. It's like a clairvoyant seeing the future but the prophecy of it not yet realized in reality. The prophecy of what's to come is more powerful than the actual occurrence of those events, to continue the logic. Or, perhaps equally so, a selfish art project not given enough time, money, and resources. If you see it to the end, you'll know of what I speak. \\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nClosing Remarks:\\n\\n\r\nI can say this much. The music, art style, pacing, symbolism, all of it is deliberate and is meant to coalesce with the holistic message that Aku no Hana visually and aurally represents: the darkness and depravity that society shuns and refuses to embrace. It is the final evolutionary state of a work that pen, paper, and manga panels could only ever dream of expressing. Kasuga's dark and twisted story of adolescence, of budding sexual tension, and of crossing the boundaries of morality, is a special one that stands out among the pile of Japanese anime for eons; art for art's sake, for better or worse. Yet in the shadow of the many highlights of the series, enough maddening errors of omission (continuing the story) and art and production problems exist to detract from the experience. It has the atmospheric ambition mirroring the famous Coppola move Apocalypse Now. The execution, however, has enough pitfalls that it mimics the fumbling of an awkward teenager. I will say this: if it had ended in the right place, this production of Aku no Hana would be among the greatest works of sublime and self-worshiping art to have ever come from Japan. But, alas, not quite so. A masterpiece, a disaster and dirty stain among anime, or maybe just plain okay and nothing special besides looking really, really weird. Your mileage may vary. Here's some parting words: just watch it. Seriously. And if you're still meandering about it, try it out for Nakamura, at the very least. If not, you may very well be a shithead. Her words to you, not mine.\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: At the time of the review's writing, there has been no official word for a second season. This review assumes that there will not be a second season. If there is a second season, I have no intention of writing another review that includes the first season or a review of the second season alone; this is a stand-alone review project for the Aku no Hana animation project.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana's been the Spring season's most controversial title among anime fans and a great deal of that has to do with the anime's choice of animation style coming in the form of rotoscoping. I might as well address this issue before remarking on other aspects of the anime. Rotoscoping's been a controversial style of animation for years. While the style allows for one to animate more lifelike characters and movements, there are acclaimed animators that don't consider it a legitimate form of animation since live-action shots are animated over in order to accomplish the style and such animators think it kills creativity inthe medium. Personally, I think rotoscoping made for an excellent fit for Aku no Hana considering the mundane story it depicts with Kasuga's ordeals with Nakamura and Saeki. The style helps to better depict the dull routines of everyday life seen through Kasuga's eyes and allows the viewer to become immersed in the experience with him. The style also helps enhance a number of the title's uncomfortable moments with Kasuga and Nakamura's interactions. Going for a more conventional style of animation would have killed much of the effect this series would have to immerse the viewer in its story.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are depicted to be photo-realistic with realistic details and color that are quite pleasing on the eyes. Character designs are just as realistic with believable facial details on characters that make them actually look Japanese instead of the typical doe-eyed, rainbow-color hair designs of conventional Japanese animated titles. The designs are a bit rough in early episodes, but gradually improve throughout the span of the series. The animation, though, is a bit of a mixed bag. It's clear the makers of Aku no Hana are working with a TV budget as there are points where character designs are rendered still in movement, particularly during classroom scenes. However in major moments of the series involving Kasuga and the two girls, movement is quite fluid and there aren't too many instances of this leading to degradation of quality from the rotoscoped characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the title's story, Aku no Hana is prominently focused on Kasuga's interactions with Nakamura and Saeki pushing his fragile teen mind to the breaking point. The kid behaves much like any teen would at his age as he tries fitting in with friends, yet is feeling out of place with what society considers \"normal\" as he retreats to reading books. The series is pretty much a psychological drama that gets into Kasuga's head as he thinks about his interactions with the two girls, each representing a different world that he considers to be out of his grasp with Nakamura being the deviant outcast and Saeki being the popular girl of the class he has a crush on. The former plays enough of a big role in messing with Kasuga's head when she believes him to be a fellow deviant like herself and pushing him to do twisted acts involving Saeki after Kasuga steals her gym clothes in the title's second episode. I don't come across many recent titles that offer this level of depth in exploring the mental condition of a teenage boy getting ripped apart mentally by two girls his age. Only issue I have with the plot is that it looks like the series lacks a proper ending with the abrupt way it concluded and dropping hints that things would get worst for Kasuga in his present situation, likely teasing viewers for a possible second season.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major element of this series that was also somewhat controversial was its pacing and atmosphere. Aku no Hana devotes a good amount of time in some episodes to focus on the mood and atmosphere of a scene, mainly during major moments of the show or whenever Kasuga is in thought over whatever predicament he gets caught up in with Saeki or Nakamura. For the most part, the pacing and focus on atmosphere work rather well as they help enhance the discomfort and fear going through Kasuga's head as he contemplates things and shows how disconnected he is from \"normal\" people. However, the series usually gets in the bad habit of getting too focused on its atmosphere as it can unnecessarily focus on scenery shots for several minutes at a time at points and cause progression of the anime's plot to drag.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for Aku no Hana does very well at sticking out and flowing with the mood of the series. Its use in the series is minimalist, yet consists of haunting and tense insert tracks that go along well with the uncomfortable and mundane mood prevalent throughout the show's run. The OP and ED tracks are just as haunting with twisted lyrics accompanying the title's several OP songs meant to convey the mentalities of its main cast throughout Aku no Hana's run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Aku no Hana is quite easily my favorite title of the Spring season for being bold enough to be completely different in how it conveyed its story and overall presentation. Some elements of its approach on presentation have their issues, but they don't completely hurt the experience of exploring the complicated and twisted world of adolescence seen through Kasuga's eyes. Not to mention that the slow pacing, focus on atmosphere and rotoscoped animation won't be for everyone. But if you're looking for something that is completely out of the ordinary for an anime series, Aku no Hana would be a definite watch for you.",

            "content": "In most cases the manga for a story is better than the anime.  What most people don't realize is how difficult it is to interpret a manga into an anime and still stay true to the story.  Scenery in a manga doesn't translate very well into anime and most readers of manga could care less about how long it takes them to read a chapter.  \r\nAku no Hana has received a lot of mixed ratings due to its slow pace and long annoying scenery shots.  Most people comment about the rotoscoped animation or the fact that the characters don't have bigeyes and colorful hair.  I think most people have a hard time watching this anime because it highlights just how much boredom effects our daily lives.  Humans tend to mentally dwell on pointless things simply because we have nothing else with which to occupy our minds.  Maybe this anime is a very good portrayal of what many people suffer with on a day to day basis.  After reading the manga and then watching the anime, I am content to accept the theory that the director wanted as little glamour or fan service as possible in order to stay true to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nMany reviews wrongly comment on how deeply disturbing this anime is.  It isn't, not really.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and consider that most of the people who use this site have never had the ardent pressure of conforming to society the way Japanese teenagers do.  Sure, we have our morals and the golden rule, but a few documentaries and some research about Japan should really shed some light on how mentally draining it can be to suppress your individualism at an early age.  So why do many consider it to be something so psychologically deep when many of us enjoy our free spirit and unique behavior?  The best way to hide something is in plain sight, where everyone sees it so much that they grow tired of it and just excuse the thing as a regular occurrence.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe you have personally shelved something in your life or kept it under wraps for fear of what others might think or say about you.  Continuously throughout the anime there are classmates teasing Kasuga for being shy or reclusive.  They tease him even though he goes to so many lengths to conceal his inner thoughts.  Those who have read \"Ningen Shikkaku\" will notice that there are similarities in behavior for the young version of the protagonist in the novel and Kasuga.  Where the protagonist in Ningen Shikkaku tends to be a class clown in order to disguise the empty feeling inside him, Kasuga tends to go with the flow and agree passively with everyone.  I brought up Ningen Shikkaku simply because it is mentioned (or rather read in class) in the manga; so obviously the mangaka was influenced by this book.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does a decent job of revealing the human component which the manga leaves to imagination.  So, if you are looking for an anime with moe characters or special powers in a fantasy land, this is not the work of fiction for you.  However, if you want to experience something that might be floating on the surface of your own conscience, this might be a story to which you can relate.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana was originally a manga written by Oshimi Shuzo, named for a collection of poems from the French poet, Charles Baudelaire. The anime adaptation was written by Itami Aki. It's a psychological drama, which is a genre I like when handled well. Of course, it's usually not. The adaptation was handled by Zexcs. The only anime I've seen that they were involved in have been Mushi-shi and My-Hime. Which is somewhat encouraging, but there were other studios responsible for the major aspects of those anime. So I have no conception as to what a work they're primarily working on might be like. Iwon't lie, it's a bit refreshing to go into something with no idea what to expect. Let's look at Aku no Hana.  \\n\\n\r\nWe start Aku no Hana with our protagonist, Kasuga, stealing the gym clothes of the girl he likes. Isn't it just a treat to have a protagonist lose any likability they could have had the first time they do anything with story relevance? It's not the very first thing that happens, but it is the first important thing that happens. This anime loves to waste your time with long, drug out scenes in which nothing is accomplished. Presumably, to try to build atmosphere, but that only works when you actually do something. That's one of the biggest problems with the series, very little that happens is relevant. Back to the \"plot,\" and I use the term loosely. Kasuga's perverted stalker behaviour is observed by a girl named Nakamura. She agrees to keep it a secret, if Kasuga will make a contract with her. At its core, this is a story about deviance, which fits the title since Baudelaire believed that art and morality had to be kept separate and many of the poems in his collection were considered deviant. Six of them even being banned from publication after their initial release until 1949, almost a century after the initial volume was released. The issue with this theme, as used in this series, is that there are virtually no consequences for the deviant behaviours. The worse thing that happens is that Kasuga gets a talking to. Because this is a magical city where consequence is something that happens to other people. This level of disconnect from reality is an absolutely unforgivable problem in a series that professes to be psychological. Speaking of psychological elements, those are done extraordinarily poorly. Aku no Hana mistakes moving at a ridiculously slow pace, putting in music that's supposed to be creepy, and still shots of scenery for psychological depth. Slow pacing, creepy music and still shots could all work in a true psychological piece, but they need something to work off of and Aku no Hana doesn't have that integral piece. As such, they're just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, there are really only three who merit mention since the rest can be described in simple terms like \"Kasuga's mom\" or \"that guy with the funny eyebrows\" and don't have anything going on beyond a few scenes in which they may or may not do something that's supposed to be important. The first is Kasuga. He's a whiny little pervert who likes to make excuses for his bad behaviour and has very little depth whatsoever. He reminds me of Shinji Ikari. Then we have Saeki, Shinji's... I mean Kasuga's crush. At first she seems like the typical \"out of reach\" girl. It's only when we spend some time with her character that we realise she's actually one of the dumbest characters in all of fiction, in addition to her general lack of personality. She makes DBZ's Goku look like a genius. I'm surprised she managed to reach secondary school without Darwinising herself. Finally, we have Nakamura. Our self-proclaimed deviant and blackmailer. There's not much to her except being loud and insulting. She's the only character I don't hate. Because, if nothing else, she insults everyone I can't stand.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this is terrible. Characters frequently lose their facial features because... the artists suck with perspective. The movements are jerky. The mouths don't even come close to natural movements during dialogue scenes. A lot of the slow movements and frozen images might be better explained by lazy artists than attempts at atmosphere since these scenes enable them to do minimal amounts of work and they clearly aren't doing well in those scenes that require actual animation. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some good actors in this. Both Hikasa Yoko and Ise Mariya are very skilled. Although you wouldn't know it to hear them in this. Since the series has a general problem with characters being either over or under-acted. This is a psychological series. There's no room for subtlety of emotion here... Wait, what? the creepy music gets tiresome. It could have worked if they'd used it only when relevant instead of using it constantly. They even us it when it's just a shot of people walking. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. Expect no yuri. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana fails to deliver any actual psychological elements, resorting instead to one and two-dimensional characters who are sure to annoy you. The series both looks and sounds bad and very little happens that results in any kind of consequence and nothing happens that results in character growth.  It's unworthy of sharing a title with Baudelaire's work.  As such, I'm going to just refer to it as Cheese Steak Suppository. Cheese Steak Suppository gets a 2/10. As either a psychological work or a drama, it fails on every conceivable level. I'm going to re-watch Perfect Blue and get some real psychological content.",

Pacing on the impulses that the story gives, it feels irresistible to try not to break through Kasuga's soliloquy and Nakamura's obsession.\r\nSo far the story fulfills the void in which we seem to fall and the music emphasizes it amazingly well.\r\nthe animation is, in my opinion, superb! though you may find a new depiction world in these lines and colors, one mirroring nearly reality, and many people will not be able to embrace it.\r\nThe characters definitely catch your eyes being something you see day after day. Erupting their emotions from asweet smile and a brief moment of happiness, to a downfall in hopelessness and despair; to the very bottom when you feel like you're a piece of shit. Overall, i believe you can find a part of yourself in this anime, and i do have high hopes for Aku no Hana! \\n",

            "content": "The psychological genre is my favorite genre in anime. I love the emotions characters show as they go through the ups and downs and trials and tribulations of the story. Unlike many people who hate the \u201creal life\u201d backgrounds and scenery or the fact that the characters are \u201cugly\u201d, the thing I hate most about this show is the lack of emotion shown by the characters which I have come to love from similar psychological stories.\r\nI started Aku no Hana shortly after the season ended not knowing what to expect and with no idea whether I would hate it or love it. I had beenputting it off after seeing the art style and how it varied from the manga that I had greatly enjoyed. I also thought I knew exactly where this season would end but damn was I wrong. Instead of ending it at a place where the manga changes pace and I thought left a perfect spot for the season to end, they slowed down the pace and made it so that the climax of the story will probably come around the fourth or fifth episode of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt kind of pains me to give this story such a low score. I would have dropped this show after the first episode or so had I not read the manga and known how much better the plot gets. However, the plot gets really good shortly after where this relatively uneventful season ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Aku no Hana begins with a bored-out-of-his-mind middle school boy named Kasuga Takao. The town he lives in is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and is cut off from the rest of the world. Kasuga loves reading books and his favorite is \u201cFlowers of Evil\u201d (Aku no Hana in Japanese) by Charles Baudelaire. He even has a picture of Baudelaire in his bedroom and carries a copy of the book with him everywhere he goes. One day, he forgets the book at school and goes back to get it. When he does, he finds the gym uniform of his crush, Saeki Nanako, lying next to the lockers at the back of their classroom. Kasuga picks up and the clothes and smells them, and, startled by a sound behind him, gets scared and takes the uniform home with him. Kasuga decides to just put the uniform back the next day and avoid any problems, but things become difficult once he finds out that the loner in his class, Nakamura Sawa, saw him steal Saeki\u2019s uniform. In addition, Saeki and everyone else is freaking out over the event. From there, Nakamura uses the knowledge of what Kasuga has done to force him into a contract and use him to have some fun in this boring town town full of boring people.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I love the plot of the manga, the anime is just too slow paced. What could have had the climax of the manga (so far) at its end, instead decided to waste time on slow scenes and put off the real story for later. This show tries to build up tension too much, but fails in the end with a strange ending that forces a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I do not dislike the backgrounds that use rotoscoping (tracing over real life images and making it look animated). The one place where there is an intersection and there is a mirror that they use to split up Kasuga and his friends I thought was a very nice touch that showed how distant he was from everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t really like the designs that people consider \u201cugly,\u201d it\u2019s still not what ruined the show for me. What I dislike is the lack of emotion they portray. Despite sounding distraught or maniacal (for Nakamura) at times, the characters faces never show more blushing, tears, and sweat. Compared to something like \u201cHigurashi\u201d which shows emotions to the extreme, their faces are just boring. I just could not get attached to emotional scenes when I kept looking at the characters\u2019 faces and seeing the same expression I had seen in regular scenes. Even real life people show more emotions than these characters, which is not something I can say for almost any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I disliked was how characters only gained faces after they were large enough and how faces gradually appeared on them as they moved \u201ctowards the camera.\u201d This also detracted from the emotions of characters showed. It wasn\u2019t a problem for background characters, but it was for the main three and Kasuga\u2019s parents. One time Kasuga\u2019s mother is supposed to look distressed and crying but she (as well as Kasuga\u2019s father) has no face and instead is just sitting there for about half a minute before it lets you see her do anything to show that she is feeling distressed.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much music in this show. While the piano tones do set up a good mood, there\u2019s not much variety in the soundtrack. The one song that has one piano note every so often is about the only one I really noticed, and I\u2019m not sure if there were any songs other than that and the ED. I don\u2019t usually mention ending or opening songs, but this one starts prior to the end credits in every episode and is occasionally played during scenes. I really do not like the ending. It\u2019s a creepy, computer generated voice that isn\u2019t really even singing. I think it would work okay for a science fiction-horror but not for Aku no Hana.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I didn\u2019t even like Kasuga in the manga until after where the anime ends (right after where I thought it was going to end actually). Still, between the strange character designs, the lack of emotion they show, Kasuga\u2019s fairly annoying VA (who kind of had to be annoying to fit the role), and just the lack of anything that really happens to develop the characters during these 13 episodes, I do not like main character cast. The background characters all blend together and with their strange designs, all look kind of similar (except for one of Kasuga\u2019s friends with curly hair). Since the real interesting character development happens later than where the anime stops, there\u2019s really nothing much to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  4/10\\n\\n\r\nI kept hoping it would improve and become more like the manga I love, but it was just an uneventful, disappointing season in the end. I would recommend the manga over the anime if you want to experience the real emotion of the story and to not have the story cut off shortly before the climax. If you want something similar (but better) you could also try reading Chikan Otoko, Sundome, or Onani Master Kurosawa.",

            "content": "Well, frankly best psychological anime I have seen in years, though I am not a big watcher of the kind. I am out of words really, because anime tells so much I feel like telling any feeling, any detail would be a spoiler. I will attempt to summarize what I have seen in this anime that makes it different from the other stuff out there. Then I will try to touch more specific issuses like story, art etc.\r\nWhat makes it different overall?\r\nFirst things first, this anime is NOT for enjoying your leisure time; because they use visual imagery both as the narrator of the storyand as the element that establishes the overall atmosphere, meaning you need to effectively concentrate on what the visuals tell you. For example, lighting of a room will tell about the character much more than his/her conversations. Most of the time you can see how the characters feel just by looking at their faces. \\n\r\nSecondly, this is NOT an anime you would want to watch in one go. Just like a good meal, you have to eat it slowly, bit by bit. Overall slow pace itself is obviously designed for this purpose. \\n\r\nThirdly, what we have here belongs to the order of poetry, unlike most of the other anime which belong to the order of I would say novel, or compilation of stories. The title \"Flowers of Evil\" is already announcing such order, yet it is important to keep that in mind throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's pass on the more specific details:\\n\\n\r\nStory   8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell story is pretty simple actually. It takes place in a Japanese school in modern times. Broadly speaking, we see the change or the inability to change of Kasugi through his relation to Sawa and Saeki. But it is almost impossible to identify what the genre of the story is clearly; because they put so much emotion to it. It is as if looking at a simple object like a pen through a microscope. Thus seeing every coherent detail makes harder to identify clearly the genre of the story. Yet it does its job, which just like any other psychological work, is the depiction of characters. Let's say story in here is just an excuse for presenting the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat. Some may like it, others may not. I loved it. Reality in drawing adds a lot to the reality of emotion. And as I said in the beginning the story and the characters are depicted with visuals not with dialogues. It is hard to describe it with words but I hope in your life, you have seen a scene, a frame in reality which is so poetic that it immediately evokes certain feelings. The art in this anime is designed for recreating that feeling. Visuals are filled with so much meaning that they are naturally poetic, which is also difficult to be in a completely fictitious environment. The art is, if I may call it justly, cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen the visuals are this much strong, the only thing left for the sound is not to kill the visuals and support it. This is exactly what sound does in this anime.   It carries the visuals to the next level by creating the reality of the overall atmosphere. The credits music \u201cLast Flower\u201d by its form and content is a concentration of the story of the anime meaning if you compress the entire series into a song, you will probably get something like \u201cLast Flower\u201d. It is sadly weird.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen more real characters in anime, they are almost more real than the characters of some of the regular movies I have watched. We see three major axis on which the characters are built. One is ferocity towards the mediocrity of the town and its people. Two would be confounding lust with love, a typical trait for teens. Third is lack of courage, thus doing everything on impulse and trying not to face its consequences. Besides these foundations, we can also see the consequences of these foundations on the characters. A clear example would be the repetitions made by Sawa like \u201cBoring boring boring\u201d. These repetitions indicate a small autism which is a product of being shut out of the society which she lives in. Thus her ferocity towards the mediocrity of the town and its people, a trait which determines the nearly all of her actions, is based on her isolation from the society which manifest itself as a small autism indicated by such repetitions. There are other examples for other characters but I will not give them here, because I do not want ruin the fun of understanding such connections.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show because it has been a while since I've seen such genuine stuff. But this show is not designed for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who did not read the manga, I feel like the show attained its purpose which was the portrayal of the characters for the 1 part. If the show ends here, I am OK with that because once you understand that the events are solely for the exposition of the characters, not much of an event is needed after you understood the characters. The possible next season will show us either how they change or how they stay the same, and the options to what they will change into are pretty limited, so in all cases what happens in the next season is not really important in terms of plot, because the general purpose of the plot is already designated, but the thing that will be important for the next season is the art for sure. Now that we can see where everything is going, what matters is how they are going to portray it. This firm establishement gained by an \"ouverture\" should be the purpose of every first season. That is why overall I give 10 to this anime. I recommend it not only to watchers but to the producers as well. As a first season, it has function, style, uniqueness, a key combination for establishing anything great.",

            "content": "When it comes to the latest and greatest TV shows, sometimes I feel - as Nakamura would put it - like I'm \"drowning in a sea of shit\".\r\nMy 10/10 rating is ultimately based on this show's potential. Ah, what could have been. It's obvious from the final episode that the creators had every intention to make a second season. Based on the manga, the second season would have been earth-shattering. This first season was just laying the foundation for all that excitement - and what a great job it did!\r\nLet me say, the flack this show gets totally goes over my head. Poor adaptation? Areyou kidding me? This anime is about a million times better than the manga. Where the manga feels half-baked, this season did not shy away from or sugar-coat it's themes of isolation and boredom. And where the manga art does zero justice to it's dark and \"alternative\" themes, the anime is art is edgy and, yes, very \"alternative\". Why do people hate the animation so much? It's not cute because it's not supposed to be. I don't believe it's supposed to feel overly polished, either. The realistic proportions and movements of all the characters makes scenes that felt camp in the manga feel believably tense in the anime. And Nakamura's actress is just brilliant. I do agree with other fans, though, that the single best part of this season was the soundtrack. The ending theme has to be my favorite anime ending to date. And the rotating opening themes are super cool for expanding on one character at a time. The quiet background noise for sure also adds an interesting layer to Kasuga's day-to-day boredoms and almost an outer-body attitude to the mess that he is creating.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, this whole show is a brilliant character study. Kasuga, who prides himself on being \"different\" for reading classic poetry yet doesn't want to be called a deviant. Nakamura, who's sick of people like him wearing masks, yet deeply troubled and lonely because while she has a hunch that plenty of people share her views, none of them can admit to it. And even Saeki, who finally proves she's not just an angel or muse for Kasuga, but another lying \"shit-face\" tired of playing the part she's been assigned. I like the characters here much more than I EVER did in the manga. Interesting, since scene-by-scene it's very faithful to the manga. The animation, acting, and music really does make that big of a difference. It feels like a brand new story.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, poor pacing? Okay, this complaint drives me crazy. Because obviously you're crazy to say such a thing. The pacing in this show is so, so, so consistent. That's more than I can say about the pacing for most anime. Consistency is the single most important aspect of pacing, and it takes effort to achieve. Yeah, this show is slow. Maybe that's not your style. But at least it was intentional. Everything about this show is very intentional, if experimental, and done with care and purpose. This show has vision. It's okay if you don't like it's vision or angle, but don't dare put it in the ranks of other thoughtless, forgettable shows. The director did say he wanted this show to make a strong impression, even if that impression is a bad one. I guess I shouldn't be so upset this show gets so much hate, because as they say, the opposite of love is not hate - it's indifference. Bad publicity is good publicity?\\n\\n\r\nStill upset about this show's poor ratings. Forever pissed that we didn't get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who flame this anime without even giving it a try are the kind of people Kasuga and Nakamura hate - boring people glued inside a comfort zone. Such experimental and creative anime should be celebrated and encouraged. I'd much rather watch a show that takes risks, even if some of those risks fall flat, than one with a dime-a-dozen formulaic plot and style. Take Nakamura's advice and embrace the deviant inside of you. Embrace the risque, embrace the abnormal. Embrace this show. And shows like it. Hopefully, next time something this unique rolls out, people will give it a chance and give it a second season.",

            "content": "Teenage angst, love triangles, and melodrama are all really tacky aspects for a series to handle, but if there\u2019s one series that does a near impeccable job handling these aspects, it\u2019s Aku no Hana.\r\nThe pacing is slow. It\u2019s really, really, really slow, but it works. It works brilliantly. It was a little jarring at first with how slow events were taking place, but then it became clear that this show just would have never worked if it paced itself faster. Aku no Hana takes its time building up the atmosphere, beautifully fleshing out the characters and bringing them to life. Aku no Hana doesn\u2019t liketo make scenes snappy, instead it takes as much time as it wants drawing them out.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Aku no Hana, I didn\u2019t feel like I was watching ordinary anime anymore, but real life events unfolding right in front of my eyes. I felt like I was actually a passerby standing right in the scene, observing everything that was going on. I wasn\u2019t in my room anymore, I was there. That\u2019s how immersed I was with the whole experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd an ugly experience it was.  A beautifully ugly experience.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana never once showcases the beauty of human nature, society or the world we live in. It doesn\u2019t even end on a hopeful note. Aku no Hana throws you out of your comfort zone and blatantly tells you how cruel and cynical our world can really be at times, that sometimes there really is no hope.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana achieves this bleak theme with the main cast who no longer feel merely as characters, but as actual human beings. They\u2019re fantastically well-acted and far from likeable in a believable way. Kasuga isn\u2019t a terrible person, but he makes rash decisions and digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole by running away from his problems. Nakamura is so insecure and broken down inside, that she instills this narrow mindset where people are either deviants or not. Saeki is foolish and completely driven by her infatuation for Kasuga.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, all three characters wore me down so much that I was yelling at their naivety and ultimately putting my face in the palms of my hands, but not because the decisions they made were poorly written and delivered, but  quite the opposite. Every character mirrors reality perfectly, so much that\u2019s it\u2019s almost terrifying.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana screwed with my perspective on life the same brilliant way Aoi Bungaku and Welcome to the NHK did as I watched it. But alas, there are just a few flaws with the series. Yes, it was a little uneventful at first, the series ends on a major cliffhanger, but more importantly the series just became so abrasively dark that I eventually grimaced through the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend?: Aku no Hana is a rare anime that captures the atrocious side of life perfectly, but it\u2019s hard for me to recommend a series like this. The fact that the show is so downright cynical will turn people away as well as the incredibly slow pacing. If you like dark psychological drama, give this one a chance and see for yourself.",

After I went to the forums I saw the gigantic flame war and was confused. Why are people so mad?\r\nThe answer lies inrotoscoping. A technique, were you take live action footage and draw over it so it looks like an animated show. Shows like Waking Life, A Scanner Darkly, or Mind Game all use this Technique, as well as many other shows.\\n\\n\r\nWithout questioning whether it is good or bad, I ask a different question. If Aku no Hana is based on live action footage with real actors, can it be considered an anime? I think yes, though it is in this weird middle ground between live action drama and anime.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding whether or not it is an anime, I ask a second question, is it good?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere in japan. Takao Kasuga is a middle school student who is interested in literature, especially into Baudelaire\u2019s work, Aku no Hana.\\n\r\nHe is also in love with one of his class mates, Nanako Saeki, who is his \u201cmuse\u201d and source of inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nOne day he forgets his book in class and picks It up after everyone left, as he spots Saekis gym cloths and steals it on impulse. He feels guilt and shame and tries to bring it back but the antisocial loner, Sawa Nakamura saw him steal the gym clothing and now controls his life, trying to turn him into a deviant.\\n\\n\r\nThough it is set in a normal middle school it takes a more dark approach than most other school based anime, and right from the start focuses on drama and tension instead of romance and comedy. It\u2019s interesting and comparatively unique as a school anime and quite fresh especially in light of all the more cute and fun shows that normally air.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is extremely slow paced. I haven\u2019t read the manga but many people complained it covers only a little of it so I guess it is much slower than the manga version.\\n\\n\r\nYet I have no problem with the slow pacing as it creates immense atmosphere you don\u2019t see that often anymore. There are sometimes scenes of people walking or just background lasting several minutes with very minimalistic ambient music in the background. It\u2019s quite daring to do this, in nowadays more fast paced oriented anime world and I liked it quite a bit. It reminded me of some scenes in Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze and Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not a fan of slow pacing though I think you will not like it for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe Events and interactions are all quite simple though, you have Kasuga being controlled by Nakamura the entire time. They mostly talk and sometimes do things. It revolves mostly just around the 3 main characters and side characters just spice it up, but are never directly involved in the events.\\n\r\nThough it\u2019s not super interesting. The things that happen revolve around normal first love/dating events plus Nakamuras devilish twists to those. It gives the overall story a good amount of tension and you always wonder \u201chow in the world will this end well?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of how it will end well. The things that happened were also quite realistic, nothing internally destroyed the logic of the show, though you sometimes asked yourself how stupid Kasuga is, yet everything that happens makes sense within the personalities and world. There are no visible plotholes or desu ex machina, consequences are real, though not always as you expect them to be.\\n\\n\r\nSadly the show ends in a preview for a possible second season. I will most likely watch it when it comes out because it picks up where the buildup left.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana had some of the most realistic written characters I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime. Maybe it comes from the fact they were actors, but it\u2019s also the things they say, the way they react and the world around them. There are no silly school archetypes, no moe girl, no tsundere, no slapstick or fanservice as in other shows that revolve around school. \\n\\n\r\nTakao Kasuga, is somewhat an outsider. He thinks of himself as better than others, though is introverted. He has a massive sense of righteousness and romanticizes not only Saeki but also his literature and the fact that he feels so different. \\n\\n\r\nYet he is easy to manipulate, emotionally unstable and is drawn to the wrong decisions. No really he is that guy in a horror movie who opens the door to the monster and gets killed and you are screaming \u201cNO NO NOT THAT DOOR YOU IDIOT WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU GONNA GET KILLED!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty frustrating to watch him stumble from one bad decision to the next, especially when Nakamura takes over his life and he is to weak minded to fight back. There are several occasions he could have gotten out of the mess he was in. Burry Saekis clothing in the ground, throw them in a river, burn them down. But he never did. He only once tried to get rid of them but was too hysterical to do so.\\n\\n\r\nHis na\u00efve sense of right and wrong is also extremely annoying but at the same time interesting. He is insecure and has a low self-esteem but hides behind his supposed intellectualism and books.\\n\\n\r\nSawa Nakamura is the crazy girl from Takaos class. She is offensive, insulting and acts how she likes. She is manipulative and overall I would call her a true sociopath. She is not intelligent but very charismatic. She was just as unlikable as Takao though. I hated her and her attitude and emotional instability. If I was Takao I would not have given her any attention and probably blamed the stolen underwear on her.\\n\\n\r\nYet she is one of the more interesting characters in anime history. Her evil nature and playful destructive behavior is sometimes quite entertaining. She also is the driving force for all the drama in the show, as she puts Takao into worse situations the more they spend time together.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem though is that is never explained why she is such a \u201ccrazy bitch\u201d. She comes from a relatively normal household, grew up without a mother and just her father who seems like a nice guy as well as her grandmother who also is very nice. It kinda feels sketchy and she is just crazy so the story has a crazy person.\\n\\n\r\nYou know Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki, she was also insane, but at least it was explained why she was insane, while Nakamura is apparently just insane.\\n\\n\r\nSaeki is the class\u2019 most popular girl. Kasuga loves her but at first he is invisible for him. Later when he stands up for Nakamura she adores his brave protection of her and seeks him out. Her character is also hard to understand. She later finds out about what Kasuga did but still likes him nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nApparently she hates her sheltered perfect life and sees Kasuga as an interesting boy. Also she explains how she never had any male friends before and Kasuga seems to be the first interesting male she came into contact with.\\n\r\nThe rest of the side characters are just extra and I don\u2019t feel the need to go into them as they are almost unimportant for anything that happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the main characters of Aku no Hana are very realistic and have a deep intertwined relationship. From this the entire plot and drama derives and makes the show interesting. Even though none of them is likable (at least for me) but their characters are interesting enough to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI will try to make it brief.\\n\r\nI liked the artstyle of Aku no Hana. The rotoscope was special and different. We might argue about the quality of it and how it makes the show less of an anime and how the characters are not cute and all.\\n\\n\r\nBut fact is, if Aku no Hana would have had a traditional artstyle with traditional character designs like those in the manga, it would have been less interesting as it is now. It\u2019s good that a season has a black sheep that goes against the norm so it doesn\u2019t stagnate and becomes the same shit we\u2019ve seen a million times before. And I reward differentness.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the backgrounds are fucking beautiful looking. They are highly detailed (probably because they are based on real life) and add to the immersion and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe sometimes used evil flowers also add to the slightly surreal nature of the show and were a great addition effect wise.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I enjoyed the art of Aku no Hana as it was something that I don\u2019t see often and it made the show more interesting. Sure it doesn\u2019t look perfect and beautiful like other school anime do, but it fits the more mature and dark tone of the show much better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really call it voiceacting in Aku no Hana as they actually had their own voice. So I will just call it acting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it was great. The actors did a fantastic job, they had a great variety of emotions and gave the personalities of their characters great impact.\\n\r\nThe openings were all pretty weird and had this ironic tone. They didn\u2019t fit music wise but lyrics wise and I think it was intentional. I couldn\u2019t like them but give credit for their dementia feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song on the other hand is great. I don\u2019t know what the song is called right now but you can find it and give it a listen, it\u2019s very avant-garde and the first time this song kicked in in the first episode I was almost blown away. Definitely my favorite song of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack was also great. It was mostly atmospheric ambient. Some might find it boring but it hit my nerve and I will get my hands on it soon. It makes the show much more gloomy and atmospheric and helps the dark themes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to say how much I enjoyed Aku no Hana. It was a very exhausting show to watch. The tension and stupidity of the characters made me cringe but also look for more. As I said about Kasuga it was like watching a horror movie in which the characters always did the wrong things. It pisses you off but you want to see how it all ends.\\n\r\nOverall though I think it is one of the best show of the season and that\u2019s thanks to the fact of how daring it is.\\n\\n\r\nScores\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle +1 (rotoscope is different and special)\\n\r\nQuality -1 (the execution was pretty bad though)\\n\r\nBackground +1 (Fantastic backgrounds)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs 0 (They are real humans what do you expect them too be designed after?)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 0 (sometimes the flowers of evil but rarely used)\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting +1 (for overall good acting)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending 0(the ending was great, the openings weird)\\n\r\nSoundtrack +1 (Gloomy and Atmospheric)\\n\r\nSound Effects 0 (Nothing notable)\\n\\n\r\nStory or Content 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting 0 (It's still just a school drama...)\\n\r\nPacing 0 (Slow but increased the feeling of dread)\\n\r\nComplexity 0 (simple story, simple world, interesting themes though!)\\n\r\nPlausibility 0 (internally coherent but will make you facepalm at how stupid the MC is)\\n\r\nConclusion -1 (no real end...)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality +1 (some of the most realistic and excentric people you've ever seen in an anime)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry +1 (Kasuga and Nakamura create great tension)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression +1 (Kasuga slowly becomes a worse human being and removes his sense of righteousness) \\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop 0 (not everything was well explained, though the motivations are not out of no where)\\n\r\nLikability -1 (argh those people piss me off!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation +1 (I like different)\\n\r\nSound +1 (great soundtrack)\\n\r\nStory and Content 0 (interesting but hard to watch)\\n\r\nCharacters 0 (interesting but fucking idiots)\\n\r\nValue +1 (special anime and went into MAL history and probably everywhere else as well)\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is not for everyone. It is tough to watch, has some of the most annoying characters and an off putting artstyle.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something that sticks out of the normal then please go ahead and watch it. It's not a master piece and has many flaws. But at least it is ignoring what is popular and makes its own thing which I respect deeply.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 (Fair)",

            "content": "I appreciate anime trying something a little different when it's appropriate. Flowers of Evil is a pretty good example of the kind of manga you should be doing this with. A teenage boy idolises a pretty girl in his class but then gets roped into stealing her gym clothes by nothing more than his own secret desire to defile her. It's a reactionary piece to trends in popular culture that references a 19th century poem which was also a reactionary piece to trends in poetry and art at the time. The mangaka didn't want a straight adaptation of his work, and only accepted when thedirector of Mushishi Hiroshi Nagahama came along with his radical idea. His adaptation was a reactionary piece to the response people who saw Flowers of Evil as, to put it in the words of the original author, \"Nakamura unf unf\".\\n\\n\r\nI can see what they were going for with this adaptation. It shoves back in the face of the people who saw, in what was supposed to be a story about our creepy desires to defile the ideals we hold to be pure, an overly elaborate piece of NTR erotic fiction. These are real people, not the idols that you fetishise. It's supposed to heighten the sense of unease we get over the actions the characters take in this elaborate piece of NTR erotic fiction. At least, that's what I think it's supposed to be doing. It's certainly what a lot of the early chatter around this show suggested it was trying to be. Problem is that this was not only poorly implemented, but also seemed to have fuck all to do with the main theme of the actual story Flowers of Evil was telling.\\n\\n\r\nTell me Flowers of Evil, what are you supposed to be about? Is it about the mind-numbing mundanity of everyday life and screaming to get out, or is it about wanting to defile the things you hold pure? Because one half of the series focuses on one of those themes and the second half on the other. You could argue the two are connected, but then you'd be wrong. The directing likes to spend forever showing a decaying town and characters walking really slowly along streets with the only background music being a man randomly hitting a piano key every 10 seconds. I guess this is supposed to show how friggen boring everyday life is, although that's the director deliberately making his show boring and tedious to watch to make an artistic statement, for which I would like to kindly ask him to please take his head out of his own backside.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the story tries to focus more on trying to escape this mundanity, but this mundanity is presented as a crappy thing. The idolisation of purity is presented as a more careful balance between whether purity or defilement is the way to go. There's one attempt made in the entire show to marry these two scenes in an absolutely amazing scene at the end of episode 7 where the two characters destroy a classroom in a giant obvious metaphor for sex. But the series seemed to blow its load in that episode and after that spent its time piddling away doing next to nothing. Then again, before that scene, the show spent most of its time piddling away doing next to nothing. At least then it was novel and I could kid myself this was going to lead to something. Spoiler warning (although this isn't really a spoiler at all) no it doesn't go anywhere. Instead the show ends on a fucking montage of all the things that happen later in the manga that will never get animated because this show was never going to get a sequel and was pathetically stupid of the creators to even think that it would.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem of all is simply that it's a goddamn boring anime to watch. Once the novelty wears off, and it will, you come to the realisation that only one thing happens per episode. No really, only one thing happens in each episode. The rest is padded with shots of people walking and the main character panicking. The camera liked to linger on the town falling apart, which I think was supposed to tie into this idea of the town being decaying and boring. But the show also lingered on Nakamura, lingered on the main character, heck it even lingered on the picture of the poet the main character kept in his room. This rendered the entire directing choice of lingering on anything completely pointless and only served to drag out the episode even further, which on reflection probably was the only point. The main character...also talks...like this...most of...the time...taking...deep breaths...between every....other word....he says. It's supposed to show his panicked mind, but I couldn't take it seriously after a while and just started hearing the kid from Malcolm in the Middle in the wheelchair with the missing lung.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I'm just going to say it: The rotoscoping looks dumb. I'm not a fan of this animation technique even when it's done well, but here it has characters spazzing out when they move and that curious way faces aren't drawn in when they're too far away from the camera but as they get closer the faces get drawn in as though we're on a crappy video game system and the textures only just loaded in. They got people in their 30's to play these middle school kids so it's way more difficult to swallow their middle-school stupidity when you can clearly see they don't look 14. Sometimes it's able to capture these wonderful moments of expression on their faces, particularly the joy on Nakamura's face during the classroom destruction scene, but most of the time their features look like they're are drooping off their face like they're made of plasticine and they've been out in the sun for too long.\\n\\n\r\nI do appreciate the effort, and at the time I did enjoy picking Flowers of Evil apart to get at its juicy core themes. Unfortunately the more it went on and the more I picked at it, the more it started to come apart for me. There's evidently fuck-all enjoyment you can get from it on a surface level, and it was clearly asking to be picked apart for its themes. I like that it got weird moe fans all angry over their beautiful manga waifu longer being pretty, but stripping the sexuality away from a story that was precisely about dealing with sexual urges diminishes the point of the story in retrospect. All in all I'd class the whole thing as a failed experiment. An interesting experiment certainly, albeit one that is very boring to actually watch.",

            "content": "Either the worst eyesore you have ever witnessed in your entire life, or your salvation from a miserable existence without ever having witnessed this gracious account of a teenage boy's descent into evil. In the \"Reviews\" section of this fairly revolutionary-wise visual presentation, those are the only two kinds of reviews you will ever find. In the \"Ratings\" section, however, you will find a wide range of different people, who have either enjoyed, endured, or dropped this newly classic saga of adolescence. Those traitors! How could they have rated Aku no Hana as anything BUT a 9.0 or higher?! How could they have not savoredthe decadent scenes of Kasuga-kun walking through grass for basically half of one entire episode?! How could they have not delighted in the cliffhanger at the end of the series?! All of these little nuisances serve only to truly please the true fans of Aku no Hana. Yes, I am referring to masochists such as myself, who were taken aback by the god-tier skill and passion that was put forth into making each episode painful, and were constantly asking for more by the end of each episode. Let us unite and spread the good word amongst the deviants!\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, on to the review. Please note that the actual novel, Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, does not play as big a role as you might have thought. Sorry for the disappointment, folks.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY l 10 l\\n\r\nIn this particular anime, we start off by being introduced to Kasuga-kun, our beloved protagonist for this series, and the dull setting that he is immersed in. Basically, he lives in a tranquil, quiet town, where nothing commercial/big has reached. The buildings are soft and crumbling, and the shrubbery and trees softly melt into the clear, distant sky, setting the perfect mood for absolute chaos to bloom. Kasuga-kun is a junior high student, and is walking to school, when suddenly, BAM! nothing out of the ordinary happens at all. Anyways, in his class, Kasuga-kun is almost a complete loner, save for the geeks that he has attracted. Most of his classmates view him as weirdo, who is obsessed with books (Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, in particular); and it turns out that he is. It turns out that we get to listen in on almost every single thought that enters his mind, narrated in the voice of Morgan Free- Ueda, Shinichirou, I mean. Anyways, he's obsessed about this one girl named Saeki, Nanako, who just so happens to be one of his classmates. He literally acknowledges her as his reason to live, and seriously worships her accordingly. Despite this, he hesitates to check her out during P.E., as the other guys do (Good Guy Kasuga-kun). Too bad Saeki quite literally does not acknowledge him at all. Another important character to take note of here is Nakamura, Sawa. Alright; now, the actual story is set in motion when Kasuga forgets his copy of Les Fleurs du Mal at school. When he comes back to retrieve it, he is greeted by Saeki's bag of goodies (her bag of gym clothes), and upon an impulse, he grabs it, and runs like hell, the bag in one hand and his book in the other. Little does our Kasuga-kun know, though, that a certain girl (Nakamura) was loitering afterschool, and caught a glimpse of a certain someone stealing another certain someone's clothes. Oh, boy.\\n\\n\r\nART l 9 l\\n\r\nNow, despite how everyone was complaining about \"rotoscoping\", a technique of animation which they probably picked up from this anime page's forums, have no idea about the ethics of it, and have been tossing it around like monkeys with their own feces, I'd like to state otherwise. Although it's verily painful at first glimpse, it's simply beautiful once you get used to it, and it'll grow on you. Anyways, onto the concept of rotoscoping, and its ethics in being used in anime. Rotoscoping is basically an ancient form of art, with evidence of its use in any type of animation being as early as 1915. It is quite literally, the art of drawing over recorded material; just drawing anything at all is incredibly hard, so you should get off the animators' backs when you criticize any type of animation. Also, for those who have claimed that rotoscoping was used in this instance because there wasn't enough funding, let me tell you why that is bull feces. Instead of simply animating out of scratch and having voice actors create their magic, so much more was financed in renting a place to film, having a film crew, also having animators, and paying extra for actors who would fit the role, and work twice as hard as simple voice actors. If this was too long, and you didn't read it, then it can be summed up with: Anyone who criticizes animation should just go do it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND l 9 l\\n\r\nAku no Hana has one of the most beautiful original soundtracks my ears have ever been witness too; and I've even listened to Yoko Kanno's works. You have Uchujin's already well-established works with different vocalists doing the opening songs, and ASA-CHANG & JUNRAY's simply genius song, \"Hana -a last flower-\", fit one of the anime's most important themes about evil blooming like flowers. Aside from the OST, the background sounds to several settings within the anime are done masterfully, effectively simulating the exact same feel as though it were a picture. That is, assuming they didn't just use the clean-cut background sounds from the footage that they had recorded. If so, then anyone may correct me on that point. Also, the actors had done a wonderful job of voicing who they were meant to act as.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER l 8 l\\n\r\nCharacter. The lowest point of 8 in my rating. I might be mistaken in judging these characters, but what the hell. Alright, first, we have our first main character, Kasuga-kun. At first, we are shown that he is a vigilant bookworm, with a passionate love/desire for Saeki. With time, his character quite literally withers into an emo teenager who actually does repeat \"I'm empty!\" several times in a certain episode. By the end, though, you become witness to the beautiful emergence of Kasuga-kun out of a symbolic cocoon; anything more would spoil the entire anime for you guys. Next up, we have Nakamura-san, who is, instead of Saeki, the next most important character in this anime. All throughout the anime, basically, you can sum up Nakamura-san as an absolute bad-ass angel of chaos, who seeks nothing but a companion for the end of the world (symbolically); or, if you're a normal person, then a crazy, red-haired demon. Also, by the end, you are shown more of what had motivated her to do the things that she had done. Next, is Saeki-san, the next important character within this story. She is basically an angel from heaven, a blessing for her friends and family, and a sight for sore eyes if you're an abstinent male. Kasuga-kun has completely fallen for her, and with this honest emotion, she can't help but feel it mutual. It's a relatively short relationship, though, so celebrate Kasuga-kun's luck with brevity! Anyways, later on, Kasuga-kun is put between a rock and a hard place, when he absolutely must decide between two of the lovely ladies. You must watch it in order to find out what happens next!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT l 10 l\\n\r\nEvery Saturday/Sunday/Monday (whenever it was available to me from ggsubs), I would sit dutifully in my chair and watch Aku no Hana in perfect silence, absorbing all that I could from it. I honestly enjoyed this anime a lot, because again, I am quite the masochist. This anime will fulfill anyone looking for chaotically pristine drama, and will destroy anyone who isn't looking for salvation within this anime. I very much recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something to marathon when you have nothing else to do, because there literally is no other way to watch it but in a marathon (unless you were stuck in purgatory, waiting each week for the newest episode to be subbed, like I, and many of my brothers in the Spring of 2013 anime season). I might have enjoyed it quite a bit due to the fact that it sort-of mirrors my adolescence a bit. Oh well, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL l 9 l\\n\r\nAlright, I'm not gonna be a tyrant here and absolutely make everyone who bore through my review watch it, but just watch it, if you have even the slightest interest in it.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is the sort of anime that makes you feel nasty inside, but you still feel like you have to know what happens next - like looking at gore for the first time, it's real and it scares you, but you're so curious as to how it looks, that you keep exposing yourself to it.\r\nNow, Aku no Hana's plot thus far can be noted as impressive. The continuity of themes and information is all there. If you start watching this anime sometime after the 1st episode, I guarantee you won't know what's going on. It is also well paced, making sure that theevents in the episode are substantial enough to deviate from the \"filler\" label, and leave the viewer wanting to see the next episode. Aku no Hana does this in a unique way as well, usually ending episodes with a scene that could qualify as the episode's true climax.\\n\\n\r\nArt was dope, nuff' said. Aku no Hana uses realistic, truly humanoid depictions of characters without seeming pretentious. Mannerisms and speech are very richly pronounced. The scenery is awesome, not too particle-based Heaven's Lost Property cartoony awesomeness, but detailed, almost freehand landscapes and features. When you see the way they show the water in a river, you'll know.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Aku no Hana isn't anything too amazing, but for the series and its intended purpose of scaring the shi-- I mean establishing a rather darker mood, the music works. Aku no Hana opens up with not necessarily brighter, but more up-tempo and instrumental music pieces with very well written lyrics. The episodes tend to contain moon-setters as opposed to signature themes with replay value. Monotone humming for scenes with great tension, that type of deal. At the close of every episode, they transition into the abstract ending song by playing the vocal part by itself behind dialogue, then letting the instrumentation drop in. It's a great fit for the ending scenes especially, and if you watch, you'll get it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well developed across the board. I think Kasuga, our protagonist's purpose was made very clear. Typical conflicted teenager met with stimulus he's not built to sustain yet making poor decisions and later having to face them. Though, his monologues are usually rich with foreshadowing and poetic allusions, making them twice as intense. And of course, Nakamura, the backwards red-headed antagonist of the story, as well as maiden Saeki, are developed quite well.\\n\\n\r\nI gave Enjoyment a low rating, cuz frankly I don't really \"enjoy\" the anime, but I can appreciate it. Like a good horror/psychological piece, I don't particularly enjoy watching it as it frightens me/disturbs me, but I can give it ups and downs towards its production. It will definitely stick with you on a negative note, but you'll keep coming back simply because it's as interesting as a believable ghost story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Aku no Hana is a well made series thus far and frankly I encourage those who haven't started it yet and like a little bit of strange, eerie tension to compliment their dark nights alone at home, to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nLunoA96, signing out.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nFlowers of Evil is a coming of age story that borrows its title from the very famous volume of poems by Charles Baudelaire. This was based on a successful manga and directed by the same guy that did Mushishi. These elements seem like they would combine to make an absolute masterpiece of universal acclaim...unfortunately that isn't quite what happened.\r\nProduction:\r\nWhen the original mangaka, Shuzo Oshimi, talked to director Hiroshi Nagahama, they had some creative differences that in my opinion adversely affected the anime. Nagahama felt that the story was very personal and realistic, so it would lend itself more towards a stage production or perhaps aTV miniseries. However, Oshimi was insistent that it be turned into a successful anime, so Nagahama decided to compromise by using rotoscope animation to give it a more realistic feel. In case you were unaware, rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over footage, frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films and TV shows. An excellent example of Rotoscope animation done right would be the year 2000 film Titan AE. Incidentally, this was also the film that almost single-handedly ended the use of rotoscoping in big budget animated films in the West. Despite a solid script by Joss Whedon and fun characters, it struggled to find an audience and lost a LOT of money at the box office, becoming one of biggest bombs in Hollywood history! This is because good rotoscoping is an INSANELY expensive process and after Fox Animation Studios went bankrupt as a result of Titan AE bombing, it was seen as far too risky vs. cheaper and less labor intensive CGI animation. It is possible to use rotoscoping on a small budget, but it will look UNGODLY horrible like Adult Swim's \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\". If you know anything about Japanese film and television, you are well aware that the Japanese generally don't believe in having sky high budgets. The decision to use rotoscope on a highly limited budget was the single largest flaw with this anime. Fans accepted that Mushishi moved at a snail's pace because it had beautiful art and animation. If it looked like Tom Goes to the Mayor, it simply wouldn't have the same critical acclaim that it does! \\n\\n\r\nStory and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is named Takao Kasuga and he is a socially isolated teen in a small town that likes to read classic poetry and feels isolated from his rural, working class peers. He is sort of like a less abrasive version of Holden Caulfield if I had to compare him to anyone. Takao especially loves Baudelaire and constantly bemoans the fact that none of his peers like French literature. Meh, if he wanted to know what isolation feels like he should try being a Russian literature fan in the deep south United States! Takao has a crush on a pretty girl (it is difficult to tell with the puke inducing animation) named Saeki and considers her to be his \"muse\". One day, Kasuga decides to impulsively steal Saeki's gym clothes and bring them home, but he is caught by the class stalker and social outcast named Nakamura. Kasuga feels extreme, crippling guilt over stealing the underwear and allows himself to be blackmailed by Nakamura and forced to do outrageous deeds in order to prevent Saeki from learning the truth. The problem is that the plot often seems like a comedy, but plays itself extremely straight faced and serious! Kasuga's guilt over stealing panties and acting like he just murdered his own family is so melodramatic and absurd that it is impossible to take seriously! Imagine taking the famous painting \"Ivan the Terrible and his Son Ivan\" and replacing the corpse of his murdered son with a pair of ladies underwear!\" Look into his horrified, tormented eyes and feel his pain!!! This anime expects you to observe such a painting thoughtfully and NOT laugh your ass off, which is asking a lot! The other major problem is that the romance between Kasuga and his blackmailer Nakamura is telegraphed from the 2nd episode, and yet at no point does she EVER become remotely likeable or sympathetic!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned in the production section pretty much everything I wanted to say about the art. Basically, it isn't just bad, it is an absolute effrontery to your senses.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a soundtrack to speak of. Occasionally an atonal and unsettling theme will play, but mostly it uses silence. Once again, the silence worked in Mushishi because there was pretty art to look at and allowed the viewer to become absorbed. When your art is an absolute abortion, the strategic use of silence doesn't work effectively!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nFlowers of Evil is an anime with a LOT of problems in my opinion, but that doesn't make it a horrible anime. This was a highly ambitious project that tackled real themes that teenagers must deal with and has some instances of good writing, high culture, and impressive intelligence. The main character at times can be sympathetic and if this were a well directed stage play that perhaps toned down the panty stealing \"played straight\" melodrama, it would be at least very respectable if not loveable. It turned out kind of a mess, but I DO award points for effort and I think a 6/10 rating is honestly pretty fair for this one.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: FOR THE SAKE OF THIS REVIEW I WILL BE OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMTION THAT THERE IS AN UPCOMING SECOND SEASON. The anime said there would be a part two and I\u2019ll trust that for now. If there is no season two then I'd have problems with the conclusion and the score would have to be lowered. But the anime created interest in the manga, they haven't exhausted the budget, they previewed pt. 2 scenes that they've supposedly finished, some of the most powerful scenes have yet to come, etc. At this point, it seems very safe to assume there will be a second seasoneven if the anime sales haven't been great. \\n\\n\r\nAh, adaptions. The bane of all manga readers. Understandably, this is simultaneously claimed to be one of the best and worst anime adaptions there is. It has attracted much criticism and ridicule due to the huge change in character design, but this change was actually approved by the mangaka and I would tend to agree with him that it was good stylistic choice. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, fans think all anime characters, besides the comic relief ones, must be attractive. They can\u2019t take ugly characters seriously or treat them like humans, but they have no problem falling in love with cute bug-eyed alien creatures. That\u2019s superficial to a disgusting degree. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are often ugly, but why does that matter? Do you hate all movies with unattractive actors? Not all actresses look like supermodels, nor do the vast majority of women, so why should all anime characters be beautiful? I actually didn't like how, in the manga, Nakamura was meant to be ugly or plain, but the mangaka drew her attractive. It's like the manga version of \"Hollywood Homely.\"  When I read the manga, I was kind of annoyed that something like that tried to evoke a masterpiece like \"Les Fleurs Du Mals.\" In the anime, I wasn't offended by the reference, and it heightened my appreciation instead. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is a work about descent into decadence, libertinism, and the meaning of freedom; mental and physical. Should the characters really be moe? Is it really important that their eyes cover half of their face? This adaption took advantage of all of the manga's squandered potential. This is exactly what a good adaption does, rather than following in every folly of its predecessor. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be noted about the realistic nature of the character\u2019s faces is sometimes they look better than others. Like a real person, some of the screenshots will make a character look ugly and some will make a character look normal, although normal is ugly by anime standards. The point is that you shouldn\u2019t assume all the characters are ugly based on a couple unflattering screenshots. They\u2019re not poorly designed, they\u2019re real. \\n\\n\r\nI love the collision between realism and minimalism in the character designs, additionally contrasting with the fact that the city is one of the most realistic I've seen in anime; kind of emphasizing the insignificance of humanity more subtly than the manga ever did. It should be noted that the fact that the city seems to be \"decaying\" or in poor shape is a reference to a major theme of Les Fleurs du Mal. This animation captures the atmosphere really well and if it was done differently it would have flopped thematically. It had an interesting and creative artistic direction that had a clear purpose to it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is much of symbolism and depth to the art, just as there is in the general plot, and it is arguably the best aspect of the show. The animation seemed a bit choppy at times, but the art was generally flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere created by the art was enhanced by the incredible OST. The first OP perfectly captured Kasuga\u2019s character, the second OP Nakamura\u2019s, the third Saeki\u2019s, and the fourth was like a victory lap that captured the very essence of the anime. The BGM complimented and accented the atmosphere perfectly while the ED always kicked in with genius timing, changing subtly as the series progresses, culminating in it playing for half of the finale and a new ED coming on at the end. The ED is one of the creepiest things I\u2019ve ever heard. All in all I\u2019d say this is the one of the best and most fitting anime OSTs out there. It certainly has to be the only OST I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s influenced the atmosphere of a series and my opinion of it to this extent. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems a bit generic in the description, but unlike similarly premised titles, it is not a hentai or a comedy and it plays out very differently. The show is more about presentation than plot, but the plot is still engaging, unpredictable, and unique. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were among the stronger points. Kasuga\u2019s development was the entire point of the show (it appears to be a bildungsroman) and it was very well done. Under the guidance of Nakamura (a great character in her own right) we see him go from a mindless puppet who can only spout out the thoughts of others, but longs to be unique, to a free individual. At first he can only express himself in Baudelaire poems, poems he clearly doesn\u2019t really understand, but looks down on others for not getting although he doesn\u2019t really want anyone else to read them either. This whole concept infuriates Nakamura and she tries to \u201cbreak down his walls.\u201d Later, even in the classroom scene, he\u2019s just writing what Nakamura says. It isn\u2019t until he faces the prospect of losing her that he really manages to form a thought of his own, in an incredible scene and finale episode. \\n\\n\r\nNakamura helps him, and seems to treat him like dirt, but she also needs him. Her character is very interesting and the changes to how the audience views her over time were well done. Saeki is a foil to her character and there are many parallels and contrasts between them, both subtle and overt. She wants to understand Kasuga, but she can\u2019t. She would accept him no matter how he is. Some of her character developments towards the end and alluded to in the preview/flash-forward were very unexpected and her character is as complex as any. All of the side characters are also interesting and serve their purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment would be the hardest category to score. I enjoyed it more like I would enjoy a horror movie than a thriller, romance, or comedy. My eyes were not glued to the screen and sometimes it was hard to watch. I couldn't take it in more than one episode at a time, which is a testament to how powerful the atmosphere is. The whole thing was slow paced and tense and chock-full of second-hand embarrassment and humiliation. You really feel for the characters, and as they are dejected for most of the anime, you will be too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is arguably the best of its season and the best in years, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to most people. If you appreciate the decadent literary movement, if you thought the manga could be better, if you aren\u2019t bothered by unattractive characters, if you\u2019re looking for something different or more realistic, or if you are just open minded then this anime is for you.",

            "content": "Whenever people watch a film or show, regardless if it\u2019s anime or not, they want to be enticed into a deep and complex world that is full of mystery and wonder that they can solve for the benefit of their humanity. It seems as though Aku no Hana was meant to be something that was going to be the \u201cchange\u201d some people were looking for in the wake of entertainment controlling the masses. But boy did it fail at doing that on almost all accounts.\r\nTo get this out of the way, no the animation is not horrible. It is flawed yes, but not to theextent where it should be castrated out of someone\u2019s psyche after viewing the first episode. For starters, the animation that the studio decided to use is called rotoscoping, a style of animation where people are filmed in live-action and animators draw over the film frame-by-frame. Considering that this is the first anime show to do this style of animation, how is the quality of the rotoscoping? Not too well that\u2019s for sure. The lip-syncing is atrocious, the facial expressions are devoid of any expression and don\u2019t fit well with the emotions that the characters are trying to convey, and given how low the budget was the animation isn\u2019t very fluid in most places. Though with these flaws mentioned, the show isn\u2019t necessarily unwatchable due to the animation being average so it gets a slight pass in this department.\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, however, the art design of the background in the show\u2019s setting is truly spectacular to look at. How the buildings are drawn from every tiny detail of rust and grime in the darker places of the town is something to behold. It fits very well with the tone the show was trying to capture and it\u2019s effectiveness is relatively good. Another thing that also improves on Aku no Hana\u2019s mood is the music. With its subtle ambient and minimalist influenced sound, it\u2019s one of the most beautifully crafted scores that I\u2019ve had the pleasure of listening to.\\n\\n\r\nOn a technical level, the show is mixed with good music and art but really average animation, but how does it compare to the narrative and writing? Not to well that\u2019s for sure. For one, the characters and how they are written are not at all well developed or fully realized with anything that is happening with the plot. To address this even further, the relationships between the protagonist named Kasuga with our two main heroines Nakamura and Saeki are as well put together as one could get from a highschooler\u2019s attempt at writing a story such as this, a bad one at that. What makes these characters so bad in terms of a writing perspective is just how poorly paced it is in giving us a clear indication that Kasuga has a bond with either Nakamura and Saeki. With Kasuga and Nakamura, there is no chemistry whenever they are on screen they just playoff as a couple of degenerate who spout out vapid angsty monologues towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nKasuga himself is not an enticing protagonist to be on-screen. Just because you make him this Holden Caulfield type of character where he is obsessed with a dark poetry book doesn\u2019t make him have anymore depth than any other character in the show. Are we to sympathize with him just because he acts all pessimistic with the world around him with his pseudo-intellectual jargon? Not if it\u2019s done with careful precision in Kasuga\u2019s own archetype, which in reality is not the case whatsoever in Aku no Hana.\\n\\n\r\nNakamura and Saeki are two other characters that are unfortunately not spared in terms of mediocre character writing. The romantic development with Kasuga and Saeki was rushed to the point where we only get to see very few inclinations that they are a couple. We get two awkward dates and a moment where she invites him into his room. Not only that but Saeki\u2019s reasons for liking Kasuga are not at all convincing to the slightest degree. With all of the things Kasuga did, or forced in this case, to Saeki\u2019s property, any normal girl would easily never speak to him again, but just because the writers want to keep the story going, they\u2019ll just have to hope that any person with a half a brain would buy into this. No explanation for Saeki\u2019s reasoning for liking Kasuga, no nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Nakamura, Kasuga\u2019s \u201csidekick\u201d in the show. As you might predict, she is about as explained throughout the show as any of the other characters. This is, of course, the intention because Nakamura is something that we should be wary and suspicious about whether she\u2019s evil or not. Once she forms a contract with Kasuga, the only thing we really get out of Nakamura is that she is nothing more than the show\u2019s attempt at pouring out empty melodrama into the mix to make the plot try to seem too deep than what it already is. Her primary goal to the plot\u2019s theme is never given any deep context other than the fact that she thinks the whole world is bullshit and it should be destroyed. Look, if you want to give me an existential angst plot device at least try to deliver a better explanation than just a one-dimensional written one. That way the character can be portrayed in a reasonably sympathetic light, unfortunately Nakamura just doesn\u2019t cut out to be a deep convincing anti-hero with how poor the writing is.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the tone of the show is solid, the atmosphere itself tries too hard to be frightening to the point where it almost does the opposite effect of what it was initially trying to impose. It happens whenever there is a faint rumbling noise in the background that\u2019s supposed to resemble a heartbeat that is hardly effective at all in establishing a mood or whenever the music starts to grow in its dynamics with a dark droning noise that is unsettling in a wrong way. What\u2019s funny is that some of the build-up of the tone in some of the scenes are not necessary and fail to capture any fear at all. Once you do it multiple times throughout the show, it loses it\u2019s momentum quickly and all your left with is just an empty white noise in the background.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not often I get to talk about the actual \u201cacting\u201d rather than the voice acting in this show. The acting, while good in a few areas, is often overly dramatized and doesn\u2019t reach to that level of greatness of any drama TV show that you could be watching right now. Actors constantly spout out their lines and try to carry out as much emotion as possible in scenes that don\u2019t seem as though it was needed in the first place, such as one that involves a bathroom area.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention of the numerous plot holes that drags down the plot as a whole from making it convincing to anyone watching. Usually plot holes can be forgiven if they are tiny to where they are not noticeable to ruin the flow of the show. With Aku no Hana there are so many coincidences that can easily be accounted for lazy writing such as no one noticing the blackboard writing being blocked out the day after the vandalism scene, anyone could have easily deciphered what the saying was in two seconds flat.\\n\\n\r\nIn the short scheme of things, Aku no Hana is just a failed experiment that probably never should have been fully realized given to its source material. In all honesty, the original manga\u2019s story is quite fascinating and if only they hired more competent writers to fill in the wide gap that crippled Aku no Hana\u2019s chances of becoming an intriguing psychological drama. It wouldn\u2019t be a shock to call this a \u201cwasted opportunity\u201d given how the creators were ballsy in making it with the rotoscope technique; it just goes to show when you want to do something \u201cdifferent,\u201d you might want to focus more on your writing structure than your artistic integrity.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: D+",

            "content": "I normally don't write reviews, but because this series got so much hate, I felt obligated to say something. I thoroughly enjoyed this series for many reasons. First I'll address the elephant in the room that got this series so much hate: the art style. At first I couldn't stand the art style myself. I thought it was going to ruin the series the minute I saw it, but to my own surprise I was completely wrong. After getting into the story, I felt the art style fir the show perfectly. By not having cartoon-looking characters, it made the show much more believable that thesecharacters could possibly exist, which only makes the show even more troubling.\\n\r\nNext thing I want to address is the story. Right after the first episode, this show had me hooked. I found myself eager to watch the next episode right after the last. Even though it is not categorized as one, the first few episodes disturbed me more than any \"horror\" anime ever has. And don't even get me started on the creepy music when the end credits roll. Throughout the story, we see a boy who tries to be different from everyone else because he feels like he does not fit in anywhere. This made me feel like I was going to be faced with a boring protagonist and little to no character development. Once again, I was wrong. After Kasuga spends so much time with Nakamura, we get that hint that these two may slowly be falling for each other. I enjoy how the mood of the show changes along with the opening credits music throughout the series. At first, everything seems very troubling and eventually changes into a story of a boy who is trying to find himself. Because of Nakamura, he questions everything he has ever known, and even later admits he has been lying to himself for his entire life. Because of one girl, Kasuga's entire perception on life is changed and that is what I found so appealing about the story. I must admit, the last episode did kind of disappoint me and I'm really hoping for a part two. One of the only problems I had with this series was some of the dragging scenes. No, I do not want to watch a five-minute animation of Kasuga walking through the streets accompanied by sad music. Besides these minor problems, I really enjoyed this series and recommend to anyone who likes psychological anime.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is by far the most controversial Anime of the Spring Season 2013, receiving by far the most hate and still having quite a big fan base that does like it. Which one of the two sides arguing against each other is right?\r\nStory: The story of Aku no Hana takes place in Japan and revolves around Kasuga Takao, a quite normal boy, who goes to school, loves books (especially Baudelaire's \"Aku no Hana\") and has a crush on what is supposed to be the beauty of the class. One day he finds her sport clothes as he wants to get the bookhe accidentally forgot in the classroom. He takes them out and hears a sound. In the hurry he just takes them and leaves quickly. Later on the psycho child of the class, being Nakamura Sawa tells him she saw him stealing the clothes. From then on she makes him do things that...well are kind of awkward. The whole story is really well executed and as far as I know follows the Manga quite well (didn't read it). It is really enjoyable to watch and it keeps unfolding in directions that the viewer doesn't expect to go to. It was a good story, but no masterpiece! 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are the shining point of the show. Even though the only ones that get any focus at all are the three main characters that everything revolves around, they are that good developed that that is no problem at all! Kasuga Takao seems to be one of the most normal students we've seen in a while in Anime. He likes books, has a crush on a girl and doesn't have any powers or things he is really good in. That is until he gets seen by Nakamura stealing the clothes and his life gets more and more messed up, just as his mind. Nakamura Sawa is a psycho. That's what everyone agrees upon. But it is a kind of psycho, that seems more pleasant than the \"I'll kill you all\" type, and rather is someone that is claims himself to be a deviant and searches for people that are the same as she is. Saeki Nanako is the girl Kasuga has a crush on. She is a kind and good looking girl. I am not gonna talk a lot about her since I'd just end up spoiling. One must be said: The characters aren't likable at all! It is hard to really like them, but that is the point the series wants you to be in. It's a point were you can look down on the show from a spot a lot higher, which makes every single character a lot more human and makes their built up incredibly well done. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well....the first thing that comes to your mind while watching Aku no Hana is the character design, which looks to say it in a polite way different. It is not a bad thing to make them look this way, since it is just another point that makes you feel more distant to the characters. The point were the art fails is the animation itself. The characters suffer from either to much movement at the same time and you just can't seem to concentrate because the characters look as if they would tremble without a reason or they don't move at all. The amount of still screens in this show is incredibly high and makes the show feel as if it was something based on an incredibly low budget, which it probably is. Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple. It mostly consists of tones getting louder and louder which creates a suspense that really fits the show as something dark and awkward. Aku no Hana has one of the most memorable endings ever created. A song only sung by a computer voice singing about the flowers of evil definitely is really creepy and fits the whole show really well. Just as the 4 Openings do. Every single one of them is weird in it's own way but still it fits the show so well that by now I really enjoy hearing them on their own. The voice acting is nothing that really stands out. While it definitely is not horrible, it is nothing I do love. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have no idea how to score this...honestly! This show is nothing you will enjoy! However it is something that makes you want to shut down your browser and never open it again. At parts I couldn't watch an episode in a single sitting, but had to constantly pause it to calm down a bit, since my nerves were blank, but this is what makes this show so good! 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is not a show everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. It is hard to watch and if you aren't into thrillers or that kind of stuff you really should stay away from this, but if you like them or if it even interests you a little, go watch this and make your own picture of it.\\n",

            "content": "This is not an anime for the fainthearted. It is the single most disturbing piece of fiction I have ever been witness to, and rightly deserves to be named a psychological horror. \r\nBut this is not an easy anime to watch, as  it is broken and incoherent at times. What you can expect is a lot of cringe worthy moments which build an incredible tension that borders on fetishism. The protagonist is placed in a position of utter despair contrasted with sheer bliss. He goes from one to the other at a moments notice, further adding to the tension we are witness to. \r\nAnimation:10\\n\r\nThe drawing and animation style is difficult to adapt to at first. However, it is perhaps the primary reason to watch this incredible anime. The simple lines and faded colors are inherent to the surrealist style which this anime pays homage to. The animation allows the unease of the story to truly materialize and overwhelm the audience.  It is the only animation style fitting for this great work, and should not deter viewers from watching it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is difficult to follow at times, and may seem stagnant at others. However this is done with the very specific purpose of disorienting those who watch the anime. You experience the anime as a whole, the story is merely a tool used to alter the experience the viewer is subject to. The story manages to do what it was intended for beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters have incredible depth. Each character is crafted as a riddle which refuses to be solved. They each have fetishes, perversions, imperfections, and desires. Few animes can claim to fully explore the psychological depth of their characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:0\\n\r\nThis is an incredible anime, but it is truly painful to watch. I wanted to rip my hair out, tear at my skin and gouge my own eyes out. The anime has such a profound affect on the viewer that they cannot but help constantly feeling uneasy. And this feeling continuously builds, never letting up. If at any point it lets up, that is merely to betray you moments later with a feeling that is much much worse. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Don't watch it if you can't appreciate a masterpiece. This is not some silly plot driven flowery anime that does nothing to explore its characters. This is dark and real. If you decide to pick it up, push through a little bit at a time. Otherwise you will be overwhelmed and scared to continue.",

            "content": "OVERALL-realistic plot, art and characters where everything is comprehensible, fitting music during the anime, unusual but cool end-theme\r\nwhat does it make interesting? the realism combined with good characters, which make you experience intense emotions\r\nSTORY-I have to say that as far as I've seen it, the story is very good. It shows in a realistic scenario how a simple, impulsive action can bring one in a very ugly situation. There is an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness throughout the whole anime and you can basically feel the emotions of the characters.\r\nART-Well, the Art. What to say about it. It definitely is unusual. I wouldn't say thatit's bad, but I'm sure it's not everyone's taste. There are not many typical anime characteristics and it is, like the plot, very realistic. Sometimes it even looks like a movie and not an anime. But I think, that this style is appropriate considering the story. It just fits.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS-As I already mentioned in the Story-part, you can feel their emotions, which makes it easier to find a connection with the characters. I personally think the character development is good, so far. With every episode you get to know them a little better. But also here, they go with the rest of the anime, realistic. No totally unexpected reactions or behaviour. Till now there are many clich\u00e9s. However not Anime-clich\u00e9s but real world-clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-I like the opening and the end-theme. The end-theme is some electronic bad ass voice, which would probably creep you out if you listened too long to it. The rest of the music fits the anime, it supports the atmosphere. Nothing special, though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-I think this is a matter of opinion. Since the story is realistic, it's somehow like the real life and not everything turns out well. So if you want to watch an Anime with an intense and realistic slice-of-life plot, you will enjoy this one.",

            "content": "\"You piece of shit!\" \" Eat shit and die!\" Nakamura constantly screams these words, or some variation of it. To whom, you ask? Mostly to Kasuga, the ever spineless and submissive male protagonist in the midst of budding puberty. To the audience as well, who silently watched Nakamura wither away in a boring, stagnant town, in which she chooses to embrace all that is depraved and immoral. Twisted, perverted, unnatural, yet oddly beautiful. Loathed by all who know her; loved by those who think they understand her. These are feelings towards Nakamura, or maybe befitting of the anime itself. It's awkward. It's dark. Frustrating andcringe-worthy at times. But more than anything, there is beauty beneath the decayed surface, and yet decay equally lies underneath this beauty. This is Aku no Hana, a dark and perverse take on the classic adolescence story.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is the end product of artistic vision seldom experienced in the medium of anime. A masterpiece, some will say. For others, a hit-and-miss anime. Still others, a laughable, steaming pile of excrement. My verdict? Straddling the lines of masterclass and tragically missed opportunity. Aku no Hana is a veritable master of atmosphere. A King among kings. The haunting and minimalistic music, the morbid yet excruciatingly detailed art filled with decay, the omnipresent feeling of dread and perversion. An orgasm of the eyes and ears that can leave you limp and wheezing. Even HD quality video and my expensive headphone, amp and DAC system does not give the experience justice. Aku no Hana lies submersing and drowning in its own pool of narcissism and sheer artistic ambition and vision. I say: C'est magnifique!\\n\\n\r\nRotoscoping: the animation style of Aku no Hana. It's a daring and ambitious adaptation of an otherwise very plainly and standardly drawn manga of the same name and story. It expresses in animation what mere pen and paper can only dream of, and is, for just about everyone, the source of this series's extreme scrutiny. It's virtually alien to anime. An animation style that few know of and even less appreciate, relegated to the knowledge banks of movie nerds and hipsters. It defies all the clich\u00e9s and identifiable traits Japanese animation has come to represent and likely ever will represent. Tired of big eyes and panty shots? Want realism? Be careful of what you wish for. It's anime only in the sense that was made in Japan. You either love it, hate it, or deal with it. In the beginning I struggled with the rotoscope. It's weird, I told myself. Why did they change the art style I was expecting, my second thought. Eventually, I accepted it for what it was and learned to deal with it, even appreciate. And now? I feel that it was a choice by the director to visualize the heart and soul that Aku no Hana seeks to tell, and I respect it. What that means? That's for you to try and understand after watching. You may or may not agree with me. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana's inconsistencies?  It's a daring vision that, within the confines of a 13 episode series, struggles to strike an effective balance with the atmosphere, story pacing, and character progression.  In a way, it drowns in the very narcissistic pool that birthed it. Story progression and pacing suffers considerably. Arguably, its slow progression is an aspect of the entire artistic package, but for me it's an unnecessary burden. The art? Background art aside, the character line art would fade as distance increased. Missing anatomy. It's hard to distinguish whether the art is sublime and infused with meaning, a flaw of rotoscope, or a result of rushed deadlines. One other point of contention is the ending. It cuts off at a point that there should be more story to tell. Is this a sign of a second season? Maybe. Maybe not. I see the ending as an artistic device. It's like a clairvoyant seeing the future but the prophecy of it not yet realized in reality. The prophecy of what's to come is more powerful than the actual occurrence of those events, to continue the logic. Or, perhaps equally so, a selfish art project not given enough time, money, and resources. If you see it to the end, you'll know of what I speak. \\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nClosing Remarks:\\n\\n\r\nI can say this much. The music, art style, pacing, symbolism, all of it is deliberate and is meant to coalesce with the holistic message that Aku no Hana visually and aurally represents: the darkness and depravity that society shuns and refuses to embrace. It is the final evolutionary state of a work that pen, paper, and manga panels could only ever dream of expressing. Kasuga's dark and twisted story of adolescence, of budding sexual tension, and of crossing the boundaries of morality, is a special one that stands out among the pile of Japanese anime for eons; art for art's sake, for better or worse. Yet in the shadow of the many highlights of the series, enough maddening errors of omission (continuing the story) and art and production problems exist to detract from the experience. It has the atmospheric ambition mirroring the famous Coppola move Apocalypse Now. The execution, however, has enough pitfalls that it mimics the fumbling of an awkward teenager. I will say this: if it had ended in the right place, this production of Aku no Hana would be among the greatest works of sublime and self-worshiping art to have ever come from Japan. But, alas, not quite so. A masterpiece, a disaster and dirty stain among anime, or maybe just plain okay and nothing special besides looking really, really weird. Your mileage may vary. Here's some parting words: just watch it. Seriously. And if you're still meandering about it, try it out for Nakamura, at the very least. If not, you may very well be a shithead. Her words to you, not mine.\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: At the time of the review's writing, there has been no official word for a second season. This review assumes that there will not be a second season. If there is a second season, I have no intention of writing another review that includes the first season or a review of the second season alone; this is a stand-alone review project for the Aku no Hana animation project.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana's been the Spring season's most controversial title among anime fans and a great deal of that has to do with the anime's choice of animation style coming in the form of rotoscoping. I might as well address this issue before remarking on other aspects of the anime. Rotoscoping's been a controversial style of animation for years. While the style allows for one to animate more lifelike characters and movements, there are acclaimed animators that don't consider it a legitimate form of animation since live-action shots are animated over in order to accomplish the style and such animators think it kills creativity inthe medium. Personally, I think rotoscoping made for an excellent fit for Aku no Hana considering the mundane story it depicts with Kasuga's ordeals with Nakamura and Saeki. The style helps to better depict the dull routines of everyday life seen through Kasuga's eyes and allows the viewer to become immersed in the experience with him. The style also helps enhance a number of the title's uncomfortable moments with Kasuga and Nakamura's interactions. Going for a more conventional style of animation would have killed much of the effect this series would have to immerse the viewer in its story.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are depicted to be photo-realistic with realistic details and color that are quite pleasing on the eyes. Character designs are just as realistic with believable facial details on characters that make them actually look Japanese instead of the typical doe-eyed, rainbow-color hair designs of conventional Japanese animated titles. The designs are a bit rough in early episodes, but gradually improve throughout the span of the series. The animation, though, is a bit of a mixed bag. It's clear the makers of Aku no Hana are working with a TV budget as there are points where character designs are rendered still in movement, particularly during classroom scenes. However in major moments of the series involving Kasuga and the two girls, movement is quite fluid and there aren't too many instances of this leading to degradation of quality from the rotoscoped characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the title's story, Aku no Hana is prominently focused on Kasuga's interactions with Nakamura and Saeki pushing his fragile teen mind to the breaking point. The kid behaves much like any teen would at his age as he tries fitting in with friends, yet is feeling out of place with what society considers \"normal\" as he retreats to reading books. The series is pretty much a psychological drama that gets into Kasuga's head as he thinks about his interactions with the two girls, each representing a different world that he considers to be out of his grasp with Nakamura being the deviant outcast and Saeki being the popular girl of the class he has a crush on. The former plays enough of a big role in messing with Kasuga's head when she believes him to be a fellow deviant like herself and pushing him to do twisted acts involving Saeki after Kasuga steals her gym clothes in the title's second episode. I don't come across many recent titles that offer this level of depth in exploring the mental condition of a teenage boy getting ripped apart mentally by two girls his age. Only issue I have with the plot is that it looks like the series lacks a proper ending with the abrupt way it concluded and dropping hints that things would get worst for Kasuga in his present situation, likely teasing viewers for a possible second season.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major element of this series that was also somewhat controversial was its pacing and atmosphere. Aku no Hana devotes a good amount of time in some episodes to focus on the mood and atmosphere of a scene, mainly during major moments of the show or whenever Kasuga is in thought over whatever predicament he gets caught up in with Saeki or Nakamura. For the most part, the pacing and focus on atmosphere work rather well as they help enhance the discomfort and fear going through Kasuga's head as he contemplates things and shows how disconnected he is from \"normal\" people. However, the series usually gets in the bad habit of getting too focused on its atmosphere as it can unnecessarily focus on scenery shots for several minutes at a time at points and cause progression of the anime's plot to drag.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for Aku no Hana does very well at sticking out and flowing with the mood of the series. Its use in the series is minimalist, yet consists of haunting and tense insert tracks that go along well with the uncomfortable and mundane mood prevalent throughout the show's run. The OP and ED tracks are just as haunting with twisted lyrics accompanying the title's several OP songs meant to convey the mentalities of its main cast throughout Aku no Hana's run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Aku no Hana is quite easily my favorite title of the Spring season for being bold enough to be completely different in how it conveyed its story and overall presentation. Some elements of its approach on presentation have their issues, but they don't completely hurt the experience of exploring the complicated and twisted world of adolescence seen through Kasuga's eyes. Not to mention that the slow pacing, focus on atmosphere and rotoscoped animation won't be for everyone. But if you're looking for something that is completely out of the ordinary for an anime series, Aku no Hana would be a definite watch for you.",

            "content": "In most cases the manga for a story is better than the anime.  What most people don't realize is how difficult it is to interpret a manga into an anime and still stay true to the story.  Scenery in a manga doesn't translate very well into anime and most readers of manga could care less about how long it takes them to read a chapter.  \r\nAku no Hana has received a lot of mixed ratings due to its slow pace and long annoying scenery shots.  Most people comment about the rotoscoped animation or the fact that the characters don't have bigeyes and colorful hair.  I think most people have a hard time watching this anime because it highlights just how much boredom effects our daily lives.  Humans tend to mentally dwell on pointless things simply because we have nothing else with which to occupy our minds.  Maybe this anime is a very good portrayal of what many people suffer with on a day to day basis.  After reading the manga and then watching the anime, I am content to accept the theory that the director wanted as little glamour or fan service as possible in order to stay true to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nMany reviews wrongly comment on how deeply disturbing this anime is.  It isn't, not really.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and consider that most of the people who use this site have never had the ardent pressure of conforming to society the way Japanese teenagers do.  Sure, we have our morals and the golden rule, but a few documentaries and some research about Japan should really shed some light on how mentally draining it can be to suppress your individualism at an early age.  So why do many consider it to be something so psychologically deep when many of us enjoy our free spirit and unique behavior?  The best way to hide something is in plain sight, where everyone sees it so much that they grow tired of it and just excuse the thing as a regular occurrence.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe you have personally shelved something in your life or kept it under wraps for fear of what others might think or say about you.  Continuously throughout the anime there are classmates teasing Kasuga for being shy or reclusive.  They tease him even though he goes to so many lengths to conceal his inner thoughts.  Those who have read \"Ningen Shikkaku\" will notice that there are similarities in behavior for the young version of the protagonist in the novel and Kasuga.  Where the protagonist in Ningen Shikkaku tends to be a class clown in order to disguise the empty feeling inside him, Kasuga tends to go with the flow and agree passively with everyone.  I brought up Ningen Shikkaku simply because it is mentioned (or rather read in class) in the manga; so obviously the mangaka was influenced by this book.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does a decent job of revealing the human component which the manga leaves to imagination.  So, if you are looking for an anime with moe characters or special powers in a fantasy land, this is not the work of fiction for you.  However, if you want to experience something that might be floating on the surface of your own conscience, this might be a story to which you can relate.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana was originally a manga written by Oshimi Shuzo, named for a collection of poems from the French poet, Charles Baudelaire. The anime adaptation was written by Itami Aki. It's a psychological drama, which is a genre I like when handled well. Of course, it's usually not. The adaptation was handled by Zexcs. The only anime I've seen that they were involved in have been Mushi-shi and My-Hime. Which is somewhat encouraging, but there were other studios responsible for the major aspects of those anime. So I have no conception as to what a work they're primarily working on might be like. Iwon't lie, it's a bit refreshing to go into something with no idea what to expect. Let's look at Aku no Hana.  \\n\\n\r\nWe start Aku no Hana with our protagonist, Kasuga, stealing the gym clothes of the girl he likes. Isn't it just a treat to have a protagonist lose any likability they could have had the first time they do anything with story relevance? It's not the very first thing that happens, but it is the first important thing that happens. This anime loves to waste your time with long, drug out scenes in which nothing is accomplished. Presumably, to try to build atmosphere, but that only works when you actually do something. That's one of the biggest problems with the series, very little that happens is relevant. Back to the \"plot,\" and I use the term loosely. Kasuga's perverted stalker behaviour is observed by a girl named Nakamura. She agrees to keep it a secret, if Kasuga will make a contract with her. At its core, this is a story about deviance, which fits the title since Baudelaire believed that art and morality had to be kept separate and many of the poems in his collection were considered deviant. Six of them even being banned from publication after their initial release until 1949, almost a century after the initial volume was released. The issue with this theme, as used in this series, is that there are virtually no consequences for the deviant behaviours. The worse thing that happens is that Kasuga gets a talking to. Because this is a magical city where consequence is something that happens to other people. This level of disconnect from reality is an absolutely unforgivable problem in a series that professes to be psychological. Speaking of psychological elements, those are done extraordinarily poorly. Aku no Hana mistakes moving at a ridiculously slow pace, putting in music that's supposed to be creepy, and still shots of scenery for psychological depth. Slow pacing, creepy music and still shots could all work in a true psychological piece, but they need something to work off of and Aku no Hana doesn't have that integral piece. As such, they're just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, there are really only three who merit mention since the rest can be described in simple terms like \"Kasuga's mom\" or \"that guy with the funny eyebrows\" and don't have anything going on beyond a few scenes in which they may or may not do something that's supposed to be important. The first is Kasuga. He's a whiny little pervert who likes to make excuses for his bad behaviour and has very little depth whatsoever. He reminds me of Shinji Ikari. Then we have Saeki, Shinji's... I mean Kasuga's crush. At first she seems like the typical \"out of reach\" girl. It's only when we spend some time with her character that we realise she's actually one of the dumbest characters in all of fiction, in addition to her general lack of personality. She makes DBZ's Goku look like a genius. I'm surprised she managed to reach secondary school without Darwinising herself. Finally, we have Nakamura. Our self-proclaimed deviant and blackmailer. There's not much to her except being loud and insulting. She's the only character I don't hate. Because, if nothing else, she insults everyone I can't stand.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this is terrible. Characters frequently lose their facial features because... the artists suck with perspective. The movements are jerky. The mouths don't even come close to natural movements during dialogue scenes. A lot of the slow movements and frozen images might be better explained by lazy artists than attempts at atmosphere since these scenes enable them to do minimal amounts of work and they clearly aren't doing well in those scenes that require actual animation. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some good actors in this. Both Hikasa Yoko and Ise Mariya are very skilled. Although you wouldn't know it to hear them in this. Since the series has a general problem with characters being either over or under-acted. This is a psychological series. There's no room for subtlety of emotion here... Wait, what? the creepy music gets tiresome. It could have worked if they'd used it only when relevant instead of using it constantly. They even us it when it's just a shot of people walking. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. Expect no yuri. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana fails to deliver any actual psychological elements, resorting instead to one and two-dimensional characters who are sure to annoy you. The series both looks and sounds bad and very little happens that results in any kind of consequence and nothing happens that results in character growth.  It's unworthy of sharing a title with Baudelaire's work.  As such, I'm going to just refer to it as Cheese Steak Suppository. Cheese Steak Suppository gets a 2/10. As either a psychological work or a drama, it fails on every conceivable level. I'm going to re-watch Perfect Blue and get some real psychological content.",

Pacing on the impulses that the story gives, it feels irresistible to try not to break through Kasuga's soliloquy and Nakamura's obsession.\r\nSo far the story fulfills the void in which we seem to fall and the music emphasizes it amazingly well.\r\nthe animation is, in my opinion, superb! though you may find a new depiction world in these lines and colors, one mirroring nearly reality, and many people will not be able to embrace it.\r\nThe characters definitely catch your eyes being something you see day after day. Erupting their emotions from asweet smile and a brief moment of happiness, to a downfall in hopelessness and despair; to the very bottom when you feel like you're a piece of shit. Overall, i believe you can find a part of yourself in this anime, and i do have high hopes for Aku no Hana! \\n",

            "content": "The psychological genre is my favorite genre in anime. I love the emotions characters show as they go through the ups and downs and trials and tribulations of the story. Unlike many people who hate the \u201creal life\u201d backgrounds and scenery or the fact that the characters are \u201cugly\u201d, the thing I hate most about this show is the lack of emotion shown by the characters which I have come to love from similar psychological stories.\r\nI started Aku no Hana shortly after the season ended not knowing what to expect and with no idea whether I would hate it or love it. I had beenputting it off after seeing the art style and how it varied from the manga that I had greatly enjoyed. I also thought I knew exactly where this season would end but damn was I wrong. Instead of ending it at a place where the manga changes pace and I thought left a perfect spot for the season to end, they slowed down the pace and made it so that the climax of the story will probably come around the fourth or fifth episode of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt kind of pains me to give this story such a low score. I would have dropped this show after the first episode or so had I not read the manga and known how much better the plot gets. However, the plot gets really good shortly after where this relatively uneventful season ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Aku no Hana begins with a bored-out-of-his-mind middle school boy named Kasuga Takao. The town he lives in is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and is cut off from the rest of the world. Kasuga loves reading books and his favorite is \u201cFlowers of Evil\u201d (Aku no Hana in Japanese) by Charles Baudelaire. He even has a picture of Baudelaire in his bedroom and carries a copy of the book with him everywhere he goes. One day, he forgets the book at school and goes back to get it. When he does, he finds the gym uniform of his crush, Saeki Nanako, lying next to the lockers at the back of their classroom. Kasuga picks up and the clothes and smells them, and, startled by a sound behind him, gets scared and takes the uniform home with him. Kasuga decides to just put the uniform back the next day and avoid any problems, but things become difficult once he finds out that the loner in his class, Nakamura Sawa, saw him steal Saeki\u2019s uniform. In addition, Saeki and everyone else is freaking out over the event. From there, Nakamura uses the knowledge of what Kasuga has done to force him into a contract and use him to have some fun in this boring town town full of boring people.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I love the plot of the manga, the anime is just too slow paced. What could have had the climax of the manga (so far) at its end, instead decided to waste time on slow scenes and put off the real story for later. This show tries to build up tension too much, but fails in the end with a strange ending that forces a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I do not dislike the backgrounds that use rotoscoping (tracing over real life images and making it look animated). The one place where there is an intersection and there is a mirror that they use to split up Kasuga and his friends I thought was a very nice touch that showed how distant he was from everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t really like the designs that people consider \u201cugly,\u201d it\u2019s still not what ruined the show for me. What I dislike is the lack of emotion they portray. Despite sounding distraught or maniacal (for Nakamura) at times, the characters faces never show more blushing, tears, and sweat. Compared to something like \u201cHigurashi\u201d which shows emotions to the extreme, their faces are just boring. I just could not get attached to emotional scenes when I kept looking at the characters\u2019 faces and seeing the same expression I had seen in regular scenes. Even real life people show more emotions than these characters, which is not something I can say for almost any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I disliked was how characters only gained faces after they were large enough and how faces gradually appeared on them as they moved \u201ctowards the camera.\u201d This also detracted from the emotions of characters showed. It wasn\u2019t a problem for background characters, but it was for the main three and Kasuga\u2019s parents. One time Kasuga\u2019s mother is supposed to look distressed and crying but she (as well as Kasuga\u2019s father) has no face and instead is just sitting there for about half a minute before it lets you see her do anything to show that she is feeling distressed.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much music in this show. While the piano tones do set up a good mood, there\u2019s not much variety in the soundtrack. The one song that has one piano note every so often is about the only one I really noticed, and I\u2019m not sure if there were any songs other than that and the ED. I don\u2019t usually mention ending or opening songs, but this one starts prior to the end credits in every episode and is occasionally played during scenes. I really do not like the ending. It\u2019s a creepy, computer generated voice that isn\u2019t really even singing. I think it would work okay for a science fiction-horror but not for Aku no Hana.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I didn\u2019t even like Kasuga in the manga until after where the anime ends (right after where I thought it was going to end actually). Still, between the strange character designs, the lack of emotion they show, Kasuga\u2019s fairly annoying VA (who kind of had to be annoying to fit the role), and just the lack of anything that really happens to develop the characters during these 13 episodes, I do not like main character cast. The background characters all blend together and with their strange designs, all look kind of similar (except for one of Kasuga\u2019s friends with curly hair). Since the real interesting character development happens later than where the anime stops, there\u2019s really nothing much to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  4/10\\n\\n\r\nI kept hoping it would improve and become more like the manga I love, but it was just an uneventful, disappointing season in the end. I would recommend the manga over the anime if you want to experience the real emotion of the story and to not have the story cut off shortly before the climax. If you want something similar (but better) you could also try reading Chikan Otoko, Sundome, or Onani Master Kurosawa.",

            "content": "Well, frankly best psychological anime I have seen in years, though I am not a big watcher of the kind. I am out of words really, because anime tells so much I feel like telling any feeling, any detail would be a spoiler. I will attempt to summarize what I have seen in this anime that makes it different from the other stuff out there. Then I will try to touch more specific issuses like story, art etc.\r\nWhat makes it different overall?\r\nFirst things first, this anime is NOT for enjoying your leisure time; because they use visual imagery both as the narrator of the storyand as the element that establishes the overall atmosphere, meaning you need to effectively concentrate on what the visuals tell you. For example, lighting of a room will tell about the character much more than his/her conversations. Most of the time you can see how the characters feel just by looking at their faces. \\n\r\nSecondly, this is NOT an anime you would want to watch in one go. Just like a good meal, you have to eat it slowly, bit by bit. Overall slow pace itself is obviously designed for this purpose. \\n\r\nThirdly, what we have here belongs to the order of poetry, unlike most of the other anime which belong to the order of I would say novel, or compilation of stories. The title \"Flowers of Evil\" is already announcing such order, yet it is important to keep that in mind throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's pass on the more specific details:\\n\\n\r\nStory   8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell story is pretty simple actually. It takes place in a Japanese school in modern times. Broadly speaking, we see the change or the inability to change of Kasugi through his relation to Sawa and Saeki. But it is almost impossible to identify what the genre of the story is clearly; because they put so much emotion to it. It is as if looking at a simple object like a pen through a microscope. Thus seeing every coherent detail makes harder to identify clearly the genre of the story. Yet it does its job, which just like any other psychological work, is the depiction of characters. Let's say story in here is just an excuse for presenting the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat. Some may like it, others may not. I loved it. Reality in drawing adds a lot to the reality of emotion. And as I said in the beginning the story and the characters are depicted with visuals not with dialogues. It is hard to describe it with words but I hope in your life, you have seen a scene, a frame in reality which is so poetic that it immediately evokes certain feelings. The art in this anime is designed for recreating that feeling. Visuals are filled with so much meaning that they are naturally poetic, which is also difficult to be in a completely fictitious environment. The art is, if I may call it justly, cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen the visuals are this much strong, the only thing left for the sound is not to kill the visuals and support it. This is exactly what sound does in this anime.   It carries the visuals to the next level by creating the reality of the overall atmosphere. The credits music \u201cLast Flower\u201d by its form and content is a concentration of the story of the anime meaning if you compress the entire series into a song, you will probably get something like \u201cLast Flower\u201d. It is sadly weird.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen more real characters in anime, they are almost more real than the characters of some of the regular movies I have watched. We see three major axis on which the characters are built. One is ferocity towards the mediocrity of the town and its people. Two would be confounding lust with love, a typical trait for teens. Third is lack of courage, thus doing everything on impulse and trying not to face its consequences. Besides these foundations, we can also see the consequences of these foundations on the characters. A clear example would be the repetitions made by Sawa like \u201cBoring boring boring\u201d. These repetitions indicate a small autism which is a product of being shut out of the society which she lives in. Thus her ferocity towards the mediocrity of the town and its people, a trait which determines the nearly all of her actions, is based on her isolation from the society which manifest itself as a small autism indicated by such repetitions. There are other examples for other characters but I will not give them here, because I do not want ruin the fun of understanding such connections.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show because it has been a while since I've seen such genuine stuff. But this show is not designed for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who did not read the manga, I feel like the show attained its purpose which was the portrayal of the characters for the 1 part. If the show ends here, I am OK with that because once you understand that the events are solely for the exposition of the characters, not much of an event is needed after you understood the characters. The possible next season will show us either how they change or how they stay the same, and the options to what they will change into are pretty limited, so in all cases what happens in the next season is not really important in terms of plot, because the general purpose of the plot is already designated, but the thing that will be important for the next season is the art for sure. Now that we can see where everything is going, what matters is how they are going to portray it. This firm establishement gained by an \"ouverture\" should be the purpose of every first season. That is why overall I give 10 to this anime. I recommend it not only to watchers but to the producers as well. As a first season, it has function, style, uniqueness, a key combination for establishing anything great.",

            "content": "When it comes to the latest and greatest TV shows, sometimes I feel - as Nakamura would put it - like I'm \"drowning in a sea of shit\".\r\nMy 10/10 rating is ultimately based on this show's potential. Ah, what could have been. It's obvious from the final episode that the creators had every intention to make a second season. Based on the manga, the second season would have been earth-shattering. This first season was just laying the foundation for all that excitement - and what a great job it did!\r\nLet me say, the flack this show gets totally goes over my head. Poor adaptation? Areyou kidding me? This anime is about a million times better than the manga. Where the manga feels half-baked, this season did not shy away from or sugar-coat it's themes of isolation and boredom. And where the manga art does zero justice to it's dark and \"alternative\" themes, the anime is art is edgy and, yes, very \"alternative\". Why do people hate the animation so much? It's not cute because it's not supposed to be. I don't believe it's supposed to feel overly polished, either. The realistic proportions and movements of all the characters makes scenes that felt camp in the manga feel believably tense in the anime. And Nakamura's actress is just brilliant. I do agree with other fans, though, that the single best part of this season was the soundtrack. The ending theme has to be my favorite anime ending to date. And the rotating opening themes are super cool for expanding on one character at a time. The quiet background noise for sure also adds an interesting layer to Kasuga's day-to-day boredoms and almost an outer-body attitude to the mess that he is creating.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, this whole show is a brilliant character study. Kasuga, who prides himself on being \"different\" for reading classic poetry yet doesn't want to be called a deviant. Nakamura, who's sick of people like him wearing masks, yet deeply troubled and lonely because while she has a hunch that plenty of people share her views, none of them can admit to it. And even Saeki, who finally proves she's not just an angel or muse for Kasuga, but another lying \"shit-face\" tired of playing the part she's been assigned. I like the characters here much more than I EVER did in the manga. Interesting, since scene-by-scene it's very faithful to the manga. The animation, acting, and music really does make that big of a difference. It feels like a brand new story.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, poor pacing? Okay, this complaint drives me crazy. Because obviously you're crazy to say such a thing. The pacing in this show is so, so, so consistent. That's more than I can say about the pacing for most anime. Consistency is the single most important aspect of pacing, and it takes effort to achieve. Yeah, this show is slow. Maybe that's not your style. But at least it was intentional. Everything about this show is very intentional, if experimental, and done with care and purpose. This show has vision. It's okay if you don't like it's vision or angle, but don't dare put it in the ranks of other thoughtless, forgettable shows. The director did say he wanted this show to make a strong impression, even if that impression is a bad one. I guess I shouldn't be so upset this show gets so much hate, because as they say, the opposite of love is not hate - it's indifference. Bad publicity is good publicity?\\n\\n\r\nStill upset about this show's poor ratings. Forever pissed that we didn't get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who flame this anime without even giving it a try are the kind of people Kasuga and Nakamura hate - boring people glued inside a comfort zone. Such experimental and creative anime should be celebrated and encouraged. I'd much rather watch a show that takes risks, even if some of those risks fall flat, than one with a dime-a-dozen formulaic plot and style. Take Nakamura's advice and embrace the deviant inside of you. Embrace the risque, embrace the abnormal. Embrace this show. And shows like it. Hopefully, next time something this unique rolls out, people will give it a chance and give it a second season.",

            "content": "Teenage angst, love triangles, and melodrama are all really tacky aspects for a series to handle, but if there\u2019s one series that does a near impeccable job handling these aspects, it\u2019s Aku no Hana.\r\nThe pacing is slow. It\u2019s really, really, really slow, but it works. It works brilliantly. It was a little jarring at first with how slow events were taking place, but then it became clear that this show just would have never worked if it paced itself faster. Aku no Hana takes its time building up the atmosphere, beautifully fleshing out the characters and bringing them to life. Aku no Hana doesn\u2019t liketo make scenes snappy, instead it takes as much time as it wants drawing them out.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Aku no Hana, I didn\u2019t feel like I was watching ordinary anime anymore, but real life events unfolding right in front of my eyes. I felt like I was actually a passerby standing right in the scene, observing everything that was going on. I wasn\u2019t in my room anymore, I was there. That\u2019s how immersed I was with the whole experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd an ugly experience it was.  A beautifully ugly experience.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana never once showcases the beauty of human nature, society or the world we live in. It doesn\u2019t even end on a hopeful note. Aku no Hana throws you out of your comfort zone and blatantly tells you how cruel and cynical our world can really be at times, that sometimes there really is no hope.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana achieves this bleak theme with the main cast who no longer feel merely as characters, but as actual human beings. They\u2019re fantastically well-acted and far from likeable in a believable way. Kasuga isn\u2019t a terrible person, but he makes rash decisions and digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole by running away from his problems. Nakamura is so insecure and broken down inside, that she instills this narrow mindset where people are either deviants or not. Saeki is foolish and completely driven by her infatuation for Kasuga.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, all three characters wore me down so much that I was yelling at their naivety and ultimately putting my face in the palms of my hands, but not because the decisions they made were poorly written and delivered, but  quite the opposite. Every character mirrors reality perfectly, so much that\u2019s it\u2019s almost terrifying.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana screwed with my perspective on life the same brilliant way Aoi Bungaku and Welcome to the NHK did as I watched it. But alas, there are just a few flaws with the series. Yes, it was a little uneventful at first, the series ends on a major cliffhanger, but more importantly the series just became so abrasively dark that I eventually grimaced through the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend?: Aku no Hana is a rare anime that captures the atrocious side of life perfectly, but it\u2019s hard for me to recommend a series like this. The fact that the show is so downright cynical will turn people away as well as the incredibly slow pacing. If you like dark psychological drama, give this one a chance and see for yourself.",

            "content": "Zexcs has probably done the most bold thing of the season by animating Shuuzou Oshimis manga, Aku no Hana.\r\nApparently the manga was quite popular in advance and many people were looking forward to the adaptation. Yet after the first episode an uproar of many angry fans has shaken the industry. People were pissed and the show suddenly went to the lowest rated TV series on MAL.\r\nI on the other hand finished the episode and it left quite a good impression on me. After I went to the forums I saw the gigantic flame war and was confused. Why are people so mad?\r\nThe answer lies inrotoscoping. A technique, were you take live action footage and draw over it so it looks like an animated show. Shows like Waking Life, A Scanner Darkly, or Mind Game all use this Technique, as well as many other shows.\\n\\n\r\nWithout questioning whether it is good or bad, I ask a different question. If Aku no Hana is based on live action footage with real actors, can it be considered an anime? I think yes, though it is in this weird middle ground between live action drama and anime.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding whether or not it is an anime, I ask a second question, is it good?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere in japan. Takao Kasuga is a middle school student who is interested in literature, especially into Baudelaire\u2019s work, Aku no Hana.\\n\r\nHe is also in love with one of his class mates, Nanako Saeki, who is his \u201cmuse\u201d and source of inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nOne day he forgets his book in class and picks It up after everyone left, as he spots Saekis gym cloths and steals it on impulse. He feels guilt and shame and tries to bring it back but the antisocial loner, Sawa Nakamura saw him steal the gym clothing and now controls his life, trying to turn him into a deviant.\\n\\n\r\nThough it is set in a normal middle school it takes a more dark approach than most other school based anime, and right from the start focuses on drama and tension instead of romance and comedy. It\u2019s interesting and comparatively unique as a school anime and quite fresh especially in light of all the more cute and fun shows that normally air.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is extremely slow paced. I haven\u2019t read the manga but many people complained it covers only a little of it so I guess it is much slower than the manga version.\\n\\n\r\nYet I have no problem with the slow pacing as it creates immense atmosphere you don\u2019t see that often anymore. There are sometimes scenes of people walking or just background lasting several minutes with very minimalistic ambient music in the background. It\u2019s quite daring to do this, in nowadays more fast paced oriented anime world and I liked it quite a bit. It reminded me of some scenes in Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze and Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not a fan of slow pacing though I think you will not like it for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe Events and interactions are all quite simple though, you have Kasuga being controlled by Nakamura the entire time. They mostly talk and sometimes do things. It revolves mostly just around the 3 main characters and side characters just spice it up, but are never directly involved in the events.\\n\r\nThough it\u2019s not super interesting. The things that happen revolve around normal first love/dating events plus Nakamuras devilish twists to those. It gives the overall story a good amount of tension and you always wonder \u201chow in the world will this end well?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of how it will end well. The things that happened were also quite realistic, nothing internally destroyed the logic of the show, though you sometimes asked yourself how stupid Kasuga is, yet everything that happens makes sense within the personalities and world. There are no visible plotholes or desu ex machina, consequences are real, though not always as you expect them to be.\\n\\n\r\nSadly the show ends in a preview for a possible second season. I will most likely watch it when it comes out because it picks up where the buildup left.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana had some of the most realistic written characters I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime. Maybe it comes from the fact they were actors, but it\u2019s also the things they say, the way they react and the world around them. There are no silly school archetypes, no moe girl, no tsundere, no slapstick or fanservice as in other shows that revolve around school. \\n\\n\r\nTakao Kasuga, is somewhat an outsider. He thinks of himself as better than others, though is introverted. He has a massive sense of righteousness and romanticizes not only Saeki but also his literature and the fact that he feels so different. \\n\\n\r\nYet he is easy to manipulate, emotionally unstable and is drawn to the wrong decisions. No really he is that guy in a horror movie who opens the door to the monster and gets killed and you are screaming \u201cNO NO NOT THAT DOOR YOU IDIOT WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU GONNA GET KILLED!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty frustrating to watch him stumble from one bad decision to the next, especially when Nakamura takes over his life and he is to weak minded to fight back. There are several occasions he could have gotten out of the mess he was in. Burry Saekis clothing in the ground, throw them in a river, burn them down. But he never did. He only once tried to get rid of them but was too hysterical to do so.\\n\\n\r\nHis na\u00efve sense of right and wrong is also extremely annoying but at the same time interesting. He is insecure and has a low self-esteem but hides behind his supposed intellectualism and books.\\n\\n\r\nSawa Nakamura is the crazy girl from Takaos class. She is offensive, insulting and acts how she likes. She is manipulative and overall I would call her a true sociopath. She is not intelligent but very charismatic. She was just as unlikable as Takao though. I hated her and her attitude and emotional instability. If I was Takao I would not have given her any attention and probably blamed the stolen underwear on her.\\n\\n\r\nYet she is one of the more interesting characters in anime history. Her evil nature and playful destructive behavior is sometimes quite entertaining. She also is the driving force for all the drama in the show, as she puts Takao into worse situations the more they spend time together.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem though is that is never explained why she is such a \u201ccrazy bitch\u201d. She comes from a relatively normal household, grew up without a mother and just her father who seems like a nice guy as well as her grandmother who also is very nice. It kinda feels sketchy and she is just crazy so the story has a crazy person.\\n\\n\r\nYou know Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki, she was also insane, but at least it was explained why she was insane, while Nakamura is apparently just insane.\\n\\n\r\nSaeki is the class\u2019 most popular girl. Kasuga loves her but at first he is invisible for him. Later when he stands up for Nakamura she adores his brave protection of her and seeks him out. Her character is also hard to understand. She later finds out about what Kasuga did but still likes him nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nApparently she hates her sheltered perfect life and sees Kasuga as an interesting boy. Also she explains how she never had any male friends before and Kasuga seems to be the first interesting male she came into contact with.\\n\r\nThe rest of the side characters are just extra and I don\u2019t feel the need to go into them as they are almost unimportant for anything that happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the main characters of Aku no Hana are very realistic and have a deep intertwined relationship. From this the entire plot and drama derives and makes the show interesting. Even though none of them is likable (at least for me) but their characters are interesting enough to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI will try to make it brief.\\n\r\nI liked the artstyle of Aku no Hana. The rotoscope was special and different. We might argue about the quality of it and how it makes the show less of an anime and how the characters are not cute and all.\\n\\n\r\nBut fact is, if Aku no Hana would have had a traditional artstyle with traditional character designs like those in the manga, it would have been less interesting as it is now. It\u2019s good that a season has a black sheep that goes against the norm so it doesn\u2019t stagnate and becomes the same shit we\u2019ve seen a million times before. And I reward differentness.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the backgrounds are fucking beautiful looking. They are highly detailed (probably because they are based on real life) and add to the immersion and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe sometimes used evil flowers also add to the slightly surreal nature of the show and were a great addition effect wise.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I enjoyed the art of Aku no Hana as it was something that I don\u2019t see often and it made the show more interesting. Sure it doesn\u2019t look perfect and beautiful like other school anime do, but it fits the more mature and dark tone of the show much better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really call it voiceacting in Aku no Hana as they actually had their own voice. So I will just call it acting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it was great. The actors did a fantastic job, they had a great variety of emotions and gave the personalities of their characters great impact.\\n\r\nThe openings were all pretty weird and had this ironic tone. They didn\u2019t fit music wise but lyrics wise and I think it was intentional. I couldn\u2019t like them but give credit for their dementia feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song on the other hand is great. I don\u2019t know what the song is called right now but you can find it and give it a listen, it\u2019s very avant-garde and the first time this song kicked in in the first episode I was almost blown away. Definitely my favorite song of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack was also great. It was mostly atmospheric ambient. Some might find it boring but it hit my nerve and I will get my hands on it soon. It makes the show much more gloomy and atmospheric and helps the dark themes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to say how much I enjoyed Aku no Hana. It was a very exhausting show to watch. The tension and stupidity of the characters made me cringe but also look for more. As I said about Kasuga it was like watching a horror movie in which the characters always did the wrong things. It pisses you off but you want to see how it all ends.\\n\r\nOverall though I think it is one of the best show of the season and that\u2019s thanks to the fact of how daring it is.\\n\\n\r\nScores\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle +1 (rotoscope is different and special)\\n\r\nQuality -1 (the execution was pretty bad though)\\n\r\nBackground +1 (Fantastic backgrounds)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs 0 (They are real humans what do you expect them too be designed after?)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 0 (sometimes the flowers of evil but rarely used)\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting +1 (for overall good acting)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending 0(the ending was great, the openings weird)\\n\r\nSoundtrack +1 (Gloomy and Atmospheric)\\n\r\nSound Effects 0 (Nothing notable)\\n\\n\r\nStory or Content 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting 0 (It's still just a school drama...)\\n\r\nPacing 0 (Slow but increased the feeling of dread)\\n\r\nComplexity 0 (simple story, simple world, interesting themes though!)\\n\r\nPlausibility 0 (internally coherent but will make you facepalm at how stupid the MC is)\\n\r\nConclusion -1 (no real end...)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality +1 (some of the most realistic and excentric people you've ever seen in an anime)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry +1 (Kasuga and Nakamura create great tension)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression +1 (Kasuga slowly becomes a worse human being and removes his sense of righteousness) \\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop 0 (not everything was well explained, though the motivations are not out of no where)\\n\r\nLikability -1 (argh those people piss me off!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation +1 (I like different)\\n\r\nSound +1 (great soundtrack)\\n\r\nStory and Content 0 (interesting but hard to watch)\\n\r\nCharacters 0 (interesting but fucking idiots)\\n\r\nValue +1 (special anime and went into MAL history and probably everywhere else as well)\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is not for everyone. It is tough to watch, has some of the most annoying characters and an off putting artstyle.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something that sticks out of the normal then please go ahead and watch it. It's not a master piece and has many flaws. But at least it is ignoring what is popular and makes its own thing which I respect deeply.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 (Fair)",

            "content": "I appreciate anime trying something a little different when it's appropriate. Flowers of Evil is a pretty good example of the kind of manga you should be doing this with. A teenage boy idolises a pretty girl in his class but then gets roped into stealing her gym clothes by nothing more than his own secret desire to defile her. It's a reactionary piece to trends in popular culture that references a 19th century poem which was also a reactionary piece to trends in poetry and art at the time. The mangaka didn't want a straight adaptation of his work, and only accepted when thedirector of Mushishi Hiroshi Nagahama came along with his radical idea. His adaptation was a reactionary piece to the response people who saw Flowers of Evil as, to put it in the words of the original author, \"Nakamura unf unf\".\\n\\n\r\nI can see what they were going for with this adaptation. It shoves back in the face of the people who saw, in what was supposed to be a story about our creepy desires to defile the ideals we hold to be pure, an overly elaborate piece of NTR erotic fiction. These are real people, not the idols that you fetishise. It's supposed to heighten the sense of unease we get over the actions the characters take in this elaborate piece of NTR erotic fiction. At least, that's what I think it's supposed to be doing. It's certainly what a lot of the early chatter around this show suggested it was trying to be. Problem is that this was not only poorly implemented, but also seemed to have fuck all to do with the main theme of the actual story Flowers of Evil was telling.\\n\\n\r\nTell me Flowers of Evil, what are you supposed to be about? Is it about the mind-numbing mundanity of everyday life and screaming to get out, or is it about wanting to defile the things you hold pure? Because one half of the series focuses on one of those themes and the second half on the other. You could argue the two are connected, but then you'd be wrong. The directing likes to spend forever showing a decaying town and characters walking really slowly along streets with the only background music being a man randomly hitting a piano key every 10 seconds. I guess this is supposed to show how friggen boring everyday life is, although that's the director deliberately making his show boring and tedious to watch to make an artistic statement, for which I would like to kindly ask him to please take his head out of his own backside.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the story tries to focus more on trying to escape this mundanity, but this mundanity is presented as a crappy thing. The idolisation of purity is presented as a more careful balance between whether purity or defilement is the way to go. There's one attempt made in the entire show to marry these two scenes in an absolutely amazing scene at the end of episode 7 where the two characters destroy a classroom in a giant obvious metaphor for sex. But the series seemed to blow its load in that episode and after that spent its time piddling away doing next to nothing. Then again, before that scene, the show spent most of its time piddling away doing next to nothing. At least then it was novel and I could kid myself this was going to lead to something. Spoiler warning (although this isn't really a spoiler at all) no it doesn't go anywhere. Instead the show ends on a fucking montage of all the things that happen later in the manga that will never get animated because this show was never going to get a sequel and was pathetically stupid of the creators to even think that it would.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem of all is simply that it's a goddamn boring anime to watch. Once the novelty wears off, and it will, you come to the realisation that only one thing happens per episode. No really, only one thing happens in each episode. The rest is padded with shots of people walking and the main character panicking. The camera liked to linger on the town falling apart, which I think was supposed to tie into this idea of the town being decaying and boring. But the show also lingered on Nakamura, lingered on the main character, heck it even lingered on the picture of the poet the main character kept in his room. This rendered the entire directing choice of lingering on anything completely pointless and only served to drag out the episode even further, which on reflection probably was the only point. The main character...also talks...like this...most of...the time...taking...deep breaths...between every....other word....he says. It's supposed to show his panicked mind, but I couldn't take it seriously after a while and just started hearing the kid from Malcolm in the Middle in the wheelchair with the missing lung.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I'm just going to say it: The rotoscoping looks dumb. I'm not a fan of this animation technique even when it's done well, but here it has characters spazzing out when they move and that curious way faces aren't drawn in when they're too far away from the camera but as they get closer the faces get drawn in as though we're on a crappy video game system and the textures only just loaded in. They got people in their 30's to play these middle school kids so it's way more difficult to swallow their middle-school stupidity when you can clearly see they don't look 14. Sometimes it's able to capture these wonderful moments of expression on their faces, particularly the joy on Nakamura's face during the classroom destruction scene, but most of the time their features look like they're are drooping off their face like they're made of plasticine and they've been out in the sun for too long.\\n\\n\r\nI do appreciate the effort, and at the time I did enjoy picking Flowers of Evil apart to get at its juicy core themes. Unfortunately the more it went on and the more I picked at it, the more it started to come apart for me. There's evidently fuck-all enjoyment you can get from it on a surface level, and it was clearly asking to be picked apart for its themes. I like that it got weird moe fans all angry over their beautiful manga waifu longer being pretty, but stripping the sexuality away from a story that was precisely about dealing with sexual urges diminishes the point of the story in retrospect. All in all I'd class the whole thing as a failed experiment. An interesting experiment certainly, albeit one that is very boring to actually watch.",

            "content": "Either the worst eyesore you have ever witnessed in your entire life, or your salvation from a miserable existence without ever having witnessed this gracious account of a teenage boy's descent into evil. In the \"Reviews\" section of this fairly revolutionary-wise visual presentation, those are the only two kinds of reviews you will ever find. In the \"Ratings\" section, however, you will find a wide range of different people, who have either enjoyed, endured, or dropped this newly classic saga of adolescence. Those traitors! How could they have rated Aku no Hana as anything BUT a 9.0 or higher?! How could they have not savoredthe decadent scenes of Kasuga-kun walking through grass for basically half of one entire episode?! How could they have not delighted in the cliffhanger at the end of the series?! All of these little nuisances serve only to truly please the true fans of Aku no Hana. Yes, I am referring to masochists such as myself, who were taken aback by the god-tier skill and passion that was put forth into making each episode painful, and were constantly asking for more by the end of each episode. Let us unite and spread the good word amongst the deviants!\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, on to the review. Please note that the actual novel, Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, does not play as big a role as you might have thought. Sorry for the disappointment, folks.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY l 10 l\\n\r\nIn this particular anime, we start off by being introduced to Kasuga-kun, our beloved protagonist for this series, and the dull setting that he is immersed in. Basically, he lives in a tranquil, quiet town, where nothing commercial/big has reached. The buildings are soft and crumbling, and the shrubbery and trees softly melt into the clear, distant sky, setting the perfect mood for absolute chaos to bloom. Kasuga-kun is a junior high student, and is walking to school, when suddenly, BAM! nothing out of the ordinary happens at all. Anyways, in his class, Kasuga-kun is almost a complete loner, save for the geeks that he has attracted. Most of his classmates view him as weirdo, who is obsessed with books (Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, in particular); and it turns out that he is. It turns out that we get to listen in on almost every single thought that enters his mind, narrated in the voice of Morgan Free- Ueda, Shinichirou, I mean. Anyways, he's obsessed about this one girl named Saeki, Nanako, who just so happens to be one of his classmates. He literally acknowledges her as his reason to live, and seriously worships her accordingly. Despite this, he hesitates to check her out during P.E., as the other guys do (Good Guy Kasuga-kun). Too bad Saeki quite literally does not acknowledge him at all. Another important character to take note of here is Nakamura, Sawa. Alright; now, the actual story is set in motion when Kasuga forgets his copy of Les Fleurs du Mal at school. When he comes back to retrieve it, he is greeted by Saeki's bag of goodies (her bag of gym clothes), and upon an impulse, he grabs it, and runs like hell, the bag in one hand and his book in the other. Little does our Kasuga-kun know, though, that a certain girl (Nakamura) was loitering afterschool, and caught a glimpse of a certain someone stealing another certain someone's clothes. Oh, boy.\\n\\n\r\nART l 9 l\\n\r\nNow, despite how everyone was complaining about \"rotoscoping\", a technique of animation which they probably picked up from this anime page's forums, have no idea about the ethics of it, and have been tossing it around like monkeys with their own feces, I'd like to state otherwise. Although it's verily painful at first glimpse, it's simply beautiful once you get used to it, and it'll grow on you. Anyways, onto the concept of rotoscoping, and its ethics in being used in anime. Rotoscoping is basically an ancient form of art, with evidence of its use in any type of animation being as early as 1915. It is quite literally, the art of drawing over recorded material; just drawing anything at all is incredibly hard, so you should get off the animators' backs when you criticize any type of animation. Also, for those who have claimed that rotoscoping was used in this instance because there wasn't enough funding, let me tell you why that is bull feces. Instead of simply animating out of scratch and having voice actors create their magic, so much more was financed in renting a place to film, having a film crew, also having animators, and paying extra for actors who would fit the role, and work twice as hard as simple voice actors. If this was too long, and you didn't read it, then it can be summed up with: Anyone who criticizes animation should just go do it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND l 9 l\\n\r\nAku no Hana has one of the most beautiful original soundtracks my ears have ever been witness too; and I've even listened to Yoko Kanno's works. You have Uchujin's already well-established works with different vocalists doing the opening songs, and ASA-CHANG & JUNRAY's simply genius song, \"Hana -a last flower-\", fit one of the anime's most important themes about evil blooming like flowers. Aside from the OST, the background sounds to several settings within the anime are done masterfully, effectively simulating the exact same feel as though it were a picture. That is, assuming they didn't just use the clean-cut background sounds from the footage that they had recorded. If so, then anyone may correct me on that point. Also, the actors had done a wonderful job of voicing who they were meant to act as.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER l 8 l\\n\r\nCharacter. The lowest point of 8 in my rating. I might be mistaken in judging these characters, but what the hell. Alright, first, we have our first main character, Kasuga-kun. At first, we are shown that he is a vigilant bookworm, with a passionate love/desire for Saeki. With time, his character quite literally withers into an emo teenager who actually does repeat \"I'm empty!\" several times in a certain episode. By the end, though, you become witness to the beautiful emergence of Kasuga-kun out of a symbolic cocoon; anything more would spoil the entire anime for you guys. Next up, we have Nakamura-san, who is, instead of Saeki, the next most important character in this anime. All throughout the anime, basically, you can sum up Nakamura-san as an absolute bad-ass angel of chaos, who seeks nothing but a companion for the end of the world (symbolically); or, if you're a normal person, then a crazy, red-haired demon. Also, by the end, you are shown more of what had motivated her to do the things that she had done. Next, is Saeki-san, the next important character within this story. She is basically an angel from heaven, a blessing for her friends and family, and a sight for sore eyes if you're an abstinent male. Kasuga-kun has completely fallen for her, and with this honest emotion, she can't help but feel it mutual. It's a relatively short relationship, though, so celebrate Kasuga-kun's luck with brevity! Anyways, later on, Kasuga-kun is put between a rock and a hard place, when he absolutely must decide between two of the lovely ladies. You must watch it in order to find out what happens next!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT l 10 l\\n\r\nEvery Saturday/Sunday/Monday (whenever it was available to me from ggsubs), I would sit dutifully in my chair and watch Aku no Hana in perfect silence, absorbing all that I could from it. I honestly enjoyed this anime a lot, because again, I am quite the masochist. This anime will fulfill anyone looking for chaotically pristine drama, and will destroy anyone who isn't looking for salvation within this anime. I very much recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something to marathon when you have nothing else to do, because there literally is no other way to watch it but in a marathon (unless you were stuck in purgatory, waiting each week for the newest episode to be subbed, like I, and many of my brothers in the Spring of 2013 anime season). I might have enjoyed it quite a bit due to the fact that it sort-of mirrors my adolescence a bit. Oh well, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL l 9 l\\n\r\nAlright, I'm not gonna be a tyrant here and absolutely make everyone who bore through my review watch it, but just watch it, if you have even the slightest interest in it.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is the sort of anime that makes you feel nasty inside, but you still feel like you have to know what happens next - like looking at gore for the first time, it's real and it scares you, but you're so curious as to how it looks, that you keep exposing yourself to it.\r\nNow, Aku no Hana's plot thus far can be noted as impressive. The continuity of themes and information is all there. If you start watching this anime sometime after the 1st episode, I guarantee you won't know what's going on. It is also well paced, making sure that theevents in the episode are substantial enough to deviate from the \"filler\" label, and leave the viewer wanting to see the next episode. Aku no Hana does this in a unique way as well, usually ending episodes with a scene that could qualify as the episode's true climax.\\n\\n\r\nArt was dope, nuff' said. Aku no Hana uses realistic, truly humanoid depictions of characters without seeming pretentious. Mannerisms and speech are very richly pronounced. The scenery is awesome, not too particle-based Heaven's Lost Property cartoony awesomeness, but detailed, almost freehand landscapes and features. When you see the way they show the water in a river, you'll know.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Aku no Hana isn't anything too amazing, but for the series and its intended purpose of scaring the shi-- I mean establishing a rather darker mood, the music works. Aku no Hana opens up with not necessarily brighter, but more up-tempo and instrumental music pieces with very well written lyrics. The episodes tend to contain moon-setters as opposed to signature themes with replay value. Monotone humming for scenes with great tension, that type of deal. At the close of every episode, they transition into the abstract ending song by playing the vocal part by itself behind dialogue, then letting the instrumentation drop in. It's a great fit for the ending scenes especially, and if you watch, you'll get it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well developed across the board. I think Kasuga, our protagonist's purpose was made very clear. Typical conflicted teenager met with stimulus he's not built to sustain yet making poor decisions and later having to face them. Though, his monologues are usually rich with foreshadowing and poetic allusions, making them twice as intense. And of course, Nakamura, the backwards red-headed antagonist of the story, as well as maiden Saeki, are developed quite well.\\n\\n\r\nI gave Enjoyment a low rating, cuz frankly I don't really \"enjoy\" the anime, but I can appreciate it. Like a good horror/psychological piece, I don't particularly enjoy watching it as it frightens me/disturbs me, but I can give it ups and downs towards its production. It will definitely stick with you on a negative note, but you'll keep coming back simply because it's as interesting as a believable ghost story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Aku no Hana is a well made series thus far and frankly I encourage those who haven't started it yet and like a little bit of strange, eerie tension to compliment their dark nights alone at home, to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nLunoA96, signing out.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nFlowers of Evil is a coming of age story that borrows its title from the very famous volume of poems by Charles Baudelaire. This was based on a successful manga and directed by the same guy that did Mushishi. These elements seem like they would combine to make an absolute masterpiece of universal acclaim...unfortunately that isn't quite what happened.\r\nProduction:\r\nWhen the original mangaka, Shuzo Oshimi, talked to director Hiroshi Nagahama, they had some creative differences that in my opinion adversely affected the anime. Nagahama felt that the story was very personal and realistic, so it would lend itself more towards a stage production or perhaps aTV miniseries. However, Oshimi was insistent that it be turned into a successful anime, so Nagahama decided to compromise by using rotoscope animation to give it a more realistic feel. In case you were unaware, rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over footage, frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films and TV shows. An excellent example of Rotoscope animation done right would be the year 2000 film Titan AE. Incidentally, this was also the film that almost single-handedly ended the use of rotoscoping in big budget animated films in the West. Despite a solid script by Joss Whedon and fun characters, it struggled to find an audience and lost a LOT of money at the box office, becoming one of biggest bombs in Hollywood history! This is because good rotoscoping is an INSANELY expensive process and after Fox Animation Studios went bankrupt as a result of Titan AE bombing, it was seen as far too risky vs. cheaper and less labor intensive CGI animation. It is possible to use rotoscoping on a small budget, but it will look UNGODLY horrible like Adult Swim's \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\". If you know anything about Japanese film and television, you are well aware that the Japanese generally don't believe in having sky high budgets. The decision to use rotoscope on a highly limited budget was the single largest flaw with this anime. Fans accepted that Mushishi moved at a snail's pace because it had beautiful art and animation. If it looked like Tom Goes to the Mayor, it simply wouldn't have the same critical acclaim that it does! \\n\\n\r\nStory and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is named Takao Kasuga and he is a socially isolated teen in a small town that likes to read classic poetry and feels isolated from his rural, working class peers. He is sort of like a less abrasive version of Holden Caulfield if I had to compare him to anyone. Takao especially loves Baudelaire and constantly bemoans the fact that none of his peers like French literature. Meh, if he wanted to know what isolation feels like he should try being a Russian literature fan in the deep south United States! Takao has a crush on a pretty girl (it is difficult to tell with the puke inducing animation) named Saeki and considers her to be his \"muse\". One day, Kasuga decides to impulsively steal Saeki's gym clothes and bring them home, but he is caught by the class stalker and social outcast named Nakamura. Kasuga feels extreme, crippling guilt over stealing the underwear and allows himself to be blackmailed by Nakamura and forced to do outrageous deeds in order to prevent Saeki from learning the truth. The problem is that the plot often seems like a comedy, but plays itself extremely straight faced and serious! Kasuga's guilt over stealing panties and acting like he just murdered his own family is so melodramatic and absurd that it is impossible to take seriously! Imagine taking the famous painting \"Ivan the Terrible and his Son Ivan\" and replacing the corpse of his murdered son with a pair of ladies underwear!\" Look into his horrified, tormented eyes and feel his pain!!! This anime expects you to observe such a painting thoughtfully and NOT laugh your ass off, which is asking a lot! The other major problem is that the romance between Kasuga and his blackmailer Nakamura is telegraphed from the 2nd episode, and yet at no point does she EVER become remotely likeable or sympathetic!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned in the production section pretty much everything I wanted to say about the art. Basically, it isn't just bad, it is an absolute effrontery to your senses.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a soundtrack to speak of. Occasionally an atonal and unsettling theme will play, but mostly it uses silence. Once again, the silence worked in Mushishi because there was pretty art to look at and allowed the viewer to become absorbed. When your art is an absolute abortion, the strategic use of silence doesn't work effectively!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nFlowers of Evil is an anime with a LOT of problems in my opinion, but that doesn't make it a horrible anime. This was a highly ambitious project that tackled real themes that teenagers must deal with and has some instances of good writing, high culture, and impressive intelligence. The main character at times can be sympathetic and if this were a well directed stage play that perhaps toned down the panty stealing \"played straight\" melodrama, it would be at least very respectable if not loveable. It turned out kind of a mess, but I DO award points for effort and I think a 6/10 rating is honestly pretty fair for this one.",

            "content": "(THIS IS ONLY A PRELIMINARY REVIEW. THIS WILL BE MORE DETAILED ONCE THE SERIES HAS FINISHED)\r\nFlowers of Evil (Aku no Hana) may very well be one of the most controversial, polarizing anime in a while, mainly due to its unnatural animation. The use of rotoscoping, if you will. From the first episode alone, it was met here with most users either dropping it immediately, rating it at 1/10, wrote first episode reviews claiming it to be the worst anime ever, or all of the above. My question is does the rotoscoping really make this the worst anime in existence? Then again, take a look atSword Art Online's mean score, so that'll pretty much say some things about MAL's credibility.\\n\\n\r\nThis 13-episode ZEXCS adapation of Shuuzou Oshimi's manga follows Takao Kasuga, a literature enthusiast high school student. One day, he forgets his book at school and goes back to retrieve it. He also sees the gym clothes of his crush, Nanako Saeki, and impulsively steals them. However, he is caught by a friendless, pottymothed girl named Sawa Nakamura, who decides to blackmail Kasuga for her own evil desires.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to what mostly everyone have been on about: The animation itself: Yes, the rotoscoping isn't the greatest. People here are acting like rotoscoping is the bane of anime, even though you've seen it before. For example, a number of scenes from Kids on the Slope (Sakamichi no Apollon) were done using rotoscoping. Why is it now people are bitching about it? I think it's because in this day and age, most anime-watchers are used to watching plotless, bland moe anime with the girls' eyes taking up about third of their faces. The movements do look janky and the designs themselves look half-done (I'm hoping that they improve on this for the BD/DVD release), but is it really that big of a deal? Does the animation actually tell the story in any way?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think the odd animation helps set up the atmosphere, because there are some moments that probably wouldn't have produced the same disturbing effect if it was done in the traditional animation we're used to. Like in one moment, Nakamura forcibly puts Saeki's clothes onto Kasuga. Also, keep in mind I haven't read the manga as of this review's posting, so I can't say if it provokes the same effect.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when I say this: This show is dark and twisted. Kasuga knows what he did was low and appalling and he despises himself for it. Nakamura knows it as well, and plans to make his life more hell than it already is. In one instance, Kasuga finally gets the cojones to ask Saeko out, but during the date, Nakamura makes him wear her gym clothes underneath his clothes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Nakamura: This chick I can't even begin to describe. As the series progresses, it becomes clear that Nakamura isn't just blackmailing Kasuga for her own amusement. She seems to want to show that the world is full of perverted shitheads and Kasuga's just her guinea pig.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't understand why Flowers of Evil was rated so low here, other than idiots whining about the character designs and the rotoscoping. Personally, I love it. The rotoscoping actually makes it more believable. If you think otherwise, then I apologize that it just wasn't moe enough for you.",

            "content": "A large amount of anime fans seem to complain a whole lot about how every single anime has moe in it. So what happens when the most anti-moe anime ever comes up? People complain about it. Sigh. \r\nAku no Hana tells the tale of an ordinary high school student named Kasuga, who likes to read this book by some French poet called the Flowers of Evil. (Aku no Hana means the Flowers of Evil, by the way) He has a crush on his fellow student, Saeki. One day, while going to his school after class to pick up something he forgot, he sees Saeki's gymclothes and decides to take them home. The next day at school, everyone is gossiping about how a pervert stole Saeki's gym clothes. No one should know it's Kasuga, however, a girl called Nakamura happened to see it. Nakamura happens to be a very twisted girl, and decides to blackmail Kasuga and torturing him mentally in several ways. \\n\\n\r\nLet's begin with the most infamous part of Aku no Hana- The animation. You see, Aku no Hana used this technique called rotoscopping, which means that you film real actors and just draw over them. Apparently, rotoscopping is cheap. That might be true, but it looks freakin' awesome. Everyone, for once, looks Japanese. The characters are in near constant movement, something not even some other anime with great animation can claim. The unique look greatly adds to the disturbing nature of the show. Also, the style allows them to do some rather neat camera angels that give the anime it's own unique style.  And even if you claim the animation style is so called ugly, you cannot deny how realistic the backgrounds look. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the story. One thing that always confuses me about the complaints this show gets is that people say that it's slow-paced. Even the people who like it say that it's slow-paced. It's true that there's no action scene every episode or something, but this show is far from slow-paced! It might be one of the best paced anime that I've seen. It uses every scene to increase the amount of tension in the show and add to the disturbing feel of it. And that is what Aku no Hana does best, disturb you. It's not a horror and has no horror elements to it, but just the way it plays with the characters' emotions. You never know exactly what is going on in any of the characters' minds during it. You just can't look away while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Aku no Hana are another strong point. While they do have a habit of acting like idiots sometimes, especially near the ending of the show, they're just so fleshed out, and you find yourself sympathizing with even the insane Nakamura. Kasuga is perhaps one of the best characters made for the sole purpose of getting the audience to so called \u201cconnect\u201d with them. While it's true that he doesn't have that much of a personality (which kind of comes into play in later episodes) he actually reacts realistically to the situations around him. He's not overwhelming dull like a lot of other male protagonists like him due to the situations he is placed in. Nakamura is the other main character, who can best be called an insane perverted freak. She blackmails Kasuga more or less just because she's bored with the world around her, and just wants some fun. She's really fleshed out throughout the show, and despite the terrible things she does to Kasuga, she's still a rather sympathetic character. I was never sure whether to like her or hate her during the show. She's certaintly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana also has perhaps one of the best anime soundtracks ever. It's a very haunting soundtrack, and there's many moments of silence  in the show where it plays, giving it a chance to really stand out. And the ending theme, oh my god do I love the ending them of this. It's probably my favorite anime ending theme. It has this really unique sound to it (it more or less has the same idea as Vocaloid, expect it's much more scarier and actually sounds good) and has a habit of starting about 30 seconds before the actual episode, where the most disturbing event tends to happen, and it just sends chills down your spine whenever the song starts. The openings are also interesting too. The main characters take turns singing it, and while they cannot sing at all, the lyrics do give you insight on their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is a deconstruction of the romance genre. It takes apart the tropes in this drama and subtly tears them apart. While I wouldn't call it realistic, it is a breath of fresh air. Unique in every way possible, while it's not perfect (it doesn't really have an ending, and while it wasn't the worst selling show of the season it was airing in, I do think we can all agree that the same day this gets a season 2 is the same day where the third Puella movie only sells 500 copies), it is still awesome, and a must-watch. I give it 9 stars.",

            "content": "To be able to act out Kasuga is a feat equivalent to playing a good Ophelia. The mad princess of Hamlet, in one scene, after hearing of her father\u2019s death, goes mad and begins to sing bawdy songs in front of a shocked cast. The appearance of Ophelia in this state is simultaneously comic and tragic; she is walking the line to her death yet the surprise of the madness shocks the audience into laughter. Only a good actress can find the perfect balance, to tinge laughter with sadness yet not overtly so for \u201cin the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, thewhirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness\u201d (Hamlet Act 3 Scene 2, when he teaches the actors the proper methods of acting). A good Kasuga Takao has to be both pitiful and sublime.\\n\\n\r\nHow well an adaptation of Aku no Hana fares depends on this ability to walk between pitiful impotence and sublime exaltation. The whole weight of Aku no Hana falls on the pitiful crescendo to its sublime set-piece moments. People who have read the manga know this scene: the classroom scene. The weight of that scene depends on the director\u2019s capability to depict wildness and fury. With this regard the manga has a greater weight. The reader can flip through pages; decide his or her own pace as to how to approach the event. The watcher has to follow the director\u2019s pace. That single scene redeems everything that comes before it and sets the tone for everything that comes after. We know now why Kasuga seems so irritatingly idiotic for the first few chapters; the shock of the change is worth the price of admission.\\n\\n\r\n\tShinchirou Ueda plays the pitiful side exceptionally. His voice is cracked and whimpering. His screams are inert and more like squeals initially. His posture is always like a crumpled heap. He is a laughable creature. This is the part where I deal with those criticisms dealing with the art style. The idea behind rotoscoping is to portray a humanity of movement. Each slight nod, twist, turn of the human body is captured entirely. Without rotoscoping there lacks weight to the characters animated. On how they made the characters caricatures of their moe-fied(?) manga forms I will deal with in a different paragraph.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the manga the pitiful and sublime balance each other. The weight of each setpiece scene is felt and burns itself into the hearts of those who can empathize with the scenario given. The anime pulls back the sublime and hides it behind the seams. The pacing is at a snail\u2019s pace and many shots are spent on repetition: the twisted road sign, the school building and the familiar sights of the town\u2026 the atmosphere is crushing.  Rather than fury it strikes with a melancholy slowness. The pitiful is compounded upon the pitiful and the Romanticized exaltations of Anarchy are stripped away. The characters are ugly because they have to be ugly in the Anime. While the themes of the manga were pretty nihilistic the Anime makes it even more so. This is no lantern that attracts the moths to the light before burning them, it\u2019s a dimming candle.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf Aku no Hana the Manga is howling, Aku no Hana the Anime is throbbing. When you scream you feel the words leaving your lips. You feel the shock of relief and loudness. You\u2019re taken by yourself and for a moment leave yourself. Then afterwards your throat becomes hoarse and breathlessly you fall onto the floor wracked in pain. If instead you scream internally you feel the pain throb inside your heart. The feeling is a constant bassline that lingers not enough to overcome you but it repeats and repeats and reinforces itself. It never leaves. Reading the Manga allows for moments of brilliant carthasis; the Anime only allows you to release what is within you in gasps.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs a final verdict, do I like the adaptation? Not as much as I hoped. As a youth (as opposed to the lingering slumber of a later age) I like my works cathartic and overwhelming (a recommendation: watch All About Lily Chou Chou). Maybe part 2 will change that but for now the adaptation has yet to reach the special place the Manga has in my heart.\\n",

            "content": "The Aku no Hana anime is an acquired taste. It doesn't get enough recognition even though it could easily be called a masterpiece. It's definitely not an anime for all audiences, if you're a happy-go-lucky person who has never really experienced mental illness or turmoil, I can almost guarantee you will not understand it. But if you have struggled with depression, insecurities, dysphoria, etc. chances are you will relate heavily to the main character and perhaps the other characters in the anime.\r\nAku no Hana is one of those anime I can confidently say changed the way I see the world. It was an emotional rollercoaster and I could identify with many of the characters. Basically, it's is a slice of life anime, if you will, but with a psychological twist. Manipulation, depression, insecurity, and deception are major themes in Aku no Hana.  I found myself feeling pretty down in the dumps while watching it, but for me that was a sign of how incredibly immersive and realistic it was. Many scenes in Aku no Hana are moving and the type that you will probably remember vividly in 20 years. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was, to me, beautiful in a million ways. The animators used rotoscoping techniques, which means they hired actors to portray the main characters and filmed them, then traced over the live action film to make the anime. Many people disagree with this choice and the fact that they chose to make the characters so simplistic, but I personally enjoyed every second of it. I think the fact that the characters were so simplistic yet conveyed so much emotion is amazing. One of the main characters, Nakamura, was especially animated and every facial expression and action from her is a visual treat. I also have to give a shout to the director/storyboard artist/camera man? because the choice in camera angles is spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nThis review is already much longer than I planned, but I guess that's a sign that I have a lot of good things to say about the series.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR In my opinion, Aku no Hana is, in the most literal sense, an outstanding anime. If you're into fast-paced action sequences this...is definitely not the anime for you. But if you're into surreal, unsettling fiction, and unique animation, I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is by far the most controversial Anime of the Spring Season 2013, receiving by far the most hate and still having quite a big fanbase that does like it. Which one of the two sides arguing against each other is right?\r\nStory: The story of Aku no Hana takes place in Japan and revolves around Kasuga Takao, a quite normal boy, who goes to school, loves books (especially Baudelaire's \"Aku no Hana\") and has a crush on what is supposed to be the beauty of the class. One day he finds her sport clothes as he wants to get the book he accidentallyforgot in the classroom. He takes them out and hears a sound. In the hurry he just takes them and leaves quickly. Later on the psycho child of the class, being Nakamura Sawa tells him she saw him stealing the clothes. From then on she makes him do things that...well are kind of awkward.\\n\r\nThe whole story is really well executed and as far as I know follows the Manga quite well (didn't read it). It is really enjoyable to watch and it keeps unfolding in directions that the viewer doesn't expect to go to. It was a good story, but no masterpiece!\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are the shining point of the show. Even though the only ones that get any focus at all are the three main characters that everything revolves around, they are that good developed that that is no problem at all!\\n\r\nKasuga Takao seems to be one of the most normal students we've seen in a while in Anime. He likes books, has a crush on a girl and doesn't have any powers or things he is really good in. That is until he gets seen by Nakamura stealing the clothes and his life gets more and more messed up, just as his mind.\\n\r\nNakamura Sawa is a psycho. That's what everyone agrees upon. But it is a kind of psycho, that seems more pleasant than the \"I'll kill you all\" type, and rather is someone that is claims himself to be a deviant and searches for people that are the same as she is.\\n\r\nSaeki Nanako is the girl Kasuga has a crush on. She is a kind and good looking girl. I am not gonna talk a lot about her since I'd just end up spoiling.\\n\r\nOne must be said: The characters aren't likeable at all! It is hard to really like them, but that is the point the series wants you to be in. It's a point were you can look down on the show from a spot a lot higher, which makes every single character a lot more human and makes their built up incredibly well done.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well....the first thing that comes to your mind while watching Aku no Hana is the character design, which looks to say it in a polite way different. It is not a bad thing to make them look this way, since it is just another point that makes you feel more distant to the characters. The point were the art fails is the animation itself. The characters suffer from either to much movement at the same time and you just can't seem to concentrate because the characters look as if they would tremble without a reason or they don't move at all. The amount of still screens in this show is incredibly high and makes the show feel as if it was something based on an incredibly low budget, which it probably is. Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple. It mostly consists of tones getting louder and louder which creates a suspense that really fits the show as something dark and awkward. Aku no Hana has one of the most memorable endings ever created. A song only sung by a computer voice singing about the flowers of evil definitely is really creepy and fits the whole show really well. Just as the 4 Openings do. Every single one of them is weird in it's own way but still it fits the show so well that by now I really enjoy hearing them on their own. The voiceacting is nothing that really stands out. While it definitely is not horrible, it is nothing I do love.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have no idea how to score this...honestly! This show is nothing you will enjoy! However it is something that makes you want to shut down your browser and never open it again. At parts I couldn't watch an episode in a single sitting, but had to constantly pause it to calm down a bit, since my nerves were blank, but this is what makes this show so good!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is not a show everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. It is hard to watch and if you aren't into thrillers or that kind of stuff you really should stay away from this, but if you like them or if it even interests you a little, go watch this and make your own picture of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is an attack on our comfort zone, everyday life at its most mechanical dullness. The anime quests to find something new, something different that can set us apart from the oppression of the mundane life. The dread of seeing time pass without offering any excitement is a familiar feeling for everyone. Therefore this is an anime we can all relate at some point in our lives.\r\nThe main character Takao Kasuga starts with a desire to be different. He reads books not because he finds them interesting, but to fantasize that he is someone others cannot understand. He is pathetic.  He alsohas a crush on his classmate Nanako Saeki. He embarrassingly calls her his muse, his angel, his goddess. If the anime just ended with the first episode, he would forever stay a whiny, delusional idiot beyond salvation. However, thanks to his relation to Saeki and Sawa Nakamura, the third main character, he discovers a thing or two about himself. \\n\\n\r\nSawa Nakamura is the avatar of change. She flouts basic conventions and values of society. She has the role of a catalyst. Without her, wimpy Kasuga would never dare to stand for what he believes or even openly voice his thoughts. Nanako Saeki, the last main character, has her enigmatic side as well. Together these three undergo an experience they wouldn\u2019t do if they were alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is not beautiful. It adds realistic features to character designs which naturally make them uglier. But more facial details enrich the characters\u2019 emotional reactions. The background is also more detailed. Realistic details, such as cracks, and other imperfections of the real world emphasize the desire to break free from everyday life. \\n\\n\r\nI watched Aku no Hana because a friend said it was deep. Actually, there\u2019s nothing deep about it. What moved me in the end was how it honestly tries to face the dissatisfaction with our everyday life. It tries to find a way out, something better. But it does not find any meaningful solution. Avoiding ordinary everyday life doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a better life experience. Characters struggle to reach beyond the mundane but beyond does not promise a tangible alternative. Nevertheless Aku no Hana offers a great perspective to reflect on our everyday lives. That is why rather than enjoyment I felt uneasiness when watching. The anime was constantly attacking individuals\u2019 beliefs that they are unique. At the same time, it was not sure what its answer to the problem was.\\n",

Ever. \r\nIt was clear from the start that this show didn't have anything resembling a budget as proven as the terrible decision to rotoscope the entire show. It looks bad. It might have been \"done on purpose\" to add more \"depth\" to the show, but it still looks terrible. Then there's the pacing. Or lack there of. Most of the show is just nothing. Literally, nothing. There was an episode where about half of it was just walking. Nodialogue, no inner-monologue, nothing. It just felt like a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the characters. Ho man, the characters. I didn't like any of them. Not one. Was that the point? Probably, but it doesn't change the fact that none of these characters even interested me. Also, the fact that these kids are all in middle school really downplays the \"Drama\" that was put into the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show didn't impress me either. The ending in particular was particularly awful and none of the openings to the show really left an impact on me. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose most of the enjoyment comes from dissecting this pseudo-philosophical mess of a character study. It came off as pretentious with nothing really much to say. More of an insult than anything. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't really see how people enjoyed this show. It certainly wasn't pretty, didn't sound all that nice, and was super pretentious but had nothing to say. Kind of like a modern day hipster.",

            "content": "It is sad (if unsurprising) that this little gem is getting mixed reviews.\r\nUltimately, I find this show beautiful, exhilarating, funny and tragic at the same time. So I'm finding it difficult to answer the amorphous mass of misguided criticism that this is receiving.\r\nI wrote in my first review that this is a show about puberty. As such I found it furiously amusing. It is also a show about existentialism. Existentialism, however, needn't be philosophy. It could be\u2026\r\n(spoilers, any?)\r\n...a red haired girl with glasses, screaming, howling, devoured by an insatiable urge to project her fantasies onto the dull frame of a quiet, provincial town.\r\nNow, if youdon't see how this connects with existentialism, or why, or think that 'being a deviant' is a shallow, relative concept (relative to what? as if social norms weren't choke-full with universals), suit yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, anime is a very codified genre. It is subculture, not anarchy: so, if you haven't got it yet, I'll spell it out for you: Aku no Hana is atypical.\\n\\n\r\nSome label this 'psychological horror'. Well, yes and no. It does have more than a fair share of cringe moments but not the kind of psychological horror found in Lovecraft or Poe. The emphatic, heavy, atmospheric effects of Aku no Hana partake more of psychological tragi-comedy than psychological horror.\\n\r\nThe witty, original soundtrack provides good support for this.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows like a music score. Full of understatements maybe, but nothing illogical.\\n\\n\r\nOne reviewer wrote \"I apologize this wasn't moe enough for you\". So much for rotoscoping. The effect is jarring at first, but I'll still encourage you to give it another try. I found that it grew on me as the show progressed, as it manages to capture emotions in a creative, uniquely original way.\\n\\n\r\nI'll have a hard time convincing a purist anime audience that this is a masterpiece. So I'll just say this: if the screenshots don't put you off watch the first 5 minutes of ep 1. Thanks.",

            "content": "Sometimes, a little originality is a good aspect for an anime as it catches the watcher's attention and add a hint of unique to the anime. But if originality is used poorly, it could lead to a failure of a masterpiece. Aku no Hana,unluckily, is one of those who did not manage to use its originality well.\r\nStory:4/10\r\nThe story of Aku no Hana is one that most people can relate to: it is about a person who committed a sin and living with it for the rest of his life. This,however, does not say that Aku no Hana is relatable. The sin that the main charactercommitted is stealing his crush's gym clothes and the regretting it. This already make it hard to relate to. And what more, throughout the show, we were constantly reminded that the main character is a 'deviant' or 'pervert' and that puts us off the thought of relating us to him as we do not want to be called a 'deviant' or a 'hentai' whether we are one or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also loses its intention of being a dark anime to a more romance-centic anime, but it would be fine if they forgot the dark theme altogether, but they didn't, throughout the romance scenes, you would still have this uncomfortableness and sinisterness around you, even when it is totally unnecessary and ruins the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe general plot goes like this:\\n\\n\r\nOur main male character, the one who committed the sin, was blackmailed by a girl who saw him committing the sin. And the male protagonist hate her for blackmailing him and resents her, wanting a way out of her torment. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so far so good, everything feels dark and sinister.\\n\\n\r\n*MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT*   \\n\\n\r\nThen the male protagonist starts to develop feelings for the sadistic girl who was making him do all sorts of perverted actions and verbally abusing not only him, but his crush as well. The male protagonist then realises that he need to abandon his crush for the sadistic girl and admits all the verbal abuse such as 'deviant' or 'pervert' and starts to live with it. Accepting it as a part of his life. \\n\\n\r\n...What...The...F.....\\n\\n\r\nSo the plot is about a guy who gets released from his sin by accepting his personality as a masochist, enjoying being tormented and bullied.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why originality should be contained.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the originality also failed. After seeing the rotoscoping used in this anime, I thought to myself 'Could they have just used a normal anime style?'. The answer that came to me was 'No'. But that is not to say that rotoscoping is allowed. Normal anime style does not mix with the dark tone that the director tried to express. However, they turned to rotoscope, a time-consuming technique, for a anime series that lasted for 13 episode. There are many places that the art style just felt out of place and blurry and chaotic when it shouldn't be. And when it should be chaotic with fluid movement, due to the limitations of rotoscopes and time, the animation seems to be frozen or 'lagging'. \\n\\n\r\nThe art did intrigue me for the first two episodes but without a good plot, the art seems to fail as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only place where Aku no Hana deserve a praise, its opening is catchy and I often find myself humming it and the ending is genuinely creepy and sinister- just like the show intended to be. When the ending came up in the first episode, it immediately had me crawling in to a ball. Because it just have that same dark tone and evil sound to it as the scene that the anime was trying to cover. But then due to the anime lacking consistency in its romance and dark plots, some episodes the song ruins the romance mood or the song just loses its purpose at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n*Yet another spoiler alert*\\n\\n\r\nLet me make a tick list of the characters and their personalities:\\n\\n\r\nA masochistic male who abandons his love for a person who will abuse him for the rest of his life? Check.\\n\\n\r\nA anti-social, sadistic female who acts like a thug but says philosophical things that only the male protagonist understands? Check.\\n\\n\r\nAn all-good female who had her sports bag stolen from her by a person who had a crush on her. But then comes to terms to love him and forgive him ONLY to be ditched in the last second by some thug that treats your boyfriend badly? Check.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does not follow the common logic at all. The male protagonist could have escaped the chains of torment that the sadist girl had on him on several places but instead, he succumbs to the torture and abandons the crush.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:4/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, although some people praise this as a masterpiece for its originality, I just think that people shouldn't over look other things and let originality cloud their judgement.",

            "content": "This anime is unlike anything you have seen or will be likely to ever see. It's definitely weird and really far out there, but at the same time it's extremely realistic. I would categorize this as a psychological slice of life anime. Pretty weird combination, but this anime is something truly unique. I will go ahead and say this now, alot of people that watch this will probably drop it and say that it sucks, I can't really blame you for that. This anime isn't meant to be watched by everyone, it appeals to a certain, specific audience that doesn't have many people in it.Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but don't talk about something you know nothing about.\\n\\n\r\nStory- The story and characters are what make this anime. The basis of the story isn't anything spectacular, anyone could come up with the idea of someone with social issues that's a pervert and he has to deal with that while dealing with two different girls. What makes the story in aku no hana unique though it what it does with that basis and how it manipulates that basis and makes it into something that is truly unique. It sounds like a typical harem anime, but it's definitely not. It fits the description of psychological alot better. The story is a very slow burning one, the entire anime takes place in just under two months or so, there are 5 and 10 minute scenes of people just walking down the road, but it's alot more than that. It's slow burning, but very well paced. \\n\r\n     You don't ever feel like you're missing out on any information or that anything is being skipped, everything seems to just fall in place. It might be a little extreme or weird at certain points in the story, but that's what it's about. It's about someone that is weird, someone that is a social outcast, it's about his journey to becoming a normal person, or so that's how it seems. For an anime with such a simple theme it has quite a few twists and turns and I was always wondering what was going to happen next. It honestly surprised me because I thought it would be straightforward and rather boring. It's a fantastic story, my only complaint about it would be that it does have a semi-cliffhanger to it, but it's implied at the end that there is going to be a second season, or \"Part 2\".\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art for this anime is a tricky one. On one hand it's a very unique and interesting art style that I personally love, on the other hand there are some parts where they're talking and the lip syncing isn't exactly right, or they're talking and they have no face.  This might have been something intentional, but I don't really like it. It's still a very unique art style though, some people will love it, and some will hate it.\\n\\n\r\nSound- For me the sound was tricky aswell. I liked the intro songs themselves, but they feel out of place for the tone of the anime. It brought me out of that immersion everytime it played and wasn't really fitted for the anime in my opinion. The ending songs were amazing though. It's a very creepy and fitting song for the anime, one of the best ending songs i've ever heard in fact. As for the ambient sounds and noises they are spot on aswell. It gives the anime a very creepy undertone and really adds to the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters and story are the best things about aku no hana. There are 3 main characters, all of which are really well designed. Kasuga considers himself someone that is unique and almost looks down upon other people for not understand what he understands. In a way he is a bit arrogant. He is also a social outcast, he only has a few friends, which they don't seem that close to begin with, but everything changes when he's caught sniffing a girls gym uniform. The girls uniform he was sniffing is saekis. \\n\r\n    She's another main character. She's a bit of your stereotypical popular girl, except that she's never had a boyfriend and is also unique in her own ways. The last and final main character is nanako. She is the one that catches kasuga sniffing saekis gym clothes. She's a pervert and outcast, she also causes alot of trouble around school. She's in the same boat as kasuga. She's extremely weird, but her side of the story goes alot deeper beyond just being weird. They all have great interactions with each other, whether it be good or bad. I personally think that they are all fantastically designed characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- They enjoyment part is something that's tough. Personally I really enjoyed it. I was enthralled by the story and atmosphere of it all, I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next. At the same time I can easily see a ton of people not enjoying it, or even finishing it. It's something that you will just have to try and see if you like, hopefully my review helps you decide whether or not it's something that you will enjoy or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall I think this is a spectacular anime. Just because alot of people don't like it doesn't mean that it's a bad anime and vice versa. Fundamentally it is a very well designed anime that I don't think deserves to be this low on the rankings. It's understandable why it is this low, it still doesn't deserve it though. If you're someone that enjoys very artistic animes or just artistic stuff in general I can recommend this to you. If you're anyone else I can't recommend this to you. It's a tough anime to write about simply because of the way it is, but I think it's something worth writing and talking about, it's a fantastic anime.",

            "content": "I am truly surprised by how low the score is. I am usually rating way lower then most of the rating, however I do find the average rating of this Anime to be low. \r\nYes, it is a 5. But it is a strong 5 and would very likely become a 6 someday. This means that It is better then some of your more celebrated shows, like Accel world, Angel Beats, Guilty Crown, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, Sacred Seven. \r\nso now you might be wondering why am I award a Five, right? as usual, I am going to defend my rating and my POV, with SPOILERSALERT. \\n\\n\r\nfor me, the biggest flaw of the show lies in a few aspect. First and foremost, the art. I am not happy about the art not ONLY because it is horrifyingly bad, but also how unnecessary the producer would think their gimmicky \"revolutionizing\" ideas would pay off. It still amazes me that how someone would think these gimmicky ideas would sale, especially nowadays, you have got to have MOE, HAREM or some FIERCE FIGHT to sale (peaking at Sword Art Online). Playing Gimmicky doesn't and would NEVER work. \\n\\n\r\nbesides the Gimmicks, the still motions of scenes, or the landscapes are actually AMAZING to say the least: In detailed, stylish, realistic and generally unique. The character's arts, however, are a complete mess. there are NO shadows when a character had her/his facial expression. It was beyond the level of Unique or even style - it is really unacceptable at times. \\n\\n\r\nalso, consider how slow pace this show is, it is really hard for me to give the show credits. there are a incredible amount of time that was spend on internal dialogues, Monologues, reading Baudelaire. I am not saying I don't like Baudelaire - In fact, I like reading poems. It is just not the right thing to do in an anime like this. Think about this: What would you think if you buy your ticket to watch an hour show, and the actor's been reading and reciting Shakespeare's sonnets with a mere linkage with the show? if you are not sleeping, congrats. you are a true hipster.\\n\\n\r\nso now you've got two things going AGAINST the show. it doesn't seem to be a 5 at all, right? \\n\\n\r\nMy first defend for a 5 is the plot. despite the plot is slow-paced, it really got into the detail thought of the character. it builds some of the more memorable character of the season, and you might be amazed how a total of 3 people can create such an intense drama. It would be easy to sum up their relationship: Nakamura holds the secret of Kasuga. Kasuga Likes Nanako. The secret would blown up the relationship between Nanako and Kasuga and Kasuga's doing whatever he can to prevent the leak. I am trying to keep the secret - but I would have to say it is a Naive, or even a silly secret that could have been resolved since the second episode. \\n\\n\r\nI am not done with proving my scores yet. I do agree that the plot of this thing is sometimes silly and Naive, but when you add the personality we had into the mix, everything seems to run smoothly. Since Kasuga is always doubting himself and suspecting the others, even though he can get over and handle the secret in many ways, he can't: not because he didn't, but because he was doubting himself and suspecting the others of knowing the secret. such kinds of \"doubt\" were vastly available upon Kasuga's development as a character, and you can find lots of good example showing how he doubts the world and his friends, even Nanako at times. \\n\\n\r\nNakamura could also been summarized as someone that loves to watch drama. she's not interest in interferring any of Kasuga's business. however, she believes that everyone had hidden their true identity - which was evil behind them. She attempts to \"strip off your mask\" and does actually no harm to the people around her......that is, upon now. Nanako is the simple \"girl-next-door\" kind of character that is an obedient student. she does no harm as well......at least upon the airing of the sixth show. I am NOT trying to suggest anything, 'cause I actually have no idea, just thinking and hoping my predictions would come true.\\n\\n\r\nTo add on, the Sounds of this show is perhaps not the most thrilling sounds that you've ever got, but it is special. Ambient/Drone/Minimal music were rarely used as anime soundtracks; from what I remember, Lain was one the shows that I watch that used some. still, considering how good this anime complements with the peaceful, sometimes intriguing Drone Sound, would probably be a pleasure to many music fans. \\n\\n\r\nfurther more, their opening and ending is really unique. I am not a fan of the opening track, but I do appreciate they change their lyrics every time they choose a different protagonist to sing. the new lyrics certainly complement and suits the character well. the Ending was actually a real BLAST for me. despite it is Pop, it comes with an arrangement featuring orchestra and Glitch elements on their vocal that these things actually goes well together. The vocals sound so much like a Vocaloid that freaks me out the first time. The auto-tuning only adds to the creepiness of the song, which makes it stands out and unique among the general anime song. It might be somehow inappropriate for me to do a review base on the TV version, but I think these elements should be accurate when the full version's out.\\n\\n\r\nConsider how special this show is, it might appeal to someone who enjoys dark humor and twisted fantasies. 2ch had a slang called \"\u72ec\u7537\" (Dokuo). that means males that were single and can't social well with females. such terms were usually equivalent to Low self esteem/Nerd/geek/Virgin, and sometimes Otaku. Understanding that kind of culture will kind of help you to understand and appreciate how interesting and how \"strange\" it is for this show to happen. I am probably one of those \"Dokuo\" and I could only jealously watch the show every week. But well, what can you complain? It's a good life, and you've got a show that is great - At least it has some kind of logic and a neat portrait of characters, plot-wise and character-wise. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are still not convinced, you just can't get used to the art, skip it then. It is not that big of a deal. But please, don't call this as \"bad\" - this is certain not the all time classics and not one of the year top 5s, but watching and saying \"YES\" to this show is nothing to be ashamed of, since this is not that bad of an anime either. If you still feel like complaining, you've got loads Harem acts waiting for you to get their ass kicked - now MOVE and press ALT+F4. \\n\\n\r\n5.5.",

            "content": "Aku No Hana\r\nSomething so painful shouldn't be enjoyable...\r\nStory: (7)\r\nCentered around Kasuga Takao, a boy who reads books, he likes this girl at school Saeki Nanako. One day she leaves behind her gym clothes, Takao takes them without a moments thought, the following day the rumour around school is a \"pervert\" stole Saeki Nanako gym clothes, Takao is nervous because if she finds out he stole them, the goal he wants to be loved by will hate him. But if he destroys the clothes no one will know? well he thinks that until another girl in his class Nakamura Sawa saw him.\r\nOverall, the Story is good,My slight issue is that after this initial plot it doesn't really evolve much and simply relies on the relationship(s) between the character(s) to pull Aku No Hana to the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (6)\\n\\n\r\nBackdrops in this series are really nice i have to say that first because the next is a very debatable topic, one that doesn't house a right answer, one that is subjective and thus creates issues. \\n\\n\r\nThe style behind Aku No Hana is done via \"rotoscoping\" This method pretty much is drawing over a real life film. The problem is there is far too many times it feels rather patchy and not that great, For example the distancing till when someone has features, Some key scenes lack any facial features which simply shouldn't happen. secondly at points when the characters are running or quick movement the animations feel laggy which felt sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nLast negative is that the Art Style as it's being drawn or animated over Real Life people they carry the proportions of that, issue with doing this is characters are more rounded and look \"Fatter\" this can be rather worrying if you're fan of the manga because key characters don't look right, For example  one of the main characters Saeki looks fatter and less attractive than what she does in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The art will usually be something you love or loathe, for me it's in the middle, i can understand the \"Strange\" vibe it gave the series but i simply don't think it was worth the risk.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8)\\n\\n\r\nAlways a tough category to mark, The OP/ED Are good enough i'm paticually a fan of the outro to ED they use for every episode, really fit the strange and crazy vibe this series has. The voices are really suiting to who they represent, Saeki having a delicate, cute voice and Nakamura having a harsh and scratchy tone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8)\\n\\n\r\nNakamura Sawa - She is the driving force the catalyst for this series, An Incredibly strange individual who during the course of the series just intensifies her behavior, My overall view is she is looking for someone like her, completely odd, crazy, a deviant. She believes Takao is one, the way she manipulates and blackmails him is tough to watch, but what makes her the person you tend to fear at points rather than love.\\n\\n\r\nKasuga Takao - His character development is huge, As many people say \"Never trust the quiet ones\" and this quite resides in Takao, At first shy and what you can see from their on out is how his relationship (s) change and shape him, maybe some may say releases a side of him no one has seen, one he has kept hidden until the right person/people come along who he trusts to show it to.\\n\\n\r\nSaeki Nanako - Her development is good too  watch too, Takao puts her up on this peddle-stall and the side he see's is the ever loving/caring side who she truly is, But during the series you see that demeanor change slightly, she bares the stresses and strains a grown up relationship can create, it effects her and this is shown rather well during the later parts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the development of the characters is what makes this series progress, after the initial story not much happens and the characters have to drag Aku No Hana to the finishing line of 13 Episodes. \\n\\n\r\nKasuga Takao and Saeki Nanako arc nearer the end really didn't make any sense and brought this section's ratings down a bit. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2) During (8) After \\n\\n\r\nWhy have i given 2 scores? Well Aku No Hana is one of the most intense, strange series i have watched this resorted in many nervous episodes where it was at times painful to view what was happening, I've not had that feeling where i really didn't enjoy it while watching because of how tense and tough to watch it was, but after it's done and i had time to reflect that's when you see the great side to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo what i've done is - the during and after to get the final score of 6, It's tough viewing don't get me wrong but it's rather enjoyable is a strange way as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nAku No Hana as my header described as \"Something so painful shouldn't be enjoyable\" this term sums up this show perfectly, Each episode was incredibly tough to view, Tense,Nervous,Fear were a handful of feelings i felt during the season, But on the flip side it was enjoyable, Kinda of like how Horror films are scary and we hate being scared, but for something to be able to MAKE us scared we appreciate the series/film for that. Aku no Hana is the same for me. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the story, it does feel like it lacked a direction, the pacing at times were slow to show off the rotoscoping scenes which in my eyes were a mixed bag. The character development was great but on the other hand what happened between them didn't make sense in many places and even frustrated me (How Takao treats Saeki) really annoyed me, and all these negatives i have said during the review does leave a sour taste in my mouth over Aku No Hana..... It's something i know annoyed me, made it sometimes tough to even view, but i appreciated the series, It's far from being perfect but it's good in my eyes and worth your time watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe end hints at \"End Of Season One\" so that would suggest there will be a S2, I Hope this is the case because i feel the series needs it with how it finished S1.",

            "content": "This  by director Nagahama Hiroshi, known for his masterpiece \"Mushishi\", is a very authorial director in his works, I say he does not usually adapt an  in a normal way, always likes to have a little of his name in the work, which most of the time, is great, since normally Nagahama Hiroshi is an excellent director.\r\nAku no Hana was the  in which Hiroshi put everything he wanted in his authorial pretext, creating a very different work from the , in which the work was adapted.\r\nIn a script, Aku no Hana perfectly follows the , so do not expect great changes inthe adaptation of the work of Shuuzou Oshimi, the ka that gave life to this work.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in a matter of aesthetics, the  impresses a lot (and chases away some) due to using a technique that is no longer so used in the animation industry. This technique is called \"Rotoscopy,\" an animation technique that consists of filming certain scenes with real people and going overboard, redesigned footage of the footage. This technique was widely used in the 30-60 years for animations, mostly from Disney, since that's how they made Snow White.\\n\\n\r\nNowadays, few projects have this kind of animation, nowadays are used softwares that convert the footage to animation automatically and that is how Aku no Hana was made.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is simply strange, even in his , always maintains this air of pure strangeness, as if Aku no Hana was a kind of worm that has never been seen before and your  can pass this same strangeness perfectly through the Rotoscopia used in the entire  in the characters. The scenarios, on the other hand are paintings in the common style, with dry, dead plants or narrow streets, in darker shades and gray to reflect this feeling of the dry, lifeless city, where all are equal, then annoying, presented by the characters of the  This has a constant change, in moments that the protagonist is happier, in more relaxed moments, the scenarios are cleared of sunshine and the green of plants. I would say that is the high point of the  production.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to highlight in the production, once again to fill us with a haunting, strange and bizarre climate is the soundtrack which are usually just small, sharp guitar notes and even low piano notes, mostly outside the tone. The sound composition is extremely well placed, especially in episode 8 where we see what these little sounds can do to us.\\n\\n\r\nAlready to talk about the characters, although they do not have much charisma, their psychological is well approached and developed throughout the work. It's difficult to know what's really going on in the characters' heads, since the  does not deliver what the characters are thinking in a simple way, it's up to you to interpret each one's message and find out for yourself what they actually are. Although the end of the work is better to understand from the dialogues presented, but overall it is very interesting to create your theory convincingly to understand their thoughts, especially Nakamura who is the most interesting character of the work in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have the cinematography done by the director, which is excellent and consistent throughout entire series. Several camera moves that are used to keep us away, in a way, from the characters to create an atmosphere to feel unstable to all the events of the work. This distance is usually used in long, silent, well-placed planes to make us reflect during this moment of silence.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing Aku no Hana really fails, not because of the actors, but is something that comes from the  that makes total sense within the premise of the work, is the age of the characters that both in the  and in the  have something in around 13-14 years, however, as the actors are older, makes it look like they have something around 16-17 years old. This is a problem? No, in fact, but it is something more realistic in the concept of the work to be at that age of 13-14 years, because this would make the attitudes over the  more common in our society, which is not due to when we are older due to characters are no longer experiencing the heaviest period of puberty, as he said is not a problem so serious, but it makes it difficult to immerse in the work when the characters take actions that are not up to the standard of their age.\\n\\n\r\nAnother \"problem\" is the work does not have an end, since they only adapted the first part of the  and unfortunately, the  was a total failure with regard to sales, but obviously, this is not fault of the  at all but rather of that community of otakus that does not understand what is a good work of truth.\\n\\n\r\nWell, Aku no Hana is an excellent work that unfortunately did not have the success it deserved from  fanboys, due to its aesthetics and being too underestimated by the otakus, and certainly deserved much more success than it had.",

            "content": "After some thought I decided to do a short spoiler free review of Aku no Hana because I really do not want people to dismiss this anime!\r\nIt's a great and twisted psychological anime. The realism and the tension that is constantly in the atmosphere of this anime is brilliant. The painful awkwardness of the character Kasuga and the weird behaviour of Nakamura I really liked. Their very different behaviours were a good combination along with the other main character Saeki who gives off what is seemingly a normal and innocent vibe.\r\nYes, there are scenes that are a few minutes long which could be cut downand reduced to only a few seconds long but they would just not have the same effect if they were not real time. It would ruin the strange and tense atmosphere of the anime. It is an anime set in everyday run down, miserable looking town with a very eerie feeling about it. The slowness is a really important part of the setting. However, I admit the slow pacing can be somewhat frustrating at times. It wasn't too bad though. I'm the kind of person who is really fussy when it comes to pacing and it's always one of my biggest complaints about any anime but if someone like me was fine with it then you should be too.\\n\\n\r\nThe rotoscope animation is actually perfect and aids the psychological element of the anime. It makes it a little more life like in appearance and also much different in appearance compared to the typical anime which Aku no Hana certainly is not. Without the rotoscope the anime wouldn't be the same at all. Those who refuse to watch it because of the 'ugly' animation are childish. You are really missing out on a unique and intriguing anime by rejecting Aku no Hana due to its appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe music used is also very different to the average anime soundtrack. It is really quirky and odd like everything else within this anime. Don't be expecting the typical J-pop/rock artist/band kind of songs for the OP and ED. The ED in particular is great but probably not something you would have on you iPod. I loved Aku no Hana's soundtrack though because it adds to the overall eerie feeling the anime gives off. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil anything but I must warn you that this anime can be a little disturbing. Some may find it too weird. It is a psychological anime though! I know Aku no Hana may be an acquired taste but if you are sick of the normal slice of life school romance then check out the great but twisted Aku no Hana.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you watch this anime then prepare for an ending that does not resolve anything. The final episode just gives us a glimpse of what is to come to persuade you to go and read the manga. I myself have started to read the manga (the manga is great!) because this anime has left me intrigued. I think it is a real shame that it will most likely never get a second season due to its lack of popularity though.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Aku no Hana to those who fancy something a little bit different!\\n\\n\r\nI originally laughed at the screenshots (Nakamura's derp face and the manly looking girl!) like many others but a week after episode 1 aired I started watching. I expected to hate it but I didn't. I admit it took several episodes to get into but after that I really looked forward to watching it every week. It's definitely one of those anime you should at least check out an episode or two at some point. It taught me not to judge an anime by its animation style immediately. Sometimes it takes a while to warm to something new!  8/10",

            "content": "At first this show may seem rather unappealing, and I get why, but the subject matter in itself was a rather interesting watch, and therefore I'd suggest not preemptively judging it before you've given it a chance.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story for Flowers of Evil is somewhat simple. It focuses on more mundane events, blown to the proportion of how you'd expect a teenager to react. This does add a sense of realism (along with the animation style), that aids the atmospheric tension of the show. It is rather slow due to this, so some may find it rather boring.\r\n7/10\r\nArt:\r\nIt doesn't surprise me that many people dislike thefact that Flowers of Evil used rotoscoping as its animation. The animation and art-style does come off as rather bland most of the time, except for a few exceptions in the latter portion of the show. I do feel this animation does fit the atmosphere, however, so it didn't really bother me much.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFlowers of Evil's soundtrack was pretty good. It had an eerie tinge to it, that added to the show's atmosphere, giving it that feeling of oncoming anxiety. There were moments where the soundtrack alone was enough to create this feeling of uneasiness.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHaving complex characters is something that can aid psychological series greatly, and Flowers of Evil both nails and fails at it. My biggest issues are with the main protagonist and his rationalizations -- there were times where I just couldn't understand his way of thinking, since there was an obvious way out of his situation. Sure, you could blame it on the character's personality, but that's a rather weak excuse, as most of the time it seems like the only reason he didn't take the obvious route out, was to drive the plot in a specific direction. Nakamura on the other hand is a very hard character to understand, but that's what makes her so interesting. You somewhat understand her character a bit more as the series progresses, although never to the point where I felt like you could fully comprehend her thought processes. I didn't have much of a problem with the other side characters either.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall Thoughts (7/10):\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an atmospheric show, and don't mind it focusing on more mundane events, I'd recommend giving Flowers of Evil a watch. It's only 13 episodes, so it's a rather short series, and if you're a fan of the psychological genre I think it's be something you'll enjoy.",

            "content": "Flowers of Evil seems to stand outside anime, looking at it suspiciously, as it does its own thing. To be fair, it does exist within the same universe; this isn\u2019t some avant-garde work that has nothing in common with it. But what\u2019s refreshing about this series is how it takes the stock elements of a school series and then constantly corrupts them, makes them perverse. If Flowers of Evil doesn\u2019t qualify as an all-out attack on the institution of the school anime, it\u2019s simply because it\u2019s still a part of that genre. Whereas before the emotions of characters have been normal, cute ones about growingup and first loves; now, everything that bubbles to the surface is nasty and dark. Instead of celebrating the \u201cmono no aware\u201d of youth or whatever, it sets out to corrupt that image through the subversion of school anime archetypes and its aesthetic daring (in its pacing and animation).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story as done in another manner could seem like the beginning of a fun ecchi adventure. Kasuga has a crush on Saeki. One day he feels overwhelmed by his feelings and steals her gym uniform. However, Nakamura, a supremely anti-social classmate, catches him, and they enter into a contract together so his secret won\u2019t be revealed. Taken at face level, that plot description could head into many directions, and be approached/portrayed in many different ways. What\u2019s important is that this is a stock situation that can be molded into basically anything. This is a School Anime Template.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn Flowers of Evil, we get a clinic on genre deconstruction. All the elements that you\u2019re familiar with, that you might latch on to, are either missing or deployed in a way that pushes them out of our comfort zones. You\u2019re used to fun sidekicks who liven up the more dramatic moments? Our hero\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d is a non-entity who constantly annoys, picks on, or ignores Kasuga. You\u2019re used to the most popular girl being basically perfect and somehow still having a crush on loser protagonist? Our hero\u2019s \u201cdream girl\u201d is subjected to the madonna-whore complex, and reveals all her worst insecurities and comes out as pathetic as everyone else. You want slice of life trademarks such as the empty classroom after school, the walk home, roll call? Every single one of those is treated mundanely and shown in their utter banality (the 1st episode is basically all about this). You want crushes, some drama, something cute that goes down easy? Look somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nWhile that deconstruction is admirable and interesting, Flowers of Evil\u2019s status as a masterpiece resides in its aesthetics. After a ton of rotoscope jokes, what we are left with is the work itself. Why is the aesthetic so essential to the effects of Flowers of Evil? I believe it\u2019s another attempt by the creators to take what is clich\u00e9 and obvious and de-familiarize it. You\u2019ve seen shows with these same plot elements, but you haven\u2019t seen it done this way. I believe that as anime fans, we\u2019ve become used to certain things out of series, not only tonally, but also aesthetically. So, when something comes along that upends all the rules and conventions that we\u2019re used to, it feels strange.\\n\\n\r\nFlowers of Evil\u2019s pacing is undeniably slow when compared to other Spring 2013 shows. However, I think most of the artistic forebears of this show aren\u2019t to be found in anime, but, rather, Japanese live-action films such as Harmful Insect, All About Lily Chou-Chou or Nobody Knows. These are works that can be both understated and yet ferocious. Chou-Chou in particular is both incredibly serious and yet intensely poetic and often dreamlike, which are adjectives that can apply to Flowers of Evil as well. Time and time again the show will return to basic setups and images throughout the series, like they\u2019re some kind of refrain, as it takes a break from the main narrative action. They often highlight the decaying nature of the town where the protagonists live in, and that seems to mirror the moral state of the characters. But, even then, I don\u2019t feel this is an impossibly slow show \u2013 every episode is filled with incident, drama, even small bits of humor. Even the ostensible \u201cslow\u201d parts are not meant to be taken at face value, they\u2019re valuable artistic choices. The slow walk home at the start of episode 8 is just as much of a bravura moment as the classroom freakout of episode 7. It\u2019s beautiful and hypnotic in a way that most anime wouldn\u2019t even dare. But it\u2019s an absolutely essential moment: both characters need that space, that silence, to register what they\u2019ve done. What I hope comes across is that the deliberate pacing isn\u2019t there because the studio somehow failed to make it entertaining; it\u2019s a valid choice for a certain mood and tone.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sea of homogenous anime, Flowers of Evil was always going to stand out. Like a sore thumb, it\u2019s a reminder that just because it\u2019s anime, it doesn\u2019t have to be cute or moe or whatever else is popular right now. But it isn\u2019t ugly. This is ultimately my biggest problem with the reception that this show has gotten. Not once did I find the rotoscoping to be ugly or dull or unimaginative. Aesthetically, this show is actually quite restrained. Its animation is mostly committed to capturing the mundane banality of the character\u2019s life \u2013 empty city streets, darkened rooms, ambiguous facial expressions. The series\u2019 genius is that it saves its stylistic coups; episode 7\u2019s classroom freakout is so powerful because it comes as a release after episode after episode of restraint.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s possible that Flowers of Evil doesn\u2019t add up to much in the final analysis. Is there a point to all this angst and creepiness outside of the subversion that I\u2019ve outlined? It\u2019s hard to tell. There are certain thematic strands that are explored throughout, but that might be a topic for another post. What\u2019s certain is that a series like this in the current 2013 anime climate is an anomaly and its effects are powerful and singular enough to merit close analysis (not rash dismissal). Love it or hate it, Flowers of Evil has a way of getting under your skin.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Aku no Hana seems to be one of the most controvertial ones, that ever got published. First of all, the anime takes action in a world that we can easily put ourselves in, it's just realistic. Unlike all the other school-type animes. Everything is kept real, even characters and their purely natural development as the situation in the anime progresses. Even though not having a very imaginative or interesting plot, the presentation of it will keep you going through it (what makes the plot unpredictable)\r\nWhole series is focues around Kasuga Takao - boy who loves reading books, even those from outside Japan, especially Les Fleursdu Mal. Basically Baudelaire was a exiled poet, his poetry was about sins and how people cant resist doing wrong things. He claims he is better than other people for reading that.\\n\r\nHis character is a mindless puppet, he's not even half intereting when you look at it, and then he develops, in a quite opposite way where he was at first (he does that with help of the other main character Nakamura Sawa)\\n\r\n- And lastly we meet another important character Saeki, a person that Takao shows attraction for, and is the main problem in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nFirst of all, I wouldnt recommend this anime to everybody, it's a rather different experience. If you dont enjoy unattractive characters or slow progress with the plot, then well better don't watch it, you will sleep more. Second of all, what I reckon is (but I guess some people might not agree with it) that people not familiar with japanese culture and how social and sexual life works there wont be able to enjoy, just because of lack of knowledge about it, main problem is a problem that only japanese culture has in store and only they will suffer from such situations.\\n\r\nBUT LETS GET INTO IT\\n\r\nThe atmosphere in this anime is different, as you can clearly see from the animation way of going, and the whole art style. Here we will enjoy minimalistic dialogues (mostly even monologues, thoughts) with none or tiny amout of music. This anime will purely stand on sound effects of the background they are at, which makes you wanna listen to it closely.\\n\r\nWhat this anime basically makes is a atmosphere of mystery and an atmosphere of thoughtfulness, yes thats the word. Problem, even though being a quite simple and common one in the japanese standards is greatly presented (as I said before this series is about presentation not plot itself) \\n\r\nBut basically it's slow and gives you time to think about the whole situation, or just giving you time to put youself in their place.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nWell let me repeat myself, it's different. The background drawing is basically static, while all the characters and things they touch are \"active\". Not only that, the artstyle on the very characters is unique, they look like theyve been rendered into the anime. Overall the whole anime is drawn pretty nicely, and I personally like the artstyle. Allthough when you look at their faces, they seem to be missing their noses.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nWell as mentioned earlier, music part is small in this one. I don't really like the opening, BUT the ending is superb it is creepy and always starts before the credits in great moments what builds more tension. \\n\r\nBut let's focus more on voiceacting, coz this is what's important. Voice acting gives more to realism in this case. You can hear that actors are chosen wisely every and single one of them (even for those characters that are secondary). They surely made the effort to make what's the best from these few senteces talked through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE: \\n\r\nPersonally I liked the storyline, as I was saying the plot is understandable for those with knowledge of japanese culture. It's not very interesting, but the presentation of it is cool. Also the development of main characters is great, how they change and develop into an entirely different person, which is still logical and makes sense from the beggining till the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nIn conclusion Im just gonna that this anime is one of the best in it's year. Its unique, different and controvertial. Therfore I can't recommend that to everybody and Im sure that most people won't enjoy it. Therefore for those who are fans of slow and more realistic atmospehere, well go on. Give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/avdQngBeHPM\\n",

            "content": "So\u2026 finally after a long time I watched an ongoing anime. It\u2019s directed\r\nby Hiroshi Nagahama (creator of Mushishi and Detroit Metal City). I had high\r\nexpectations from this series. With 2 episodes yet to be released online, I don\u2019t\r\nthink I have been let down. What I say hereafter will be based only on the\r\nfirst 11 episodes.\r\nAnimation and art: The animation is like real life humans traced\r\nin 2D. When they are in a distance it\u2019s just the rough outline, no eyes, no\r\nnose, no mouth\u2026 just the outline of the figure. The backgrounds are really\r\ngorgeous, the landscapes too.\r\nSoundtrack: The series has very little background music, mostly\r\nmelancholic piano pieces.In many scenes there is no music at all, just plain\\n\r\nsilence and it adds to the eeriness of the atmosphere\u2026 something that you will appreciate\\n\r\nif you like the series. The opening theme was a regular one, okay and good at\\n\r\nits best. But the ending theme is discordant. It\u2019s more like a recitation than\\n\r\na song. It is bound to catch your attention.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Only three characters develop over the series. Takao,\\n\r\nthe male protagonist, is first seen as a shy character. He literally worships\\n\r\nSaeki, the class idol, as his angel. As the series progresses he is manipulated\\n\r\nby Nakamura, the class outcast, after she witnesses Takao stealing Saeki\u2019s gym\\n\r\nclothes. For the first 11 episodes that I watched, Saeki came across as a good\\n\r\nhearted individual who reciprocates Takao\u2019s feelings. Saeki doesn\u2019t seem to be\\n\r\nthat weak at heart as the series develops. Takao switched over from a shy\\n\r\ncharacter and bloomed into the \u201cevil flower\u201d. He doesn\u2019t think he belongs to\\n\r\nthe same world as the rest of the ignorant people in the town. The class\\n\r\nvandalism, his awakening to his inner self after being manipulated by Nakamura\u2026\\n\r\nit all makes sense somehow. It\u2019s different from being bullied in a way. (At one\\n\r\npoint of time I thought he\u2019d get raped by a girl but that didn\u2019t happen). His\\n\r\npreferences and feelings change over time. But the character that made the\\n\r\ndeepest impression was Nakamura. The way she blackmails Takao, forces him into\\n\r\nfacing his \u201cdeviant\u201d (though the Japanese audio said \u201cHentai\u201d) self is quite\\n\r\nremarkable. After a long time in an anime I found a character that I thought\\n\r\nwas screwed up in the head like crazy and I would give the world to stay away\\n\r\nfrom her and her mind games. She is one of a kind. What interested me in her\\n\r\nwas her persistence and her saying \u201cTake me beyond that hill\u201d. With 2 more\\n\r\nepisodes to go I am really keeping my fingers crossed to witness how to\\n\r\ncharacter development finally turns out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I like the series. It is seriously absolutely wonderfully\\n\r\nslow paced. It goes deep down into psychology and its aspects of romance. There\\n\r\nare no demons other than the ones in your heart; there is no action, no guns,\\n\r\nno bombs\u2026 just a battle raging between your mask and your soul. There will be a\\n\r\nlot of people who will hate this series, maybe, but there will be a lot of people\\n\r\nwho will extremely love it. But I don\u2019t think it will be a series worth\\n\r\nignoring. Give the first episode a try and decide for yourself. On my part, I\\n\r\nwill be waiting for the last two episodes of the series. I think it has to\\n\r\noffer yet more.\\n\\n\r\n(The same review can be found on my blogs over the net).",

            "content": "While I give the story, sound, and characters 6+s, it really doesn't mean much. A theoretically good story doesn't promise that the execution of the plot is well done. While the manga got it right, the anime screwed the pooch.\r\nAku no Hana is one of manga fairly decent manga that get an anime adaption so aggressive shitty that it should be filed under as a hate crime. I'm not even going to harp on the character designs as a sole reason as to why the anime is so bad since there are many other issues, such as pacing, Saeki herself being a mediocre character, andNakamura essentially carrying the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe average length of a chapter in the manga is about 35 pages. Even though it's almost double the length of your typical manga chapter, you can burn through the three dozen pages at breakneck speeds due to the numerous one-panel pages and stretches of little to no dialog. The anime takes away this quick read and slams the brakes on the pacing. While the urban scenery is beautifully done, it's not enough to compensate for NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENING for long stretches of time, which creates a new problem: we are treated to characters who are not named Nakamura for more time. Takao Kasuga's inner monologues drone on for ages, taking the feeling of his internal anxieties and turning it into a chore for the viewer to shift through to get to the next scene. For most of the material the anime covers, Saeki functions more as a plot device than an actual character with little to no aura, functioning more as a trophy or an object of desire than a human being. Nakamura, in contrast, has so much stage presence she honestly makes the rest of the cast look  bad in comparison, especially with Ise at the helm, giving an A+ grade performance. With a core cast of a mere three, having one being so unanimously dominant results in a horrible balance where every scene of which she is absent from is torturously boring to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not the main reason why this adaption is shit, the animation (or lack thereof) is salt on the wound. As we all know, Zexcs is a shitty studio that has NO FUCKING MONEY WHATSOEVER. When you are a studio that has little budget and capital, the last thing you should do is opt to experiment with an expensive and difficult animation style, like rotoscoping. You know what happens when you try something hard like rotoscoping when you're a broke company who makes Godawful shit like Sister Princess, H2O, and Cuticle Tantei Inaba? It looks like GARBAGE. In an animated work that's supposed to have a more realistic appearance, characters having no details is inexcusable. A person's face can tell you about a lot of what is going through their heads. They can tell stories just from their appearance. There are some words or thoughts that are best conveyed through the face of a person. A show that prides itself on being a more \"serious\" show with an art gimmick should not have faceless characters, or at least have them not look like they have Down's while they're breaking into a cold sweat, panicing trying to remember what number comes before \"potato\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was already unimpressive in episode one, so to see it get worse as the series went on felt like they were spiting Oshimi by making it look bad on purpose. All of the sensuality and youth of the characters has been castrated in this adaption, replaced by a fifth-finished character details and 16/17 year-olds looking like they're hitting their mid-late 20s and suffering from birth defects, breaking atmosphere and immersion in record-setting time thanks to the characters being set against the wonderfully done backgrounds. Rusty bent metal has never looked so pretty. Nice backgrounds are the only thing that the Mushishi director has seemed to carry over into this series, and it's not nearly enough to pardon the numerous flaws it has in regards to both the directing and the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana could have been one of the crowning gems of 2013, but instead gets treated as a 3rd class citizen and practice grounds for Zexcs failed animation experimentation. On the bright side, the anime bombed, but encouraged people to buy the manga, with hopes that they can filter out this disastrous adaption from their consciousness, resting easy that a season two is out of the question.",

            "content": "Oh boy, oh boy, I've been craving to write a review for this one. And unlike some others, I will be reviewing this anime based on what has been shown, not what is to possibly come... because screw that... why try to review something that hasn't even been shown? \r\nNow to say the least, Aku no Hana is absolutely one of the most controversial animes of the season for sure. When the first episode was released, I was not even 2 minutes in before realizing this anime was different. As many have seen or even heard, yes this anime is not traditional animation, but rotoscope.This caused huge controversy over whether or not to watch it right off the bat. Even after I saw the rating of a \"4\" that it once had, I said to myself it can't be that bad. So I watched the first episode and quit after a few minutes. I thought it was awful looking to be quite honest.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, about 7 weeks later I wondered how the anime was doing. I looked at the rating and saw it had done better, and so I figured it must have gotten somewhat better. I went back to watch it, saying to myself to at least give it the old 3-episode-rule that I give every other series. I also told myself to just simply look beyond the animation style and look at the story...lol. And so I watched 3 episodes (looking past the rotoscope style, which honestly isn't as bad as I thought in the first place) and then all the way until I was caught up to the recently aired episode. \\n\\n\r\nI was completely hooked and it was because of these three things:\\n\\n\r\n\"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.... I guess. Read the next 3 points at your own risk.\"\\n\\n\r\n1. Why is Kasuga such a pathetic little piece of trash? He's a complete spineless wimp and hardly stands up for himself, ever. He is just a doormat basically. \\n\r\n2. Why is Nakamura such a crazy psychotic bitch and why does she give two shits about Kasuga? Honestly...\\n\r\n3. Why is Saeki such a fool to even be interested in Kasuga? Again, WHY? It makes little to no sense at all.\\n\\n\r\n\"SPOILERS END HERE.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nThese three things kept me interested, and so I kept watching. HOPING to find an answer to all of these 3 questions, or at the very least 1 of them. So then, here I am on the edge of my seat as I am just waiting to find out an answer to one of these questions in the final minutes of the last episode... and then...\\n\r\n.......\\n\r\n..........\\n\r\n............\\n\r\n..............\\n\r\n................\\n\\n\r\nExactly.\\n\r\nLOL Get it?\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this anime was a huge waste of time. For those interested about a more \"in-depth\" review, here it is:\\n\\n\r\nART: The art wasn't as bad as they say, it was alright. Also, they could have cut down the pointless walking scenes. Therefore, 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The sound was... wait there was sound? Exactly. There were many empty moments with no sound at all to make a \"eery\" feeling to \"engulf the viewer\" as some say. However, I did enjoy two of the opening songs of the four and I still hum them to myself sometimes. The ending theme was... strange. Therefore, 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: The characters... really, need I say anything? Just refer to my 3 spoiler points if you don't care about spoilers. Therefore, 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:... eh... probably a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: The overall story, a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nSo now it's time to end this wonderful review:\\n\r\nBasically, I only kept watching Aku no Hana to find out the answers to my 3 questions. But, some of you might still be wondering (if you didn't get it), did you ever find out the answers to your questions? Well if that's the case, please refer back to the last sentence before a few dots up and think it over.\\n",

            "content": "Story- Aku No Hana is one of my top 3 favorite manga\u2019s and the story is the main reason for that. It\u2019s essentially a coming of age story with characters who have mental hangups and mental illnesses. Saeki, the girl who is a model student and does everything that\u2019s expected of her but is secretly depressed and wants to find something in life that genuinely excites her. Kasuga, the boy who loves books and thinks he\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d from everyone else with an underlying disdain for most people around him. Nakamura, the girl who hates everyone and everything, but hates herself the most. Yet she\u2019s justlooking for someone as fucked up as her to be with. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story, while not for everyone, is an amazing and uncomfortable drama. However, this anime adaptation ends at the best part of the story. Relegating the best arc of the manga to a short \u201cpreview\u201d montage. Thus I cannot reccomend  this adaptation story wise unless you have already, or plan to read the manga. This anime will just leave you unfulfilled with a brief glimpse into the crazy future these characters will have, but will never be animated. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation-  This is the only fully rotoscoped anime I\u2019ve seen. Rotoscoping is basically filming in live action and then tracing over said live action footage to create realistic looking animation. I hated this at first. Mainly because they replaced the amazing character designs (especially Nakamura) from the manga with live action models. But it did grow on me over time. Plus rotoscoping allowed for some crazily intense and emotional scenes that never would\u2019ve been possible with regular animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some drawbacks though. While the characters movements looked realistic and great, when said characters suddenly stop moving it looks weird and statuesque. And if a character is moving in the foreground with stationary characters in the background it feels unnatural. Also there\u2019s this weird effect where characters far away just don\u2019t have faces. But as they get closer to the \u201ccamera\u201d their faces slowly phase in like a video game running on very low render settings. There\u2019s a specific scene where 2 characters are having a conversation about how one of them is grinning, but the camera is too far away that both characters literally don\u2019t have faces and you couldn\u2019t see what they were talking about. It was so bad I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Though these issues seemed to be more sorted out it the second half of the show. But overall I enjoyed the art style and animation for what it was and you should at least watch a few episodes to see what rotoscoped animation can truly do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and directing- The voice actors were great with their more realistic and emotional performances. The music was good when it was there but often forgone for the sake of silence, which added to the atmosphere. The directing was interesting. Forgoing quick scenes from the manga in favor of long drawn out walking scenes for sometimes minutes on end. It really lets you have time to take in everything the characters have done and think about it while looking at their body language. Also the ending song was creepy and annoying at first, but it quickly grew on me and keeps getting stuck in my head now. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7/10. I would\u2019ve gave it an 8 but the ending was disappointing. It essentially teased the best arc of the story and a potential season 2 that never came to pass. The animation was absolutely wonderful and unique but there were certain drawbacks to it that took me out of the experience. Though the second half of the show really seemed to snuff out said drawbacks. The story is good but very unfulfilling on its own so you\u2019ll need to read the manga to see the best story arcs this series has to offer. Overall a decent but still disappointing adaptation from a superb manga.",

But it was the \"Intensity\" and \"spaz\" that you can feel in the plot. the story was awesome even though i never finished it, and you'll never know, you will be hooked in tothis masterpiece, then in time, you will like it. \\n\\n\r\n1st point is the concept of it. It was truly original. Very good points, very good events...\\n\\n\r\n2nd point is the art. For my opinion, the model of the characters was from their seiyuu, which is great. The art was truly unique, and undeniably misunderstood by people.\\n\\n\r\nlast point was the story. 1st episode i was like \"the art is umm...\" 2nd episode was like \"ok, the i get the story, but still, why the art?\" 3rd, 4th, 5th, i dont really mind the art. the story was cool, rad, awesome, and very..umm... balanced...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion,\\n\r\nStory, awesome, i got easily hooked, i will try to finish it. Tips, if u want to watch this, PLEASE, go for the story. You will never know what's next to expect from good animes like these. Aku no Hana, awesome anime...",

            "content": "Aku no Hana, yes. \r\nWell, at least you can call this anime unique. It really is unique, but in a rather strange way. My opinion may not be a popular one. But I\u2019ve got a couple of things to say\u2026\r\nStory (7/10): I really do like psychological anime series. Always provoking your mind and make you question yourself. Things don't go as you want them to, and they surprise you greatly, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way. \r\nAku no Hana though... rather than being excitingly psychological, it just made me angry and irritated. The story was dragging, and it all wasthanks to the characters, the terrible art, the cuts they made from the manga and the failed attempts to set the right mood. It was shockingly awkward to watch at times. It\u2019s not really the story that is the problem, it\u2019s the bad usage of characters and other visual details. I really like the idea of Kasuga having dark, perverted secrets and Nakamura being a terrifying brainwasher and the whole dark, suffocating tone about it\u2026 But there is no way that I could enjoy it with these characters!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10): Ah yes. Of course a person can be weak, of course they can be cowards, of course you can be brainwashed. But this went too far. \\n\r\nALL the characters were weak. Expressionless, mentally ill and far too easy to mess with. The whole situation Kasuga was in with Nakamura was ridiculous, for me at least. How can a person be this mentally weak and so easy to brainwash. What's wrong with all the characters? (And I really mean ALL of them. Like, seriously, how can EVERYONE in the same class be mentally ill?) Things were so uncomfortable to watch. Not because they were mind-provoking, but because they were far too unrealistic and irritating. \\n\\n\r\nArt (1/10): Don't get me started on this one. Rotoscopy, really? And this low budgeted version too? Not to mention how bad the actors portrayed the characters emotions, and then they made it worse by drawing over it... Really? Is this another attempt to be unique and different? Why does it have to be this way? The story is unique enough without the bad art. I really liked the art of the manga though, so I am quite confused about the choices they made for the anime\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The sound wasn't bad. I really liked the mood-lifting music it had. Even though the anime lacked in emotions from the characters... the sound never failed to deliver the right mood where it was needed. And that is exactly what music and sound in movies and series should be like. But whatever mood there was, was ruined by the horrible acting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10): I'm very sorry. I actually enjoyed the manga from time to time. But sadly, they took away many of the good scenes from the manga, because they were too explict. This made me a lot angrier than I already was. Some of the horrifying scenes were so badly portrayed that they gave a whole other feeling than they were supposed to. I am truly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): The story itself isn't a bad one. Actually, it is very creative and thought out, even though it sometimes just goes over the top. Unfortunately, those over-the-top times goes so far, because of the bad personalities of the characters, that you forget about what really was good with it. It is a shame, after all. I guess it's not my cup of tea. I would love the series more if the characters weren't ruining it all. \\n\r\nAs I said first, Aku no Hana is one of a kind. It is unique. \\n\r\nBut not anything unique is something good. \\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana was the first anime i watched that really made me want to write a review. Why? Thats what im going to try to explain in these 5 categories below.\r\nAfter the 5 main points there will be a SPOILER zone where i will share some thoughts.\r\n1.  Story\r\nAku no Hana takes place in a post-industrial japanese town. The main character is a bookworm and especially loves the book \"Flowers of Evil\". He has advanced vocalulary and is in love with a girl from his class - Saeki, to whom he refers to as his muse. One day after school, he impulsively grabs Saeki'sgym clothes and runs off, thinking that no-one saw him. However, Nakamura - a quiet careless girl from his class sees him and starts to make plans on how to make the best out of this situation. \\n\\n\r\n2. Art\\n\\n\r\nThis is the point where most people will have split opinions. Firstly i want to say that the landscape and backgrounds are AMAZING. Never before have i paused an anime so many times just to look at every frame. The shadows and all the detail are breathtaking. Huge kudos to whoever drew all this. However this also means that many frames are frozen, with only the characters moving - i like it since it doesnt give a 3D-feel about the whole thing. \\n\r\nThe characters are very originally drawn. The anime is almost completely unsexualized and all character faces and proportions are in realistic standards.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really see any unique sound qualities, just the usual grasshopper chirping. Some scenes in particular have very powerful sound because of the given situation.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character\\n\\n\r\nThis point is pretty hard to go into without spoiling so im going to keep it short and continue on further down. The three main characters Kasuga, Saeki and Nakamura have different personalities. Saeki and Nakamura are contrary to eachother. Saeki is a hardworking student while Nakamura doesnt care about school and is very unpleasant to everyone. Kasuga can be seen as a little of both, and a huge chunk of the story is about that he has to make his mind up about his personality.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. It's definetely in my top 3. Of course this varies for each viewer but that is my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n------------SPOILERS-------------\\n\\n\r\nI can definetely relate to the characters feelings. Growing up in an post-industrial town, knowing very little about the world outside of it. Just looking at the half-run-down industrial landscape is enough to make one feel depressed. \\n\r\nThe main character, Kasuga, doesn't know what he wants. He goes to school just as everyone else and has a few friends, but from reading western litterature he understands that there is something bigger outside of his town. He is in love with a girl from his class, the top student Saeki who seems as lively social girl with a great life.\\n\r\nAfter getting confronted by Nakamura about the gym clothes that Kasuga stole, she begins to influence him and lets his desires out. This is possible due to Kasuga's timid nature with Nakamura being the one in charge. This is where Kasuga starts getting torn between two choices. Either going with Saeko and living a proper life, or going with Nakamura where he doesnt really know what to expect. \\n\r\nAfter going on a date with Saeki, we see a turn in the story. It turns out that Saeki is also in love with Kasuga. Now the only thing that stands between them are the dirty secrets that Kasuga holds from Saeki - and Nakamura since she is a part of them. What Kasuga fails to understand is that love is a strange thing, and that Saeki is willing to accept him despite everything he has done. \\n\r\nWith Saeki and Kasuga sharing their timid nature, none of them go chasing after eachother leaving Kasuga for Nakamuras infkuences. She makes him go crazy and let all of his feelings out and eventually cultivates the idea they both share - getting out of their town. \\n\\n\r\nOne day they decide to set off, with their sight on the hill-chain encircling their town. When they finally understand how poorly prepared they were. Saeki, who is chasing after Kasuga eventually finds them and the 3 of them have an argument with Kasuga in the middle. Here Kasuga gets his final chance to decide who he wants to go with, either with Nakamura or Saeki. Things start to become too much for Kasuga and he breaks down, unable to choose.\\n\r\nAfter a while the police comes and picks them up, i think that in the car Kasuga finally understands that what stands in front of him is not a choice anymore. He simply cannot poison Saeki with his foul nature. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending really puts a cherry on the top of this masterpiece. Kasuga finally  understands the reality of his situation, and with confidence he chases after Nakumura after which he suggests that they find the other side of the hill together, but inside of their own town. This shows great character development from Kasuga's side and even though Nakamura doesnt take his words that well it doesnt matter, because he now feels what Saeki felt for him earlier - love.",

            "content": "It's funny how often you hear about \"not judging a book by its covers\" especially in reviews and such.Well in this case I wish i did judge it by the first impression it made or even by the number of mixed reviews ,some bashing it, I heard about.Because as it turned out Aku No Hana was one of the worst titles I've seen in recent years.\r\nBefore going into the review I want to point out that i didn't read the manga before starting the anime,which in retrospect was a very bad idea because now due to the bad taste this series left in my mouthI lost the much needed curiosity to find out how the manga is in comparison, so keep in mind that this a anime version only review.I'm sure that a lot of things were explained much better in the manga,character interactions had more room to develop and so on.... \\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe story is surprisingly simple ,especially for a tile labeled under the psychological genre,our main character Kasuga Takao is a high school student ,loves to read books and has a idealistic crush on his popular classmate Saeki Nanako.\\n\r\nOne day due to a stupid circumstance he ends up stealing her gym clothes ,but is caught by another classmate Nakamura Sawa who blackmails him to form a contract with her in order to not reveal what he just did,which due to how the series progressed meant toying around with him making Kasuga do a few ,well lets say some indecent but very petty stuff (ex: Kasuga wearing said gym clothes) for her own amusement and as she stated \"to break down his walls\".Oh and yes it sound like the premise of a hentai title if that's what you're thinking.\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much it,yeah I wish i was joking.Did you expect something more? Because you wont find it in Aku No Hana.\\n\\n\r\nSo in direct consequence due to how minimal the plot and story are ,there is very little happening in each episode.These 13 episodes could have easily been condensed into around 4-5 episodes without much of a problem and without missing any vital information.What keeps it at 13 episodes is a absolute indecent amount of padding and just wasting the viewers time with very long shots of the scenery,close up of objects and in one case just the 2 main characters simply walking for half a episode.\\n\\n\r\n*final episode spoiler\\n\\n\r\nAlso in the final episode they even had the nerve to recap what little has already happened that far in the first half of the episode and in the second half to show previews of \"things to expect\" in the second season,which to this day has yet to be announced because of its bad reception and lack of sales.\\n\r\nThe studio actually animated some short scenes/moments from the second half and were cocky enough they would get a green light for of this abomination.Well to our luck we were sparred of this second season so far.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nAnd here we go right into the belly of the beast,all the characters are completely unlikable and simply a pain to have to endure watching.While i did hear that's what the producers were going for it still doesn't excuse how undeveloped they are and just how things happen because the plot dictated that way not because of the characters motivation.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with Mr Personality himself :Kasuga Takao. A complete push-over ,spineless, uber bland main character, he mostly does what Nakamura dictates without that much of a consideration.\\n\r\nOnly thing you can say defines his is that he is angsty and later on develops Stockholm syndrome towards Nakamura ,which honestly you would actually expect from someone who is so damn pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nSaeki Nanako is the (initially) love interest for the main character ,although as he describes it its a platonic kind of feeling aimed towards a \"muse\" status.She is the classroom's beauty and also the most intelligent (although that is highly questionable due to her actions)  Not much to say about her,in retrospect she is the most grounded and normal character in the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nNakamura Sawa ,the blackmailer.Initially presented as a problem student who dislikes/hates everything around her.After witnessing Kasuga stealing the gym clothes she developed a sick interest in him as she thinks he is also a deviant like her and want's to witness his actions.\\n\r\nSimply put she is downright toxic :foul mouthed/vulgar,unpleasant ,bipolar.All what you would expect from a mental patient that's for sure.\\n\r\nBut what makes all of this worse is she is presented as quirky kind of character ,even charming in her own way if you will, , and that we aren't presented to the reason as to why she is this way,the anime had to keep us waiting for the second season to find out about her past/reasons.Huge mistake. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters are almost non existing.We see a few classmates here and there,the teacher,the main characters parents.And that's it.\\n\\n\r\nNotable mentioning goes  to Yamada ,one of Kasuga's friends, who looks and acts like a young version of real life actor Dan Fogler.A very bad and obnoxious actor who just makes you cringe rather than laugh,same goes to his \"anime counterpart\".\\n\\n\r\nART \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the reason as to why this title got so much controversy,it uses rotoscoping technique to achieve its character design and animation.\\n\r\nI wont go into much detail because its something that has been discussed over and over again.To put it simply it looks really bad and hard to look at,not enough to make you drop the anime ,although this may very from person to person.It's not really a \"deal breaker\" but its not doing Aku No Hana any favors ,that's for sure.For characters who are supposed to be in high school they look like they are in their late 20's some even late 30's, female characters look like male characters,character facial expressions/features simply don't appear from a distance.... \\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds on the other hand are very well done and looks very realistic,but they did re-use certain shots and angles over and over again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here ,its a very minimal type of soundtrack that doesn't get in the way of the action .Voice actors did their jobs decently if you keep in mind the material they were given,no notable standouts here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching it I wanted to give Aku No Hana a 5,maybe a 4 depending on the situation that was going on.But after finishing it and witnessing all that it had to offer ,a score higher than a 3 wouldn't do it justice.\\n\r\nIts just that special kind of bad that you watch to amuse at how much the producers screwed up and at their incompetence in producing a worthwhile story.\\n\r\nFlimsy plot,unbearable character who take up the entire screen time due to how few they are,slow progression that crawls at a snails pace,bad ending.That's Aku No Hana in a nutshell.\\n\r\nAs a 2-3 episode OVA or perhaps as a movie it could have worked ,but as 13 episodes series who even had the nerve to keep you waiting for another season it failed spectacularly.",

            "content": "Taking its name from a poetry book by Charles Baudelaire (\u201cLes Fleurs du Mal\u201d in French), Aku no Hana is a lush psychological journey chronicling the mishaps of reserved middle schooler Kasuga Takao, (who carries the namesake book close to his heart), as he deals with his embarrassing decision to steal the gym clothes of love interest Saeki Nanako.  Things get slightly more complicated (okay, *insanely* more complicated) when the news of said act reaches outcast (and sociopath in the making) Nakamura Sawa, who uses her newfound knowledge as blackmail.  \r\nWhile the events described may sound like the premise for an over-the-top sitcom,the show promptly establishes itself as anything but a laughing matter.  In fact, for a story of petty preteen drama, Aku no Hana is quick to present itself as one of the darkest and tensest series in its genre.  In fact, one could almost argue that the creators took the most anxious moments and scenarios that middle school life can provide, and made a TV show out of it.  That being said, I certainly would not have given it a perfect score had this show been as lacking in charm as it sounds.  In fact, it is the execution of this premise, characterizable by its subtlety and its delicate channeling of human emotions, that has made this my favorite anime I have watched thus far.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the catch (and your litmus test regarding whether this show is right for you):  Think of the last time someone was telling you about a book, a movie or a TV show, and warned you that you were missing out on the show if you only focused on the literal plot points, and paid no mind to the thoughts and motivations behind each character\u2019s actions.  If you decided to approach Aku no Hana in such a mode, you\u2019d be doing yourself a greater disservice than just neglecting the true fruit of the show \u2013 in fact, you wouldn\u2019t even be watching the show.  Period.  While the physical events for any given episode are few and far between, the unspoken thoughts of each of the characters move at a mile a minute.  It\u2019s the mastery of this cinematic technique that, more than anything, puts the show in a class of its own.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, far more components of the show exist that drive home the point that it isn\u2019t for the masses.  The animation style is an almost century-old technique involving hand-drawing images over live footage, better known as \u201crotoscoping\u201d.  It\u2019s a style that flawlessly captures and supplements the show\u2019s slow and plodding ambience \u2013 but as anime watchers well know, it\u2019s a controversial choice, and has seldom, if ever, been used before in the anime world.  Fans of American film director Richard Linklater (of School of Rock fame) might be familiar with it in films such as Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly (but fear not, Aku no Hana\u2019s use of rotoscoping isn\u2019t nearly as chaotic).  On a separate note, the soundtrack, while far from unlistenable on the whole, has yielded some songs that are definitely tough on the ears.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re the type to bite your nails at moments of nervousness or suspense, this definitely won\u2019t be your cup of tea.  If you\u2019re looking for something that offers more traditional anime themes, such as fast-paced action or dazzling sex objects, this show will probably not be up your alley.  But if you\u2019re a worry-wart like me, you\u2019d be surprised \u2013 you might even be delighted \u2013 to see how much Aku no Hana can take the tension you\u2019ve held inside on a daily basis, and reproduce it on screen.  Ironically enough, I would argue that in such a way the show produces a uniquely effective method of assuaging daily stress.\\n",

It delivered a lot more than I had expected from the simple synopsis MAL has for it, which wasn't actually too endearing.\r\nIt's hard to describe how I felt watching this anime. Dark, is what I want to say but I was also left feeling a little on edge after each episode. The psychological aura it delivers is quite intense, you feel like you are either Nakamura or Kasuga (MC's) in the story. The story itself is nothing short of disturbing and that's where Aku no Hana gets its appeal, so it's not something I would recommend someone startingoff in the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters develop quite well. We see Kasuga transform from the very beginning to the very end and it's not exactly that we see this humongous change in him, it's more like we open up the shell to expose what was already there. Nakamura is dark but she's likeable in many ways because she does what she does in such a precise way that is so thought out it's extremely clever. Saeki doesn't see much development but her screen time isn't wasted, even for being a love interest in the story. The supporting characters do exactly that - support. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style I found to be quite fitting. Much different from the manga (obviously) but I truly believe if it were to be done any different, it would take away from the story and how it needed to be displayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is absolutely 100% the most perfect song for this anime other than the fact it's called Aku no Hana (lol). I felt twisted listening to it while watching the end of each episode and throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't something that can be taken lightly and it truly is a magnificent psychological/drama",

            "content": "First off\u2026.what the hell did I just watch? \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe most messed up thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean the plot was brilliant and so creepy that it can end up being a real life situation. It\u2019s plots like these that I wonder if the writer or creator of this had some sort of dark past or a similar experience when they were growing up. It\u2019s depressing, it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s absolutely an inspirational plot. For a writer like me, and a literature student, I can go very, VERY deep into this plot that I can end up writing a three to five page essay. ButI won\u2019t do that. I can say that this story held some psychological aspect of betrayal, depression, OCD, Post-traumatic stress, and other mental issues these characters do carry. This story really dwelled deep into real life situations. The book that was mentioned: Flowers of Evil is a gateway or symbol of the whole story. Like The Nameless Monster was in Naoki\u2019s Monster. It symbolized forbidden thoughts, lost childhood, and of course, Death. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt seems as though it was probably originally filmed in the outside world, then animated over the layer. It\u2019s very realistic. The background is too detailed to be a normal drawing, but otherwise beautiful. The characters\u2026not so much. If the background can hold that much detail, so can the characters. Meaning the design should be clear from far away the same it is close up. I don\u2019t want to see a no face character far away. It\u2019s sloppy, lazy, and just plain creepy. Come on guys, you can do so much better than that! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNo\u2026just no. The opening song will change btw. It\u2019ll seem kind of off at first but will soon slowly start sounding like a normal person and not a screaming kid. The closing song\u2026just plain no. I got chills when I heard it and went straight to the next episode. It really did set the dark tone of the theme of the anime though so I do give them credit for coming up with a great and scary song. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are subbed and I doubt will be dubbed. Now as someone who doesn\u2019t watch subbed very often I loved this. I really do hope they don\u2019t dub it because it can ruin the voice of the characters and the mood of the story itself. It\u2019s so realistic that English speaking characters will just throw it all away. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the whole anime comes together. The characters in this were not only so realistic, you can find them just walking in your town, they were showing a side of an anime character that is rare to find. No, there is no death; there is only death of the mind almost. With a perverted school boy obsessed with the girl of his dreams and a stalker blackmailer who will do anything to make the school boy pervert\u2019s life a living hell, you got the best OTP ever. Just kidding. But the Stalker, Sawa Nakamura, does have some personal issues that we do learn about. The same goes for Takao Kasuga, the school boy pervert. These two characters might seem just plain stupid and probably very hateful\u2026trust me, I\u2019m not a fan of them, but the way they were represented and characterized, man they are a pure masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a weird anime, not going to lie. I hope they make a second season to tie up some loose ends. The character\u2019s situations and they conflict in the plot was so real it was scary. It makes you think: can this happen, is this happening right now; do I know anybody that is in this situation? It can give you complete chills thinking about it. Keep in mind guys; this is not about black flowers with eyes that can kill you. Those flowers really just represent the theme of the story. Someone is always watching\u2026.and you can never get away with anything without a price. \\n\\n\r\nI give this a 77% on the evil flower scale. \\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana was introduced to me by a friend who's seen far more anime than I have. We were talking about the worst anime we've ever seen, and on the list he produced, Aku no Hana was at the top. Why I decided to watch any anime on a list titled, \"Worst Anime Ever\", is a very good question. I could be a masochist. Point is, I didn't expect very much going into Aku no Hana, and I got, well, something. Here are my thoughts:\r\nStory:7\r\n     The story for Aku no Hana, is, in a word,abrasive. It revolves around a cringe worthy main character that does perverse things that get progressively worse to impress someone he hates. Why he does these things is because our main protagonist is so desperate for acceptance that he makes many obvious bad choices. I used the word abrasive because this story is rough and will wear you down over time, to where you think things can't possibly get any worse, and you don't give a damn about what happens to this guy anymore. If you're like me, you'll spend an inordinate amount of time between pausing to brace yourself and recover from the awkward, cringe, moments, and yelling \"What the hell are you thinking\" at your monitors. Kinda like the \"No, don't do that\" when watching a scary movie. I still give it a 7 though, because despite all that, the ending ties everything together well enough that it's almost worth all the discomfort of getting there. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\n    This anime receives a lot of hate for its art style, so much so that if you watched it on Crunchyroll like I did, the comments for the first episode were disabled from all the flaming. It uses Rotoscoping, which aesthetically, doesn't please my eyes. To be honest, when I started to watch Aku no Hana, I hated it. I thought it looked really dated. But as I progressed through the series, It bothered me less and less, probably because I was more focused on what I was watching, and less on how it was drawn. Overall, it's a bit annoying, but definitely bearable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\n     This is another anime that relies heavily on sound, and fortunately, the sound is great. The music throughout is best described as eerie, and unsettling, but it definitely fits the overall mood. It's probably because throughout this anime, there will be plenty of moments where you, as the viewer, will feel uncomfortable, unsure if you want to continue watching. The music personifies that discomfort beautifully. On its own, it's definitely creepy though(in a good way), so if you try to play a song from the anime to a friend, expect them to take two steps back and possibly avoid you indefinitely. Just a word of warning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\n     I feel like a seven is too high here, because out main character Takao takes second place in my \"Worst Protagonists Ever\" list( behind Makoto from \"School Days\", who will forever be reigning champ. What a Douche). I don't even like using the word protagonist, because to me, a protagonist is the lead person who does good things(as opposed to an antagonist who is the lead who does bad things). Takao does not do good things. He does things that are obviously bad for him, that he knows are bad, and then complains about how screwed up his life is. But surely given the chance to fix it, to put himself back on the morally right track with zero(yes ZERO) repercussions, he would right? No, he doesn't. As a main character he is terribly flawed, and yet I still don't think he deserves a lower score. Why? Because the fact that he can bother me this much, even after I watched this a couple months ago, tells me that he is a good character. If the creators can make a character that sticks with you this long, and still elicits the same emotional response(in this case, disdain), then it's a well written character in my book, even if he is an annoying little shit. Also, the antagonist Nakamura is brilliantly written, so bonus points for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5\\n\r\n     This is where I think this anime suffers, because it can be absolutely painful to watch. Using my \"How many episodes can I watch in a row\" enjoyment scale, Aku no Hana scores a 1-2, with me usually regretting the second episode. Aside from the fact that I was cringing through most episodes, this anime likes to trick you into thinking things will get better, that Takao will fix things. So many times I watched that second episode because the preview at the end of the first one made me think things were about to resolve for the better, only to be slapped across the face my the creators with an even worse situation. Not only is that lack of resolution irritating, but I don't think that anyone likes to get their hopes up, only to be disappointed. Again, the ending does do a nice job of making it seem almost worthwhile, but a nice lesson learned in episode 13 doesn't really equal 12 episodes of discomfort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6(Fair)\\n\r\n     Aku no Hana isn't a bad anime if you look at it as a whole. By the end, you tend to forget how much you dreaded watching the episodes leading up to it. But just like a bad movie can't be redeemed by a great ending, if you didn't really enjoy the first 12 episodes, the ending in episode 13 can only do so much to make the series enjoyable. I'm hoping that this was just the necessary evil in order to set up a second season(which seems likely), because a second season would probably score higher now that I know what to expect. Aku no Hana is worth a watch if you like anime that makes you uncomfortable(looking at you \"Watamote\" fans), or even if you can stand the uncomfortableness if you like anime that make you think. Otherwise, I would avoid it, because if you're like me, curled up in a, cringing, ball of regret is not how you like to spend your free time.   \\n\\n",

The plot itself is slightly immature but a certain level of maturity is needed to understand it.\r\nOne thing that really bothered me was the street the protagonist always took which the anime shows in almost every episode in great detail, taking upscreen time. It's based in a small town and hence the repetition shows that there is nothing new or interesting that happens, but still...enough with the road and it's signs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, explores the darkness in the hearts of teenagers, exposing their demons and insecurities",

Here's why I consider it an 8 or MAL's \"very good\": \r\nThis show is hard to figure out, but I don't think on an intellectual level.  It's not really cerebral, yet it does makes you think.  This show is polarizing because it either grows on you or not.  Whether you like it depends on whether you can \"feel\" it.  I know that may sound strange,but although it lacks greatness for other aspects of production, its tone is effective at emoting.  Pain, sorrow and estrangement are emotions the show MAKES you feel.  \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is about corruption of self image.  There's depth, in the psychological characterization.  The plot includes a growing sense of morbidity not easy to describe.  If it weren't for the second half of the show deviating from what I'd like better, in hindsight, I would've considered this close to a masterpiece.  It has potential in its creativity, exploring the protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana's story touches on many issues present with Japanese youth.  It delves into depression, perversion and shame.  But the main notion I saw played with was: corruption of self image.  Aku no Hana is an apt embodiment of Japan's repressed sexual culture. And this is what makes it compelling.  Characters take a turn down an unfamiliar path for us.  It is refreshing to see people do complex and heinous things.  The story also grants us another perspective; an inspection of Japanese culture through another lens, albeit mostly hyperbolic.   \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is an interesting show, and many may not like it for being so, but it grew on me.  It takes an open mind to enjoy.  Likely unconventionalists would favor it.  The reason why it works, is that tonally it accomplishes much by irreverently spitting on our attempts to understand it, and bringing tension through atypical character development.  The thing is, the protagonist arc is strange, leading where we don't expect it to go.  More generally, there is a sense of a growing, festering plot, adding unease with each episode.  This 'feeling' gradually seeps into the plot, aided implicitly (by music, actions of characters, etc. and explicitly, as displayed on screen.  You'd have to see the show to know what I mean.  But I must say, not everyone enjoys cringeworthy material.  Thematically, however, much is able to be accomplished by the cringeworthy, sickening tone. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore, those who are open-minded, unconventional thinkers, or anyone who is....sexually depraved or can appreciate depravity...would likely enjoy this show.",

            "content": "There is no reason for anyone to love the way they\u2019ve been raised in suburbia. It may not be dangerous, but that is not enough to make living there worthwhile. Suburbia is a world without values, where nothing is allowed to be good and worth devoting to. Some things are considered bad and off-limits \u2013 like drugs. Anything else though is \u2018just a hobby\u2019. No wonder this safe lifestyle doesn\u2019t stop people from killing themselves \u2013 why live such a life, anyway?\r\nNo wonder, then, that suburbia has its share of \u2018rebels\u2019 who take symbols that seem to contradict suburbia. Then again, any person who findssomething valueable is rebelling against suburbia \u2013 that\u2019s why both the happy-go-lucky raver and the skull-laden metalhead are considered rebels of this landscape. Even the truly religious and the intellectual can be rebels in this world. Such passionate people will challenge the status quo since they will value something other than the suburban lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nNotice the problem, though. Notice what\u2019s the requirements for a true rebellion against suburbia \u2013 having values. Aku no Hana is the pseudo-rebel, the person who hates suburbia so much with all its emptiness yet cannot find anything of value to replace it with. It wrecks destruction, says naughty words and perhaps will pay lip-service to sexuality but in the end it has nothing to say. In the end, it is too weak to admit it\u2019s exactly like the suburbia it hates and this lack of self-awareness is its destruction.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime fails in the same way the main character, Nakamura, fails. Nakamura hates the boring life she leads. I hate that way of life, too. Yet just because she claims she\u2019s going \u2018beyond the hill\u2019, that she will tear down Kasuga\u2019s walls to find something there doesn\u2019t mean she actually will. It doesn\u2019t mean her actions are directed at this venture. Actually, her actions are more like that of a sexual abuser rather than a tough life coach\\n\\n\\n\r\nImagine if a man stripped a female of clothing, forced her to wear something and said this will somehow psychologically heal her and make her stronger, bring out the \u2018real her\u2019 or something equally fancy. Few of us would take it seriously. The moment the man will use force is the moment we will find him villainous, no matter how many rebellious slogans come out of his mouth. So why is it okay when a female does it?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an anime so engrossed in being different, so immersed in wanting to be unique that it doesn\u2019t even try. It goes beyond the art style, which is ugly but not too hard to get used to. The backgrounds are fantastic. They go beyond the emptiness of suburbia, giving everything a rusty look of falling down and crumbling. We see something else besides boredom, that suburbia equals malaise and its lack of values is actually that depressing. As for the character design, it\u2019s merely failed realism. None of them actually look like real people but more like distorted photographs. For a while it\u2019s amusing, but not too much.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it starts off interesting with a view into the darkness and weirdness of random people. Quickly, though, it is obvious we\u2019re supposed to side with Nakamura, view her as a tragic person lost in a world of dull people who just cannot realize how special she is. Too bad the creators missed that if anyone actually paid attention to her, they\u2019d realize she should be in jail. No one cares how special you are when you abuse people. Look what happened to Watkins.\\n\\n\r\nTrue horror is realizing that something that\u2019s horrible is also real, and perhaps more common than we think. Don\u2019t be a pig and act like your mud is special. Show the viewers that what they consider deviant is actually normal. Horrify them with that. Instead, we see a small act of stupidity and teenage horniness being shoved in our faces like the creators just discovered the true darkness that lays at humanity\u2019s heart.\\n\\n\r\nIf only they had enough empathy to realize that the true horror is realizing that all our rebelliousness is worth nothing if we\u2019re cruel, that we\u2019re excellent at swallowing our own Kool-Aid as we hide from how we hurt others. From the middle onwards, the series becomes nothing but a carnival of vomit. We see people being mean to each other, some preaching about the nastiness of suburbia and pushing someone to do things they don\u2019t want because you and your rebellious self know what\u2019s best for them. Hating suburbia is a good thing, but it\u2019s the first step. This anime barely takes in, and merely wallows in the pre-packaged cliches of rebellion \u2013 like anti-capitalism music that you need to pay to hear.\\n\\n\r\n1.5/5",

            "content": "Flowers of Evil the Animation. Why would anyone watch this anime adaptation than the manga that doesn't look ugly like the so-called anime adaptation that likely to trigger some ocular injuries? Well, this anime has the superior gritty black bitter dust feeling to it.\r\nI actually kind of liking this rotoscope animation graphically better compared to the manga. Although it was quite divisive between the fans of the manga that some called this adaptation is terrible while this anime really grows on some people who watched it. The anime adaptation has more dark and serious feel also the characters look more mature than in the manga,in the original source material the characters look like fresh graduates from elementary school. It's not that bad actually, the drawings in the manga is actually decent in much honesty but this version is more fitting that makes the story even more depressing and somehow more realistic and less sugary. The slow pacing of the anime is perfect for this kind of show, if you familiar of shows with similar sinister themes then this isn't really bothering. \\n\\n\r\nThe most alluring factor of the anime is when each episode is about to end, the ending song starts to haunt your very soul deep down to the point of anxiety you never experienced beforehand. Yeah, i do agree the ending song is strange and giving somewhat uneasy feeling but fits perfectly with the acts on screen while the song starts to come into play. I also like how the opening songs differ from a quarter to another quarter of the whole this 13-episode show. This signify that the producers give the utmost effort about the output of the adaptation to catch the feeling of undergoing what will happen today, the lurking terror of past decisions, and bittersweet emotions of first time school romance drama.\\n\\n\r\nFeelings of guilt and shame of the main character that brought to the viewers are really caught perfectly and how much tension the main character suffers from a trivial yet shameful and lowly decision that he made, what if he got caught? The already tainted name of the main character like being called weird, an oddball, perhaps edgy if the main character live in these days by the peers around him for being have distinguished interests and behavior might going down to the bottom of the darkest abyss of hell. There is no way going back to the point when the main character is just an ordinary eccentric introverted guy without psychological issues that obstructing his normal school life. Even after the moment this show ends halfway through the source material you might to have a contemplative time about what you did witness on screen especially if you binge watching this show in past midnight in one sitting like i did. The producers of this anime really did a damn great job tackling the situations without looking sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nThe major negative side of this anime adaptation is it does really in need of a sequel with this tone of adaptation that many people think it is just downright appalling without any trace of good redeemable thing left to value and this didn't really sell well in the anime industry. Hopefully it will come out soon, because it desperately have to. The last episode ending just sucked at this point, if they really want to save the remaining fans that still dominating the haters of the anime adaptation they are obliged to make the continuation season of the adaptation from the original source material. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for some heavily suspenseful psychological horror shows, then this is the one you would probably like to try out, especially if you can relate to the main character at the nadir point in your life. Best served at past midnight to experience the fullest despair. This show is not for one whose looking for cheerful and lighthearted daily full of ha-ha school life romance drama. Because the title of the show already warns it, even the flower that looks like a sea urchin with an eyeball on the top of it looks like the most vile plant that spreads its seeds of all sorts of evil everywhere easily you will ever see in an anime poster.

The story itself feels disturbing but not in a gory way, but in a psychological and broken way. You must watch the whole season to really understand and enjoy what it's trying to say. \r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe characters' style are not likemost anime. Although many people who've watched this anime simply don't like this kind of art style, I found it pretty and interesting and it really fits with the story itself. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nIt also fits the story and it is, still, pretty simple. It's dark and kinda disturbing but in a positive way. The anime wouldn't have the same awkward and distressing feel if it had any other type of soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime really does have an realistic feel to it. It doesn't have an overly-skilled or magical character so you can really feel connected to most of the characters in this show. Their despair and pain is understandable and real. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFrom the moment I've started watching to the end of the season I felt sucked in and in many moments I felt like I've had an empty feeling inside of me (or a feeling of hopelessness/despair). I felt truly agonized (also in a good way, yes) towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI am really hoping for a second season.",

            "content": "Aku  no Hana is one of those anime's that make you actually take the time to think about what is happening.  The anime itself isn't very well known but it really does have a overall feeling of the balance between good and evil to it. The art/graphics were not the best and more than likely a huge turn down to most viewers but once you are able to look past it you realize it actually is quite amusing. I personally chuckled every time a characters facial features were a bit sloppy especially the elusive gender bend character with the face and voice ofa male but hair and social status of a female. The character development was just amazing, I personally enjoyed learning all the characters individual quirks. The story itself has a deep meaning and to really understand it you kind of have to put yourself in the anime. The story line goes above and beyond some guy stealing his crushes clothes, where from there it turns into a mystery, romance, and slight comedy ( if you have the right sense of humor). I also enjoyed how the book itself played a huge part in the story as well a times it almost seemed as if the book was a character on it's own.  Once you start watching I can almost guarantee that you will binge watch, but maybe not. I believe that people whom have great imagination and also those who see the beauty in life will personally be touched. Overall I highly recommend this anime so why not give it a try?",

            "content": "Aku no Hana in truth is the plant that grew in the \u201cother side\u201d and is the source of madness for all the characters.it is a giant eye in the shape of flowers that watch over them all and with their madness it remains open.it also questions the conformist life style and shows it\u2019s ups and downs.\r\nAnH is based on a manga by Oshimi, Shuuzou or at least the story is based on it but the studio that adapted it decided to mix it with a reality style animation (rotoscope or w/e) and the result was an unholy mix...not just because they tried to makeit look real though it is because mixing anime world with reality is not an easy thing to do and they tried to make the characters and other things real as well in a bad way.sadly Aku no hana anime failed but at least it tried but as a result what could have been an 8/10 turned into this.\\n\\n\r\nAku no hana is a different read from the usual things around.we all like unexpected things in the stories and the Aku no Hana tries to be unexpected.but we need a reason or motivation to like them.simply caring for mad characters that harm others is...a waste of time.although it can be considered a good thing when we have time to waste\u2026.sadly it seems that I am mostly going to talk about negative things about this anime but that doesn't mean it doesn\u2019t have good points.for example it makes you yearn for more to see what happens next cause it is unusual and Aku no hana is good at presenting the story so it helps a lot and also the opening songs are interesting but the negative points were the things that drove me to write a review since it didn't do justice to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nin reality Aku no hana manga is about a boy that turns into a freak for the sake of a girl and it was about the madness that sorrounds them and took the shape of a flower.the story itself is simple.it is about mistakes and misunderstandings of teenagers about the events of their life.although not sure that is what the mangaka wanted it to be but in reality that is what this anime is.the main focus is characters take on the events of the story.Takao is in love (or so he thought) with a girl name Nanako and by pure accident one day he finds her gym cloths in the class and without thinking he is forced to take them with himself.while what he did was wrong it wasn't the greatest sin of all times and he could just laugh about it when he grew up but since he was a teenager he was more pure and it was enough to make him feel very bad about himself.although since middle schoolers in Aku no hana have thinking patterns and psychologies of adults one cannot simply accept that whenever they make a wrong call it is becuz they are middle schoolers but sadly many anime these days have this loophole.although the anime is yet to reach deeper parts of the story where characters express their thoughts more so maybe its too harsh to judge the anime for that yet.Nakamura is another character in the story that tries to be weird.although in the manga she doesn't need to \"try\" but in anime perphaps because of it\u2019s style she just doesn't fit.she saw what Takao did and use that chance to tame him into a man he wants him to be.Nakamura hates everyone and thinks that life is boring and she doesn't want to be normal and boring.while she could be a good character she is too extreme and that makes her annoying at some points specially in the anime.in the end even Takao wants to be like her and that explains why he never resist her abuses to an extent.but what both characters didn't realize again maybe becuz they were too young was that if they think everyone else is normal and boring then no one is or maybe those things that are deemed normal like love/hate and marriage are bound to meanings of life and many people values them and while they didn\u2019t need to accept it they have to respect it! \\n\\n\r\nbut one thing that takao got right about himself was that he is empty.that is why he was easily changed by Nakamura even though probably he had a talent for being a perv too.also sadly the only normal person in the story is Ai, Nanako\u2019s friend and others are just too extreme.Nanako thinks that what Takao did is completely alright while Takao thinks that he did the greatest sin and Nakamura things everyone is trash and sadly there is no middle ground and no one else tries to teach them that.and like many other animes their parents are just useless.(or maybe becuz they were useless that the kids turn out like that).although I am not saying that main characters should be more logical to be acceptable,I am saying that no one is completely logical in the story\u2026the irony that the anime decided to make aku no hana more real while it is not fit for one.not just becuz their parents aren't real enough as characters but becuz characters like Nakamura can't easily get adapted anywhere besides anime world.not that it is impossible but it is a hard work.one good thing about the anime is that the viewers are yet to see Nanako turn 180 completely since even if you fake your personality for a long time it will become a part of you no matter what and while changing yourself Is not impossible it can\u2019t be done so quickly and a kid can\u2019t be that complex in the first place...as you get close to the ending the anime gives you \u201cschool days\u201d vibe a little although those that alrdy did read the manga knows that it won't go that way at least for now.\\n\\n\r\nanother thing is that there are a lot of wasted times in some episodes.characters walking for minutes or just stay silent for minutes...it just makes you wait more and by the end you just get a recap episode and some random shots from future chapters of manga and the anime just needed to adapt one more chapter for better ending but they decided to waste time with recaps and long walking scenes...(even though they were probably bound to limited budgets they could use it better).let us hope that they really do make another season with higher quality.\\n\\n\r\nalthough in the end AnH's manga wasn't a masterpiece itself so the anime at best could get an 8/10,now it is 6.5/10 and I rounded up to 7 in hopes of a better next season if there is going to be one.\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is what could be said barely an anime. It is delivered for us in an anime form, in anime ways. But what we get isn't what most of us are waiting for in this medium. Rather than your general anime, where we get a stereotyped story that makes it easy for us to classify it - The action filled shonen; the humoristic harem or school club - the bittersweet, funny ecchi comedic-romance - we are presented with a story wich wants to send us more than enjoyment, but also a message. Doing so, it can't fit in anycommon anime theme we may quickly think of, and it develops in it's own personal way, and I've got to say, this is were anime, and all kinds of art, really shine for me.\\n\\n\r\n    I can but laught of that description they came about of this anime - not because it was lame, but  because of how it could be miss interpreted by many people. It, firstly, signals a comedy-harem setting, letting down most of watchers who were expecting that. Actually, 90% of audience dropped just because of the realistic art style, and maybe for good, as it's art style isn't the only part of the anime incompatible with standard anime expectations.\\n\\n\r\n    I will try the most I can to not spoil anything, while trying to transmit my feelings and toughts about this anime to those who watched it.\\n\r\nI will starting saying that this anime has high philosofical and psychological impact to those who watch it open mindedly, and enjoy learning a thing or two with a story. The characters have very strong caracterization towards what the diretor planned them to be. Nothing about their personality helps in comic relief, or anything that would serve to any other purpose away from telling the story and proving it's point. And I think they work very well with the plot. I might even say that they ARE the plot.\\n\r\n    We can tell that the diretor really couldn't care less about what we might think of his storytelling. While the story and characters are very deep, It will hardly make you smile even once, you won't want to be any of the characters - you will probably get upset about how they act- but it's just part of the point of this tale.\\n\\n\r\n    By now, I will assume that the second season will be aired, for it seems obvious that the part two is already fully animated and ready to be presented.\\n\\n\r\n    This anime shows us a deep, ugly truth about kasuga and the others, and also about all of us. It also shows psychological aspects that amuse me. The way they act, their toughts, and the development of the plot alog with the subtle messages is what made it enjoyable to me. As the foruns and my anime experience shows me, these points may not be very atractive to most anime watchers, so I cannot recommend this to most people, even qw I think of Aku no Hana as a great work of art and a great story that might teach you some importante stuff. \\n\\n\r\nWe like to think how safe we are inside of ourselves, how we are \"normal\". Yet we delve hiding into worlds that doesn't exist, trying to feel what we can't in real life, and yes, I'm telling this directly to most of you anime watchers, who just can't apreciate and learn form a story that tells us about problems we might have inside. - I might even go further and say that this is the main reason a lot of people dislike Aku no Hana - They want shows that give them characters they feel good pretending to be.\\n\\n\r\n    Well, away from the bashing, watch Aku no Hana if you're like me, who loves an original story that makes you think, and in this case, might even give you a minor life lesson. I must add that I have not read the manga and I won't read it ever, I will just wait for season two. For my score, I will give it 9 out of 10, as the anime pacing really was a bit, just a bit exagerated. We could have gotten more in one season.",

However, awkwardness and perversion that would be played for laughs in any other anime are laid bare for the viewer in Aku no Hana. This is done in the most uncomfortable and honest way possible. In the same manner. the rotoscoping only barely conceals the honest, living faults and imperfections of our characters. This technique allows for the creators to give us the illusion of animation. The bright colors can only do so much to mask theoppressive reality that bleeds through in their every movement. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter how you look at it, this is a character driven story. Kasuga is our main. We follow him on his walks to and from school every day. The beautifully illustrated backgrounds showcase the rust, decay, and weeds that seem to take over his town and that make up the monotony of his daily life. It is this monotony, this slow moving boredom whose pace becomes the pace of this series, that seems to drive him to Baudelaire and books. Not to mention the decay of the city is a theme taken straight from Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. (It's not only the title). \\n\\n\r\nThe tragedy of Kasuga's character is his misunderstanding of his own identity, and most importantly: love. \\n\\n\r\n(It is important to note, these are only middle school students!)\\n\\n\r\nInitially, Kasuga takes an approach from literature, he only wishes to love Saeki, his crush, in the most pure way possible. In his mind, this is tantamount to using her as his 'muse.' As selfish as this is, this limitation that he has placed on himself further drives him away from the decaying city and the people who live there. He looks down on them as apes, refusing to see Saeki as one, and thus strives to become more than an ape himself. It is through an impulsive action, stealing her gym clothes, that Kasuga shocks himself into having to admit a part of his own nature. \\n\\n\r\nEnter, Nakamura. Fully believing in her own apeness, she sees Kasuga as someone who is close to fully becoming a deviant. Nakamura's identity is wrapped up entirely in that of the deviant. This limitation she places on her self is similar to what we see with Kasuga initially. However, Kasuga is unable to hold on to the identity he has created for himself, and replaces it with the one Nakamura has constructed. Going from one extreme to the other, Kasuga becomes confused about the nature of his own deviancy, thinking of it as freedom that will 'burn this fucking town to the ground.' Of course, we should know, at least, that freedom is not about being unbound. Their desire to escape both physically and mentally from their surroundings can be chalked up to their youth, but also their damaged psyches. They are truly people who are unable to  understand and cope with their own behaviour, They're not even sure how they want to behave, in some instances! This naive misunderstanding of love, deviancy and freedom is pretty much what defines Kasuga and Nakamura. Despite any similarities they are both very deep characters in their own right, and their development is done in a satisfactory way, despite it being frustrating for me. \\n\\n\r\nSaeki may be the most interesting character. She is neither angel nor ape. Kasuga is shocked to be approached by a 'flesh and blood' Saeki, however, Saeki is not put off by Kasuga's impulsive, 'deviant' action.  Her seeming understanding of 'deviance' is the healthiest of our main trio. Because she sees the necessary interplay between love and lust, the balance that makes us who we are. She is even able to understand Kasuga's behaviour, despite him being ignorant of it himself. When she articulates this to him we can see how different their characters really are. She is not a deviant in the way Nakamura wants Kasuga to be, nor the way in which Kasuga is scared to see her as. Saeki and her relationship with Kasuga may be the most frustrating and tragic  aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nMy interpretation is that Aku no Hana is a character-tragedy, however others can interpret it in any way they wish. Depending on your outlook, you may agree more with the author/creator. (This frustrating aspect is why I'm giving it an 8, but that's just me). \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this series to anyone who desires to see a very interesting character study. At times I thought the authors/creators intentions were just as naive as some of these characters, however Aku no Hana is a strong series, and one of the better coming of age stories I have seen. This definitely isn't the anime you watch to escape reality, although you'll find yourself lost in the one Aku no Hana has created. For better or worse.",

If you are in this kind of mood or immature, just run away from this.\r\nWhat i often praise about the art of Manga and Anime is the easiness that these artists have in creating new stories and new unlimited emotional concepts. There are no barriers standing like the ones mainstream content suffers in the western world.\r\nThis anime is psychologically terrifying. It's a masochist spectacle than bring depravity in your face. Characters are running themselves into the ground at an astonishing speedin a way you find hard to understand.\\n\\n\r\nAmong all this repugnant mess of kids destroying themselves for no apparent reason, you'll find yourself drowning in their struggle and you'll feel hooked on these lives like never before.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by the end of it all, it's nothing but another love story. A staggeringly different one from all the other you have seen before. Something really new and that leaves you with an impact lingering in your mind for weeks.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, about the art. Good lord. Some of the most gorgeous backgrounds ever made in anime story and a weird way to present the characters. First, you find it strange and unappealing. They chose to actually FILM the characters and then to transfer an manga like animated version of it into the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe mix between vibrant and realistic backgrounds and these cartoon like characters will more than probably put you of... for a couple of minutes!.\\n\\n\r\nThing is, the expressions captured by real live actors are unbeatable. The way that it helps the narrative is astonishing and it perfectly fits the need of real emotion on the characters once that we are talking about a story that will rip your guts inside out.\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the greatest anime i ever saw.",

            "content": "I really wish I could love Aku no Hana more than I did. The concept is bursting with all kinds of twisted potential, and when I saw what the animation style looked like -- so bizarre and unique in a sea of same-same shows featuring green-haired girls with eyes half the size of their heads, I knew I had to watch this. Unfortunately, even though I loved the style and atmosphere of this show, the confused characterization and pacing ultimately made Aku no Hana a letdown for me.\r\nStory: Without giving away too much, this show turns into a melodramatic soap opera much too early onfor my liking. A major breakthrough that changes each character dynamic irrevocably happens more than halfway through the show, so the rest of the series seems quite rushed after the fact. It\u2019s unfortunate that Aku no Hana will never get a second season, because if the events were drawn out much longer, allowing each character to simmer in their undercurrents of hatred and anxiety for longer than a day before moving onto the next convoluted plot event, this might be something close to a masterpiece. I think this show shines when it succumbs to just how psychologically and sexually insane it could be, while still making some time (not nearly enough time, unfortunately) for interesting character development. Again, a caveat: the show\u2019s middle school setting made the sexual content -- tied to themes of humiliation, domination, and fetishization of purity -- difficult to reconcile with how old the characters are. That being said, those are some pretty intense and subtly-outlined themes for an anime, so when the show isn\u2019t tied up in tiring \u201cyou\u2019re a pervert!\u201d, \u201cno I\u2019m not!\u201d arguments and other boring anime conventions, looking closely at the kinds of sexual behaviors and attitudes happening reveals a lot more than is spelled out about each character. I sort of liked the direction the show took after most of the sexual elements are stripped back in the last few episodes -- the plot twists into a trope that is so prevalent in stories about teenagers for a reason, after all -- but again, the pacing is so off that it felt tonally inconsistent with the psychological torture and horror of previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Can\u2019t praise the art enough! I\u2019m not very surprised that there\u2019s such hysterical arguments about it -- taking such artistic liberties in a medium where people often spend more time worshiping cute characters than actually paying attention to nuances in the story (if there are any, that is) is bound to make a lot of people pissed off. I haven\u2019t read the manga, but I think the style elevates the material here beyond the conventions of anime (which, unfortunately, makes every time that the story succumbs to such conventions even more jarring and disappointing). You can see by how richly detailed the backgrounds are, how beautifully surreal some scenes are drawn, and little things like the reflections of characters seen in TV screens, that the odd animation and character design is totally on purpose. The fact that this show is rotoscoped adds emphasis on movement instead of detailed character design. Each character is so bizarrely drawn that, although they are certainly more realistic looking than your average anime character, they don\u2019t look entirely human. But they move like a human. In a show where alienation from others is paramount, the style strengthens this aspect more than any bit of dialogue or plot twist could. Each character\u2019s troubles with fitting in and understanding the people around them are only emphasized by their blank, simple appearances...they\u2019re empty characters living in an empty, rusted, hopeless world. I appreciated that Nakamura, who looks like a cute Rei Ayanami-clone in the manga, looks like a normal girl in this show. The animation style makes it difficult to reduce her to the \u201ccute crazy girl\u201d that so many people seem to have done. Nakamura\u2019s blank, semi-realistic appearance allowed me to sympathize with her and understand her as a human being, not a stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I skipped the main song because I don\u2019t sit through openings with no animation but OH MY GOD, THAT ENDING SONG. I think it\u2019s my favorite ending to an anime yet. Although the show has some problems with maintaining tone sometimes, the ending always brings it all back because it\u2019s so creepy sounding. It\u2019s always cued in at the right dramatic moment, and each time I heard it I began to like the show more, in spite of all my reservations with it. I\u2019ve never actually heard of a show whose ending song actually makes the content of the show better, but goddammit if Aku no Hana isn\u2019t just that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As with most anime, I ended up liking the side characters much more than the main character. Aku no Hana obviously devotes more time to Kasuga than Saeki or Nakamura, but the screen time they do get shows that they are just as muddled and complex as he (supposedly) is. Unfortunately, the show\u2019s horrendous pacing means that right when the contours of Nakamura\u2019s true personality become a bit more defined, it ends. I really wish we saw more of Saeki, as well. It\u2019s rare that such a nice and sweet girl is given a chance to be interesting beyond having a sad backstory. Speaking of sad backstories, although I have major gripes with Kasuga\u2019s characterization, I loved that Aku no Hana never resorted to giving a character a sad or abusive childhood to \u201cexplain\u201d the way they are. Each character has a loving family that often only wants to understand them, and in this way, the way each of them act becomes a little more heartbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just extraordinarily difficult to figure out in general or if this show handled the manga\u2019s characterization of Kasuga poorly, but I found it hard to understand if we\u2019re supposed to sympathize with him. He\u2019s pitched halfway between a Shinji-Ikari-shy-blank-slate of a main character and a nuanced criticism of that often-tired anime trope (no shade at Shinji, I love him). He gets tugged around by an insane girl, is disgustingly obsessed with a his crush\u2019s purity even though he steals her uniform for ostensibly sexual purposes, and childishly revels in his outsider status even after realizing that\u2019s...childish...? All things that point to a more intelligent way of looking at this character type, but because we spend so much time with him doing so much over the top screeching and crying and monologuing, I just couldn\u2019t figure it out.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of over the top, I know this is an anime but there were a lot of times in Aku no Hana where characters, specifically Saeki, act in ways that aren\u2019t based in reality at all (or maybe they are, but there wasn\u2019t enough thought given to the pacing to provide a realistic explanation for those actions). Fortunately, the sheer spectacle of the show allowed me to ignore all of that and revel in the insanity and soapiness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: At its core, this is a 1/3 sordid sexual-humiliation tale, 1/3 \u201cget me out of this town\u201d love triangle soap opera, and 1/3 semi-nuanced character analysis. So...it\u2019s pretty enjoyable. There are quite a few long takes that remind me of NGE\u2019s slower scenes, and although I wasn\u2019t anywhere as nearly invested in the events of this show to fully pay attention during those scenes, I respect the decision to include them as much as I respect the animation style. Characters do stupid, outlandish, bizarre shit that sometimes makes no sense but who cares! It\u2019s a lot of fun, if you like being uncomfortable! In the first half of the show, not knowing what Nakamura will subject Kasuga to next is pretty terrifying to watch as the stakes go higher and higher...and when those stakes all get annihilated, it\u2019s impossible to see what will happen next. A shame that the last episode almost entirely hinges on the false assumption that this will get a second season, though. Totally looking forward to reading the manga!",

            "content": "This thirteen-episode series deals with some of the darker aspects of teenage psychology and sexuality. Kasuga is a shy middle school student who\u2019s an avid reader, his favorite book being Baudelaire\u2019s \"Les Fleurs du Mal\". One day he notices the girl he loves from a safe distance, Saeki, has left her gym uniform at school. He has loved this girl for a long time but had never been able to act upon it. In a fit of juvenile impulse, he steals the uniform.\r\n\"Flowers of Evil\" was filmed using rotoscoping, the technique of animating over pre-recorded footage. This brings a sense of natural movement to ananimated world. The contrast between movement and the mores tilted, traditionally rendered backgrounds presents an air of surreal isolation. Being out of place with your world is something most teenagers feel, and this technique brings that emotion to the story in almost every scene.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tale of youthful perversion and manipulation, the turmoils of growing up with such confusing desires and how the world will see them. The animation expertly conveys that confusion, showing characters so fundamentally at-odds with the world around them. All of them are well-developed, and who they start off as in the beginning of the series is not how they end up as. \\n\\n\r\nNot one of the main characters is an angel, or (in some cases) even a halfway nice person. But it also helps making them easy to relate to. \"Flowers of Evil\" is not afraid to show the creeps, the perverts, the snobs, the depressing, and the unpleasant. It shows school life exactly for what it really is; a dark, depressing, and at times even scary part of one's life.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana, or \"Flowers of Evil\" began life as a manga that published from 2009 to 2014. It told the story of a young man named Kasuga, and his struggles with growing up and youth. He obsesses over the poetry of Baudelaire; specifically The Flowers of Evil, despite not understanding it. Also in tow were Saeki, his love interest; and Nakamura, a devillish powder keg of a young girl that serves as a source of life and youthful expression, as well as a counter to Kasuga's self-loating and self-pity. While somewhat unbalanced in terms of structure, it does a good job of telling aninteresting story with odd characters and themes. But I'm not here to give the manga a big sappy handjob as a means of glorifying the original work while disparaging the anime adaptation that everyone hates.\\n\\n\r\nIt says a lot about the state of anime and its audience that a show like Aku no Hana was buried and bashed incessantly. The anime adaptation is actually quite good. Its art style is completely unique and memorable, its tone brooding and thick with dread and ever-lingering hostility, and its story is so bizarre and well-executed I wouldn't hesitate to call it great. But that opinion unfortunately isn't shared by the majority of other anime viewers. It was bashed and bloodied over the artistic liberties it took from the manga and crucified over its choice of character design and animation. This, to me, is simultaneously baffling and completely expected at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nI say its baffling because Aku no Hana does everything an adaptation of a visual medium should do. It should faithfully tell the story it's adapting, while doing everything in its power to NOT copy every single thing its source material does. First, Aku no Hana's story isn't dependent on it being depicted visually. It would work just as well as a novel due to its slow as molasses plot structure and independence of flashy plot setting and overly vivid scenes. And what I mean by that is Aku no Hana's plot is slow, methodical, grounded heavily in reality, devoid of action scenes, and does not take place somewhere fantastical. It isn't Gurren Lagann or FLCL where trying to tell the story without the visuals would be excruciatingly difficult and likely to worsen the experience. Not to imply that anything is missing from TTGL or FLCL but my point is, the kind of story Aku no Hana tells isn't one that depends heavily on the way it looks. This is why I don't care about the art style being different from the manga. The manga's artstyle is boring. It works for what it does but it isn't interesting or an absolute necessity to utilize in an animated adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nSo the staff took an experimental approach to the artstyle and animation, positioning very bizarrely rotoscoped against very detailed photorealistic backgrounds. While clearly poised within the uncanny valley, the sloppy and unpolished animation of the characters does so much to strengthen the dark tone and uncomfortable scenes the creators wanted to depict. The jarring visuals clash with everything the audience is used to with regards to how anime characters look and move, which works brilliantly to instill a near constant state of discomfort in the viewer. However, this also alienated it from most mainstream anime fans who couldn't get past its tough-to-love\\n\r\nappearance.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is what brings me to why I find the rejection and hostility Aku no Hana received completely unsurprising, even if it is extremely frustrating. What killed the anime adaptation of Aku no Hana wasn't WHAT it changed or some non-understanding of its source material. What killed it was THAT it changed. Its biggest crime was that it was ugly; that it chose to toss aside the dull visual design of the original manga and try something completely new. And for the type of story that Aku no Hana tells, that change made perfect sense and was executed very well. But in this industry, that didn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people who watch anime just don't want to be challenged. They want to see the same thing they've seen a hundred times. There's a reason why shows like Attack on Titan, Fate/Stay Night, and Sword Art Online have enjoyed very lengthy stays in the animated adaptation realm. They all feature top-dollar animation budgets, hyper-attractive character designs, and extremely basic fan-servicey plots. That's the sort of thing that sells in anime right now. Basically: pretty animation with pretty people that gives the audience exactly what they want without challenging the viewer mentally or emotionally.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping that in mind, it's no wonder Aku no Hana failed. It IS ugly, challenging, and dared to defy its audiences expectations. And that to me is heartbreaking, as it did so much right and was completely rejected. I can only hope that more people give this a shot with an open mind, as it deserves so much more love than the brutal reception it's gotten thus far.",

            "content": "I love that Aku no Hana attempts to create something different, raw, and real. Whether it succeeds or not is up to each individual, but in my personal opinion this anime is a masterful work of art. \r\nI am a big fan of experimental art styles and I think the art is striking in an unconventional way. It doesn\u2019t look like a stereotypical anime where the characters are moeblobs and have eyes that take up half of their face. The rotoscoping captures the awkward nuances of being a living, breathing human being. The characters look and act human. The art perfectly fits a show thatis about the uncomfortable and ugly aspects of the world.  \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is very moody and atmospheric; there are sometimes long stretches of moments without dialogue. The show does an excellent job of capturing the mundane and cyclical nature of everyday life as well as Kasuga\u2019s feelings of alienation and claustrophobia. He is terrified of being ordinary and deludes himself into feeing like he\u2019s above everyone else by reading \u201csophisticated\u201d books and conjuring grandiose, romanticized delusions. \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana, much like Baudelaire\u2019s works that the show is named after, evokes the artificial and paradoxical aspects of life. Ensnared in a mire of failure, sin, agony, and moral degradation, with one hand outstretched towards grace and elevation, and the other towards the animalistic and wretched depths. The suffocation of the spirit and the attempt to rise above the sin, decay, and hypocrisy of the world. \\n",

The animation is kinda weird although I guess I like it. The main character is dumb af and annoying, and don't even talk about that shit of a character that is Nakamura and that acts like a total retard and doesnt do anything disturbing as people say, she just does dumb pointless things to the story that made me want to punch her on her face. The only person that kinda hasa brain is Saeki although shes kinda stupid for even though all kinds of shit happened she still liked that fucking idiot main character. Will never watch this again nor do I recommend this trash to others, maybe just maybe ill read the manga at the most.",

            "content": "When I first saw this I really didn't think much of the artwork and I bet that probably turned a lot of people off, TRUST ME, don't walk away from it. It will grow on you, like it did for me. In the end the art work really complements the story telling and mood of the anime. It kind of provides a sort of surrealism to the whole think. It seems real, but really isn't, kind of feel. \r\nKasuga, the main character, lives in a pretty boring town. He wakes up goes to school, reads books, etc and dreams about his \"muse\" Saeki. That's allhe does, but Nakamura, the deviant, has other plans for him. Kasuga like I said is a pretty boring guy, until he does something that draws the attention of Nakamura. Nakamura is pretty much a deviant. She hates the town she lives in, hates her life and is bored out of it. So she needs some amusement and \"freedom\", so she tries to turn Kasuga into something that he isn't so sure about. Saeki plays the love interest of Kasuga. She's smart, pretty and very well liked by everyone. By the end of the anime, that boring feeling in the beginning turns into something else; it pretty much turns into despair and darkness.\\n\\n\r\nThe way this anime is directed is incredible. They provide us with such a dark mood at times, you even get depressed watching the characters do their things. It definitely is not an anime for kids. A lot of adult and dark themes are explored. From sex, perversion, etc. The characters while not many are enough to garner your attention. Before you know it the episode is over and it didn't even seem like the 20+ minutes passed by. Heck even the ending music is creepy, but delivers a message of what the anime is pretty much about. \"The Flowers of Evil.\" Definitely recommend it. Ignore your first intuition to dump it because of the artwork. You won't be disappointed. Trust me! 9/10.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is an incredibly realistic, quite dark and mostly overlooked anime that deserves more recognition in my opinion. With its striking, spectacular and original art style and very realistic characters, I find it deserving of a 10/10 score, even if some might only appreciate it for how completely different it is from other anime. \r\n(This is technically a spoiler-free review, but it's not really that spoiling the plot would be an issue, as the plot is almost not the focus of the anime, but it's more the premise; so take into consideration that I would like to comment on things that are originaland fascinating about this anime, but I can't, because it would detract from the series' subtleties for you)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana seems to get a lot of harsh criticism from fans of the manga due to the way the anime cuts off partway through the story with the implication that there will be a second season. In reading the manga, I have found that the anime is really something of a separate entity, and has taken on a life of its own. I don't think it's necessary to appreciate the manga to appreciate this anime - in fact, I think the anime takes a much more mature and realistic approach the the story. Others seem to dislike it for its slow pace and the fact that it does not provide immediate gratification. However, I feel that these factors work to create an incredibly realistic story that ends up being very intense, dark and forboding without resorting to obvious symbolism. \\n\r\nThis anime does not treat you like you're stupid. In watching it, I felt like I wasn't being told a story - instead, I felt like I was bearing witness to a chunk of time, watching the events unfold without needing an upfront explanation. There was no need to watch characters have conversations about the premise for me to understand what led to the events shown in the story. \\n\r\nIt's not really possible to accurately summarize this story. The plot this anime follows is not the most outstanding aspect of it - instead, the story is just a vessel for the characters and the atmosphere, and I feel it is very rare to see this in anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is absolutely breathtaking. The characters are set against frankly stunning backgrounds that remind me of the art in Ghost in the Shell. The repeated images of certain places on Kasuga's route to school showing a somewhat run-down, quiet town beautifully depict the dreary and somewhat oppressive atmosphere of the anime, and really add something to the story.\\n\r\nAs for the character art, I have never seen another anime done in rotoscope, and I think it made for an incredible experience. The way it captured the realism in the characters' movements and expressions was truly a unique experience, and definitely gave me a feel for the individuality of each character in a way the art in the manga didn't. The episode in which the art really took my breath away was #7. Just watch it. I can't say anything to spoil it because it truly gave me goosebumps.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very subtle, but was in perfect sync with the atmosphere at all times. In episode 7, the soundtrack really stood out alongside the art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is a slow-burn, very convincingly realistic anime that centers around the 'descent into madness', so to speak, of the lead character Kasuga. It's difficult to explain how realistic the characters and their development over the short period of time really is without giving anything away, however, I will say that I was genuinely taken aback by how realistic the characters, especially Kasuga and Nakamura, turned out to be for me. There is no perfect character in this anime - nobody you can really wholeheartedly love or hate - which is something that makes Aku no Hana so realistic, and, once again, gives the viewer the feeling of simply watching a chunk of time rather than being fed a story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason this is not a 10/10 is because of the lack of immediate gratification provided by this series. It's an anime it is necessary to almost push through to get to the payoff, but that is because of its realism - there aren't incredibly suspenseful cliffhangers like there would be in a horror or action anime. It's about the internal conflict within Kasuga, and for this reason it's not the kind of series one binge-watches out of sheer addiction to a rollercoaster ride of a story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy anime that delves into concepts of psychology, good, evil, identity and emptiness, alongside outstanding art/animation, fascinating characters and a highly realistic portrayal of them, this is the anime for you. \\n\\n",

I know this is a really late review, but since I finished this one late I think it would be a good one to do for my first review. This Aku no Hana's art was original, and I really thought it was going to be refreshing and well done at first. One thing I could not stand however was the blank faces and zoom ins on random characters. Mayu  always made the same faces; such obvious faces that you could tell they were the same. Maybe the zoomins and blank faces are not too big of a deal, but in the end it made the anime very dull and boring to watch. The story was really good I felt it would be one you would either really enjoy, or just not understand the meaning. The ending made me feel empty and not complete, but maybe it was just meant for you to not understand and wonder about what they were going to become. I fell in love with the song at the end. It's honestly hard to even call Kasuga a character. His idenity was completely warped during the whole series by his angel Saeki, or by the devil named Nakamura. Nakumara changed an easily resolvable situation into hell. She changed Kasugas whole personality showing how his mind was so easily warped. Honestly when it comes down to it this anime was not one where I would try to finish it in one night. I usually wasn't too excited to watch the next episode, but I felt I had to finish it to know what was going to happen next. If you can not handle dark scenes then do not watch it, but if you want to watch something psychological give it a shot!",

            "content": "Overall, this anime was decent. I completed the manga not too long ago and enjoyed it, however  this anime kind of had the feeling I was completing a task rather than enjoying it. \r\nThe first downside to this anime is the art and animation. The method they used is rotoscoping. It felt like a lagging video game. The options available for animation are far and wide it is beyond why they used this method. I don't know if this was a purposeful decision to be more artistic and the such, but it came off as a little pretentious. It's a shame because the artaspect of environmental drawings looked really good and very detailed. If there is a second season I hope they improve on this by using a different method. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the story overall, but at times it came off as trying a little too hard. I understand this anime was going to be slow paced but not this slow paced. There was basically one half an episode of two characters walking through the town with no talking. The manga version of this Anime presented the story in a much better way. A person who never read the manga and ended up watching this show would probably find it confusing as to why characters did what they did. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime pretty good. Opening and ending themes were fitting of this sort of anime genre, as well as the voice actors portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all pretty melodramatic. If you like that sort of thing good for you, but I don't. Lets start off with the main character Takao Kasuga. Kasuga is a half-wit for lack of better words. He has no mind or will of his own. Then we have Sawa Nakamura who is clearly certifiable. I guess that is part of her appeal. Finally, we have Nanako Saeki who is in my opinion is the most well-rounded character. She is the girl that is smart, athletic, and good looking. Basically every guy in the class wants to be with her. She spends a lot of time crying. Throughout the series the characters deteriorate instead of progress forward. Maybe in the second season we'll see more character development. The characters reactions overall were unrealistic. This is the kind of anime that aims to be realistic but instead comes off as extremely exaggerated. I feel like you can enjoy the show more when you have a character in it that you can personally relate to, but that was missing here for me. I find Yamada to be the most entertaining character even though his part is small. At least he is the comedic relief in an otherwise dull anime.  \\n",

            "content": "I was skeptical of even going into this anime after being introduced to it by a friend. Just as a had originally thought, I had to force myself through most of it until the last few episodes. \r\nCharacters: The anime just does not seem to do a great job of placing the main characters into their respective age group as defined by the anime. Which left me with a subjective view of the characters from the very beginning. The only attribute that fit Nakamura and Kasuga from their age-group was childishness. The way they acted about their situations was interesting, complex, and childish at thesame time. They will at times leave you confused and struggling to understand them but try not to put too much thought into it. (Kasuga kind of pisses me off but, hey, nothing I can do about his character development.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story in itself can hold your interest but it feels like a lot of meaningless emphasis was put on the boredom of the town. I understand the fact that it was meant to be that way, but it only required a minute or two of that emphasis at most per episode to get that point across. This was the one and only real quirk I had with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound: The animation is unique to this anime, but it takes time to get used to, so you can't go into this one with the mindset of how an anime is supposed to look. It requires a clean slate or you'll just disappoint yourself  and probably miss some of it's worth due to over-thinking it. Just as the visuals of the town show, the music is to match, again emphasis on the boredom of the town not needed to get the point across. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The story and characters themselves were the saving grace of this series. The ending was interesting but I don't believe there is going to be another season to the series. Earned a 7 (barely as it took me more than half the series to settle in and not have to force myself through it) for uniqueness, as well as an interesting concept and character development. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana, or Flowers of Evil is quite the controversial anime. It can be viewed as a love story, a love triangle even. Or, a phycological journey that the main male character goes through from start to finish. Our protagonist is an introverted guy. He is shy, awkward, and spends his time reading books. He has a little crush on his class mate, Saeki. Yet he never got the courage to confess his feelings for her, especially that she is the main topic of the guys in his class. However our introverted guy\u2019s life is changed forever when he finds Saeki\u2019s gym clothes afterschool one day.\\n\\n\r\n Aku no Hana combines the complexities of romance, with psychology. The gym uniform becomes the biggest component in our protagonist\u2019s journey to Saeki\u2019s heart while trying to conceal the fact that he is the one who has her gym uniform. His very own shyness and fear lead him to befriend the class\u2019 outcast student. A girl with no friends, one who does not respect anyone. With these elements: A crush, a stolen gym uniform, a witness who uses her knowledge to blackmail the guy, and you have the whole that is Aku no Hana. This nature complex of the show, the psychological nature of the events and the behavior the characters display has not appealed to many.\\n\\n\r\n It is dark in nature, the mood of the anime is reflected in colors; the sky is always grey in color. It reflects what is going trough with our guy, Kasuga Takai. He is quite, and miserable most of the time; engaging with inner monologues to try and reason with himself. However none of his monologues has lead him anywhere, nor did they provide him with answers. He seeks salvation and a way to redeem himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main characters in this anime are the min component of the show. Introverted shy Kasuga. Beautiful, soft-spoken Saeki, and the trouble maker, Nakamura. Having all three combined together spells trouble. Having found Saeki\u2019s gym uniform and found out by Nakamura was the beginning of Kasuga\u2019s plight. He is a coward, hesitant, and a defeatist. He cannot voice his thoughts or even be assertive about them. He is easily goaded by Nakamura who uses him as she pleases, he is the perfect prey for her to toy with. Saeki is quite oblivious to what is happening; all she knows is that Kasuga likes her and that is it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes this show. They are the driving force that gets everything moving. The focus is only on those three; it is all that is needed to get the plot moving. Their actions and interactions makes up the greatest part of the anime. The characters represent extremes: good/innocence and evil, and the one tossed in between. Nakamura lies at the evil/experience end, with Saeki on the other good/innocence end. Kasuga is in between them, he is somewhat of an innocent inexperienced guy, who has to experience things he is not very comfortable with, yet he has no choice in the matter.\\n\r\n It is similar to life\u2019s experience; what we go through pushes is to make stands we might not be comfortable with, yet we have to do them anyways. Those three are a representation of life, how everyone starts off as an innocent inexperienced person, and as they grow and go through different phases of life they become more knowledgeable and sometimes downright evil. It is that experience that shapes us an make us who we are. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really sets the mood for this anime, and also adds to it\u2019s theme is the art. Aku no Hana is quite realistic; the mundane everyday life of school kids. Getting involved in deviant actions and the psychological spiral Kasuga goes through. He is a miserable boy, that\u2019s for sure. He rarely, if ever, smiles. The art reflects his persona very well. The atmosphere is dark, the sky is always grey, and everything is not so colorful despite it being colored. The colors are sort of dull, they are just there, but they don\u2019t shine or stand out. They just blend into the background and the overall grey-ness of the sky. \\n\r\nDecadence of human spirit is seen through the colors and buildings as well. They are old, broken down, decayed, and rusty. Baudelaire is mentioned throughout, his very own Les Fleurs du mal (Flowers of Evil) is what moves the plot, not to mention the title of the anime. Baudelaire\u2019s Flowers of Evil poetry depicts decadence and eroticism, which is what this anime is about. The art plays out these two themes, by the background colors and the designs of the buildings and roads. Decadence is seen clearly in the buildings and signs, the colors nearly gone due to their age and rust.\\n\\n\r\nSounds are very simple; there are no elaborated musical peaces to accompany heated dialogues. When two characters argue, the only sounds come from them, their yells and intakes of breath. The musical pieces are quite and they get higher in tone when intensity picked up in some situations. The sounds simplicity adds further to the theme; it serves as an extension to the characters (mainly Kasuga\u2019s) thoughts and feelings. The low tones reflects his inner weakness and lack of motivation, and as they get higher we see how he becomes more determined and speaks up. The sounds serve their purpose, to further add to the overall atmosphere and the mental state of the characters. \\n\r\nThe Ending theme is very innovative, and quite catchy.  \\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is not an anime many would love and enjoy. It provokes more questions than answers; the slow pacing, and the inner monologue of the main character provide the main component of the show. It deals with the self; how one views themselves and how they react when pulled out of their comfort zone. Would they try to adapt? Or would they snap? \\n\r\nAku no Hana does not provide you with comfort; on the contrary. It pushes you out of your comfort zone, engages your senses, get on your nerves, and doesn\u2019t give you the answers you seek. Not only for the viewers, but for the characters themselves. It pushes and pushes, until they snap, and when they do? Things start to get out of hand. This anime is thought provoking, keeps you guessing what is going to occur next. It shocks you, repulses you, and alienate you. It throws you in this vortex with no way out, from the minute is starts until the credits roll after the final episode.\\n",

            "content": "Aku No Hana is a study of three early adolescents enduring puberty and trying to discover themselves, whether they want to or not.  There are three principal characters.\r\nThe first of the three is the protagonist, Kasuga Takaro an introverted and widely read third year middle school student.  He lives at home with both parents.  His mother is a typical housewife, usually cooking dinner.  Kasuga\u2019s father is also a bookworm and passes along reading suggestions including the eponymous \u201cAku no Hana,\u201d a collection of poems by the mid-Nineteenth Century French author, Baudelaire.   \r\nThe book, \u201cAku no Hana\u201d has a profoundeffect on Kasuga, although he confesses that he doesn\u2019t understand the text completely.  While there are no direct quotes from the work, the anime suggests that \u201cAku no Hana\u201d has an existential quality, one that has a greatly affect young readers who are dealing with self-identity.  \\n\\n\r\nThe quest for self-identity develops in a depressing setting.  Kasuga describes his isolated town as \u201crust, gaming parlors, and weeds.\u201d  It is surrounded by mountains which act as both a natural and figurative \u201cfence\u201d to be crossed.  Striking down barriers and fences is the mission of the second principal character, Nakaumra Sawa, another introverted and troubled classmate of Kasuga\u2019s.  She defies authority and the \u201csystem,\u201d showing blatant disrespect to her teachers and refusal to participate in exams, turning in blank pieces of paper.  She is very intelligent and insightful with a strong judge of character, but is greatly troubled.   Her search for a kindred spirit leads her to Kasuga.  \\n\r\nThe third character is the class star, straight A student, popular, bright, brilliant and beautiful Nanako Saeki.  Kasuga is smitten and while his male classmates make fun of his attraction to Saeki, fate twists a triangle of angst and attraction that bring all three together.\\n\\n\r\nKasuga, while going home realizes that he has left a book in his desk.  He returns to an empty classroom, gets the book, but notices Saeki\u2019s used gym clothes that have fallen out of her locker.  He sniffs the gym clothes and in a moment of indiscretion, steals the clothes.   Kasuga believes that he is alone, but Nakamura has seen him.   \\n\r\nKasuga encounters Nakamura on a bike path.  They talk, and she climbs on to the back of his bike, saying, take me to the other side of that mountain pointing to a distant hill.  She has discovered another \u201chentai\u201d such as she describes herself.  She threatens to expose him as a pervert if he doesn\u2019t do what she asks.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the following days in class, Nakamura is falsely accused of stealing lunch money.   Kasuga defends her, saying that she did not, and that the accusations are groundless.   Saeki is impressed with Kasuga\u2019s courage to stand up for what\u2019s right.  Later they meet and Saeki discovers that there is a lot more to Kasuga than what first impressions tell.  They date and begin a romantic relationship.\\n\r\nThus the triangle is formed.  Kasuga has moments of courage, but more often than not, his cowardly side wins out and he runs away.  Saeki is hurt by his actions, but as the story unfolds, she begins to understand that she has no real identity.  Everything she has done, study, cram school, piano lessons, etc .have all been imposed by her parents and teachers.  \\n\\n\r\nNakamura continues to have a profound effect on Kasuga as well as Saeki.  She says that she is determined to break down the walls that they have built around themselves.  Three young teenagers, each with character defects placed in an isolated setting and being influenced by Baudelaire\u2019s esoteric  poetry sets the tree on a path to disaster.  \\n\\n\r\nI was drawn into the story and followed it intently, not being sure where things would lead, but having a strong hunch.  \\n\\n\r\nYou will have to watch the remainder of the anime to see how things turn out.  There\u2019s a lot more in store for the three.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Flowers of Evil (or Aku no Hana) is one of the most divisive anime of the past few years. Many decry it as an ugly waste of time, while others praise it for being a brilliant work of artistic expression. Seeing as it ranks this high on my all-time favorites, it is obvious where I stand in this argument. Flowers of Evil is as core-shaking an experience as I have ever had watching an anime. It is a show that so perfectly frames itself in the minds of its disturbed characters that it is honestly frightening.\r\nThe story is one of adolescent angst, insecurity, anger, andsexual deviance. It follows Takao Kasuga, an introverted middle school student who has a love for literature and a distaste for most of his classmates, even those he frequently associates with. The one person he doesn't think badly of is his crush, Nanako Saeki, whom he idolizes but hardly has any interaction with. That is until one evening, in a single moment of horrible judgment, he goes through Saeki's P.E. uniform and ends up sneaking off with it in a panic when he thinks he might get caught. Unfortunately, he was seen by someone, resident trouble child Sawa Nakamura, who blackmails him into a \"contract\" with her. From here the show becomes a slow- burning nightmare of adolescence, digging into the darkest recesses of the teenage psyche.\\n\\n\r\nIf it isn't already evident, Flowers of Evil centers around deeply flawed, fairly despicable teenagers. Needless to say, they aren't exactly the most likeable of characters. They are, however, incredibly interesting ones. Kasuga is an accurate and brutally honest depiction of a disgruntled teenage misfit who reasons the fact he doesn't fit in because he's special and that 'no one else understands him'. Kasuga is rather asocial, preferring to spend his free time reading rather than socializing with his classmates. He idolizes Baudelaire, but has no admiration for the people in his life (except Saeki). He looks down on most of his classmates for not being as well-read as him, but paradoxically doesn't want them to think badly of him despite actively isolating himself from them. Like many teens, he's self-absorbed yet lacks self-control and maturity, which makes him very susceptible to Nakamura's poisonous influence.\\n\\n\r\nNakamura, on the other hand, clearly doesn't give a damn what anyone thinks of her; she's violently antisocial and her contempt for everyone around her is palpable. Her foul mouth is only matched by the bleakness of her outlook. She takes pleasure in her wanton harassment of Kasuga, and seems happiest when she is prodding him into doing something wrong. Yet behind all the malice, there is something humanly broken about her. Through glimpses into her personal life and the rare crack of vulnerability in her otherwise sadistic demeanor, it is shown that Nakamura is a self-loathing individual who's frustration manifests in her nihilistic worldview.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the central characters is Kasuga's crush, Saeki. Unlike the other two leads, she's actually fairly popular at school and seems like a perfectly well rounded teenager... at least at first. The layers of her nice girl image are peeled back as she becomes entangled with Kasuga and Nakamura in a twisted love triangle, revealing deep seeded insecurities. For as popular as she is, Saeki perceives herself as a painfully unremarkable and empty person. She sees Kasuga as someone interesting because of his love for literature, and wants to be close to him because of this. Her uneasiness about his relationship with Nakamura leads her to have an unhealthy possessiveness over him. This is where the brilliance of the narrative lies. Where most other anime are picturesque in their depiction of adolescence, Flowers of Evil is biter and uncomfortable; enveloped in never ending melancholy. While it mighty be overwhelmingly bleak, there certainly is truth in this pessimistic version of adolescence, especially for the damaged characters of this warped coming-of-age story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it's time to address the elephant in the room, the cause of the controversy surrounding this anime: the art style. Flowers of Evil utilities an animation technique called rotoscoping, in which the animators trace over live-action footage frame by frame. This technique is hardly anything new, it's been used in films such as Richard Linklater's \"A Scanner Darkly\", and even used for certain scenes in anime. What sets Flowers of Evil apart is the strange lack of detail in the character designs, which needless to say aren't the most attractive and a far-cry from those of the source material. This, of course, is what generated the controversy.\\n\\n\r\nStrange as this might seem, I think this was a brilliant visual decision. The minimalist character designs contrast with the highly detailed backgrounds, which makes the show look and feel like a waking nightmare. It's as if the characters' negative emotions and warped worldviews are leaking in the visual design; the town is rotting and filled with \"shit-eaters\" as Nakamura would call them.\\n\\n\r\nHiroshi Nagahama's direction of this nightmarish tale is impeccable. As with his other works, Nagahama demonstrates his affinity for cinematic flourish. The constant re-use of the same backgrounds creates a constricting atmosphere. Kasuga and Nakamura feel like they trapped in their small town; likewise, the viewer is inescapably stuck in the heads of these immensely screwed up adolescents. The languorous pacing of events captures the ennui and emptiness that the characters feel. The minimalist ambiance of the soundtrack encapsulates the looming dread which permeates throughout the show, punctuated by the sound of rolling thunder. The moments when tension finally snap, such as the classroom destruction scene, are simultaneously cathartic and horrifying; microcosms of teenage frustration in of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThough it doesn't adapt the entire manga, and probably never will due to poor Blu-ray sales, Aku no Hana feels like a full experience. It captures the darkest parts of adolescence with its unique aesthetic and brutal honesty. Perhaps most admirably, it is an example of artistic risk taking in a medium that all too often is too commercially driven.",

The art style is very unique; instead of regular animation they used animation that kind of resembles scribbly pencil drawings. But for some reason, it made it work for this anime. \r\nIf you have read the manga and plan on watching the anime, I must warn you that it will be disappointing. I felt that the creators of this show made it a little to slow, and added unnecessary things to the plot. It does get good, but towards the end you'll justsit there and go \"That's it?\" \\n\\n\r\nI can tell that  the creators did this on purpose to get you to read the manga. If you're interested in continuing this series after the anime ends, I would read the manga. It gets more in depth into the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a little creepy, the style was unique/weird but I enjoyed it.

I found the Art/Sound to not be necessary in this story at all and therefore didn't weight them into my Overall rating.\r\nThe pacing can be slow for a lot of younger folks who are bombarded withvisual stimulation at rates exceeding what's needed.  In today's \"want it now\" society I can see why some viewers are unhappy with the pacing.  For me it was near perfect.  There are reasons behind the slow spots and if you're willing to indulge your own imagination during these times you will be greatly rewarded.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime enough that I went right out and re-read the entire manga.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've done that in 20+ years.  \\n\\n\r\nThat alone was an indicator, to me, that this anime was special.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like slow pacing then this probably won't be a good anime for you.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy great stories and characters then this is definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Beyond the edge of the world lies only darkness, driving you mad.\"\r\nOh man, what a trip this was.\r\nOut of all the anime to begin airing throughout the course of 2013, Aku No Hana was by far the most unusual. I remember reading the description of the series and the feeling of my brain oozing out of my ears due to the confusion I had endured within that twenty second time-frame. But that description alone brought no justice to what was soon going to grace the TV screens of many unsuspecting Japanese citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, please strap on your seat belts because we are aboutto embark on a 13-episode flight with major turbulence and no pilot.\\n\\n\r\nAku No Hana, based on the manga by Shuuzou Oshimi,  puts us behind Takao Kasuga, an introverted middle-school boy. Takao lives at home with his parents, who seem relatively normal. Both Takao and his father share a passion for reading, which ultimately leads to Takao's father lending his son a copy of Charles Baudelaire's \"Le Fleurs du mal\" or \"The Flowers of Evil.\" For those unfamiliar with the content of \"Le Fleurs du mal,\" keep it that way if you know what's good for you. For after reading the book, Takao's behavior changed. And by no means was that change for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThe next day in school, Takao wanders into his classroom after school and winds up stealing the gym clothes of his crush (Nanako Saeki.) However, he was not alone at that time. He was spotted by another female classmate (Sawa Nakamura) and called out on it in private. Fearful of this act of deviancy escaping unto his classmates, Takao joins into a \"contract\" with the girl who spotted him. But this is no ordinary contract, this girl aims to break him down, piece by piece.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the description of this anime on various websites will NOT tell you is that it is the journey into the terrifying minds of several different deranged teenagers, struggling to grow up and live normal lives. It strays from the typical character advancement that is commonly depicted in currently-airing shows, and focuses more on the dark undertones of what confused children can wind up doing without the attention or the help they need. The beautiful thing about this show, however, is just how completely dependent our three main characters are on each other.\\n\\n\r\nI have dissected the anime into a few key components to better illustrate the different aspects of it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nI fell in love with the soundtrack of this anime the second the first opening song came on. Being so unlike anything I've ever heard in an anime before, I was extremely taken aback. Each of the three main characters winds up getting their own opening song, but the best part of this is that the lyrics within their respective songs all apply to the internal conflicts the characters face in some way or another. The BGM during the actual show will make you feel incredibly uncomfortable, while as the ending song will creep you the hell out and leave you suspended in mid-air until the next episode. This soundtrack was almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nNever before have I witnessed characters as dark, and yet realistic, as this. Takao is a boy struggling to fit in, trying to cast away his problems and live a normal life. But he keeps getting sucked back in by Sawa Nakamura, an isolated and incredibly deranged girl that knows no boundaries and will say whatever she wants to say to whoever she wants to say it to. All the while, Nanako Saeki is sitting on the sidelines and internally disintegrating. My favorite part of this entire series was just watching her character basically destroy itself from the inside out. It was truly fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nHere is the falling point of the series. The art within Aku No Hana is completely rotoscoped. Or in other words, it looks like shit. Being so different from the art in the manga, this aspect drove many viewers away within the first five-ten minutes of the show. Character's faces don't appear until they are closer to the imaginary camera, lines are constantly fading in and out, it just doesn't look good. HOWEVER, it is just this that makes you feel so much more uncomfortable while watching. The characters look so incredibly odd and the rotoscoped art style displays real facial expressions, rather than typical animated ones we have seen time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nI've always been a fan of darkness when it comes to a story. I enjoy the feeling of a somewhat ill-hope for characters that, deep down, are terrible people. And watching these characters fall deeper and deeper into darkness is what makes Aku No Hana astounding.",

            "content": "I love Aku No Hana.\r\nBut I didn't enjoy it very much.\r\nDoes it sound like contradiction? Let me explain it.\r\nIf you were to ask a stranger what do they associate with Anime, they would either answer with silence or label it as \"disturbing japanese stuff\". Which, when you think about it, isn't necessarily that far from the truth. No one will be shocked by the fact an anime protagonist is a 14 year old girl with big breasts and pink hair. Japanese culture is different, things like that are just accepted. And Anime takes full advantage of the fact that those who don't watch don't care.\r\nAndin such wacky world of anime Aku No Hana was created.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed about Aku No Hana is its pace. It's slow. Instead of constantly pandering to the viewer, Aku No Hana methodically achieves its own pace. If you get annoyed by the fact there's lots of scenery shots instead of more dialogues and monologues, Aku No Hana isn't for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strong points of Aku No Hana is definitely the art. It's realistic, somber, simplistic and depressive. You feel like the author wasn't trying very hard but still displayed human beings a lot more realistically than 99% of other animes do. There are not many bright colors, in fact Aku No Hana is dominated by grey, and I found that very fitting. No complaints from me, I can only conclude that the artwork was outstanding. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes were ok, but nothing that you'll remember two weeks after watching the series. The background music is very fitting, ranging from quiet piano pieces to sheer silence. The ending theme however was truly something else and a truly remarkable way to end every episode. If you like the series, you'll like how it sounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI quite liked the character development. The main characters face many obstacles throughout the course of the series, and always DO THEIR BEST. I question their morality, but their efforts are impressive. Yet, due to human imperfection most of the time they just flat out fail. And, even when they succeed they often question their decisions and/or feel regret. due to their incompetence. The motives that drive the protagonists are those of disobeying modern society and protecting their friends, which fits their age. You could also interpret it as if their incompetence comes from the lack of experience in life, which is of course due to their age. I didn't especially like any of the characters, but that's probably the last thing you'd want from an anime that deals with the topic of life's boredom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told not only through the actions of the protagonists, it's also told through the great audio-visual work put into this anime. And with all that said I still have to add that I didn't enjoy it in the traditional sense of the word. I think that you'd have to be disturbed for Aku No Hana to bring you joy, and that a psychological horror is a perfect description for it. Aku No Hana is creepy-and creepiness lies between the known and the unknown. And Aku No Hana walks that line almost perfectly.\\n",

            "content": "Aku no hana was so visually interesting, and had such enjoyably ominous background \"music\", that I could almost overlook it's lack of content.\r\n     The basic theme deals with \"normalcy\" vs \"deviancy\", something anyone who's ever been a teenager can understand. But as anyone who's ever climbed out of their teenage years can understand, it's a fairly hollow and superficial subject. What's normal is obviously subjective, and the idea of being a \"deviant\" is only a persona we assign ourselves or others to catagorize the world in a quantitative, but ultimately futile, way. We wouldn't want toface a world where we're all just humans, we have to put everyone in pens and assign them roles and scales and numbers and quantities so that we can imagine an order to the chaos. (Easily seen in almost every anime where characters are fit neatly into stereotypical roles). At least the roles of these characters weren't the usual anime stereotypes. I'll give them that. But it clings to the theme like Kate Winslet on a peice of the Titanic... gripping it for dear life because it's the only life line. I suppose that's my main problem with the show. Life doesn't center around a central theme.\\n\r\n     Sawai comes off as someone who simply has \"small town syndrome\". She's basically just bored with the small world around her, living in a small town. Her obsession with \"breaking down walls\" of normalcy is nothing more than an over glorified fight against cabin fever. She's also not a deviant... or rather, she's a \"forced deviant\". A real deviant wouldn't go around saying that word all the time, nor would they recognize that there were \"walls to break down\" inside oneself because they never would have had those walls to begin with. They just go about their \"deviant\" life acting \"deviously\", maybe realizing that others see them as different, but not really able to grasp how different they are and why.\\n\r\n    Takao, the main character, is a drama queen (which is especially off putting because he's a GUY). He sees the world in the color of poetry, and it makes his world view unrealistically idealistic and emotional... which is why he idealized Saeki as some sort of object or idea instead of a human. He wants to quantify the world, but in an emotional, qualitative way (if that makes any sense). \\n\r\n     Saeki, of coarse, is just a normal inexperienced girl, who jumped on the chance to explore a new facet of life (dating). She wanted it so bad she was willing to put up with that sad sack Takao. Kind of pathetic, and not too enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\n    The story is slow paced, which is nice. It matches the background music / sound well, and helped stretch out the show's lack of  content. Nothing really gets faced or resolved despite the many confrontations, especially due to the main character's reluctance to face life (he'd rather hide in a book he doesn't really even understand). I don't even know if you can call the last scene a resolution, but, there may be hope. \"End of Part One\" implies there will be a part two.",

            "content": "What I'd heard about Aku no Hana was that is had an intense, gripping story and interesting art style, so I gravitated towards it eagerly with not too much background on it. Though after watching it, I can confidently say that it definitely unalike anything I've ever seen. Aku no Hano is something that I didn't necessarily get enjoyment out of, but I feel I have to take away immense respect and overall appreciation for the show. \r\nStory (8/10): the main story was personally torturous to sit through. It follows main main character Kasuga Takao, a middle school student, who keeps to himself and isa fan of obscure books. One day as he finds himself faced with the opportunity to take his crush's, the angelic Saeki Nanako, gym clothes, so he guiltily does. To his horror, the class pariah Nakamura spots him doing this. She uses the knowledge of Takao having Saeki's gym clothes as the ultimate blackmail, forcing him to do terrible things. And if he refuses her, she threatens to tell the class of his actions. This is the main driving factor of the swiftly moving plot, along with an undertone of dark romance. But not only what Nakamura does to Takao made me very uncomfortable, but also the fact they're supposed to be middle schoolers. They're doing some pretty fucked up shit for just hitting puberty! \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): the simplistic/realistic art style I thought worked well. A unique story deserves a unique representation, I suppose. I can see how people have issues with it, but overall I thought it didn't take anything away, but just added something a little more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): the varying openings and the super ominous ending theme worked very well with the vibe of the show. The music overall just added a touch of unease, which only triggered more mixed feelings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): the characters are probably the best thing overall. You have the fairly demure, average \"deviant\" Takao contrasting with the outspoken, perverted \"deviant\" Nakamura- which leads to interesting chemistry as they find themselves seemingly entangled with each other. Then you also see the genuinely sweet Saeki, who seems to be Nakamura's complete opposite in almost every way. The way the characters interacted got me hooked, and I was very motivated to see if they would ever end up happy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10): I found it very hard to enjoy this show, one of the main ideas of the show being blackmail. I felt terrible for Takao as he went through Nakamura's psychotic treatment, and how his character began to twist due to the constant pressure he was experiencing. Also, I grew to despise the concept of deviance, and how Nakamura abused it to slowly chip at Takao's sanity. Looking back, I can appreciate the show much more, but as I was watching it, I definitely did not feel the same admiration. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend Aku no Hana to anyone looking for something very psychologically intriguing or something they'll be able to feel an array of strong emotions while watching.         \\n",

            "content": "I'm going to try to keep this review as brief and spoiler free as possible. If you're a fan of the psychological/drama genre then this anime is for you, however if you're easily deterred by unconventional art - skip this one.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nWhile the story revolves mainly around three characters it's not too difficult to follow, however along the line it gets highly philosophical and even bizarre in a kind of positive way that is usually common for the psychological genre, it enveloped me completely and even made me feel uneasy about some of the events. Sadly from the 13-th episode the anime turns into afull recap of the events and a teaser for a season two that isn't going to be made.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nFor most people the art either makes it or brakes it. In this case the art is unconventional to say the least, and reminds more of a live action movie than an anime. While the art may seem terrible to most people, I got used to it around episode three and later found that it fits perfectly with the main theme the anime is trying to portray. (character design and animation is what I had in mind.)  Backgrounds on the other hand were done exceptionally well, adding swiftly to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIt's been quite some time since I've seen soundtrack and sound effects that match so perfectly with the anime, zero complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development 6/10\\n\r\nKasuga - Main character your typical cliche anime portagonist, that has difficulty normally communicating with other people except for his friends.\\n\r\nNanako - The girl in class that Kasuga admires from a distance, later she turns out to be more in arms reach than MC originally thought.\\n\r\nNakamura - Another girl from Kasuga's class, the only words I can use to describe her - relentless psychopath, that tries to \"destroy the walls that Kasuga has built around himself.\"\\n\r\nOther than these three, the supporting characters were completely shallow and unmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nIntro 1/10\\n\r\nI don't know if the intro should be addressed, but it felt like it was completely out of place regarding the dark and sinister theme the anime was portraying.\\n\\n\r\nOutro 10/10\\n\r\nGave me the creeps every time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nWhile \"Flowers of evil\" isn't an anime for an ordinary viewer, fans of this genre might find it quite enjoyable. While coming to a climax that never takes place, it falls completely under it's own shadow. It's creepy, it's strange, but for some reason I couldn't stop watching. However the dullness of the main character and the love triangle sort of ruined it for me, aswell as the ending definitely isn't something you'd hope for. All in all it's worth a watch with low expectations.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*\r\nAku No Hana is rather specific anime, that is different. I mean, very different.\r\nStory:9-great\r\nMeet Kasuga Takao, a boy who loves to read books and is passionate about them. The book that he is reading is (of course) \"Flowers of Evil\" by Bodlaire aka. Aku No Hana. That book changed his way of looking at things in life (or maybe...). He is living pretty much an ordinary life, until the day that he stoles one of his classmates'(Saeki Nanako's) gym uniform. In the rush of hormones, he runs away with it. Although he thought that he was cut away from world in that very moment, someonespotted him. And that was his classmate Nakamura Sawa. She isn't afraid to shove middle finger into anybody; her teacher is no exception. One day, Nakamura told him that she saw him, and they made a contract. No need to say that she will make #$%& with Kasuga in the next 10 or so episodes. And story slowly unfolds. I would say that this was a great plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt:5-mediocre\\n\r\nMeh. But you shouldn't judge the whole anime by the way it's drawn. There is also a whole story that waits for you. Even if 3D like anime isn't your cup of tea, give it a try. For me, three words: not a fan.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10-outstanding\\n\r\nI love it how OP changes on every three or so episodes. And have you heard the ending song? Although it's somewhat weird, I like it. *hana ga, hana ga saitayo*\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8-very good\\n\r\nOf course it's very good! How could you make a good psychological anime without a good character development. Just pay attention to the signs that characters give.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3-poor\\n\r\nIt felt like story was really slow. Maybe it's just me, but I think that something more could have been done. Maybe some fan service? I dunno. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:3-poor\\n\r\nIt was sad. The ending. I cried so many tears at the end... 'cause it was bad AF. If you watched the anime and read the manga you will understand me: good input-bad, BAD output. So many things could have been done. But no. You had to put 20 minutes of recap, one minute of understandable ending that was cut out because of the budget and \"End of Part One\" at the end. Although its ending was bad, I would recommend you to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Are you team Saeki or team Nakamura?\\n",

            "content": "Well, I think I can safely say I\u2019ll never see an anime like Aku no Hana again. It reminds me of the old adage \u201ctoo weird to live, too rare to die\u201d. I\u2019ll spare you the flowery intro and just get right into the meat of this thing as I already have a pretty in-depth review of the manga should you be interested in my rambling, incoherent thoughts on Aku no Hana\u2019s general premise. This is mostly going to cover what I did and didn\u2019t like about the adaptation as opposed to the story and such, as it is identical to the manga\u2019s. \r\nThings Iliked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nIt is faithful to the source material \u2013 The Aku no Hana manga is so good. I have it rated as a 9 right now, but I bet after rereading I\u2019ll bump it up to a 10. The anime covers about the first third of the manga. It doesn\u2019t deviate at all which suits me just fine. The story is so well put together that any changes would have went over like a fart in church.\\n\\n\r\nThings I didn\u2019t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe anime only covers about the first third of the manga \u2013 The second arc is probably the best part of the manga. The third arc ties everything together beautifully. Hope you hadn\u2019t planned on seeing them because this thing BOMBED.\\n\\n\r\nThings I liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing \u2013 The OST is melancholic and atmospheric. The ending theme sounds like a dead robot singing at its own funeral. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nThings I didn\u2019t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe last episode is a glorified recap with spoilers for a non-existent second season \u2013 Umm, that pretty much says it all right there.\\n\\n\r\nThings I liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe acting \u2013 Very solid, you can tell the actors cared about their roles and a lot of effort went into creating the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThings I didn\u2019t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe casting \u2013 That being said the cast was way too old to be playing middle-schoolers. A lot of what made the manga so good was that the characters were just kids. A huge theme of the thing is supposed to be the changes that come with puberty. The guy that plays Kasuga was pushing 20 when this was made\u2026I realize that it would have been pretty risqu\u00e9 to have actual kids in these roles, but they were already making a weird, experimental series. Why compromise there?   \\n\\n\r\nThings I liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe animation \u2013 Yup. Aku no Hana is rotoscoped. They filmed everything with real (old) actors and then animated over it and had voice actors dub it. It\u2019s something that takes some getting used to, but it suits the type of story being told. It\u2019s ugly at times, but these are supposed to be gangly, awkward teens. Yeah I kind of miss cute Nakamura too, but I mean come on, she\u2019s supposed to be a creepy loner, not an object of your (or my) sick fancy.  \\n\\n\r\nThings I didn\u2019t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:\\n\r\nThe animation \u2013 It\u2019s pretty common knowledge that the reason this didn\u2019t get a second season is because everyone hated the rotoscoping. It\u2019s a shame, but that\u2019s the price you pay for experimenting I guess. I would have preferred traditional animation if it meant getting the whole story adapted, even if some of the unique atmosphere was lost, but it was never meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed Aku no Hana. Yes there are some glaring flaws but it\u2019s just so unique and the source material is so strong that it\u2019s pretty easy to overlook them. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d recommend to just anyone, but if you\u2019re looking for something different in a medium where different is getting to be more and more rare, check this out.\\n",

            "content": "This is a SPOILER FREE review.\r\nTo kick off things, this anime is NOT a 10/10. That is my personal opinion. With a more objective view I would rate this anime at 8 out of 10. It is not anime for the faint of heart or for people who enjoy \"fast food\" anime. It is an anime for people who appreciate the image and can enjoy a much different type of anime, that are not following the \"rules\".\r\n Let's jump right into the scores:\r\nStory 9/10: The only reason this is not a 10, is because of the ending. The story is about a middle school boy,who's troubled by his view of the world, more or less, a confused teenage, typical teenage drama, right? No, it evolves in a breathtaking drama story with stunning visual to go along the way. It depicts the small Japanese town society in an absolutely terrifying way! The strictness of this society, the social dead-ends people meat. The way that other people's words can play with your mind. It is a coming-of age anime, in the darkest way possible. Be ready though, for slow scenes. As I said, this anime is for people can appreciate a slower pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: This section is going to be cut in smaller parts, in order to perfectly define this anime's art.\\n\r\n#1 Backgrounds: Here, most people will agree, the drawings of the backgrounds are master level, especially for a TV anime, reaching the levels of 5 Centimeters per Second. They are truly eye candy.\\n\r\n#2 Character Design: This is either a 10/10 or 1/10. For me, it is the first. The characters look weird, by all means. However, this immensely realistic look, I could even call it hyper realistic (?) is just breathtaking. Each character is really unique, the clothing are just perfect. The anime focuses a lot on body language, since at times the facial expressions are hidden completely, which for me is a really nice touch. Sometimes the body says much more than the mouth. Be warned though, this style is not for a lot of people. It is NOT your typical anime.\\n\r\n#3 Animation: The animation is a bit of experimental here. I might have enjoyed something smoother, although by the end of the anime, I liked it so much I wanted more. It is on the slow side, probably less than 20 frames per second, so it needs a bit to get used to, but I believe it is really enjoyable and serves the purpose.\\n\r\n#4 Atmosphere: Here is where this anime shines bright! The colors, the locations, the whole creepiness. It all just sits perfect in conjunction with all the rest.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The OST is magical! That is the best way to describe it. I know when the music makes me cry and I have to search it afterwards, that it is doing something right. The ending was also really nice, cannot say the same about the opening sadly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10: I would have liked to see more character development on Sawa Nakamura, the only reason again this is not 10/10 :) . The main character Kasuga is somehow not exactly your typical teenager! Filled with dark thoughts and doubts, he is probably not relatable to the audience (for the best I guess), somehow if you can relate to him then this anime will become something more. The struggle of love, the magnification of problems that aren't really serious, all the s**t a teenager's mind can muster, it is in here. It is done in a scarily realistic way, which makes it even better. The girl of the anime, Sawa Nakamura, is a mystery. She is crazy, weirdly sexual and an outcast. Again perfectly depicted with the exception of her background which comes too late in the anime. Generally, all the characters are really well developed, even the not really important ones, which adds to the realism this anime tries to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: People who enjoy dark/drama stories will probably enjoy this. It is just the right amount of creepiness and sadness for a perfect mixture of sad anime.\\n\\n\r\nExtra: The opening really ruined some of the pacing at points, but doesn't really ruin the anime thank god. I would heavily recommend this to people who have read Oyasumi Punpun and are searching something similar in anime. This anime is what I would the avant garde of anime. It is more than the stupid \"fast food\" anime like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online and it is more \"progressive\" than some the best anime out there. I would definitely suggest this to anybody who wants a serious anime, as long as you are ready to handle the art-style, which is not easy! Still, give it a try.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana is a school-life anime inspired by \"Les Fleurs de Mal,\" a collection of poems that describe boredom as the greatest evil.\r\nThe story follows three teens as they break social norms as a way to relieve boredom. The main themes of the anime are psychological, eroticism, and high-school life. The atmosphere is dark but realistic.\r\nOne strength of the anime is the character progression; two of the protagonists are increasingly influenced by the third to throw-off their everyday inhibitions and release an inner anarchy. The anime is thought-provoking, and explores the gap between what we want and how we act. The art style isdifferent from most and brings a new perspective. I thought that the series did a good job of expressing the feeling of Baudelaire's poetry.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot does stagnate at times. Some ideas are introduced but never fully explored, and the show seems incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime for people interested in a coming-of-age story about a boy who wants to be different. Viewers who enjoy dark psychological anime and subversive themes may also be interested. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is divisive. People looking for pure enjoyment and upbeat vibes should try elsewhere.\\n",

            "content": "Most people like to shit on this show's animation, but the truth is that its just different and while it took a while to get used to, i still loved the drawings. The story overall starts off interesting and you find yourself sympathizing with the main character, however towards the end we realize how much of a piece of shit he really is based on the decisions he made (somewhat spoiler). This is not an easy show to watch due to the cringe and stupidity of the main character and is exactly what you would expect from an anime listed as psychological. The plot twistsare interesting and very entertaining, but overall it's just the main character who ends up being a disappointment. Don't expect much of a romance, the story is mainly centered around the main character, and if you will go deep enough, it explores the 3 main types of people depicted in Japanese culture. If youre looking for a romantic story, this is not the show for you, lets just say the ending isn't what we think it will be after we see the dedication saeki has to their relationship. (bit of a spoiler, watch the show to find out what i mean) Therefore in conclusion i wouldn't necessarily recommend this show to anyone but if asked about it i would say: \"just watch it\".",

            "content": "Never heard of this anime before but after reading the synopsis, its look kind of a dark anime so i watched it and i must have it very dark and its kind of good actually despite seeing some hate towards this anime.\r\nStory: 7/10 Kasuga Takao is a quiet boy who loves reading books till one day he went to his classroom as he lost his book at his classroom then he saw Saeki Nanako's gym clothes and steal it cause he heard sound coming outside of his classroom and went home. Then Nakamura Sawa saw him stealing Nanako's clothes and make him from a contractwith her if not she will tells the class that Kasuga steals saeki's clothes. As this anime goes on, its get darker and will make you feel uncomfortable as Nakamura making Kasuga do some weird things. Later part of this anime, the story feels kind of out of place but overall its quite good as a psychology anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 The art style of anime is not your normal animation but more like some kind of cartoon looking. Its feel oddly weird at first and as time goes on you may gets used to the aimation. Its either a hit or miss type. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 They used some creepy sound some part of the anime to make feel you scare or creep out but overall it match up well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 Nakamura is the most complex character i had ever seen, you can't really understand her yet her character stand out the most throughout the series to me. Most of the time she gives me a dark aura feeling. Kasuga is timid and he spend most of his time, lying about himself. He not smart and the choice he makes is questionable from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10 It took me four days to finish this anime as i just feel uncomfortable to watch. You have to take a deep breathe and carry on the next episodes as each episodes feels horrific. NOt all episodes feel the same but from beginning to the mid point of this anime it makes me feel horrific.\\n",

            "content": "June 3, 2013/ 2A.M./ Aku no Hana/ Episodes seen so far 9, haven't read the manga so this is a review of what I think so far.\r\nAt first sight, I would guess Aku no Hana is definitely not as appealing to most viewers. I myself was very hesitant to watching this anime because I wasn't used to the art designs of the characters, but as you progress through the anime, you might end up adapting to the appearance of the anime and focus more on the story. But first I want to say, the main protagonist Kasuga,  has no common sense! Why would yousteal sweaty gym clothes in the first place? I know it's because of lust, but still why?!? But if he didn't steal them then we wouldn't have a story will we? Basically our antogonist here which is Nakamura, the girl that knows all about the stealing incedent blackmails Kasuga and forms a contract with him. As we progress through the story we see that Nakamura is a complete sadist and continues to blackmail Kasuga in a very disturbing way that makes you sympathize the main character. Nakamura is certainly a character that would piss of a lot of people including me, but Kasuga is also to be blamed because of his lack of common sense. \\n\r\nThe psychological part of this anime is well played off and the scenary is a good collateral for the lack of the character design. This anime has its WTF moments and is a good anime, I don't think it deserves a 1 or a 2 like seriously c'mon it's not bad, just give it a chance. Overall my score is 7/10. Although at first it was an 8, the reason I changed it is because the later episodes pissed me off, just personally how dimwitted Kasuga is.",

            "content": "So, this is my first time doing a review. Yoroshiku nee! I'm writing this review on the impression from the manga and comparing is unavoidable.\r\nAku no Hana is what I'd see even ten or twenty years later and it never gets boring. The story is brilliant. It's realistic and you can feel the main characters in yourself. It somehow brings out the theme of \"What hides inside each of us\", which Nakamura depicts as \"Deviant\" or \"Pervert\". These three main characters, except Nakamura, hides their dark sides within them. If Nakamura had never appeared in their lives, they'd continue their lives without even knowing theyhad such sides. It actually applies in our lives. Sometimes, the story progressed fast; sometimes, it progressed too slow until you'd want to shout at the screen, \"Hurry up!\" Is that how psychological the creators want it to be?\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite bad at the starting. They actually used rotoscoping and it's quite new in anime. However, it improved throughout the series. I just hope they improve it in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nSound or music of Aku no Hana is outstanding. The background music successfully brought out tension and even though it's so simple, you can feel the atmosphere just right with the background music. The opening changes its versions throughout the series and the rhythm is quite catchy. The ending is scary, almost to the point where it's disturbing. Both depicted the story well. I might say, the voice acting is good, nothing much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the story is one of the best parts of the story. And I'm fairly sure almost all of those who've watched Aku no Hana would be pissed at them. And this is a proof that the character progress is very good. After reading the manga and watching the anime, I don't quite feel any rage towards the characters comparing to when I read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI had much fun watching this anime. At times I watched attentively; and at times I almost bored to death. But as for the animation, it's a fresh new start and I'm really glad the creators chose rotoscoping, at least it's something new. I saw the short messages from the original author of Aku no Hana, Oshimi Shuuzu, every time at the end of an episode. I think he's satisfied with this adaption of his manga and I'm as well very happy to think that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give an 8 over 10. It's an amazing series with a dark twist of its storyline and it's not gonna give pleasure for sure. It's more of its disturbance that keeps you attracted. I'd highly recommend it.",

            "content": "When the first images of the Aku no Hana anime came out there was a lot of talk about how awful the characters looked and how disappointed people were with the animators decision to use rotoscoping. The manga was pretty popular with its unique story and very human characters, so readers were avidly looking forward to its animation.\r\nI was one of these people who judged the show on its animation without actually watching it and so pushed it way down on my to-watch list.\r\nFinally I got around to watching it and all my complaints were completely wiped out. I fell in love with the storytelling style. In my anime watching years I havnt seen an anime so true to its manga. Each shot is so close to the way it was drawn in the manga (Unfortunately this put restrictions on how much of the chapters could be covered in the episodes). Aku no Hana really made me appreciate the depth rotoscoping  can give to a story. (In case you don\u2019t know rotoscoping involves recording scenes in live action and then having animators draw over each footage frame by frame. I think its amazing!)\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana\u2019s story is very unique. For years movies and books have told stories about adolescence. About how our innocence is snatched away and we finally begin to see the world as it truly is. Raw and corrupted. Aku no Hana attempts to tell the story of a boy, Kasuga, who has a very poetic and romantic view about life. But his ideals are shattered as he gets involved in a spiral of events triggered by his confrontation with the black sheep of his class, Sawa Nakamura. Sawa makes it her duty to tear away the last shreds of innocence kasuga has and reveals to him his own perversion and the grim realities of their small town and existence. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is kind of heavy but the way it is told is simply remarkable. I loved every moment of watching this show. I got used to the animation pretty quickly and at times even thought that the girls looked pretty cute. The animation style truly complements the subject of the anime and actually makes the scenes more powerful.  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. I don\u2019t know if everyone would agree with me here but I fell in love with the track list of Aku no Hana. The openings and endings help carry through the eerie feeling of the plot and especially one scene in the anime just took my breath away. I think I just sat there with my mouth open for a good 20 minutes when I saw the \u201cwrecking the classroom\u201d scene. The track in that scene was Hana \u2013 A Last Flower which was used brilliantly, its very hard to explain so you need to see it to know what I mean.\\n\r\nMy only complaint was that there weren\u2019t enough episodes! I wanted more! Im really hoping and praying that this series gets more season because the story covered in the anime was just the tip of the ice berg (Check out the manga).\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana breaks away from the typical high school animes that come out one after another with its story and style of animation. It\u2019s a must watch and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. \\n",

            "content": "//**Spoiler Alerts Included**//\r\nFirst let me get this out of the way; there is no second part. However, the first part was really well-written and performed. The way it ended (no spoilers here) implies there would be a second part but sadly there isn't as its 2016 now. So, a perspective shift is needed at the end otherwise you feel like youre left at somewhat of a cliffhanger.\r\nAku no Hana is in fact, a pretty twisted anime. It's not \"edgy\" twisted, or really implausible, either. Basically, the main Character, Kasuga, as said in the description, ends up stealing a gym uniform on total impulse, and thiscrazy girl who hangs out in the sidelines sees him.  The girl, Nakamura, is a bad-news bitch who believes that deep down, everyone is very messed up, hiding all their carnal desires and instincts through walls in their hearts.  She sees Kasuga take the uniform and it fills her with excitement that she saw another person acting like a deviant.  She then sets out to force him to do things he thought he never wanted to do, like making him wear those stolen gym clothes while on a date with the girl he stole them from.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the whole time I'm watching this go on, I'm thinking \"why doesn't Kasuga just spill the beans? There are plenty of opportunities like when Saeki, the girl whose uniform he stole, basically makes it clear she would not be upset the slightest if he did it.  Still, I realized this anime wasn't about the passing of events regarding the stolen uniform, because well, that would make the plot seem kind of tacky where things got stretched so far out of hand and somehow could get fixed by just telling the truth.  Which, if i'm being totally honest, is what I wanted it to be about.  \\n\\n\r\n//\"How-I-Feel-It-Ended\" Spoilers//\\n\r\nFor the first half of the series, I thought it'd be about how far a lie gets taken and that possibly the truth can set you free.  Then, after a certain point, there was literally no turning back and things got very interesting, but they definitely changed because I knew I'd recoil if somehow telling the truth fixed Kasuga's problems. Instead it became about an evil flower; which, you could say both Nakamura and Kasuga are.  However, Im referring more to Kasuga as he basically becomes evil.  That is the way I saw the anime to suit the ending scenes.",

            "content": "Aku no Hana intrigued me greatly when I saw people calling it a \"masterpiece\", naturally, I had to watch it.\r\nI never thought I'd be so bothered by something to write a review. This is the first and probably last time I'll write one. \r\nDISCLAIMER: This is written entirely by my interpretation of the story and characters.\r\nFor starters, I surprisingly don't have a problem with the animation. Indeed, the lip sync and some facial expressions sometimes do not match with the intensity of the situation but it wasn't actually terrible. I definitely enjoyed seeing a different art style for once. Really looking forward to more ofthis animation. It is quite realistic but minimalistic at the same time, which is why I thought it was stunning.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and scenery were amazing, I have to admit. Everything is done carefully and with much detail. The people walking around, the cars, everything included made it so calming. If we include the soundtrack to those calm moments, you have truly a beautiful thing to look at as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe story. I've seen some call it \"generic\" but I thought it was quite original at first. That is, until it started to have a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Usually, I'd be okay with only a few but this show left so much blank spaces. I am specially bothered by the vandalism scene, as I believe anyone could have read the text in the board. Maybe it's just the way I interpret the story, but sometimes it felt forced. As if it tries so hard to grasp the viewers attention by being \"frightening\" but failing at the attempt. The unnecessarily long shots of the characters walking were hard to look at, it made me just want to skip them as much as I enjoy the scenery scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMy major problem with Aku no Hana are the characters. I don't see how they are so deep or how they had any development at all. Personally, I thought they were as deep as the background characters. Nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nKasuga seemed interesting at first, as he seems to be carried away by what his friends or family think. He is just a normal teenager that likes dark poetry that he, himself can't even understand. Pessimistic and full of discontent with his surroundings. Socially awkward and the typical \"quiet\" and somewhat intellectual student.\\n\\n\r\nThe adorable Saeki, a girl that one day feels nothing and the other feels everything. The relationship between Kasuga and her is the definition of \"rushed\". There was never an explanation for her sudden feelings for our awkward protagonist. They went in a date in which they barely crossed a word, which makes everything seem even more wrong. She might be the most flat character in Aku no Hana, as there was never a reason for her to overlook how the things Kasuga did, then proceed to insist on wanting to be with him and understand him. Any other person would have either explain their reasons to act this way or run away from Kasuga immediately.\\n\\n\r\nNakamura, the classic \"outcast\" that believes the whole world is full of bullshit and wants to see it burn down to ashes. All she ever does is throw temper tantrums and make Kasuga miserable. The boy that wanted to be free, is now stuck with someone that orders him around and humiliates him. Apparently that's \"deep\". Now, as well as Saeki, her role in the plot is never given any context. There wasn't any explanation for her actions except that she is an angry teenager that wants to run away. A very poor attempt of creating a deep anti-hero.\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't any depth or character development. My expectations were high for Kasuga, as I waited for him to realize how toxic his relationship with his \u201csidekick\u201d was. When he realized that Saeki can live without him, I obviously hoped for him to think the same with Nakamura. If he grew as a character and became independent that would've been a shocker, but of course not. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't at least expected him to eventually snap due to all the emotional abuse he was put into and commit murder.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish. I was surprised by how poorly the writing in Aku no Hana is. It did had much potential. Certainly, it was a failed attempt to create an extravagant, original and full of meaning psychological drama story.\\n\r\nIf there is ever part 2, I can only hope that the creators will do a better job with the writing and the attempts for a frightening atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nExtremely disappointing.",

That being said, the show is not lewd or pornographic, but realistic in it's portrayal of kids growing up and not knowing how to handle being sexual beings. I've read the manga and the art style is really different. I happened to love the animation style (they used a rotoscoping technique) and while people say it wasn't done well I think that the jittery quality added to the overall tense and nervous tone of the show. The show is thought provoking and really emotional.The more you watch the more you realize how complex the characters really are when you already thought you saw through them. The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because it's not really complete although it can be viewed as finished. I still think it's definitely worth watching. If you're into poetry, les fleur du mal by Baudelaire is what inspired the story and is really quite beautiful while also possessing the incredibly unsettling themes which make Aku no hana so great.",

            "content": "Honestly, I'm not sure what I expected from Aku no Hana's anime adaptation. (While I haven't read the manga, I hear significantly better reviews about it compared to the anime). The plot seemed quite interesting, but the animation style was what attracted me the most.\r\nI feel like rotoscopy was a good way to go for the plot it has, and it does set the work apart from others with similar themes. It seems like the art style was generally underappreciated by viewers, but it definitely added to the plausibility  of the story. The anime generally lacks a soundtrack, but the silence throughout the episodes,as well as the ending theme, add to the strangeness factor.\\n\\n\r\nMy real problem with Aku no Hana lies with the characters themselves and their portrayal and development. The three protagonists are incredibly unlikable even after 13 episodes, and there's no real effort shown to convince the viewer to change his/her view on these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a lot darker than MAL's synopsis makes it seem, and the story is interesting to say the least but it is excruciatingly slow. While I personally hope a second season isn't released due to the lackluster storytelling of the first, the first season doesn't seem to have much of a direction alone. If a second season is released, hopefully it will show some redeeming qualities. After all, the flashforward shown in the last episode alone was more interesting than the entire first season.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Aku no Hana wasn't awful, but it did fall short on various aspects.",

Here, you'll see how the new experiences of being adolescent affects our main characters, and by ''experiences of being adolescent'' I mean the most relevant: sexualism and exisencialism... Yeah, maybe its f*cking akward to watch, but not that type of akwardness that you see on ecchi anime, you feel akward by the characters emotions, acts and toughts.\r\ncons:\r\n Not for everyone, you can find it boring 'cause is about adolescents being adolescents.\r\nSometimes gets edgy -perfect for tumblr users-\r\n_Character: 8\r\nThis is a psychologic anime, sothis is the most important thing to develop. It's very good and I could consider them as tridimencional characters, but also sometimes i think that they're a litle bit exaggerating -Nakamura- or stupid -Kasuga-. Again, this is a story about coming of age, so the characters feels real; can't say more without spoil.\\n\\n\r\n_Visual: 10\\n\\n\r\nMaybe you can feel strange in the begining,  but when you get the animation, you willbe amazed how they can picture the expresion of character really well, especially the eye movement (that the most important thing on a psicholohy anime)\\n\r\nAlso, amazing direction and beautiful photography : in the important scenes you'll gonna get it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like from this anime if I comparing to the manga: In anime Nakamura is a really weird girl with peculiar expressions that made her feel like she is. Not like in the manga, that she gets an image of cute girl that eazy yo love\ufeff.\\n\\n\r\n_Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nAmazing, just great. Atmospheric as f*ck. The sense of immersion is just lovely.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nWhy not a 9? well, lefting behind that sometimes gets edgy, here's why: the anime wasn't finished, the last episode is, literally, a cliffhanger. Also is impossible that it gets a second season, it was a commercial failure.\\n\\n\r\n_Overall: 8.\\n\\n\r\nNot for everyone. If you can watch it then I'm sure you gonna love it -and cry for a second season that will never be make-",

            "content": "Never in my life I have experienced anything like what I did when I was watching this anime. Aku no Hana gives away so many emotions that go along with the breath-taking story, atmospheric and incredible music, original characters and so much more; I am having troubles putting it all into words. \r\nThe story carves into your mind like razors cut into your skin. It's unique, special, dark, mind-bending. After watching you'll be unintentionally giving yourself quite some time to think through what you've just seen. Rather than developing around one plot and one single point, Aku no Hana revolves around mutlitple plots that fitinto each other like puzzle. Expect the unexpected, in fact, expect plots where you'd never expect them. As the story developed I was feeling... how do I put it.. shocked but intrigued at the same time, this euphoria of emotions just dragged me in like NO ANIME ever did. The storyline is gloomy, it gives away this kind of subtle but yet depressive emotion which is one of multiple factors that will make you not regret a minute you spent watching this masterpiece. Long story short? Shocking, negative, different, gloomy, frustrating, DEEPLY saddening, remarkably unique.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects of this anime is also its art (understandably). The manga is drawn (understandably) quite differently which, in my opinion, ceases to give away the actual Aku no Hana feel that this title has potential for. To the point - the art is unique as well, something you don't get to see every day. It's alternative but most importantly it's something special that only helps the emotions this work gives away to its watchers to come across. At some point it represents what this title stands for. I can't imagine Aku no Hana being drawn differently, like this as it is, it's something different, something that stands out and partly gives away this seriously serious & terrifying feeling.\\n\\n\r\nI am an audiophile myself and so this paragraph I will enjoy to write about. Aku no Hana heavily leans on the background music in the sense of the atmosphere and ambience. The music is very very very well done. Just as this title itself, once again - it's special and dark. In fact it's so breath-taking I simply had to get the OST of this anime. Simply UNBELIEVABLE atmosphere and ambience that serves as the cherry on top of a cake here. As for the dubbing I think the voice actors did fantastic job, I seriously do not know what else to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters - not quite something I ever saw in an anime. In a good sense of course. A lots of blackmailing, frustration, complications and so on. All of these just build up to the \"psychological\" feeling of this title. The characters simply fit together so well. There's a huge contrast of natures of each single one of them which, throughout the story, makes things satisfying, interesting and yet once again very intriguing. I guarantee you'll find the story development based on the characters surprising and awfully interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Aku no Hana appealed to me. Most likely because of the type of person I am which might be the reason I rated this title so high. You might not see it the way I do but one thing I know for sure - regardless, you'll enjoy it.

            "content": "The music of Aku no Hana is excellent. Spacey synths, rumbling background sounds, and silence are the main elements within the score of Aku no Hana. There are no normal orchestral pieces, the type you may see in Ouran High School Host Club(One of the scores in that show for example is literally a cello song note for note from Bach), because much of the show does not have many comic sequences that would require them. The show uses music to give the viewers hints of the undertones happening within words from a character or from a scene of walking. An example of this iswhen Nakamura and Takao walk home together one episode and the spacey, slow tempo music plays in the background. Even if someone had shown you that scene in isolation and you had no idea what was going on or what had happened prior to the scene, you may be able to speculate what happened or what the characters are feeling then because of the music. This type of thing happens a lot during the show. When Nakamura threatens to reveal Takao\u2019s secret, foreboding sinister music might play and the watcher is often left to wonder whether what is sinister is Nakamura threatening Takao, Takao\u2019s secret, Takao\u2019s state of mind, or possibly an indicator of what Takao actually is behind his facade. The music leaves interpretation to the viewer while still moving along the story which I think makes the soundtrack a success.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana also succeeds in its background art, which is often what sets the tone for many anime series.Extremely nice backgrounds with intricate shapes, varying line weight, soft pastel-like coloring, and a very nice three dimensional, realistic presentation. It makes me think of an art project I had to do where the teacher always talked about line weight and structure to make sure the bottle we were drawing wouldn\u2019t  look flat. When I see a vase in a hospital, or a traffic light, I\u2019m awed at how much the goes beyond just making a pictorial depiction or in fulfilling the bare minimum for background art. \\n\\n\r\nThe character animation is controversial to many people because Aku no Hana doesn\u2019t use normal methods for animation. The show uses a technique called rotoscoping and because of it the characters look kind of pseudo 3D. It leads to a bit of jerkiness at times, and character designs that look a little bit weird. After a few episodes, however, I found the characters weird designs to be a perfect match for the tone of the show, and the nice clean lines contrasted very nicely with the backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and art not only serve the story and characters of Aku no Hana but greatly enhance the experience and these elements are so finely created that they stand out from other anime where the music is there as something an addition rather than part of the story itself. With crops of similar looking and sounding anime, the music and art are a welcomed change. Easily top five of all time in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nIn Aku no Hana, there are just three characters : Takao, Nakamura, and Saeki. Takao likes Saeki and stole her gym clothes out of desire and Nakamura saw him do it and blackmails him, making him do things for her sadistic pleasure. The drama unfolds between just these three characters With just these three characters to focus on you end up with characters that really change throughout the series and that are not as you would think from the beginning episodes. You also end up caring for the characters in unique ways by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story can feel sometimes slow, but the things that happen in each episode are never particularly boring. The story never really stagnates and always advances, either in unfolding the blackmail situation or in unfolding the characters and learning more about them, and what their \u201cmasks\u201d really are, which thankfully, is not pretentious or vague. This story would fit right in in a book, and also fits very nicely here as well.\\n",

            "content": "Aku no hana(or Flower of Evil) is about a highschool boy who one day lets his urges get the best of him and steals the gym clothes of his highschool crush, then he meets this other girl and A BUNCH OF CRAP GOES DOWN. This is an interesting story about the corrupted mind of an individual.Full of perverted thoughts and actions.And the breakdowns that lead to his ultimate despair.I\u2019d be lying if I said i didn\u2019t like it. The show is put in three tiers,tier one MC guy,Kasuga has a normal life as a highschool boy, until that moment, tier two- he meets this psychoticgirl named Nakamura and she pretty much screwed up this guy, and finally tier three where all hell breaks loose and i feel super dirty on the inside. After watching this show, I kinda look back on myself and realize that yeah, i have the ability to do something in the future out of human urges and impulse and so can anyone really. The story definitely does a nice job of showing a downfall of a used-to-be normal high school boy who by the end of the series becomes completely shut down to the points where clinical help is needed,and don\u2019t forget about the people who were already like that before, cuz they are there too.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of crazy moments and I found myself thoroughly engaged , but sadly, the entire show didn\u2019t have that pace.Mainly the first bit, which was pretty slow paced, also episodes 7 and 10 where (Im not frickin kidding) half of the entire episodes where people walking and some eerie music and nothing ELSE. Albiet it did happen after some serious sh!t went down.I can see the reason why these moments were here, it\u2019s nice to have a slow moment for the audience to take in what the heck just happened after a critical moment, but they went a bit toooooo far with those moments.But there are parts of the show I do appreciate. The actual dynamic to Kasuga,Nakamura,Saeki were so bold and it took a seriously large step around episode three.It turns less into quirky rom-com and more into a psychological show,which was their intent and by joe they really pulled it off well.Except the ending. OH BOY it was bad. Not because of the concluded(but not really) story,-actually that part was amazing,i remember being genuinely freaked out about a majority into the final episode- but the fact that they tried to tease what chapters from the manga have yet to be adapted -like they animated them too- but surprise,surprise the anime didn\u2019t do well in Japan, so now we will never get a season two.SAD\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was done by Zexcs who did Omamori Himari, and that anime about dictionaries and that\u2019s all I remember watching from them.This show does stick out in their repertoire because not only is it the most colorless looking show they have produced, but it sticks out by having rotoscope animation used in the entire show. They actually did a nice job with it.Even in the art department. My fear would be that the actors visually would not express the same emotion that an anime character has-i mean that\u2019s hard enough to do already-but the actors in show did a great job not only in movement but in expressions as well, I can tell what they are feeling in each scene and that\u2019s great. Also they really put a lot of detail into certain foreground objects and slow motion bits and it looks amazing on Blu-ray tbh.there are also some down sides,.There are times where the characters would freeze and i have to make sure i didn\u2019t hit pause on accident. A human standing still and an anime boy stand still are two different things. Also ,there are some \u201cinteresting\u201d designs, like the guys who are actually girls design wise and the background which is just so dirty looking and unappealing.But that\u2019s about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is kinda forgettable for me because it never really reveals itself.It\u2019s more like audio drugs if anything. When it comes to those mindf*ck soundtracks, nothing hits home to me more than the monogatari osts because it varied depending on situations and the music sounded different and organic.This show\u2019s ost is organic, but not different,or at least it doesn\u2019t stand out.The openings(which there are three of) are actually good;not only are they sung by the three main characters in this show, but you can tell a lot about them by the lyrics they sing.The ending song is the best,holy crap it is the creepiest song I have heard in forever. It gives me so much anxiety.I don\u2019t see myself listening to it constantly though,but that\u2019s not a bad thing. Not every single thing is made to be seen/heard constantly, but it can be made to tell a message.This ending song is one of those songs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are three characters I will talk about:Kasuga, Nakamura,and Saeki.\\n\r\nKasuga is one of those people who can easily be manipulated, he\u2019s like a turkey on a tv stand.If you even put a toe towards him, he will crumple down.It\u2019s kinda sad actually for him to become this way. He has no backbone and he loves literature.The best parts about him is when just has enough and takes his anger out on the world. I love how the show handles how his changing behavior affects not only him, but his parents as well.Also, Saeki. Sorry to spoil, but the two end up getting together, but the reason it shows is that this is Saeki\u2019s first time dealing with love, so it\u2019s kinda messed up how her first love gets turned on its head.Nakamura is the real case in this show.At first I wasn\u2019t down for all of her hijinks but in the end(since this review was long enough already) it takes some time to see why the heck she is so demented.All of these characters start of on basic ground but then descend as the story goes on and it is very glorious for sure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had a nice time with this show, it\u2019s always nice to try new things and after a 30 episode marathon of BLACK CLOVER, i really needed a psychological show to satisfy that stupid elitist part of my personality.I did have to sacrifice some patience and even more patience after episode 7.but in the end, don\u2019t go into this show expecting it to be \u2018Serial Experiments Lain\u201dbut go into it expecting it to be a rom-com, because it will shock you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nUPDATE- I looked up the lyrics to the english song and apparently it\u2019s about how there are always people who try give their attention to you in order to help you, but you are so corrupt that you deny your attention to them. In other words, you are too far from saving.Also, that person trying to help you might be similar to you but try to hide it.(i\u2019m not smart so this may not be right, but that\u2019s my theory)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Aku no Hana and Aku no Hana (manga) \u3011\r\nI'll start out by saying that I feel that I could write a term paper on the philosophy and the themes within this series. It is rich with thought-provoking subjects.\r\n\u2022 I read some of Shuuzou Oshimi's other works, such as Avant-Garde Yumeko, Devil Ecstasy, Drifting Net Caf\u00e9, Sweet Poolside, Shino Can't Say Her Own Name, Inside Mari, Happiness, and A Trail of Blood.\r\n\u2022 And let's just say that most of Oshimi's works are usually just plain smut. \r\n\u25cb Happiness is the only work of his that can even comeclose to Flowers of Evil in maturity, and I couldn't value it on its own merit based on the glaring similarities to the Swedish novel, Let The Right One In. Inside Mari is touted as one of his best works, but the twist was predictable and the ending was unsatisfying and left the 2deep4you factor too wide open. \\n\\n\r\n\u25cb Flowers of Evil itself is commentary on adolescence, perversion, anarchy, and the true meaning of evil that mirrors the type of sadistic themes of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's grand opus Venus in Furs. Though many thought of it as an unnecessarily edgy and sick take on the coming-of-age story genre, the perspective of the main character seemed realistic and relatable to me.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cb The manga and anime series take as the voyeuristic approach as mentally unstable, mysterious, and ever fascinating, Sawa Nakamura, that leads the protagonist into the depths of madness. As you consume the spiraling narrative, you are taken captive by Sawa, wondering, is she good or is she evil, or is she just a human being? \\n\\n\r\n\u25cb She definitely partakes in socially unacceptable behavior and is menacing, but is seen through a sympathetic lens when Kasuga gradually begins to fall in love with her and sees that those who wear the pretty masks are actually the evil ones. There is something definitely pure about Sawa, in her hatred of falsity and childish desire to escape from their town that's \"(quote/unquote) drowning in shitheads.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u25cb I may have more of a bias towards this series, because I was in a similar relationship and felt for Kasuga. I guess, this story just happened to find me at the right time. I've heard other anime fans call this show \"the next School Days\" and say that it's easily forgettable, or by 4chan's standards, it's \"Linkin Park: The Manga.\" Despite all of the cutting remarks, Flowers of Evil strongly resonated with me.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cb Flowers of Evil, the manga and anime, have nothing to do with the original Le Fleurs du Mal, which is Kasuga's favorite book in the series. I read Charles Bauldlaire's poetry tome shortly after obsessing over Aku no Hana, and much to my dismay, the poetry had little to nothing to do with the themes of the Japanese comic version. The poems were very avant-garde and perverse with strong necrophiliac undertones.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cb Reading the book didn't do much for me, but it did give me more clarity on Kasuga. A teenager who loves a book and pretentiously pretends to know the meaning, while looking down at his classmates, all the while, hiding his own perversions. As I mentioned earlier, the characters are very well-written. I won't spoil what happens later, but all of the main cast are unraveled in beautiful and disgusting ways. Much like the title of this series suggests: Flowers of Evil\\n\\n\r\n\u25cb I recommend the manga over the anime, but I experienced the show while it was airing and was simultaneously reading the manga that was publishing, side-by-side. In my opinion, engaging in both forms of the medium was the best way to take in Aku no Hana. Many people are not fond of the rotoscoping in the anime, which I don't blame them for. It looks weird, but there are some really well-directed scenes in the TV show and I loved the soundtrack, especially the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cb Overall, Flowers of Evil is very psychological and wrought with the angst of a teenager unable to have true liberation in the constraints of society, as well as sexually. If you're a fan of deeply psychological and surreal experiences, this is exactly the series you've been anticipating, but warning: it is very divisive and will push ones\u2019 buttons. It\u2019s up to you\u30fcwhether they are buttons you want to be pressed. I give the anime a 6/10 and the manga a 9/10, as well as a home in my list of favorites.",

Although the sound really gave vibes but cum on, 2013 anime and those graphics!! I dont think season 2 will do any help regarding that quality of art.

            "content": "Flowers of Evil is a series I really liked the basic premise of. Takao Kasuga is caught impulsively stealing the gym clothes of his middle school crush, Nanako Saeki. After threatening to reveal his secret to everyone, unpopular \u201ccreepy\u201d girl Sawa Nakamura makes Kasuga obey her every order. Nakamura manipulates Kasuga\u2019s feelings for Saeki, trying to convince him through forced perverted actions that he\u2019s a deviant just like her and that his self-image is a lie. It\u2019s a very thematically demonstrative series, but despite the anime ending before finishing adapting the manga it tells a single complete story arc with a satisfying enough conclusion spot.There\u2019s some themes here I was highly interested in, mainly those related to the conflict of puberty: sexual repression and virginal guilt. Repression becomes a theme in general, as both Kasuga and Nakamura are angst-budding precocious pre-teens who find the town\u2019s milieu to be unintellectual or dishonest, respectively. Nakamura tries to tear down the Kasuga\u2019s pretentious inhibitions as he puts up the air of being a literate intellectual.\\n\\n\r\nFlowers of Evil\u2019s production values are generally quite impressive. The series\u2019 use of rotoscoping in its animation has been highly controversial, but it\u2019s very misunderstood. Too much attention has been given to the basic act of deviating from the manga\u2019s art style, and not enough people have questioned the effect the new art style has on the narrative. It actually brings together a highly effective chemistry. Yes, the frame-skipping animation of the slow-moving rotoscoped facial features looks creepy, but \u201ccreepy\u201d is what defines all aspects of the show. The \u201cuncanny valley\u201d look of the characters is appropriate for Nakamura\u2019s imagined society where people are just pretending to be human, and as their facial features disappear the further they get away from the camera the world begins to look emotionally distant and impossible to empathize with. This is intentional, as Kasuga and Nakamura\u2019s difficulty to relate to other people is their defining link. My only complaint about the character designs is that they look far too old to be middle schoolers, and this more mature impression diminishes the plausibility of the story due to Kasuga and Nakamura\u2019s frustrated, juvenile reactions to things.\\n\\n\r\nTheir city is portrayed as deserted and devoid of life, with plenty of slow shots of the cinematography showing numerous empty streets and buildings that have no activity inside of them. A muted color palette drapes everything in depressing, lonely greys. Emphasizing the lifelessness of the town is a soft musical score that often utilizes low keyboard drones under greatly spaced apart single piano keys. A mix of the light nature of middle school life and the perceived shallowness that comes with it, and at times, Kasuga\u2019s fears. The four opening songs each play from the perspective of one of the three main characters, with the final song addressing the general themes of repression. Each episode\u2019s transition into the ending song is also among the most memorable in an anime, concluding a series that thoroughly uses music in conjunction with its narrative. The painted backgrounds are gracefully done yet always sullen, and the distinct direction utilizes other surrealist tricks such as dream-like symbolic sequences and live action footage to further create a world of uncertainty. Flower of Evil\u2019s very slow, deliberate atmosphere is both mysterious and unnerving like puberty itself and possibly the best thing about the series. The metaphorically orgasmic finale scene to one of the middle episodes is a particularly well-done scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode has Kasuga\u2019s friends arguing whether a movie is in the horror genre or romance genre, foreshadowing the blurry line in Flowers of Evil itself. There\u2019s a light horror aspect as Kasuga is trapped in his situation and forced to risk embarrassing himself by the demands of the seemingly sadistic Nakamura who stalks him daily, and these scenes can be tense and difficult to watch. It displays some of the shame of adolescent bullying, but I wish it went further with its themes of sexuality and its psychological impact on those discovering sex for the first time. It was twisting these themes and progressing to more severe places until the final five or so episodes. At this point the series becomes less about taking its themes to new places and demonstrating them in other ways and more about the teen melodrama of its three leads. This strikes me as a mistake that makes the show far less interesting, as it gives some immediate semi-closure of the main characters before it\u2019s given us enough of a metric of their true selves for these revelations to feel meaningful and deserved. The motivations and true feelings of Kasuga and Nakamura are so vaguely defined at this point that the weight behind their emotional drama feels hyper exaggerated compared to what we\u2019ve seen of them so far. This turns their teenage angst into something more slight, like how a teenager overreacts to a breakup rather than the more drastic, darker social commentary that made the series initially gripping. It was too much too soon to turn this psychological drama into a relationship drama. To make matters worse, the already slow series seems to grind its progress to a halt. The cinematography shots and slow walking scenes now become a chore when the introspection behind them is now that same slight teen melodrama rather than alienation and anxiety.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the series uses all of this remaining time just to resolve its plot conflicts, the themes it explored prior to this have ended before they were able to make a powerful statement on adolescence or society. This promising series ends its evolution too soon and slowly declines into a drawn-out, melodramatic conclusion. The end result is something that will probably only stick with me on a conceptual level, thanks to its strong atmospheric direction and ideas of concepts that could\u2019ve been much more than they were. My curiosity was piqued, but it wasn\u2019t followed up with questions or stimulation. Flowers of Evil\u2019s story itself meant very little to me, and there probably wasn\u2019t much meaning to it in the first place.",

            "content": "No I am not going to bash the artstyle! Contrary to most other opinions, I actually liked the artstyle and thought it added to the atmosphere. There are no waifus to be found here tho. You have been warned. \r\nThe underlying theme of the show is to be true to one's nature. Not conforming to society's standards but instead giving into you carnal desires and acting without fear of consequences. Sadly the show itself fails the litmus test. The story is told from the perspective from the biggest man-pussy in the world. At every scene, the indecisiveness, uncertainty and unwillingness to stand up from himselfradiates out like a beacon which sucks all and any hope the series had. His \"growth\" through the show is his opening up to his masochistic tendencies as he realizes that he loves the person who is essentially making his life a living hell. To pad up the fact that this is all there is to the plot, we have obscure philosophy drone on in the background. This is make people feel that they have seen something deep and original when it really is as shallow as I make it sound. We keep getting quotes from this book \"Flowers of evil\" like its meant to have a deep, significance when in reality it does nothing to add to the show. The main character at around midway in the series confesses that he is an empty man who reads books to make himself feel special. Oh, Kasuga, you are so right. You are indeed an one dimensional character with absolutely no growth throughout the series (finding yourself to be a masochist is not growth)\\n\\n\r\nYeah, yeah, we get it, Kasuga was shit! How about the others? Well, they aren't great either. The other mains are Nakamura who is bullying Kasuga as she knows Kasuga's secret and Saeki who is a plot element purely meant to act as love interest. Saeki has absolutely no role apart from confessing her love to Kasuga even though no sane person on this pale. blue dot can physically fall in love with him. Seaki's thought process is to say \"Why the fuck not! \\n\\n\r\n\"We spoke first one day ago and you want to ask me for a date? Sure why the fuck not\" \"We just went out on the first date and you want to enter a relationship with me? Sure why the fuck not\" \"I just saw you in the library being physical with another girl and you want me to trust you? Sure why the fuck not\" \"You steal my fucking uniform, completely ruin the classroom, make a mockery of my uniform and put it up for the whole fucking class to see? You want me to understand your broken, weak, pathetic excuse of a mind? SURE WHY THE FUCK NOT\" Saeki is one fucking dimensional with zero presence but to be a foil. Nakamura is the series' Joker. Evil without a proper explaination why? Oh her parents got divorced. PLEASE UNDERSTAND!! Her character is deep, you just gotta read fucking \"Flowers of Evil\" and understand the deep subteties. \\n\\n\r\nThis show had so much potential. Kasuga idolizes Saeki. It could have explored Kasuga slowly becoming unenamoured as Saeki shows more of her human side. It could have shown real growth by having Kasuga grow a fucking spine and facing his problems instead of being a whiny, fucking biatch. It could have made Saeki less of a \"Yes lady\" and given her more character. Hell it could have even made Nakamura a tsundere and have her develop feelings for Kasuga (Nvm the last one happens). Nopety, nopety nope. Lets take the most boring path forward and sprinkle it with crappy philosophy to make it seem \"deep\". \\n\\n\r\nThe story, characters and philosophy are all shallow and poorly thought out. The music and the art on the other hand are truly inspired. The art and music meld together gloriously to create a gloomy, oppresive almost claustrophobic atmosphere. There isn't a single joke/light moment in the series. This isn't an easy watch and sadly isn't an engaging nor a worthwhile one either. 3/10 is my final score.",

The characters are great too - they are nothing like each other and they really react to things in their own ways.\r\nThe fact that it doesn't have too many characters in it is a plus for me - if there are too many names to remember in an anime or manga, I usually mess it all up and give up on it because my memory can't remember all the persons. Luckily, this anime hadjust the right amount of characters!\\n\\n\r\nI'm amazed at how scary Nakamura could be sometimes, but also by Kasuga's stupidness sometimes. I think they were all believable characters though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great and I haven't watched anything like it before. I highly recommend it to those who are into the psychological and thrillers.",

I am not telling that I liked things as they turned out to be in the end, BUT the fact that it put me into thought is the reason why I gave it a high score. And the below reasons as well...\r\nStory: 10 \r\nTeens are awful. Its undoubtably the toughest part of one's life, because you are the least self-conscious you will ever be - and this is painful. Finding one's identity is a troublesome process and this anime depicts it in a very accurate way. No anime I haveseen so far had such realistic representation of teen emotions as this, and that's why I found the story original and appealing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAnother original and realistic element of the series. I mean, the characteristics and movement of the people in it where SO close to real people's. Landscapes were astonishing too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nVoices and sound effects were clear and relevant. OT and ET were as relevant, too. I want to download the ET because it is so unique and creepy it really got me to like it after the few first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the level of accuracy of a teenager's feelings in this anime is very accurate. The characters are overreacting in a 'natural' way. Some try to imitate others and go with the current and others - like Nakamura - always try to be different (though in the bad way). The mc is divided between these two and this is the main tragic element. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n(Maybe a little spoiler here)\\n\r\nAs I said I didn't like the ending much. You don't have to be evil to be different and be able to like yourself. But this is not the only speculation that this series granted me or this exact unpleasant outcome gave me food for more consideration, so it didn't spoil the overall enjoyment. I really liked this anime and what it offered me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n",

            "content": "Aku no Hana to me is the poster child of being TOO true to the original art. It for all intents and purposes is a mirror of the source material the good and the bad. This included things involved in the manga that would, and usually didn't work well in the new medium.\r\n One of the most obvious of all is the pacing, its abysmal to be frank, the anime went for the same cliffs pauses and stops of the manga, wasting minuets an episode to dead drab silence.  Episode 13 should have been episode 7 or 8 ideally. Another major problem with thestory comes forth from the pacing major events and what should have been the major hooks don't come in at all during the story to justify the ending point, which felt superficial at best.\\n\r\nArt while hard to get used to, is perfect for the mood it was trying to convey. Working with a simplistic/minimalist art-style over rotor-scoped actors. (Using real actors as models for the animation). Colors fit well with the mood again.\\n\\n\r\nSound is veeery preference based specifically when it comes to the actors. Its comes to the decision of whether you prefer voice actors who fit the character(hard when you see the character archetypes) or well, good voice actors, and really it is hard to complain about it when they were using rotor-scoping. Ambiance varies and when it doesn't drag on is used well. The ed was fantastic op was only slightly worse.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is one of the real kickers. Without the development or the full development arc of the characters they were either unfathomable or cliche.\\n\r\nCreepy delinquent girl, class idol, awkward teenager, pervert friend, unlikable teacher, gossiping girls.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to enjoy it at all as the pauses were numerous the dialogue was frankly embarrassing and the story was rarely at the right pace almost always going too slow, with some of the more pivotal events going by to fast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was hard to enjoy at the best of times bad at most of the times and horrible at the other times. There are so many better ones out there and well the ending WAIT FOR PART 2 and well I don't think there is going to be a part two at this rate.",

            "content": "Loneliness. It is one of the most painful things to experience and I think that's made clear by most of the anime you'll see. All of us have different ways of dealing with it and in \"Aku no Hana\", you'll see one of those ways.\r\nThe story is simple......-ish. Kasuga Takao is the class's bookworm. He has a crush, Saeki Nanako , who he considers as an embodiment of perfection but only admires from afar (naturally). But one day, going home, Takao realized that he forgot a book in his classroom. And when he went to go get it, he saw that Saeki forgot her P.E.clothes and the bastard took it by mad impulse. Of course, the word got around which left both him and his \"muse\", Saeki, feeling ashamed. Not only that, Takao has to deal with Nakamura Sawa; the ill-mannered weirdo from his class, who was the only one that \"caught him in action.\" She promises Takao that she won't be a snitch in the condition that he will follow everything that she says form that day on. What happens after that are situations set by Nakamura which left my forehead wrinkled and my mind pondered. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems I have with this anime is that some of the scenes are just quiet scenes. When I say quiet, I mean no talking, no BGMs. While understandable, these scenes mean there's a silent reflection going on inside the heads of the characters or a method of the animation studio to say that a scene was finished and we're on our way to the next one, they are awfully long. Too long. Sometimes, they would take minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art. Okay, first of all, the art is not ugly. Eerie is what I would call it. What many don't realize is that the art compliments the overall theme of the show which is creepiness. Though, I understand that for some, anime is their mean of escaping reality \u2500that they don't want to see any reference to the real world as much as possible but the first thing that they see are these realistically-animated characters. Of course, it wouldn't be of their liking. And sure, people who read the manga would say that \"The art they did in the anime is different from the manga.\" But I like to think that an anime adaptation of a manga is an opportunity of a studio to retell the story without going far away from the source (that and because this site avoids comparisons of adaptations to it's source).\\n\\n\r\nSound. I can't say alot for the BGMs as most scenes doesn't have any. But when it does, they are superb. The OPs are very addictive. The type that gets stuck in your head. Almost makes you forget that you're watching a screwed up anime. And the ED is creepy as hell. Then there's the voices............ All I can say is, they did a wonderful job. Everyone's voice fits the characters and each seiyuus acted out their roles amazingly.\\n\\n\r\nAku no Hana is one of the \"books\" that's only been judged by it's \"cover\". The setup may be a bit general but what sets it off from the others is the craziness of Nakamura. If you're not a fan of the psychological genre, then you might not like this one but if you are, then take this as my strong recommendation.",

            "content": "There are hundreds of anime that come out flawed, not cause people who made it are bad at their job (though that certainly necessary helps) but because of unfortunate realities of anime industry. I feel like that's what Aku no Hana suffered the most from. \r\nArt and animation: Polarizing to say the least. Do you think anime should be constricted to cartoony, big eyed aliens with bizarre hairdos? No? Then you might enjoy this art style. Aku no Hana uses stylized rotoscoped actors and in my opinion uses it well. Sure not everybody looks like a pop idol but the style fits the story. Whatrotoscope brought to the table is a degree of realism, variety and subtlety in facial expressions and gestures as well as smoother animation. Even if outside of that Aku no Hana rather rarely uses benefits of animation I think everything mentioned above is enough. There are some surreal special effects sprinkled throughout and some really cool camera work but it's too few and far between to become anything really special. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to backgrounds it's more or less standard affair. It's mostly just painted over photos but they are painted over really well, I'd even say it looks superior to a lot of digitally drawn backgrounds in recent anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: music in this show is rare and mostly consists of ambient tracks used during some contemplative scenes. There's also the really interesting ED song with weird, chopped up and digitized vocals and off-tune but strangely melodic wind instruments that create the feeling of someone losing a grip on reality. It appropriately plays during important moments when something genuinely messed up happens. \\n\r\nNot sure if OP reaches the same amount of harmony with the show but upbeat jazzy tracks reminded me a bit of Shiina Ringo and Mayumi Kojima which is never a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nStory and characters: these two are inseparable for AnH as it is very much a story about characters. AnH seemingly sets out to explore what it's like to be a misfit in a society that rejects any deviation from normalcy by colliding a small main cast of atypical and eccentric characters against their more ordinary peers and family members. It was almost painful at times to see just how hopelessly absolute the disconnect between a child and parent can be which I think is a testament to how believable the characters were though unfortunately few of them are even closed to being as fleshed out as Kasuga who still could have some blank spaces filled. \\n\r\nIt also seems to delve into what matters more in a relationship or what makes us love since Kasuga is torn between kind and beautiful Saeki and rough, unhinged Nakamura who however might be the only person to understand him on a personal level. \\n\r\nI'm not and won't say any of this with certainty though, because as of now the story is not even close to being finished and with how much time has passed since release I'd doubt that sequel is coming any time soon. Manga might offer a more complete story but I'm not reviewing the manga here. \\n\\n\r\nDirecting: Aku no Hana is brimming with shots that are just nice to look at when not straight up impressive. Everything is tied together together nicely into easy to follow, coherent narrative and it makes sure to throw in a short flashback or two to make sure the viewer is following along. However pacing is atrocious and AnH loves a bit too much to throw in long, silent, contemplative scenes when it's not warranted. One example is particularly bad, in episode 8 I think there's about 5 minutes of just walking silently. There are ways to depict characters silently walking around town for a  long period of time without boring the viewer with overly long, boring scenes. \\n\\n\r\nFun factor: despite everything I mentioned, AnH is still a very unique experience and in my tiny onion it's worth giving a try if you're a fan of the media. Otherwise you might be better off reading the manga. \\n",

Some people may find the anime disturbing.\r\nFirst, I would like to say that this anime was great, but I was disappointed at the end because there was no season 2 (yet!!!). At the end of the anime, they say there will be a part 2, but this anime was released in 2013, so if you are willing to wait for the season 2 (You can) but who knows when it will be released!!!\r\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the anime because youcan always read the manga (like I did) and then continue the story. The manga has even more thrilling and psychological details and a lot of cliffhangers. The story becomes even more existing and thrilling in the manga that I had to finish it in one day. It made me love the anime even more.\\n\\n\r\n1) The story is amazing because it shows how the main character (Kasuga) changes because of a simple mistake he has done, and how that mistake will ruin his life. He acts like any young boy would do when he falls in love, but one thing that he does (take Saeki's uniform with him to his home) makes him regret everything!!!!!!! \\n\r\nThis mistake will be the key to a world of chaos and mayhem. \\n\r\nHis life will be turned upside down, he will face a lot of things that will make him discover his true nature (not a boy who just love reading books). \\n\r\nI was really impressed by this anime because it shows how some sick people like (Nakamura) can manipulate other peoples rather than help them. She saw him steal Saeki's uniform and starts to manipulate and control his life by threatening him when she says that she will tell everyone about his perverted mind if he doesn't do as she asks of him.\\n\\n\r\n(story 10/10)\\n\\n\r\n2) I didn't really like the main character (Kasuga), I thought he lacked in personality, but I was really impressed by the other characters (Saeki and Nakamura). Those two are the ones who made me like this anime, they are the ones who will turn this anime into a psychological anime.\\n\\n\r\n(Nakamura) is a creepy girl, weird and hated by everyone.\\n\r\n(Saeki) is a girl who has always the highest grades and is loved by everyone.\\n\r\nThis anime starts slow, and let you think of those girls the same way everyone else thinks about them, but you will discover many things about those girls when watching this anime that will make you see that we live in a world that is filled with insanity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n3) The art is a bit weird (8/10)\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the worst anime I have ever seen. I hated it so much that I decided to read the manga (perfect logic), and I absolutely adored the manga - which is now in my top 3. But this isn't a review of the manga, it's about the anime.\r\nStory\r\nThe biggest shame in this anime is how long it was. The 13 episodes can only tell the part of the story which - in my opinion - is the worst part of the manga. If there is a second season, then I would probably enjoy it much more as it would tell the bestpart. The pacing is too slow.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI despise the art style of the anime. The manga was beautiful, but the anime ruined it. I don't care if it's how the original creator wanted it, it's terrible. The art style would be bearable if there was actually a good story however.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here. The voice acting was actually pretty good, and I enjoyed the openings (the nakamura version is my favourite). This was one of the only things that helped me complete the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nIn the anime, I hated all of the characters. Kasuga was a little crybaby for the majority of the show, Nakamura is too pushy and Saeki has no apparent personality. In the manga, I adore all these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this show at all. It is one of the only shows (along with clannad) that has pushed my no-drop policy to the limit. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is garbage and if anyone wants to watch it I would suggest you read the manga instead.",

            "content": "A middle school love story. If you think that's as stupid as it sounds you won't like this anime. Despite the seeming veneer of edginess pursued by the writer, this anime falls directly into the kind of story the characters are capable of telling. So I'll start with them, the main three, and how they made me feel, after all you'll be watching these three for the majority of the time.\r\nTakao Kasuga. Shake my head, where to begin. Well, I guess I'll say what was on my mind for the entirety of the 4 hours and 20 minutes it took to watch this little animette(I'm allowed to call it that right? Yes I just made up that word). This kid is a fucking pussy. That pretty much sums up his entire character. But then again, all of us guys were a little insecure, shallow, and indecisive in middle school right? *looks to the left and right* definitely not me though. Anyway what more can be said? Ok, so to clear this up Kasuga (as his classmates call him) is a gigantic wuss, AND desires all of the female attention and ensuing sexual encounters he can lay his clammy, grubby, little, cravenly hands on. Except he never gets to the latter, because as I've said, this show is about middle schoolers. Not much room for steamy sex acts depicted in the beautiful rotoscopia that this anime is portrayed in.\\n\r\nOk an aside about the animation. So from my research on the internet a lot of keyboard warriors were getting up in arms circa spring 2013 when this show was aired because apparently some of those cheeto stained fingers of theirs had to decry the apparently, in their opinion, horrible looking animation that they were witnessing. It's different, learn to appreciate the different, at least before you critique it. Personally after the first 30 seconds I had gotten over the animation because, oh so cultured and intelligent me understood EXACTLY what the writers were trying to say. Yes, here it is, this anime is all about perspective. Pretty early on the animators do some really cool things with visual perspective, showing you scenes from reflections and mirrors constantly, which while not necessarily mind blowing, is a really quite nice little motif to carry with you for the remainder of the experience.\\n\r\nAnd later on the story reflects the general theme, whereas you begin to see more through the other characters eyes besides Kasuga's, which in my opinion really drags things down when he is the focus, because like I said before, the dude is REALLY shallow, but I digress, middle school dudes...\\n\r\nAlright character number 2: Sawa Nakamura, or just Nakamura as her classmates call her. Well, at least if they regularly talked to or about her. Honestly mad props to the writers for portraying this girl in such a way as to provoke genuine villain status, and also make you totally feel for her, because her classmates exile her pretty much as a result of her \"deviant\" behavior. I mean come on, straight up calling teachers shitheads right to their faces, what's not to like?\\n\r\nOh, and another aside about themes, the whole topic of deviancy is kind of something the story touches on and then puts down. Which, while understandable, I see the writers really want depth in this story over a longer period of time. But, really, in the end the story begins with this topic, I'm afraid, as a cheap bait and switch to garner viewers with it's edginess, and then attempts to go on and tell the (as the writer would probably call it) \"middle school love story it was always meant to be\". Fuck that. Honestly, after the first couple episodes I was expecting some really graphic shit, didn't get it. I was stimulated, but left feeling unsatisfied. And hell, do I want these characters to get full on naked and just do it for my own sake so I can stop feeling so god damned teased? Hell no, that would just be cheap thrill. What I was really looking forward to was for the whole \"deviant\" theme to wrap up in a fulfilling retrospective about the human mind and the concept of desire. If I'm not gonna physically masturbate to this AT LEAST let me jerk my brain off for ten minutes so I can feel all the emotions were worth something. But like I said, again, the story drops it because, guess what, middle schoolers. I. Digress.\\n\r\nSo, back to Nakamura. Personally I thought this character was the most heavily driving force of the show, and in my opinion she is what drags the show's writing/story score up to a 6 from like a 4. Yes, Kasuga is a 4, as in, I don't want to listen to the inner working's of a middle school boy's mind, I already had my two years of that shit with myself, thank you very much.\\n\r\nOk, last character: Nanako Saeki, or, as you can see from the pattern, Saeki. Saeki is the character that makes the whole \"love story\" concept even worth visiting. Honestly she's a good girl, she puts faith in Kasuga when he deserves absolutely none. And what does she get back? Ok Kasuga being a 4/10 character I'm sure you can guess. Yeah that's right this idiot goes chasing after Nakamura. And though, the story doesn't really explicitly say it, I think it's really because Nakamura is a more exciting girl. And that's not to take anything away from Saeki. She is humble, hardworking, and emotionally genuine. That last bit is, phew... That's a keeper right there honestly, and honestly for the same reason she is not wary of Kasuga the scumbag because she is an inexperienced middle school girl, Kasuga doesn't know that she is one in a million because he is an inexperienced no- brain middle school guy. So that is, in my opinion, probably a pretty underrated part of the story, the tragedy of watching Saeki's heart get broken over and over. But a broken hearted middle schooler does not, a story make. After all I'm sure, for all the reasons I despise Kasuga, a lot of women who watch this show completely understand or scorn Saeki for her ignorance.\\n\r\nSo overall I give Aku No Hana (the flowers of evil) a 7/10. The story just peters out towards the end, which is really unfortunate, because there were many very thought provoking directions it could have gone. But I suppose it does promise a season 2 at the end, so maybe if it comes out the score of this one will be rescaled. Beyond that the art was just different, a refreshing breath of air in a hyperbolic time chamber of samey art in the realm of anime. Sound design gets and easy 10; the music so moodily raw and just ambient in all the right moments is unquestionably the only successful iteration that could have come out of attempting to produce a sound score for this... thing. And the characters, well Kasuga, the main characters just drags it from a 10 or a 9 to an 8.\\n\r\nSo if you haven't watched it, should you? Oh man, to be honest if you want to waste four hours of your life worrying about the trials and tribulations of middle schoolers go for it, I doubt I'll ever give it a second go, though the first time was pretty darn enjoyable in a myriad of ways.",

Done with a different style than most anime, the art seems to have been trying to be more real, in the sense that it feels like you are just watching a television show rather than an anime. It is not a world where fantastical things happen, but our world, where the main character is thrown into a situation that he does not know how to handle. The presence of the show,and the foreboding things to come is just astounding as I find myself sitting up straight in my chair just to catch more of a spectrum of what is happening. You will not see any mystical powers, any silver haired girls, or even a quirky character, this show seems like it had something to say about the anime that is out there now and that they were not comfortable in portraying Japan as such a fantastical world and wanted to make it as realistic as possible. Please watch this anime, it is by far, one of the best I've ever watched.",

I actually enjoyed the story way better in the anime than in the manga. The development of the story and the characters is slow and smooth, maybe too slow for some people. In the manga, some parts seem like they were poorly written, and I didn't really like the rest of the story that the anime doesn't cover, maybe because I watched the anime before reading the manga, and because the manga seemed to start getting away from the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art: Most people hate it. They don't understand why they made it that way, and I'm just going to guess they didn't even watch most of the show.\\n\r\nWhen you watch this show and understand it, you understand the art. Yes, it's ugly, and that's how its supposed to be, it's not a pretty story either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is definitely a 10, especially the ending songs. Everything just goes really well with the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: These are characters that you don't usually see in anime, that's why I like them so much. They're unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think the trick to enjoy this show is to stop thinking of it as an anime, and to think of it just as a live action series or movie instead. I bet if it was that way more people would enjoy it, because I know a lot of people enjoy this kind of psychological plots, but they're looking for something else when it comes to anime. I personally enjoy mature anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is a 10 to me, mostly because I can't find other anime like this one and I really related to it and its depressing mood, but realistically it's probably like an 8.",

When I first saw this series I couldn't understand it and quit after episode 2, Afterwards I read the manga and came back to watch it to really understand.\r\nArt: In all honesty I like to take a chance on series that were bold enough to go with a different art style like Ping Pong the Animation. But I thought this series took a chance and it didn't pay off. I'll honestly say it was unique but the animation wasn't worth it becauseit does put off more people than it gets.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I'll say that I loved the changing opening songs, the opening songs were always weird yet sounded fun (read the subtitles) and the music played in the very creepy or weird parts were nice. I will say honestly that I didn't really enjoy the ending song, it was weird but I found it a bit too strange.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were actually decently done. I enjoyed how Kasuga and his others were done. The only character that I really didn't like all that well was Nakamura, she didn't sound the way I really imagined during the manga and at some parts during the anime I thought she wasn't was well portrayed as in the.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Absolutely loved this story. Displays a teenage darkness that we don't see in many series. This story is not about the popular guy getting harems, or regular teenage passion, its about an outcast teenage and the crappy world surrounding him, which makes this series really unique.",

            "content": "Dropped this show like a bad habbit, never seen a  main character. Scratch that in c haracter, as pathetic as the guy in this show. 50% of the time while watching this you will be wondering \"why doesn't this guy just do X\". The show tries to convey the lost of innocence and the darkness of the human soul, but fails miserably in the fact that it tries to do this through completely trivial bullshit.\r\n1. Why doesn't main character just deny he stole the uniform, the girl accusing him is hated by everyone especially the teacher and no one would believe her.\r\n2. Why isa girl bursting in tears over someone stealing her gym uniform, it's not like she had nothing to change into. And then the entire school is taking it like someone just got kidnapped. Impossible to take this show seriously when every single thing is blown out of proportion.\\n\\n\r\n3. Main character is impossible pathetic,  so pathetic that he makes you want to slam your head into your keyboard. He ruins the entire show by himself.",
