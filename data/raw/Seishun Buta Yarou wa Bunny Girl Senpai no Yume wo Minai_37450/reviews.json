            "content": "I don't understand the hype for this one.\r\nBunny Girl Senpai is full of the same issues commonly criticized in most light novel adaptations, so why does it get a free pass? Harem tropes, waifu bait, incest teasing, thin characterization, vague pseudoscience, and an asshole deadpan protagonist who solves a bunch of girls\u2019 problems for them. Most of all, the art and sound are incredibly mediocre excluding the many moments when CloverWorks chooses to bend over and spray shit in our eyes with its abundance of hideous CGI crowds.\r\nFirst and foremost, I hate the writing in Bunny Girl Senpai. Consider the '4' points I rated theshow overall to be a generous acknowledgment of its basic features. It was painful to watch, but not irredeemable. The story follows Sakuta, a second year in high school, as he tries to help girls afflicted by a supernatural phenomenon known as Adolescence Syndrome. If that sounds like a psychological disorder concocted by a pretentious teenage boy trying to sound smart, that\u2019s because it is. If a character suddenly becomes invisible or if everyone is trapped in a three-day long time loop, then the author will call it Adolescence Syndrome and leave the rest up to our imaginations. In other words, it's the author\u2019s way of masking a cheap plot device. Rather than giving us a coherent explanation for the syndrome, the author just handwaves it with common quantum mechanics like Schrodinger's Cat and Laplace's Demon. It\u2019s loosely defined as a supernatural affliction that manifests in people who are going through severe stress, whether it be cyberbullying causing physical cuts, or going invisible because you\u2019re sick of attention. To the show\u2019s credit, as a plot device, it is used to craft some empathetic struggles within the characters and even a little bit of relatability. However, these conflicts aren\u2019t executed nearly as well as they could be. The story is told through five parts, each with a new girl for Sakuta to help and flirt with. This standard setup is so unbearable to watch play out because of how terrible Sakuta is as a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta is the average deadpan, cynical, uncaring protagonist, except he\u2019s also an unlikable asshole. His one single tone of voice is monotonous boredom, and he almost never wavers from it for the entire series. Keep in mind, this show is FULL of dialogue, but it has no goddamn clue how to make any of it seem interesting. Sakuta\u2019s dialogue isn\u2019t witty or clever you would expect from a deadpan character, it\u2019s just vulgar, gross, and offensive. Deceptively, he acts like he\u2019s being a terrible person ironically, and in turn, people don\u2019t think he\u2019s that bad of a guy. However, everything he says is actually unironic, there\u2019s no nuance, he\u2019s just a bad person. He is never punished for being an asshole, sometimes girls might comment on his behavior if he says something especially inappropriate to them, but right away they move on and act like he\u2019s Jesus-kun again. For example, when a girl says something rude to him he fires back with:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAre you on your period or something?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nDid a twelve-year-old write this script? Sakuta's shallow quips are always like this, juvenile and crass, and the rest of his dialogue is completely deadpan. He is rarely emotionally impacted by anything; very little makes him impressed or concerned. Viewing a story from the perspective of an uncaring asshole like Sakuta makes it impossible to get invested in anything, or even enjoy it. If the show had actually confronted him about his behavior and acknowledged how bad he was to his friends, then it could have been a character flaw and something to develop upon. But from what we saw adapted, his character development is satisfied with being permanently stagnant. He continues to hide his ugly personality behind a thick layer of snark and quips. Sakuta is just the rotten core of this story, surrounding him is the main attraction, all of the ladies who are strangely drawn to him.\\n\\n\r\nOur first heroine for Sakuta to assist is Mai Sakurajima, the titular bunny girl. Somehow she makes the dialogue even worse, she is equally as dry and cynical as Sakuta. Throughout the series, the script parallels standard rom-com dialogue, except it is written to be as pretentious as possible with the pace cranked down to molasses. Rather than a simple sentence lasting a few seconds, it\u2019s needlessly wrapped into a messy jumble of sophistry and weird unfunny jokes. Why can\u2019t these kids just talk like normal human beings? That would sure as hell make them more engaging to watch, and you know, relatable. Mai is the typical tsundere archetype, with the intruiging bunny girl costume appearing the most in episode one, then rarely appearing for the rest of the series. The whole \u2018Bunny Girl\u2019 hook in the title is contrived for what amounts to little more than big budget clickbait. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one area which Bunny Girl Senpai is deserving of praise, its themes. At least from a conceptual standpoint, they add some nuance and relatability to cast. The execution of these themes, like the rest of the show, leaves much to be desired. Where we see the most intruiging themes on display is in Futaba's arc; she is introduced early in the show as more or less an exposition dumper with the sole purpose of lampshading plot conveniences. The relevant themes of insecurity and social anxiety addressed in her arc are muddled by the terrible hackneyed script. She is a scientist girl for the sole purpose of spouting tropey quantum theory pseudo-science to explain away everything that\u2019s happening. It\u2019s always painfully apparent that the author just read a brief summary about the theories he uses in his story in an attempt to seem intelligent, but it's so clear he didn't bother to fully research them so instead it makes him look stupider. These overlong, cringe-inducing, self-congratulatory \u2018science\u2019 scenes occur almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nNothing in Bunny Girl Senpai feels real, it's all plastic. Mai and the rest of the girls don\u2019t feel like fully realized characters either. They all experience some kind of turmoil yet this rarely shows through in their personalities. They are all plastic prepackaged moe archetypes, unaffected by anything they go through. Even if a character is visibly changed by their conflict after it\u2019s resolved, it is usually undermined by the show\u2019s terrible writing. For example one girl is affected by Adolescence Syndrome because she is so insecure with her body from how people have treated her, then after her affliction is resolved Sakuta interjects with another one of his crude sex jokes that objectifies her body and undermines everything the show was building towards. Another issue is the lack of lasting effects to each arc. They are paced too poorly for us to see how characters are impacted, rather a satisfying conclusion the story just moves on. When the author decides he\u2019s bored of a girl he simply ends the arc, in favor of a new case of Adolescence Syndrome. Of course, with another stock standard girl taken off the shelves at A-1 Pictures\u2019 waifu warehouse to become the show\u2019s new main appeal for a few weeks, until she is inevitably relegated to the supporting cast in favor of a new poster girl.\\n\\n\r\nIt makes the author seem like an impatient teenage boy who just wants to shove as many beautiful girls into the arms of the cool guy bland protagonist. He pairs a girl with the protagonist and lets them flirt a little bit, and before he has to commit and actually develop said girl he gets bored of her. And writing a nuanced character is such hard work for him. So instead he just solves the issue by tossing aside the old girl in favor of a fresh new waifu to fawn all over his self-insert. This is, of course, a fundamental issue of most harem anime, a revolving door of waifus and a self insert protagonist. Being a light novel adaptation, Bunny Girl Senpai bears many structural similarities to a harem anime. Generally this is the reason why I avoid the genre, that and obnoxious fanservice which this series is thankfully frugal with. Eventually, it leaves off on a non-ending because this is an adaptation of an ongoing light novel. The show tries to wrap up the story as neatly as possible at the end of the last girl's arc, but it crashes and burns in its finale. The climax is a filled with overwrought crying, forced drama, and the cheesiest and most cringe-inducing writing in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nIn a better series, this barren wasteland of a script could be saved by a larger budget, or a more experienced director. However, this show\u2019s decidedly unimaginative directing style leaves much to be desired. The art is mediocre, it\u2019s in no way vivid to look at, the directing fails to make the long stretches of dialogue remotely interesting. Aside from the abhorrent CGI crowds, it isn\u2019t a visual disaster, it could be worse, but it could be so much better. Other dialogue heavy anime like the Monogatari Series utilize unique directing techniques and plenty of visual storytelling to engage the viewer in lengthy conversations between two characters. Strangely, Bunny Girl Senpai desires to be watched as a thoughtful supernatural character drama, but it plays out like a generic light novel romantic comedy, taking the worst aspects of each and failing to craft an original or worthwhile series.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 4/10]\\n\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai presents intruiging themes of how people treat and mistreat one another during adolescence. However, it fails to execute its best ideas successfully or in a compelling way due to terrible pacing, narrative structural issues, needlessly convoluted dialogue, mediocre presentation, and a thoroughly unlikable main character. If the author possessed half of the self-awareness he seems to think he has, this may not have been an overrated, cringy, bore-fest.",

            "content": "Anime about teens in high school are a dime a dozen in this medium. You could say, if your anime isn\u2019t set in some sort of school setting, then chances are it\u2019s not really an anime\u2014unless it has Bankai\u2019s or something. While on the surface, this would look like a run-of-the-mill show, it dares to offer something different than most high school anime doesn\u2019t dare touch\u2014and that is reality itself.\r\nWith a (translated) title such as Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (Bunny Girl Senpai for short) and the promotional poster of an attractive girl in a sexy bunny outfit, you would think thatthis would be a slice-of-life comedy with all of the tropes tossed into the pot in order to generate merchandise sales, right? That is where you are seriously mistaken! Despite the red flag in the title\u2014very long titles tend to be disappointing anime\u2014it prioritizes storytelling before fanservice and otaku pandering, giving the audience an atmosphere and characters that we can sympathize with and relate to on a deeper level than their appearance. The reality is showing how to deal and overcome some of the issues we go through in adolescence, and not all resolutions are happy endings. These issues come under the guise of a supernatural phenomenon called Puberty Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nWith a straightforward plot, the story revolves around our main protagonist, Sakuta Asusagawa, who meets girls with Puberty Syndrome, and must help them overcome their emotional instability in order to save them. It\u2019s a fictional illness which can cause a slew of problems for adolescents. Mai Sakurajima (Bunny Girl) is at the centre of this as she experiences invisibility to everyone. Mai is a well-known celebrity, and yet very few people but Sakuta is able to see her, are able to remember she even exists. We all know that feeling of being invisible. We know we physically aren\u2019t, yet all the attention is directed at everyone else, we feel stuck, having to take it all in, without actually being a part of it. It\u2019s heartbreaking for Mai who is a social star and is used to been seen all the time. The people she wants to notice her don\u2019t, more so they can\u2019t. Despite her success\u2014she\u2019s totally alone. Sakuta can relate to this since he\u2019s vicariously experienced it through his sister, Kaede. It\u2019s soul-crushing, and he wants to help.\\n\\n\r\nPuberty Syndrome is a culmination of all the things we hate about growing in adolescence, mainly the things we\u2019ve gone through at our lowest points. It\u2019s a visualisation of them, placing a magnifying glass on the invisible, examining what makes these particular things so painful. Sakuta\u2019s friend, Rio Futaba acts as the show\u2019s narrative device, offering exposition on this phenomenon and quantum mechanics that might otherwise come from a floating voice from the sky. Information is always better revealed through character interaction since we\u2019re experiencing the story through the eyes of Sakuta. Futaba doesn\u2019t just serve that purpose, she slots into the dynamic, falling for people, just as other characters do and experiences Puberty Syndrome herself. Although this supernatural occurrence is fascinating, it isn\u2019t the selling point. That belongs to the characters, their dialogue, their interactions and chemistry together\u2014especially when it comes to Sakuta and Mai.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a \u2018spark\u2019 when our main protagonists are together, it\u2019s like a captivating dance. They are always in sync, but they are always moving. One pushes, the other yields. Then the roles are reversed. Back and forth, back and forth. They\u2019re not fighting. Their energies are harmonized\u2014towards the mutual goal of a seamless performance, eventually, they're perfectly balanced against one another. Even in instances where the pair is fighting\u2014whether it be sub textual, verbally, or physically, the balance remains. They are evenly matched. Each gives as good as he or she gets\u2014and there is inevitably a certain measure of respect, one for the other\u2019s skill. They spar almost from the moment they meet. Their arguments are earnest, but their energy is always aligned, the chemistry between them is the best thing that Bunny Girl Senpai has going for it. This is the result of putting two lively characters together where they create a dance of opposition and harmony, having a focus on dynamic character archetype, creating coherent conflict, and lastly, enacting change.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s to appreciate here is that Bunny Girl Senpai manages to avoid delving too far into that clich\u00e9 by keeping Sakuta solely interested in Mai. In fact, they become a couple, and early in the series. It\u2019s very refreshing to see an MC who isn\u2019t so easily swayed by other women and instead tries to keep things platonic between him and the other girls struggling with Puberty Syndrome. Sakuta treats people the same, and while his smug and sarcastic nature usually enjoys poking fun, underneath his deadpan persona is a genuine guy who is caring and respectful. Mai is a character who goes through a great deal of development, she has changed so much throughout the course of the show without sacrificing her traits to be carried by Sakuta; she\u2019s strong-willed, intelligent, independent and honest. The dynamics between them and the casualness of their relationship is a refreshing change of pace from the hyperactive romance we are used to seeing. You feel invested in not just the plot, but how the plot affects all these characters.\\n\\n\r\nCloverworks got the opportunity of adapting Hajime Kamoshida\u2019s Light Novel. The character designs are very much like a hodgepodge of styles, to the likes of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU and Monogatari. They look great, they feel great and they sound great\u2014thanks to a talented selection of seiyuus that bring their given character's personality to life, making them believable and hitting comedic scenes out of the park. The colour palette is pulsating with vigour and energy, the background art, the layout of the architectural designs and shot composition is gorgeous and all combine to complement the alluring atmosphere of Bunny Girl Senpai. The animation has had consistency issues, but never in important moments, it\u2019s very scarce. Most of the soundtrack is casual, relaxing and suits the light-hearted tones and pacing. There are also tracks for the \u2018gut punch\u2019 scenes that evoke emotion, especially in instances where characters have melancholy reflections. The OP \"Kimi no Sei\" by the peggies is a perfect song choice, it\u2019s a very catchy acoustic rock ballad. The ED \u201cFukashigi no Carte\u201d is sung by the seiyuus of Mai, Futaba, Kaede, Tomoe Koga, Nodoka Toyohama and Shouko Makinohara at the end of their given arcs. It gives an eerie and whimsical feeling equal to the story they're telling.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai\u2019s message is incredibly relevant to the difficulties of teens today. It manages to be a surprisingly poignant metaphor for the effects that issues such as bullying and ostracization can have on youth.  It manages to keep a consistent quality of the plot without sacrificing anything to adhere to quotas of fanservice and otaku pandering. The dialogue, the characters, the progression, the music and visuals are operating as powerfully and effectively as possible. The \u201cSakuta Effect\u201d works because he is a strong character who handles situations maturely, he\u2019s not pessimistic nor arrogant in the sense he tries to do everything himself. He reaches out for help, he knows his limitations and flaws, he\u2019s self-aware, he\u2019s genuine and honest. Great characters make for great writing, and Bunny Girl Senpai is definitely a smash hit from Cloverworks and joins the discussion of Anime of the Year.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NON-CRUCIAL SPOILERS FROM ONE EARLY EPISODE\r\nRaskal Does Not Dream of Copyright Infringement\r\nThere is going to be a lot of mentions of Monogatari series in the review, because you need to understand that this series is not just similar, or inspired, or derivative. No - it\u2019s an unbelievably blatant plagiarism, it steals everything from Monogatari, and I mean EVERYTHING, except for a couple of elements stolen from Oregairu and Haruhi instead. Comparing it to the famous cases of literary plagiarism ruled by court (Like Harry Potter\u2019s rip-off called Tanya Grotter), it would 100% be ruled a copyright infringement if Nisio Isin/Kodansha ever botheredto sue (and it baffles me that they didn\u2019t). If you\u2019ve seen Monogatari before, you might get a kick out of spotting entire scenes and minute-long dialogues meticulously copypasted word-for-word (don\u2019t make it a drinking game, you\u2019ll die) but there really isn\u2019t much point in doing that over an actual rewatch, because production values are not as good as Studio SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\nWell, one might ask, wouldn\u2019t a carbon copy of a good series also be good? No, because there is another element in play - the author is a talentless hack. Something called \u201cstupidity\u201d manifests in multiple aspects of this story making it impossible to enjoy. Here are some examples:\\n\\n\r\n1. Primitive surface-level copying results in nonsense. The best example is the show's title - it\u2019s terrible for marketing purposes because it made many people believe this is going to be some ecchi harem. Well, the title comes from the female lead wearing a bunny-girl suit ...for approximately 15 seconds that basically amount to nothing plot-wise. You see, in Monogatari heroines have animal leitmotifs, and that got copypasted - except the writer couldn\u2019t think of any actual reason for this inside the story, so it\u2019s just an awkward non sequitur, sitting there, doing nothing except making the title stupid - and there are many other examples like that.\\n\\n\r\n2. Insufferable protagonist. There is a certain trope familiar to most anime watchers - \u201cbadass loner\u201d, aka \u201cGary Stu\u201d, aka \u201cSelf-insert Jesus-kun\u201d, aka \u201cliterally me\u201d. Araragi from Monogatari looks like one - until he isn\u2019t, because writing anime cliches as complex real people is what that series does. Hachiman from Oregairu is another take - he is also real, i. e. an awkward teenager who has trouble socializing. Being a talentless hack he is, the writer of Aobuta couldn\u2019t do anything but write this trope completely straight. The MC is supposedly antisocial pariah, but he has social skills and confidence of a god. When some dumb females give him shit he just says \u201cbegone thot!\u201d and they run away in shame, defeated by his awesomeness. He beats a jock twice his size in a fist fight by \u201coutsmarting\u201d him, nevermind a gang of jock\u2019s friends standing there doing nothing. It\u2019s just so cringy to watch. Kirito from SAO is a better protagonist, at least that guy farmed levels or something.\\n\\n\r\n3. Idiotic non-logic. Monogatari has supernatural phenomena explained with ghosts. Aobuta has supernatural phenomena explained with quantum mechanics. That is, dumb and cringy \u201cis math related to science?\u201d level of quantum mechanics understanding. That\u2019s not my point, pseudo-science is just a particular case of a bigger problem of nothing making sense. This is also better explained with an example. Spoiler ahead:\\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler begins here**\\n\\n\r\nHere is a conversation between two characters:\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cI\u2019m trapped in a day-long time loop.\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cThat means there is another person also trapped in the same loop.\u201d\\n\r\nNonsense, right? Well the conversation is slightly longer but boils down to exactly that. Here is a full version with my play-by-play:\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cI\u2019m trapped in a day-long time loop.\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cWhat if you're not trapped, but instead perfectly predict the future, and experience it as an advanced form of jamais vu?\u201d     //How could this possibly be a first idea in reaction to the time loop? How does that work? Why is it a time loop that repeats multiple times instead of just being clairvoyant? You what?\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cHow so?\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cLaplace\u2019s demon. A theoretical intelligence that can perfectly calculate position and behaviour of every particle in the universe, therefore, can predict the future.\u201d      //But why would it make a repeating loop instead of just being clairvoyant??? Why would Laplace\u2019s demon be your first idea if it doesn\u2019t actually fit the nature of the situation?\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Laplace\u2019s demon, I\u2019m a normal human\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cThat means some other person is Laplace\u2019s demon and they do the calculations. You\u2019re quantum entangled with that person so you experience their time loop.\u201d     //Again, how could this possibly be your first idea? Other person being Laplace\u2019s demon doesn\u2019t actually answer any of the questions posed. Also, quantum entanglement... a) Is an actual physical phenomena, not theoretical construct, and it doesn\u2019t fit the situation at all, so it wouldn\u2019t be a thing that comes to mind here; b) Doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Laplace\u2019s demon, so it wouldn\u2019t come to mind based on that; c) DOESN\u2019T EXPLAIN WHY THE TIME IS REPEATING IN A LOOP, INSTEAD OF TWO PEOPLE BEING CLAIRVOYANT. \\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler ends here**\\n\\n\r\nNotice the pattern? Wrong physics aside, none of the conclusions of Person B logically follow from previously reached conclusions, it\u2019s a bunch of random lines arranged one after another. Either the author is a moron and \u201clines arranged one after another\u201d is his understanding of how logic works, or he thinks the audience are morons and he can scam them with this garbage if he talks fast and sounds confident. Incidentally, if someone tries \u201cbut that\u2019s just Person B\u2019s theory, it doesn\u2019t have to be true\u201d on you - spit them in the face because the characters act on those assumptions and they are proven to be 100% correct.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 because this series provides nothing of value and has no reason to exist, except to give an answer to a weird thought experiment - what if some acclaimed series was the same, but written by an author 50 IQ points lower.\\n",

That was the moment in which I was so graciously blessed by this anime, to save me from myself, and help me understand what I\u2019d known all along. That of course, it was the cat.Schrodinger\u2019s cat.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai, Cloverworks\u2019 wildly popular light novel adaptation, is the type of anime to present itself as something to be desired, only to constantly undermine itself with every waking moment. It takes any amount of credibility you could attribute to its core themes and tells you to go elsewhere. It\u2019s the type of show I so desperately wanted to enjoy, something that I could wholeheartedly say earned my AOTY, but turned me away at nearly every step of the journey. \\n\\n\r\nSakuta, our story\u2019s protagonist, is generally an inexpressive, unintentional lady killer. His intentions are deceptively pure, and most notable of all, he consistently manages to be the most inconsistent character in the series. He takes on the persona of a perverted, dense teenage boy.  His demeanor is relatively cynical, and his method of solving issues is inconsistently bizarre. There are moments in which takes a full 180, falling victim to the notion of dramatic climax. In these times, he expresses his cathartic side, often tearing up or yelling wildly. His outbursts come off as less of a part of his character, and more as an effect of the story. Sakuta receives what some may call \u201cdevelopment\u201d throughout the course of the arcs, and while I can see why it may be perceived as such, it falls short on a few fronts. First and foremost, Sakuta does not change at all in between or during the arcs. He maintains the same outlook, attitude and demeanor throughout the entirety of the show. The only development that is visibly noticeable is Sakuta\u2019s life changing interaction with Shouko. The Sakuta the viewer is made known to, is as I described above. The Sakuta we are exposed to in his occasional flashbacks, is not the same person. This meaning, while the two Sakuta\u2019s we are made known to are different when compared before and after, it has nothing to do with Sakuta\u2019s character in the story at large. All this interaction serves as, is a justification for why his current attitude is the way it is. It\u2019s two contrasting personalities, that are inferably conjoined, but not detailed enough to connect on a developmental level. Sakuta does not change over the course of the story, but rather changes before the story, and uses that as a lame justification for lazy character writing. Sorry for the redundancy, just wanted to make that clear. I\u2019ve heard arguments as to the change in his optimism as a result of meeting Mai. Considering Sakuta was by no means \u201csad\u201d before meeting Mai I believe the scenario speaks for itself. Being happy is not development, happiness exists as a by-product of being alive.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Sakuta\u2019s inconsistency comes in (other than the outbursts) is how his methodology of dealing with conflicts changes as the story progresses. Keep in mind that the basic frameworks of his character are not changing as these solutions change. Initially, Sakuta is displayed as someone willing to go to the ends of the earth to solve a problem he is invested in. He believes that if he can assist in someone\u2019s woes, he inevitably will intervene. He maintains this mentality for the next arc, going as far as to publicly embarrass himself for the sake of Tomoe. After this though, he takes a sharp turn in how he approaches issues. He begins allowing those he\u2019s helping to fix their own situations. He \u201cadopts\u201d a mentality in which he believes that there are times when people can only truly help themselves. He isn\u2019t conflicted over this change in world view, just accepts it as though it never happened. Had he consistently used this philosophy or any philosophy for that matter, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but then after a couple arcs, he slowly begins gravitating back without any apparent thought process, intervening at some points, withheld at others. Inconsistent character philosophy is not development either. It\u2019s frankly the exact opposite and removes possible room for development by creating a gray area in the projected principles of the character. \\n\\n\r\nMai, the main heroine and incidentally the \u201cbunny girl\u201d, is a character design with a voice actor. She has no feasible motive or desire that\u2019s worth caring for aside from her relationship to Sakuta and wanting to be in show business. Once her character arc is over, she becomes a cameo. She shows up whenever Sakuta needs motivation or inspiration and helps him tie up the loose ends of whatever he\u2019s dealing with. That\u2019s seriously all there is to her.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of whether you found these characters likeable or not, they remain unexplored throughout the entirety of the show, with a frighteningly scarce amount of decipherable insight as to the purpose of their actions, or how to interpret their occasional manic episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my mind there lies a cut and dry line between characters that are memorable, and characters that aren\u2019t, and this applies to the supporting cast as well. When the sole purpose of a character\u2019s existence is to be \u2018acceptable\u2019 and convey the story in a way that is admissible, I think that character is worthless. With no hyperbole intended; most of the characters in this anime are arbitrary. This is not Sakuta\u2019s story. Nothing about this story is Sakuta\u2019s, in the same way that any other run of the mill character with a C-cup could replace Mai and be just as effective. I can best describe this as a story told through Sakuta\u2019s mouth, not his character. He, and everyone else are approached as though they are merely liaison between the writers and viewers, not vital to the story. \\n\\n\r\nTaking the cake for the worst character introduction ever written, is Rio Futaba. For the first six episodes, her entire character is based on the idea that she is \u201csmart\u201d. She solves the mysteries. She knows, realizes and explains things that only the most omnipotent of light novel characters could imagine. You thought hacker Kirito was obnoxious? Well this is Kirito\u2019s brain on drugs. She\u2019s (not) well versed in quantum mechanics. She knows the ins and outs of other\u2019s relationships and how they think, yet she is as emotionally aware as a stick of glue when it comes to herself. She is essentially included as a means of easily explaining the content that the writer didn't know how to include in the dialogue (for good reason). To be fair, her personal arc is decent. For a brief non-spoiler synopsis, she encounters an issue in which she is forced to confront romantic feelings and deals with them accordingly. This at the very least makes use of her emotional obliviousness to expand on her character depth (ever so slightly) and create some sense of human existence within her robotic air. This, in my opinion was the only way to salvage her character, and I appreciate Kamoshida\u2019s basic understanding of the characters he had created.   \\n\\n\r\nKaede is in fact a decent character, in both design and execution, and managed to outclass both main characters in her first five seconds of screen time. She has the only interesting character introduction that isn\u2019t butchered soon after, and her panda pajamas were an awesome complement to her shut-in status. She exemplifies both the irritating younger sister, as well as the retrospectively mature one once she undergoes her character arc. She receives the season finale, and deservedly so. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot structure of this show is both interesting and immensely disappointing. Much like the Monogatari Series, the main character encounters some sort of supernatural issue with a future member of his mock-harem every few episodes and assists in resolving it. Coming from someone who only liked one member of the supporting cast, and none from the main; I found every piece of character interaction in this anime to be uninteresting. Stories with no overarching plot rely heavily on character interaction. So, you might be able to tell where the \u201cimmensely disappointing\u201d part came from.\\n\\n\r\nStory-telling is far from my specialty, but I have to say, introducing a concept, not defining it, loosely basing it on a bunch of random things and then running with it isn\u2019t such a good basis for a plot. The million-dollar question: What is puberty syndrome? In short, it\u2019s whatever fits the direction that the story goes in. \u201cAbnormal experiences rumored on the internet to be caused by sensitivity and instability during adolescence.\u201d, is how MAL chooses to define it. However, Rio likes to think outside that limiting box. Kamoshida (LN author) created a drinking game where every time a character is affected by the ambiguous \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d he\u2019d take five shots, get out a different high-school textbook and vomit some Rio dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe first \u201cencounter\u201d is that of Mai becoming \u2018invisible\u2019 and forgotten by the world around her. Hundreds of interesting metaphors could be drawn from this. Hell, you could derive a social commentary on celebrity culture in a heartbeat, and my god the list goes on. Honestly it looked like the show was heading in the direction of using metaphorical insinuations as a means of explanation. Instead, off the rails it went. Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Yes, that Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Why? Cause Rio said so. I understand the idea of using real concepts to ground fictional ones in the same reality, but the concepts must be at least somewhat related. It\u2019s because they take such a farfetched grab at using this repeatedly, that it comes off as a lame gimmick that ignores basic knowledge on the subject. Just as an example, for Mai\u2019s arc, the writing excludes the concept of a half-life, radiation emission probability not being linear; point being, why use a real concept if you\u2019re going to alter its factual basis? Like I said before, it makes it seem more like a gimmick than a tactic. This all to further prove my theory that the pseudo-science exposition is used only to make Rio sound smart and bait the viewer into believing whatever nonsense she cooks up. I used the first encounter as an example to avoid spoilers, but I assure you, none of the other encounters are resolved with any sense of clarity in mind, and almost play out the exact same every time. Some of you may be like me, in that you find the metaphorical insinuations much more interesting. I fully understand and would love for that to be all there is to it. Unfortunately, though, the writer decided to use this method of half-assed pseudo-science to explain puberty syndrome, or at least ground it in some way, shape or form. I hope I don\u2019t have to explain why saying that \u201cthe reality of a concept is unimportant\u201d, is completely ridiculous when the intent of the concept is to be made realistic by comparing it to other real concepts. In all honesty any attempt at clearly defining Puberty Syndrome will be haphazard at best, because the author is hell bent on basing it on real concepts that just don\u2019t relate.\\n\\n\r\nRomance is a tricky genre to tread. In this I think Bunny Girl Senpai is at its finest. As a once upon a time fan of The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, I know for a fact that Kamoshida is capable of writing somewhat captivating romances, which is the main reason I picked up this anime. There is a substantial amount of embarrassingly uncomfortable confessions here if that\u2019s your thing. If you are willing to put up with the rest of the shit-slinging, there is a romance story to be had.\\n\\n\r\nHigh-school rom-com anime have the world\u2019s worst track record for horribly integrated settings. The characters in this show have no interaction with the world around them. There is an unwritten standard for both emotional and striking scenes in anime, or any medium for that matter. The iconography/detail of the background and location plays a huge part, and obviously a plethora of other factors contribute as well (BGM, etc.). For the most part though setting is hugely related to the impact of a scene. I\u2019ve racked my brain over and over, to arrive at the conclusion that the only scenery that could hold emotional value in this anime is the beach. The reason being, Sakuta receives his adopted world view from Shouko there, and most of the arcs end up in that area. This is fine, they succeeded in created one area that, while being scarcely occupied by them, holds some value to the viewer. Where the issue lies is that there is nowhere else in this show that is iconic in any meaningful way. Nowhere in the entire world. Not the school in which they spend most of their time, not Sakuta\u2019s stark bedroom. Nowhere. This is one of those instances where this show represents itself as desirable, and then immediately undermines that sentiment. There are plenty of examples of how secondary settings in school anime can become emotionally valuable to the viewer. Take Yui\u2019s bedroom from K-On!, 3-Gatsu no Lion\u2019s stairwell, Clannad\u2019s clubroom, Oregairu\u2019s roof top, Love Live\u2019s roof top/stairwell/school, or any other show known to have massive emotional attachments to their respective fan-base. They all have at least a few locations that manage to create a summative semblance of a world around them. When every background is as bland and unimaginative as possible, the characters become painstakingly vital, and we just established that the characters aren\u2019t even treated as characters at all. Because of this, even when it\u2019s time to reach the heights of the show\u2019s respective arcs, everything is trivialized by the fact that nothing about the world around the characters is important. On top of this, every bit of melodrama incorporated in the scene is amplified infinitely. Melodrama and characters that I don\u2019t like are not a combination I\u2019m too fond of. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, Bunny Girl Senpai introduces a jarring amount of interesting ideas and fumbles nearly all of them. The topic of being an outcast is referred to a few times in this story. Relatability aside, this is an easy and reliable way to create viewer empathy towards the protagonist\u2019s cause. What would be the one thing that the author shouldn\u2019t do immediately after introducing Sakuta as a social outcast? In my mind it would be giving him a decently large friend group. Guess what, he has the jock guy as a friend, Rio, Mai and the reporter all within the first two episodes. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s just sloppy writing. Next up on the list is sexual stigmatism. Sakuta is someone who likes to make puns out of sexually charged remarks. I like this aspect of the show. I think people are far too awkward about sex, and it\u2019s always refreshing to see anime tackle this in a way that isn\u2019t too obnoxious. So, let\u2019s run through this again. What is the one thing that the writing must avoid in order to promote de-stigmatizing sexual remarks and make it ubiquitous with the dialogue? I would say choosing character tropes that have trouble confronting romantic emotions is a big one to avoid. \\n\\n\r\nHead count: \\n\r\nMai - comfortable with sexually charged jokes.  \\n\r\nMai\u2019s sister \u2013 uncomfortable with Sakuta\u2019s humor.\\n\r\nTomoe - can\u2019t confront romantic emotions. \\n\r\nRio - emotionally unaware and distressed\\n\r\nKaede \u2013 emotionally distressed, but comfortable with Sakuta\u2019s humor. \\n\\n\r\nMore than HALF of the main female characters not only can\u2019t deal with sexual remarks, but also have some quantity of emotional ineptitude within themselves. I\u2019m not so ignorant as to believe it would be natural to have every female character in the show be into raunchy humor, but more than half of them aren\u2019t. There is the likely explanation of viewing Sakuta\u2019s perverted attitude play off other character tropes. Unfortunately, when you give more than half the cast the same reaction, it\u2019s tough to remain interested, which leads me to believe the raunchy comedy is indeed an attempt as destigmatizing sex among the demographic watching it. Either way, there were inherent flaws in the way this concept was presented, which is unfortunately the case the with the better half of every concept addressed in this show.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most remarkable technical aspect of this show is its pacing. For a 13-episode light novel adaptation, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that genuine thought went into the storyboarding and layout of the episodes. Director Souichi Masui, having storyboarded on huge titles such as \u201cBeck\u201d, \u201cSoul Eater\u201d and \u201cSamurai Champloo\u201d, may have had a significant impact on how well the pacing turned out. However, this story is adapted from a light novel, and even premonitions aside, the additional effort that it takes to realize writing into animation with no layout of the authors thoughts in the form of scenes and direction makes for a more difficult time generating creative trademarking. This doesn\u2019t mean that the sloppy cuts and uninteresting angles used are excusable, but certainly had a hand in the overall ineffectiveness of any intended artistic integrity. A comparable show like Monogatari (in plot structure, and the fact that they are both light novel adaptations) which uses style as a defining factor makes it known that it\u2019s possible to combine light novel adaptations and individualistic direction, so why is this show so incredibly dispassionate? I can\u2019t answer that question without some lofty speculation, so I\u2019ll briefly summarize the point of this paragraph. Essentially, this anime is paced well, but lacks creative influence. Bunny Girl Senpai pays tribute only to the concept of storytelling, disregarding any sense of innovation. This is not a criticism, this is an effect of viewing common seasonal anime through a critical lens. Although the above will inevitably shorten this anime\u2019s longevity, it\u2019s more than possible that a large portion of viewers don\u2019t care about this in the short term.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable aspect of this show is its sound design. Bunny Girl Senpai\u2019s OST falls somewhere just above average, with a catchy opening, decent \u2013 dramatized, albeit \u2013 but decent insert tracks, good sound effects,  and decent audio engineering in general that does well to create some sense of professionality in an otherwise rudimentary production. \\n\\n\r\nTo say that the collective reaction to Bunny Girl Senpai was one of pleasant surprise, would be the understatement of the century. \u201cA trashy bunny girl costume and a confusing, shoddy premise\u201d are the thoughts I had going in. Although only one of those two expectations were made to be inaccurate, I can say with the utmost confidence that this show is much better than a lot of people would have assumed going in. It takes a good amount of blood, sweat and tears to create something greater than the sum of its parts, and frankly this show just didn\u2019t make it there for me. It takes ideas that look acceptable on paper, and fruitlessly attempts to convert them to animation. There\u2019s really nothing wrong with missing the mark but missing the mark in almost every category (characters, plot structure, setting, core concept) and being applauded for it seems rather counter-intuitive. I understand why this show comes off as likeable. It\u2019s a very reticent, palatable show with enough charm to keep its fanbase interested. Beyond that though, there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a surface level show with exactly what meets the eye, and while some may consider that genuine, I can\u2019t bring myself to call it anything other than uninspired. So, when all\u2019s said and done, Rascal may not be dreaming of Bunny Girl Senpai, but you can bet that I will be\u2026 and with a few complaints he\u2019s well on his way to a second season (that I won\u2019t be watching) of \u201cMy Teen Romantic Calamity Pseudo-Science SNAFU\u201d.  \\n",

However, you aren\u2019t going to watch a girl wearing a bunny outfit all the time \u2026 sorry to disappoint. Also, the audience can relate the anime with Bakemonogatari, Sakurada Reset to name some and the similarity between the main characters' behavior, the mystery in the plot, and the supernatural events.\r\nOn the other hand, as a positive aspect about the series, we have the characters chemistry and an entertaining plot. The story is interesting and mysterious, it could be a bit confusing for some, butit has a taint that boosts the characters interactions and hooks the spectators with good pacing. In this anime, the author cared to develop a world where the school is the center, and the events affect the characters and the interaction with the outside world. \\n\\n\r\nWe have two main characters, but their personalities differ a lot, so the contrast makes the characters more vivid. They aren't the typical high schoolers with the same generic background as most of the high school series. The main male character Sakuta has a nice introvert attitude and with an awkward past and could be a weirdo. Furthermore, he is ironic, sarcastic and with some sense of humor executed flawlessly. The main female character aka the Bunny Girl Mai (her face looks like a bunny :3) is a famous actress but with a mature air that is not normal in this kind of series. I am finding the background very interesting, but she will experience some unexpectant events related to a certain syndrome that I am not going to explain because we have only seen four episodes and this syndrome will affect the plot outcome in several ways. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is clean and precious. I am surprised by the quality and color management. However, it is not perfect, and some camera angles could have been improved, but you won't notice them. \\n\r\nThe OP (Kimi no Sei) is marvelous. I think the peggies did a great work performing the song; the lyrics are magnificent and have a great score that helps to follow them. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the series is good so far, albeit there are some plot mysteries related to the \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d that need to be revealed and explained but there are good theories in MAL\u2019s forum.\\n",

            "content": "Bunny Girl Senpai is an anime about this famous child actress who turns invisible, a main character dude who doesn't give a fuck about anything, and his little sister who was verbally assaulted to a point that she started bleeding blood and became a shut-in. All of this happens because of some magic disease called a puberty syndrome.\r\nThe events include our main bro being some sort of women-helping Jesus except if the women are bothering him in which case he roasts them by claiming they are on their periods or otherwise strips in front of them to make them awkward blushy blush, because apparently, heis the only person in the series who doesn't get embarrassed over nothing. \\n\\n\r\nOur series relies on certain levels of edge and apathy when it wants to, but usually these things are forgotten in 3 seconds when our main bro starts roasting someone. Be it him calling a dude who is using a camera a wannabe photographer or just appearing superior to anyone else for no other reason than others being inferior to him.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really makes much sense here. Our dude cares so little about anything that he can see the invisible bunny costume-wearing senpai and then they become friends or something and chat about the supernatural things that occur in this series with the same disinterest the main bro is already radiating regarding everything that exists because that's the sole point of his character.\\n\\n\r\nThere has been quite a few series that have dealt with similar themes in highly similar manner. These include Bakemonogatari, Oregairu and Suzumiya Haruhi. The problem here is that everything in this one feels forced and fake. The main cast can be believable and realistic at times, but most of everyone else isn't. Rather they seem to exist just for the main characters since they so often are some one-dimensional buttholes or angry lil girls who get served by the mc and then disappear. Especially scenes such as random girl appearing just to fuck with the mc's shit and call him a pedophile are cringe and feel nothing other than stupido filler.\\n\\n\r\nI think melancholy, vanity, disinterest and in generally being the outcast offer incredible potential under these settings, but I fail to see what makes Bunny Girl a good exemplary of these. The best thing about this series is how familiar and welcoming it feels, but unlike so many other series similar to it, it seems like a good example of a series that is not living up to its potential at all. Real zero effort stuff. I also feel physically ill from the existential philosophies presented in the series. I feel like this series is disrespecting its audience. It's like asking philosophy student \"know who Sigmund Freud is?\" The dialogue can also be pretty meh seasoned with lame. Lewd and sexual remarks presented in a highly teenage manner and not with the level of maturity and awareness that is usually seen in the dialogue of similar anime series. I'd much rather have the cast hit the tarantino-effect instead of this nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this series promoting itself and its characters with the \"I am not like all the rest\" -attitude, what I am seeing here is pretty much like most of the rest: A completely average anime series, soulless and empty version of what it could have been. Attempt to make the next big hit under these settings, but failing to see what made any of the earlier ones worth of praise in the first place. I give this a 4 instead of a 5 just to show how little effort it takes to be as edgy as the mc.",

            "content": "Story: 7/10\r\nThe story of Seishun Buta is relatively simple, there is a supernatural phenomenon that happen and that its origin is unknown. This phenomenon is known as ''puberty syndrome'', the protagonist's little sister has been a victim of this phenomenon in the past. The anime begins with Sakuta meeting Sakurajima Mai, who is also being the victim of this phenomenon, from there the protagonist decides to help her.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe opening and ending are very good, when they starts you get so excited. The soundtrack also is good, although it is not perfect, but it is  enough to cause impact during drama scenes.\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThe maincharacter, Sakuta, is so badass! man, i wish be like he. Sakuta in only 5 episodes prove be a excellent character, he goes against all protagonist cliches and surprise you in each new episode. The heroine, Mai, is also a good character, she isn't like the others girls that you usually see in animes, she is racional and not a stupid tsundere. The others characters is also good, in special the cientist girl (dude, i like much her)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDude, I honestly would give 10 easily to this anime just for the entertainment. You start the episode and when you realize it is over. You become totally focused, the time seems to accelerate. The fact that each episode brings up something new that breaks down cliches surprises us more and more (Especially the protagonist, who goes against 90% of other animes).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like animes that are not cliches, in which there are great characters, romance that progresses, and of course, an excellent protagonist, I highly recommend watch Seishun Buta.",

            "content": "\u2018I live life everyday hoping that I\u2019m a slightly kinder person than I was the day before\u2019 - Makinohara Shoko\r\nIf you thought this show was about literal BUNNY GIRLS, boi should you be prepared to be bamboozled by the most misleading title that you mightve ever come across. I was watching the first few minutes of the first episode expecting something probably as ecchi as it seems on the cover art, but hot damn did I got hooked by the quirky characters, mainly the interactions between our main protagonists. This show within the first episode reminded me of Bakemonogatari, which till this date Istill think has one of the best monologues and dialogues, and now at the end of it, I think we have a great contester to dethrone the monogatari series, and here I present you, Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai.\\n\\n\r\nStory / Character -10-\\n\r\nRevolving around the idea of \u2018Puberty Syndrome\u2019, this story mainly focuses on how our male protagonist, Sakuta settles this problem for the ones undergoing this syndrome. Albeit totally supernatural, there are sufficient backstory and explanations relating to quantum physics and what not (if you can understand that is), in which I think is always a great touch to the story to not let the audience sit in confusion. Puberty Syndrome is where you might find random bruises or cuts throughout your body, or having a juxtapose of yourself that takes your rightful place etc. However, because the setting of this story is actually in high school, it can be very relatable to some due to the fact that the problems usually are involved with gossiping, bad mouthing or simply falling in love. Consequences of not properly solving Puberty Syndrome can lead to severe problems, just like in real life, one wrong move and it might cause you the win or lose. \\n\r\nNow moving on to our protagonist, ladies first, and it is our best girl Sakurajima Mai senpai. Humorous, bold, outgoing, what more can one ask for, it\u2019s an all in one package here for your service. Sakuta, again humorous, kind, and mostly perverted. With the encounter of Makinohara Shouko, Sakuta starts to treat others kinder and is the core of why Sakuta helps (perpetually) everyone out throughout the story, because he wants to be kind. As of the side characters, imouto, kouhai, thicc af girl IN LAB COAT, theyre all really great and likeable characters, with each of them having their own unique personalities. They also contribute a lot to the story, making this entire show a very wholesome one. Catchy settings and directing is what makes this anime stand at the top against the others this season, maybe even the year of 2018, you get so invested into the characters by the first episode it is hard to just not love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt -10- \\n\r\nCloverworks ( A-1 Pictures) nailed the crap out of it this time. The art style is really smooth to the eyes, and looks a lot like Oregairu (which is definitely an extra point), animations are fluid and some compositions are seriously on point.  Subtle emotions are well laid out on the characters and they really add up to the feelings and they convey well to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSound -10-\\n\r\nAnother big part that contributes to the wholesomeness of this show is the voice acting and the OSTs. The opening which at this point everyone probably knows how to sing, is hella catchy, and is like a blackhole sucking you in, once you heard it, theres no turning back. Same goes for the ending, every character had their own uniquely designed ending, just like how the monogatari series has the VA sing the OP for their respective arcs (in which case is the same here). Voice acting is top notch, whats better than having a quirky conversation? A lively and energetic one. And its all here in this show, cocaine for your ears my buddy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -10-\\n\r\nDefinitely my top pick of this season (year as well), if you haven\u2019t watch it, please do so already, you really don\u2019t want to miss out this show, even if the cover art turns you off (or the otherwise ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) You want some fun time watching some slice of life-y anime? Check! You want some home hitting feelings or tear jerking moments?  Check! Having doubted this anime at first was my single worst mistake Ive ever made, because this series has proven itself worthy of being one of the best animes possibly out there. With an movie adaptation for another arc in the future, I can safely say that everyone should be looking forward for that, just like how Sakuta looks forward getting teased by Mai everyday.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is a short series adapted from \"Light Novel\" this series has thirteen episodes, six years after the release of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo from the present screening Kamoshida Hajime who is the creator of this series at once The creator of the series \"Sakurasou\" recently also produced a work that Cloverworks studio appointed to become an anime.\r\nStory\r\nWhat happens when you experience a strange puberty, for example, can you exchange your body to be someone else? A story that focuses on a young man named \"Azusagawa Sakuta\" who finds himself meeting a bunny girl,it turns out Sakuta knows that person she is \"Sakurajima Mai\" who is a senior in his school. But strangely only Sakuta can see the form of a rabbit Sakurajima, both of them are looking for a way out together to uncover the mystery that happened to him.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the mystery of the series has several chapters that they must complete, if counted there are five chapters available in this series. Having supernatural themes, this series is highly anticipated by various people, but the solution they provide is forced as if they only gave a very simple impression but we can accept it.\\n\\n\r\nNot forgetting this series is also in the romantic category, indeed some of the scenes that are displayed are very simple and limited to such as holding hands (therefore this series can be watched from among the ages, but there are some scenes that contain sexual jokes that are not worth watching for children but it's still natural). The conflicts they are not very significant, they only argue about the problems they and they can solve them very simply.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nRecently, exactly two months ago a company called \"Cloverworks\" which was the parent company of \"Aniplex\" released a number of popular anime series, for example they collaborated with several studios in the recent \"Darling In The Franxx\" series. cause controversy in the whole world. In their adaptation they have no shortcomings, arguably in every adaptation they have worked very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has a rigid animation design and does not have a special characteristic, a simple character design adds to the impression that this animation becomes very simple. But the audience does not care too much about it, they only focus on a very interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAn anime series will not be good if it is not supported by the sound part. From the voice part or seiyuu they are very good, the match between the voice and the characters is very suitable they can produce good sound quality according to the age of the character they are playing.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme of \"Kimi no Sei\" sung by The Peggies is very simple but has its own characteristics, while for the closing theme \"Fukashigi no Carte\" they are very good at replacing singers in each chapter based on their respective characters.For their BGM they are very careful in their selection, sometimes BGM is at the center of attention, for example when fighting is not only important animation but BGM also plays an important role in this matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThis series has two main characters, telling about their school life is not an ordinary student they have strange puberty. Sakuta is a student who is boring in the eyes of many people, he has a dark past therefore he is shunned by many people but he still live his life as usual. After meeting Sakurajima Mai Sakuta's life changed which initially had no purpose in life now with the spirit of living his life.\\n\\n\r\nHas a strange youth Sakurajima Mai is very bored because at any time she can disappear in the eyes of everyone, but one time when she was in the middle of a meeting she met a Sakuta, he was able to see the form of Mai wearing a rabbit costume. artist who has ignorance to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAfter him meeting with Mai, Sakuta is now acquainted with a girl named Koga. She is the younger sister of Sakuta's class who has a cheerful nature but behind her cheerful nature, she has a strange youth. Different from the others, Koga can return time based on her will.\\n\\n\r\nHaving a smart and beautiful friend is the hope of everyone. Futaba, who is Sakuta's classmate, has an easy to talk nature, but this Futaba has a strange youth where he can split into two.\\n\\n\r\nMai has a half sister named Nodoka, she is an artist like Mai. Nodoka has jealousy towards people who are stronger than him, as a result of his character he can exchange bodies with other people so that he can feel what the person can feel.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta is also just like Mai, she also has a younger sister, but the difference is the younger sibling. The sister of Sakuta named Kaede, she is a confined and timid girl but she has a reason why she is moody. from his classmates, therefore he became a confined and timid girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis season has many interesting anime series and one of them is Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai tells about puberty syndrome, this series has a very interesting story in each episode even we are invited to think how to solve the problems they are facing.",

            "content": "This review contains some light spoilers.\r\nOftentimes the word \u201cpretentious\u201d is thrown around to criticize shows with complex plots or extravagant visuals with the assumption that calling the anime \u201cpretentious\u201d with no explanation of how that detracts from the quality of the show is a valid criticism in and of itself. However, in the case of \u201cBunny Girl,\u201d Kamoshida\u2019s pretensions are detrimental to the quality of the writing to the point that the incredibly simple ideas presented in this show become unnecessarily difficult to understand solely so Kamoshida can stroke his ego.\r\nThe first arc of Bunny Girl is dedicated to Mai Sakurajima\u2019s case of adolescence syndrome.This syndrome caused Mai to turn invisible and made everyone forget except for the Sakuta (the MC) and his friends to forget that she exists. While I think this is all fine, the issue arises from Kamoshida\u2019s attempt to explain this simple concept using Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Not only does Kamoshida fail to explain Schrodinger\u2019s cat correctly, but it isn\u2019t even an accurate representation of Mai\u2019s situation. There is a much simpler and more widely known thought experiment that goes: \"if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\" If no one perceives Mai, does she exist? The tree falling thought experiment reflects Mai\u2019s syndrome so much better that it is just dumbfounding that Kamoshidadecided to incorrectly apply Schrodinger\u2019s cat to the situation instead. This is just terrible writing. Kamoshida takes a concept that could easily be understood with little explanation, and then makes it as complex as he possibly can for no reason other than to show of his poor understanding of Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Unfortunately for us, this isn\u2019t the last time Kamoshida shoves his lack of knowledge of quantum mechanics down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc of the series focuses on the Sakuta\u2019s underclassman whose case of adolescence syndrome created a time loop that caused everyone to relive the same day 3 times. This isn\u2019t a complicated or novel idea. Hollywood movies like Groundhog Day and even children\u2019s shows like Cardcaptor Sakura have made use of time loops. Of course, Kamoshida decides to make it as convoluted as possible by using Laplace\u2019s Demon to explain this simple plot device. \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime to be be pretentious in the way it is written, it has to present itself as being deeper than it actually is. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s inherently a bad thing While I think this word gets overused as a lazy criticism to describe any \u201csmart\u201d anime, in the case of Bunny Girl, Kamoshida\u2019s pretensions significantly diminish the quality of the writing. Kamoshida takes straight forward ideas and makes them unnecessarily complicated by introducing unnecessary quantum mechanics that he doesn\u2019t even fully understand. But if you think this is the end to the terrible writing present in this anime, you\u2019re dead wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEvery line of dialogue in this anime sounds as if it was painstakingly crafted by the author to sound as clever and witty as possible. Unfortunately, Kamoshida is neither clever nor witty and the dialogue just ends up feeling incredibly stilted. The dialogue is composed of the kind of lines that people wish they had said when thinking about a conversation they had minutes ago. No one speaks like this! It\u2019s unnatural and unrealistic. Everything that comes out of Sakuta\u2019s mouth is just an obnoxious one-liner. Kamoshida clearly doesn\u2019t even understand the most basic rules for writing passable dialogue, and the fact that it\u2019s the primary point of praise for this show is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough less bothersome than Kamoshida\u2019s sheer incompetence as a writer, the fan service in this show is almost offensive because it\u2019s the kind of fan service that thinks it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t mind fan service or being blatantly pandered to as long as the show is honest about it, but Bunny Girl tries to justify its fan service in the most pathetic ways possible. The worst example of this is in the beginning of the series when Mai dresses as a bunny girl to test whether other people can see her as if that\u2019s the most logical thing she could do. It\u2019s not reasonable, it\u2019s just a pitiful attempt at disguising fan service because Kamoshida thinks he\u2019s above it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakuta is a bit more cynical and edgy than most generic self-insert main characters. Mai is slightly more understanding than most tsunderes. Those are the only things that make the characters in Bunny Girl unique. If you\u2019ve seen a light novel adaptation before, you\u2019ve seen these characters before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the art, it\u2019s just very average. If Cloverworks didn\u2019t take every available opportunity to assault my eyes with a mob of hideous 3DCG background characters, I would give this category a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Bunny Girl is just godawful and nothing else about this anime is really worth mentioning.\\n",

            "content": "\"Never judge a book by its cover.\" - Some random person.\r\nThis Fall 2018 anime season, there are a lot of shows to watch on. Honestly, on my opinion, I enjoy this season pretty much more than any other seasons this year. From Goblin Slayer giving us memes and war, SAO back at it again with another season of Kirito OP-ness, to Jojos returning to TV screen with its title \"Golden Wind\", Fall season this year is definitely a must-see season.\r\nLet us not forget the romance or drama genre of anime which are plenty this season as well. One of them, giving us audience a prettymuch click-baiting cover is \"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\" or in short, \"Bunny-girl Senpai\". When I looked at the cover picture of the anime on its MAL page and its synopsis I was like \"Oh... It is another typical and generic harem anime that the protagonist is always at the center of everything and he is not that lovable to the audience perspective I bet.\"\\n\r\nThat WAS my statement until I watched up to episode 3 and kept going until I finished it. I was so damnnn wrong.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe follow the story of Azusagawa Sakuta to his daily high-school life. It was normal, until he met Sakurajima Mai wearing a bunny suit in a library. Weird am I right? But as the story goes on, we get to follow that Mai is suffering to a what is called as a \"Puberty Syndrome\" which incase for her, turning invisible to other people (except Sakuta because he is the protagonist). \\n\r\nThis was the starting point of the story. We get to know so many types of Puberty Syndromes that revolves around Sakuta's girl colleagues not only Mai. Does this sound pretty familiar? Yes.. It is almost like the plot of the Monogatari series. In spite of that, Bunny girl senpai tends to create a unique atmosphere to the audience. It is more on drama, feels, romance and the sufferings of the girls along with Sakuta in the story, portraying real-life issues on our society. One of the girl suffered bullying, one suffered jealousy or envy, one suffered hatred on herself and not knowing how to act what she wants, one suffered ignorance to reality and wanted loneliness and one suffered one of the harsh reality of love. Every single bit of this issues complements the story's goal and the main protagonist Sakuta who really is the center of them all. But making him the center of it doesn't make it\\n\r\nas your typical and generic harem anime unlike other anime out there that the protagonist is the center of everything and the harem is very plain. In fact, it is not even labeled as a harem on MAL which totally makes sense because the vibes of it being a harem is not there. Instead, we get the vibes of every character's problems or issues they are encountering along with Sakuta which is totally fine for the story. Hence, Bunny girl senpai's story unveils problems or issues of teenagers to our modern society that make it more of a story foreshadowing this topics and having the audience learn from it because of the experiences of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, there are soooo many waifus on this show. But let us talk about the one, the only, man of culture, Azusagawa Sakuta. Unlike any generic protagonist out there who cannot portray their real feelings in real life in front of a girl, Sakuta is different. He will say anything that comes to his mind whether it is a perverted one or someone that makes someone offensive. His replies to the girls especially to Mai-san always get me and say \"How do you have the guts to say that?\". In any case, Sakuta is one of the best male characters I've ever seen this season or maybe this year as well. Now for the waifus. My favorite Sakurajima Mai have like some sort of unique trait on her. She doesn't really care about what Sakuta is saying even it is something perverted. She is always composed but have the blush to protect. She have some little tsundere vibes but not that much unlike her little sister Toyohama Nodoka. Nodoka is like the opposite of Mai-san. She is your typical tsundere type of girl but her story gave us more details about their relationship as a sibling to Mai-san. Next girl is Koga Tomoe, which I think represents a girl that is a tryhard and wants to keep updated always to whats happening whether in real life or social media. She fears loneliness and because of that she tries to become like her classmates. Then there is Futaba Rio, the one who wears lab coats on every scene she is on and the one that advices Sakuta of the causes of Puberty Syndrome through the power of SCIENCE!. We can say she is a very smart girl considering her intelligence on quantum mechanics, physics and all sorts of mumbo-jumbo science stuff. But then like any other girl in the series, her fear or Puberty Syndrome complements to the story of the anime. It is something most of us wanted to do for the sake of others but we are unsure if we can really do it... and again because of love.. Of course we shall never forget the little sister of Sakuta, Azusagawa Kaede. Because of her I tend to like Sakuta as a main protagonist because Sakuta.. surprisingly... not in love with her little sister! Like how many times we get to see incest in anime. Like literally every season I guess? But here, Sakuta doesn't like Kaede hugging him while he was in bed and he even quoted this statement \"Who'd get excited over their little sister?\" Sakuta aside, Kaede probably have the worst type of Puberty Syndrome and it impacts Sakuta as a brother of her as whole as well. Even the parents of Sakuta and Kaede are devastated. That's why I can describe Kaede as Sakuta's challenge that makes him a hard challenger and never give up on her. And finally the little girl Makinohara Shouko is just a pure mystery to me. I mean this girl is someone important to Sakuta but there are circumstances that makes her a mystery and somewhat special. Overall, the characters are lovable to the audience that makes it entertaining to watch on every week.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOn the art side, it is good. It is not that special or anything but it is indeed watchable and pleasant. the character designs are pretty much cute as well with their eyes big but bright. It is fairly a unique art style among other art style this season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nUnfortunately, unlike the good OST of Monogatari, Bunny-girl senpai doesn't have much of that. The soundtracks are good and thats it. It just fits into the atmosphere but it is something that I will not put on my music playlist as it is not my taste. But... the opening and endings are veryy good for my ears. The opening have good sound that catches my ear and the ending portrays some sadness because..... the episode ended of course. But i said \"endings\" earlier. The endings have different characters walking in a beach. For example, if the episode is mainly about Futaba, you will see Futaba walking into the sands of the beach. The same applies to every character of each arc. Overall in terms of sound, opening song and ending song are likable while OST's are good but not for my playlists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nHence, Bunny-girl Senpai is one of those anime that makes the story sounds pretty similar to other genre or anime but its intake to it are unique. The fact that it implies some weakness or fear of teenagers makes it relatable to people and gives out feels to us. If you are looking for an anime that have a bunch of girls but have a good story and a well-narrated protagonist, this is it for you and I highly recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "TLDR: A really good Romance/Mystery anime with a lot of potential. Definitely a must watch this season.\r\nSTORY:\r\n Although I have seen similar stories in anime but so far the execution is pretty good and Far Better than MOST anime.  It is a Mystery surrounding \"Adolescence Syndrome\" where different characters face supernatural phenomena while going through adolescence and how it affects the main couple.\r\nThe show has built a lot of intrigue this far.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\n The 2 mains are compelling. The main guy is an outcast with a mysterious past. He cares about people but can give someone a verbal bitch slap if needed. He is kindbut courageous enough to stand up for himself and say what he wants. He is not a wishy-washy pussy like most romance protagonists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe girl is serious but not stuck-up. Her responses are honest yet measured. She is sometimes blunt but never rude. She is mature enough to admit her mistakes but not dwell on them.\\n\r\nShe is neither a Puritanical Prude nor an overtly seductive bimbo.\\n\r\nMost anime often have a difficulty finding a balance between these 2 traits.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThey have great chemistry. They tease each other and constantly try to one up one another, while also sharing their secrets with one another.\\n\r\nTheir conversations are interesting even when talking about mundane things.\\n\\n\r\nNO fountains of Nosebleeds/accidental boob-grabs or any silliness of that sort.\\n\r\nEverything is talked about openly and there seems to be a genuine connection.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast is fine too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & ART:\\n\r\n It is really good. Kind of looks like \"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n Good. For some reason the Opening song reminded me of \"Your Name\" opening song. May be they share similar beats, rhythm and instruments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend this show to Fans of Romance with supernatural/mystery elements.\\n\\n\r\nI have given this an 8/10 because I don't know how the story will be handled in the next episodes.\\n\r\n The score can go up or down depending on that. It definitely has the potential to be one of great ones.\\n\\n\r\nFingers Crossed",

            "content": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough Pornhub videos to know how this series is going to end.\u201d \u2014 Krunchyman\r\nThis series truly speaks to me as a fellow \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d sufferer, as I use to \u201cbaste my ham\u201d five times a day on a regular basis, and let me tell you something folks: rug-burn is an inconvenient truth.  But enough about my own troubles, because this anime is troubling enough in its own right.\r\nFirst of all, allow me to propose a theory that I kicked around in my head since viewing the first episode.  The Bunny Girl Senpai, otherwise known as Mai, is simply a figment ofSakuta\u2019s imagination, brought about by the \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d phenomena that he has superimposed on her to convince himself that she is in fact real.  Given that Sakuta has yet to experience a sexual relationship (as far as we know, at least), he envisions a girl in a scandalously lewd outfit in a public library.  Despite having a golden opportunity to live out his lustful fantasy, he decides to slow play his hand, by initiating a methodical, emotional approach to getting into Mai\u2019s pants.  If you wish to deceive yourself into believing a fantasy girl is \u201creal\u201d \u2014 like Sakuta was attempting to do \u2014 then she has to seem authentic; otherwise, the imaginative experience will fade away into the ether (just like their first encounter).\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, the concept seems plausible from a demographic perspective.  Many of the consumers watching this show are young, adolescent boys who have yet touch a girl.  And what is abundantly clear about male, anime consumers from the various salacious photos posted on their profile\u2019s?  They fantasize about provocative senpai\u2019s, whom they will never meet in their lifetime\u2019s.  Literally every anime fan has this phase in their lifetime, but, unlike most people, Sakuta had the courage to sprint toward his convictions, and make his fantasy become a reality.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I present to you: the Tyler Durden theory.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\u2026.<ahem>  Welp!  Episode three blew that theory out of the water, back to the drawing board.\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuick recap: the series is banal, the character\u2019s are ill-explored, the character designs look remarkably similar to one another, and the entire concept is so uninteresting, that I concocted a version of it in my head to maintain my level of sanity.  The scene where Sakuta started screaming towards the school, professing his affection for Mai was the lone bright spot, because I nearly fell out of my chair from laughter.  That being said, the entertainment value for Bunny Girl Senpai is noticeably absent, and I would ardently recommend that you look elsewhere for anime-related amusement.  \\n\\n\r\nContrived, school-aged bullshit; nothing more need be said.  \u201cThen why did you write the review in the first place,\u201d random MAL user \u2014 because, silly billy, hateful comments recharge my power crystals.",

            "content": "This is my first and probably last review on MAL. I think there are a couple of things to say about this anime which are not said yet. I don't want to go to much into detail so it would be better you have watched the anime before reading this.\r\nThis anime is a fanservice trash anime that pretends to be not trashy nor fanservice and attracts all people who love trash and let them believe they have found a superior good and deep anime which is at the bottom of it's heart as stupid as SAO or any other harem ecchi anime out there. \r\nIdon't want to offend anyone. I also enjoy those kind of anime like yamada kun for example. But this anime is on the one hand stupid as hell and on the other hand every single charakter and problem is a 1 by 1 copy of bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nMain charakter: He is absolutely one dimensional. He has no emotions and acts indifferent to everything what happens arround him but at times he make some couple of unfunny sarcastic jokes and tries to solve the problem of the girls from his harem (which gets bigger by almost every episode). \\n\\n\r\nSakurajima mai: Maybe the waifu of the year. The relationship between her and the mc is fanservice at it's finest. You have a celebrity good looking and cute girl who is attracted by the lowkey lowlife loser mc, which maybe represents the average consumer of that kind of anime. This is maybe why this anime gets such high ratings. Because this kind of relationship satisfies the needy needs of the male consumers.\\n\\n\r\n(Apart from mai you have all over the anime those ecchi moments like panty, boobies and so on)\\n\\n\r\nFutaba: Honestly this anime is not that bad but also not that good but this character wants me to smash my head with lightspeed against the pyramids of gizeh. \\n\r\nEverytime our beloved main character is confronted with the puberty syndrome he has no idea what's going on because he is stupid. This often take a couple of time until he realizes it and than goes to futuba who is supposed to be the smartest person in that anime. And wow every conversation between them which is about the puberty syndrom gives cancer to my ears. He tells her that person xy has problem z. She responds with some pseudo sientific and deep answers which contains some phenomens of the physics. Those responses are totally random and make absolutely no sense. This is how a conversation between her and me could be:\\n\\n\r\nMe: Futuba-chan my stomach doesn't feels so good\\n\r\nHer: Have you been to the toilet today\\n\r\nMe: Eeeeh no?\\n\r\nHer: Well i think this is because schr\u00f6dingers cat.-blabla explains it- and so is your stomach. The answer to the question what's going on with your stomach is that you have constipation and diarrhea at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nReally those conversations are so boring and stupid. If you are not familiar with quantummechanics or physics at all this might sound very deep and intellectual to you but trust me. It's just shit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last point is really everything of this anime is equivalent to bakemonogatari but only like 10 dimensions worse and boring.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta = araragi (both lowkey and lowlife persons)\\n\r\nMai = hitagi (one is a soft tsundere the other tsundere and yandere in one person)\\n\r\nFutaba = meme oshino (mc come always to them because they have no idea about their mysterys)\\n\r\nNodoka = nadeko\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest of the characters are almost the same\\n\\n\r\nAt last i want to say is something good. If it comes about teenagers and their problems in that school age this anime has it's strength. Most of them feel very realistic and autehntic. If the mc wouldnt be that one dimensional the relationship to mai would feel a bit refreshing because their contact feels alive and not that exxegerated. But the anime deals it very bad or with other words it packs it in a very shitty way. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is a bit disappointing to me. It had much more potential if the writer would have been courrageous and made something independently and not that trashy fanservice copy of an anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The challenges we face during our adolescence may be irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, though their magnitude in the moment can feel overwhelming. It's no surprise then that media which intensifies these issues through supernatural phenomenon would be popular, since teenage audiences feel as if the weight of their problems is understood. However, does this media actually help its audience to overcome their problems, or is it merely wish fulfillment to escape from them? Seishun Buta Yarou may have something compelling to say about the adolescent experience, but it's unfortunately buried under layers of tropes and cliches.\r\nBut of all the elements of theshow that feel superfluous to the narrative, the protagonist Sakuta sits at the top of the list. Unlike the girls of the show, he doesn't undergo any development over the series, and only exists as the self-insert lens through which we view their arcs. He hardly exists as a character, and his only trait seems to be his tendency for frequent dehumanizing sexual harassment directed at basically every girl he meets. He's presented as the catalyst that instigates the girls' growth, but instead he just comes across as a plot device that knows exactly what to do to solve their problems for them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, each arc of the show is modeled after a classic thought experiment, and wow do I wish they hadn\u2019t done that. Not only do these allusions not add anything to the narrative, but their integration feels completely unnatural. (\u201cSurely you\u2019ve at least heard about the cat in the box, right?\u201d a friend asks the protagonist, nearing the end of the first episode) Seishun Buta Yarou is hardly the first series to have pulled this allusion, but at this point, referencing Schrodinger\u2019s Cat seems like shorthand for a light novel thinking it\u2019s smarter than it is, and I can\u2019t think of anything else that had the audacity to follow it up with \u201cHave you heard of Laplace\u2019s Demon?\u201d three episodes later.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the contents of each arc, the conflicts that the girls deal with mostly come off as artificial. Still, even if the substance itself is lacking, I can\u2019t fault the presentation. The animation and vocal delivery is expressive, and it\u2019s also neat how there's some overlap between events that help to make each one feel less like an isolated incident. However, I think that Seishun Buta Yarou\u2019s most compelling asset is how the characters behave outside of the central narrative. Despite everything else, it\u2019s fun to see these characters relax and bounce off of each other. It's a shame that the show's best feature is also its least central.\\n\\n\r\nMy feelings towards Seishun Buta Yarou are conflicted. I went into it expecting a cross between Monogatari and Oregairu, and that\u2019s not really what I got. It took a while for me to accept the show for what it actually was, but once I did, I was able to find a genuine emotional core underneath all of the light novelisms. Ironically, I think the more interested you are in this genre, the less likely it is that Seishun Buta Yarou will appeal to you. It leans hard into its genre trappings, and your enjoyment will be largely determined by your tolerance of them. Still, if you're a fan of deadpan loner protagonists, you could do worse.",

            "content": "What do I think about Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai? It\u2019s an amazing show. That\u2019s the simple way to say it but the complicated way is explaining it from my perspective. To be fair, I think this anime gets judged based on a lot of facts before it even aired. Like for instance, the brainchild behind the light novels is the same person that made Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. (The Pet girl of Sakurasou) Anyone who has seen that anime may think what to expect from this show. But I think a bit differently. Hajime Kamoshida helmed thestorytelling for both series but there\u2019s quite a bit of differences. I don\u2019t want to talk too much about comparison because the fact is, Bunny Girl Senpai pretty much stand out a lot on its own feet.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s get the most obvious out of the way first. When you see that key visual on the anime entry page, what really comes to mind? On the front is a beautiful long haired beauty dressed in a sexy bunny outfit. When you look at it, she could probably resemble a playboy girl on the front page of a magazine. The visual impression alone had my interest although it\u2019s clear that the anime isn\u2019t just about a bunny girl. It\u2019s about a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa in which his life changes forever after encountering our poster girl, Mai Sakurajima in the library. At the heart of the series is also a mysterious phenomenon known as the \u201cAdolescence Syndrome\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow I should say right off the bat that you\u2019d better be prepared for social commentary. This is essentially a very talky show with no shortage of dialogues. In fact, it explores many social problems that is very real in our world today. Anxiety, depression, bullying, inferiority, isolationism, lack of confidence. You name it. If I had to guess, there\u2019s probably someone out there in your life that also suffers from something along those lines at one point or another. So in many ways, it\u2019s easy to say this show is relatable on a realistic level. But you\u2019re probably thinking that logic makes no sense considering the set up for the first few episodes. Indeed, Mai\u2019s debut in the anime is perhaps way too bizarre to be considered real. It could even be considered surreal. I mean, who has ever seen a girl in a sexy bunny outfit walking around in a public library?\\n\\n\r\nUntil I realized what this show really wanted us to experience, it sort of reminded me of an anime known as \u201cBakemonogatari\u201d. My first impression of the fated encounter between Mai and Sakuta felt similar compared to that series. We have a regular guy meeting a girl under unusual circumstances and they begin to connect on a more personal level. What does make the first few episodes for this anime more distinctive is the amount of human emotions shown. Early in the series, we get a confession from Sakuta as he expresses it with brutal honesty. That love confession defines Sakuta as a character who isn\u2019t afraid to hold back his feelings. In fact, Sakuta seems like a guy who doesn\u2019t care much about what others think of him. Some people would call his behavior as cynical and anti-social. Indeed, Sakuta isn\u2019t a guy that\u2019s easy to make friends with but he does truly have people he cares about. Mai and his sister, Kaede are perhaps the two most important people in his life. That brings about his relationship with them. From the beginning, he and Mai develops a strange bond that blooms from strangers, to friends, and to a couple. Their relationship develops more and more despite some of their similarities and differences. It\u2019s shown that both characters suffers from some anxiety issues. However, Mai\u2019s problem suffers more as she fears about being forgotten. On the other hand, Sakuta is indifferent about how the world and doesn\u2019t even care if everyone hates him. (with exception of his closest loved ones) The first arc details the show exploring their deep inner problems. In fact, these inner struggles manifest in the form of the mysterious \u201cAdolescence Syndrome\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched more and more of this series, it became easy to see the direction of the overall storytelling. Each arc contains a story that deals with a different issue and a different character. However, several recurring themes apply and the most prominent is the amount of social psychology. There\u2019s meaningful interactions that is essential for the plot and character development. I\u2019m quite impressed how much every arc made me feel invested by these different characters. The second arc explores Tomoe, a schoolgirl that gets involved in a time loop. Think of Groundhog Day or the Eightless Eight. At this point, I knew what this show as aiming for: having the main protagonists help conquer their problems while solving the mystery of the Adolescence Syndrome. Tomoe\u2019s problems involves her fear of losing friends is another example of a social problem. It paints the picture of people suffering from problems that they try to avoid yet seemingly need help in doing so. That\u2019s where Sakuta comes in to deal with them. He\u2019s like an anime life coach.\\n\\n\r\nWith the pattern of the story structure, I knew what to expect as Sakuta also helps deal with problems involving Rio Fubata, Nodoka Toyohama, and even his own sister, Kaede. I should say that at times, the manifestation of their problems feels like a superstition. We get doppelgangers, body switching, and memory loss. It\u2019s rather creative how they represent each of the characters\u2019 inner struggles while capitalizing on the psychological appeal. One character that manages evade these social problems is Shoko Makinohara. Regrettably, I\u2019d say that compared to the other cast members, her presence is easily forgotten despite her connection to Sakuta\u2019s past. Speaking of which, Sakuta has problems of his own that includes his troubled past. He even suffers from a physical scar on his chest due to his sister\u2019s Adolescence Syndrome. Throughout the series, I think it\u2019s important to realize how the creators managed to capitalize on its emotional content. The final arc in this anime adaptation shows Sakuta as a kind brother who is willing to do anything to help his sister. It\u2019s the type of family bond that is emotional and contains a lot of heartwarming moments. And even as emotional as the story gets, this show still finds time for comedy such as with Sakuta\u2019s lewd comments about girls and his dry sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that CloverWorks is involved in this project. They\u2019re a studio rebranded from A-1 Pictures as its own identity. To my delight, they managed to capture the essence of this show perfectly. The main selling point of the quality is the character interactions. Because this anime consists of a lot of dialogues and interactions, it\u2019s important to capitalize on their social lives. Thankfully, Cloverworks knew what it was doing as it draws out human emotions of the various characters. Characters such as Mai, Kaede, Tomoe, and even Sakuta are firm examples of this during more of their emotional moments. The visual quality also stays consistent throughout the duration of the run without relying on it too much. Bravo CloverWorks, you\u2019ve made quite an impression this year already. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song \u201cKimi no Sei\u201d is perhaps one of the catchiest ones for its usage of lyrics and delivery. It contains a variety of characters and while it\u2019s not anything too unique, it captures the surreal-like feeling of the show. There\u2019s even Mai in her iconic bunny outfit. Additionally, there are interchanging ED theme songs performed by the various voice actresses of the characters. Each of them follows their respective arc but all of them earned my praise for their consistent delivery. \\n\\n\r\nThis show may have a long title but it only took me a short time to accept what it really is. The amount of social psychology content made the story flow on many levels with each arc. Almost every character in the end felt important for the overall themes of the series. And while I can\u2019t say Bunny Girl Senpai may be recommendable for anyone, I\u2019d definitely giving this a try if you\u2019re thirsty for meaningful character relationships and dialogues. It\u2019s not a Bakemonogatari 2.0 and in fact, I\u2019d say Bunny Girl Senpai is much more appealing than what it appears to be.",

They are not the generic characters you see in most as they are quite interesting and hopefully shouldn't disappoint you at all.

And like many light novel adaptations, it's a rather uninspired attempt to sell more copies of the source. And it's possibly as bad as Cloverworks last badly made project Persona 5 The Animation. The Opening is objectively the worst Opening I've seen this year, consisting people running, poorly edited out of context pictures of the heroines, horribly blended in CGI, lifeless backgrounds. Which is actually a good indicator for what the show actually is.\r\nA self inset ball of snark has monotone banterwith main heroine and becomes popular among teens. Is a quote that can also be used to describe, The Monogatari Series, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Oregairu, Hyouka as well as a few other popular shows. However where those shows had strong writing, visual direction, or well thought out characters to work with, it becomes obvious that Bunny girl is just a weak imitation. Even this could be forgiven if it weren't for the standard animation, lazy background art, terrible CGI and half-assed scene transitions that plague this show. I've heard people saying that they haven't noticed these issues but I'd ask them if they were being too focused on the subs to notice what's actually happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst anime I've seen so far this season. Don't get me wrong this does have strong emotional moments. But you need to ask yourself if a few emotional highs are worth trudging the anime through.\\n\\n\r\nAs a finishing note I'll just leave an example of how this anime copies a far better show poorly.\\n\\n\r\nMai's backstory is a complete parallel of Hitagi from the Monogatari Series. Only difference is Hitagi's made sense.\\n\\n\r\nBoth have abusive mothers but while Mai's mother is just a lazy asshole, Hitagi's mother turned abusive because she got roped into a cult. Their breaking points happened when Mai was forced to do a swimsuit scene and Hitagi almost got raped. The interesting bit in monogatari is that Hitagi's mom got into the cult because it \"helped cure\" Hitagi in a prior incident. This complicates their relationship. Meanwhile Mai's mom is just an asshole.\\n\\n\r\nBoth girls instantly fall in love with their saviors. However in Bunny girl this is played lazily as possible Her savior is her romantic interest and the show pretty much forces them into a relationship instantly. Though they have good banter. Similarly Hitagi also has good banter with her Savior. Except Monogatari puts more thought into the actual concept. Instead of Hitagi being stuck into a relationship with the first person who showed her kindness and all problems being solved instantly, she doesn't end up with Kaiki. Instead she actually learns to deal with her problems and moves on.\\n\\n\r\nBunny girl senpai took Hitagi's entire character arc and just made it bland. And this is just what the show does with everything.",

            "content": "\"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\", which I'll be referring to from here on out as just Bunny Girl, is a light novel romance with a a snarky, perceptive male protagonist and a cold, standoffish (at least at first) lead girl. If this sounds familiar--it should! Early viewers have drawn comparisons to the Monogatari series, and despite being competent all around, with a talented voice cast and above-average production values, this, like many recent light novels, feels like a Bakemonogatari stripped of much of what made Bakemonogatari fundamentally interesting. While I'm not necessarily asking for SHAFT-style visuals, Bunny Girl's artstyle, especially its backgrounds, are bland as generally expected from an A-1 offshoot studio--the same residential Tokyo setting seen a million times before without any special touches. The voice acting is generally flat but passable.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Bunny Girl is strongest is in the relationship between Sakurajima Mai and Azusagawa Sakuta. I may have been unfair in describing the pair as an ersatz Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi, because despite surface similarities they're not entirely copies of each other, and their dynamic is enjoyable--indeed, by far the best aspect of the show--for its own reasons. Rather than a single laugh-out-loud punchline, the back-and-forth banter was, while still not up to par with better-written series like Monogatari, generally enjoyable, particularly Mai. Still, at the end of the day it feels like a rather conventional tale of a tsundere-ish girl slowly opening up to the \"relatable\" protagonist who is so helpful and always knows better--who, while more memorable than the average harem MC, is still a bit too much of a bland self-insert specifically targeting the sort of disaffected teenager who think he has it all figured it out, suggesting a target audience of angsty teenage boys (like most light novels). He's reminiscent of other light novel protagonists like Kyon and the aforementioned Araragi, yet lacks the depth or genuine character flaws that make those characters more endearing. As of the fourth episode, Mai is also becoming an increasingly less interesting character and more conventional tsundere (leaning more on \"dere\"). Also notably irksome is that this anime, like many other pseudo-intellectual light novels, introduces and then butchers the concept of Schrodinger's Cat using the designated exposition girl, something that I plan to treat as a red flag from now on.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, which I had completed at the time of this review, covers the main character meeting a mysterious girl who walks around in a bunny suit to no visible reaction from bystanders. He discovers through talking to her that she was a former child actress who has since struggled with a mysterious \"adolescent illness\"--a supernatural element which sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise entirely \"normal\" setting (IMO this would have worked better if the show had a greater supernatural element instead of applying pseudo-scientific explanations to the adolescent syndrome)--that makes the vast majority of people unable to see her, even her mother. This problem is solved in a predictable way that will appeal to the easily-manipulated, but the first arc's conclusion, despite being paced well and having no time for \"will they or won't they\" drama, was predictable and not in a good way. While I think there are enough positive elements of this anime to make later arcs salvageable, I struggle to find it much better than average in almost any regard. (The titular bunny suit, by the way, only shows up in a single episode and is retired after that, which I admittedly found to be a bit of a disappointment because she looked great in it).\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nArt 4/10\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n",

While yes, only 3 episodes have aired at the time of me writing this review, my main problems with this show will surely not change since the show would look entirely different if that were to happen. Before I start, warning there might be some slight spoilers for the first 3 episodes.\r\nA lot of people are comparing this anime to Bakemonogatari or the Monogatari series in general and while I can sort of see the comparisons with the2 main characters and the fact that there's a lot of talking, what makes Monogatari great is severely lacking in this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only solid aspect of this show. Our MC and his close friends are the only ones who can see or remember who Bunny Girl and MC and Bunny Girl fall in love yada yada. It's fine as a story but there are some plotholes/questionable events which can possibly be cleared up in future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where 'Bunny Girl' starts getting very lackluster. If you want to make a story that is heavily based on dialogue, then you better have some amazing art and sound or I might as well have just read the damn source material. Everything from the setting to the animation to the character design is so boring and uninspired it's just uninteresting to look at. The sound does not help either as it being just boring light piano music is just as boring and uninspired as the art. Please take the time to just go and listen to any great soundtrack(Monogatari Series, Cowboy Bebop etc.) and then listen to the Bunny Girl OST and see how boring and bad it is in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWe have all seen the characters in this anime before. Our MC is just a normal anime dude who has brown hair instead of black hair, which is fairly common but nothing out of the ordinary. Our 'Bunny Girl' is just your standard anime black hair girl except she has a bunny hair clip. The other characters so far are nearly irrelevant. Our MC's friends are basically just there to confirm Bunny Girl actually exists and he's not crazy. Scientist lady is also there to conveniently explain some things..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\" is, in short, wasted potential. If this show was done without a small budget and time constraints it could genuinely be a great anime, but right now what we have is a rushed show with nearly nothing redeemable outside of the story filled with question marks and plotholes. This is anime is the epitome of mediocrity and probably as close to a standard anime you can get. Go watch something genuinely amazing instead, it's a better use of your time.\\n",

            "content": "I don't understand the hype for this one.\r\nBunny Girl Senpai is full of the same issues commonly criticized in most light novel adaptations, so why does it get a free pass? Harem tropes, waifu bait, incest teasing, thin characterization, vague pseudoscience, and an asshole deadpan protagonist who solves a bunch of girls\u2019 problems for them. Most of all, the art and sound are incredibly mediocre excluding the many moments when CloverWorks chooses to bend over and spray shit in our eyes with its abundance of hideous CGI crowds.\r\nFirst and foremost, I hate the writing in Bunny Girl Senpai. Consider the '4' points I rated theshow overall to be a generous acknowledgment of its basic features. It was painful to watch, but not irredeemable. The story follows Sakuta, a second year in high school, as he tries to help girls afflicted by a supernatural phenomenon known as Adolescence Syndrome. If that sounds like a psychological disorder concocted by a pretentious teenage boy trying to sound smart, that\u2019s because it is. If a character suddenly becomes invisible or if everyone is trapped in a three-day long time loop, then the author will call it Adolescence Syndrome and leave the rest up to our imaginations. In other words, it's the author\u2019s way of masking a cheap plot device. Rather than giving us a coherent explanation for the syndrome, the author just handwaves it with common quantum mechanics like Schrodinger's Cat and Laplace's Demon. It\u2019s loosely defined as a supernatural affliction that manifests in people who are going through severe stress, whether it be cyberbullying causing physical cuts, or going invisible because you\u2019re sick of attention. To the show\u2019s credit, as a plot device, it is used to craft some empathetic struggles within the characters and even a little bit of relatability. However, these conflicts aren\u2019t executed nearly as well as they could be. The story is told through five parts, each with a new girl for Sakuta to help and flirt with. This standard setup is so unbearable to watch play out because of how terrible Sakuta is as a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta is the average deadpan, cynical, uncaring protagonist, except he\u2019s also an unlikable asshole. His one single tone of voice is monotonous boredom, and he almost never wavers from it for the entire series. Keep in mind, this show is FULL of dialogue, but it has no goddamn clue how to make any of it seem interesting. Sakuta\u2019s dialogue isn\u2019t witty or clever you would expect from a deadpan character, it\u2019s just vulgar, gross, and offensive. Deceptively, he acts like he\u2019s being a terrible person ironically, and in turn, people don\u2019t think he\u2019s that bad of a guy. However, everything he says is actually unironic, there\u2019s no nuance, he\u2019s just a bad person. He is never punished for being an asshole, sometimes girls might comment on his behavior if he says something especially inappropriate to them, but right away they move on and act like he\u2019s Jesus-kun again. For example, when a girl says something rude to him he fires back with:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAre you on your period or something?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nDid a twelve-year-old write this script? Sakuta's shallow quips are always like this, juvenile and crass, and the rest of his dialogue is completely deadpan. He is rarely emotionally impacted by anything; very little makes him impressed or concerned. Viewing a story from the perspective of an uncaring asshole like Sakuta makes it impossible to get invested in anything, or even enjoy it. If the show had actually confronted him about his behavior and acknowledged how bad he was to his friends, then it could have been a character flaw and something to develop upon. But from what we saw adapted, his character development is satisfied with being permanently stagnant. He continues to hide his ugly personality behind a thick layer of snark and quips. Sakuta is just the rotten core of this story, surrounding him is the main attraction, all of the ladies who are strangely drawn to him.\\n\\n\r\nOur first heroine for Sakuta to assist is Mai Sakurajima, the titular bunny girl. Somehow she makes the dialogue even worse, she is equally as dry and cynical as Sakuta. Throughout the series, the script parallels standard rom-com dialogue, except it is written to be as pretentious as possible with the pace cranked down to molasses. Rather than a simple sentence lasting a few seconds, it\u2019s needlessly wrapped into a messy jumble of sophistry and weird unfunny jokes. Why can\u2019t these kids just talk like normal human beings? That would sure as hell make them more engaging to watch, and you know, relatable. Mai is the typical tsundere archetype, with the intruiging bunny girl costume appearing the most in episode one, then rarely appearing for the rest of the series. The whole \u2018Bunny Girl\u2019 hook in the title is contrived for what amounts to little more than big budget clickbait. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one area which Bunny Girl Senpai is deserving of praise, its themes. At least from a conceptual standpoint, they add some nuance and relatability to cast. The execution of these themes, like the rest of the show, leaves much to be desired. Where we see the most intruiging themes on display is in Futaba's arc; she is introduced early in the show as more or less an exposition dumper with the sole purpose of lampshading plot conveniences. The relevant themes of insecurity and social anxiety addressed in her arc are muddled by the terrible hackneyed script. She is a scientist girl for the sole purpose of spouting tropey quantum theory pseudo-science to explain away everything that\u2019s happening. It\u2019s always painfully apparent that the author just read a brief summary about the theories he uses in his story in an attempt to seem intelligent, but it's so clear he didn't bother to fully research them so instead it makes him look stupider. These overlong, cringe-inducing, self-congratulatory \u2018science\u2019 scenes occur almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nNothing in Bunny Girl Senpai feels real, it's all plastic. Mai and the rest of the girls don\u2019t feel like fully realized characters either. They all experience some kind of turmoil yet this rarely shows through in their personalities. They are all plastic prepackaged moe archetypes, unaffected by anything they go through. Even if a character is visibly changed by their conflict after it\u2019s resolved, it is usually undermined by the show\u2019s terrible writing. For example one girl is affected by Adolescence Syndrome because she is so insecure with her body from how people have treated her, then after her affliction is resolved Sakuta interjects with another one of his crude sex jokes that objectifies her body and undermines everything the show was building towards. Another issue is the lack of lasting effects to each arc. They are paced too poorly for us to see how characters are impacted, rather a satisfying conclusion the story just moves on. When the author decides he\u2019s bored of a girl he simply ends the arc, in favor of a new case of Adolescence Syndrome. Of course, with another stock standard girl taken off the shelves at A-1 Pictures\u2019 waifu warehouse to become the show\u2019s new main appeal for a few weeks, until she is inevitably relegated to the supporting cast in favor of a new poster girl.\\n\\n\r\nIt makes the author seem like an impatient teenage boy who just wants to shove as many beautiful girls into the arms of the cool guy bland protagonist. He pairs a girl with the protagonist and lets them flirt a little bit, and before he has to commit and actually develop said girl he gets bored of her. And writing a nuanced character is such hard work for him. So instead he just solves the issue by tossing aside the old girl in favor of a fresh new waifu to fawn all over his self-insert. This is, of course, a fundamental issue of most harem anime, a revolving door of waifus and a self insert protagonist. Being a light novel adaptation, Bunny Girl Senpai bears many structural similarities to a harem anime. Generally this is the reason why I avoid the genre, that and obnoxious fanservice which this series is thankfully frugal with. Eventually, it leaves off on a non-ending because this is an adaptation of an ongoing light novel. The show tries to wrap up the story as neatly as possible at the end of the last girl's arc, but it crashes and burns in its finale. The climax is a filled with overwrought crying, forced drama, and the cheesiest and most cringe-inducing writing in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nIn a better series, this barren wasteland of a script could be saved by a larger budget, or a more experienced director. However, this show\u2019s decidedly unimaginative directing style leaves much to be desired. The art is mediocre, it\u2019s in no way vivid to look at, the directing fails to make the long stretches of dialogue remotely interesting. Aside from the abhorrent CGI crowds, it isn\u2019t a visual disaster, it could be worse, but it could be so much better. Other dialogue heavy anime like the Monogatari Series utilize unique directing techniques and plenty of visual storytelling to engage the viewer in lengthy conversations between two characters. Strangely, Bunny Girl Senpai desires to be watched as a thoughtful supernatural character drama, but it plays out like a generic light novel romantic comedy, taking the worst aspects of each and failing to craft an original or worthwhile series.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 4/10]\\n\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai presents intruiging themes of how people treat and mistreat one another during adolescence. However, it fails to execute its best ideas successfully or in a compelling way due to terrible pacing, narrative structural issues, needlessly convoluted dialogue, mediocre presentation, and a thoroughly unlikable main character. If the author possessed half of the self-awareness he seems to think he has, this may not have been an overrated, cringy, bore-fest.",

            "content": "Anime about teens in high school are a dime a dozen in this medium. You could say, if your anime isn\u2019t set in some sort of school setting, then chances are it\u2019s not really an anime\u2014unless it has Bankai\u2019s or something. While on the surface, this would look like a run-of-the-mill show, it dares to offer something different than most high school anime doesn\u2019t dare touch\u2014and that is reality itself.\r\nWith a (translated) title such as Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (Bunny Girl Senpai for short) and the promotional poster of an attractive girl in a sexy bunny outfit, you would think thatthis would be a slice-of-life comedy with all of the tropes tossed into the pot in order to generate merchandise sales, right? That is where you are seriously mistaken! Despite the red flag in the title\u2014very long titles tend to be disappointing anime\u2014it prioritizes storytelling before fanservice and otaku pandering, giving the audience an atmosphere and characters that we can sympathize with and relate to on a deeper level than their appearance. The reality is showing how to deal and overcome some of the issues we go through in adolescence, and not all resolutions are happy endings. These issues come under the guise of a supernatural phenomenon called Puberty Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nWith a straightforward plot, the story revolves around our main protagonist, Sakuta Asusagawa, who meets girls with Puberty Syndrome, and must help them overcome their emotional instability in order to save them. It\u2019s a fictional illness which can cause a slew of problems for adolescents. Mai Sakurajima (Bunny Girl) is at the centre of this as she experiences invisibility to everyone. Mai is a well-known celebrity, and yet very few people but Sakuta is able to see her, are able to remember she even exists. We all know that feeling of being invisible. We know we physically aren\u2019t, yet all the attention is directed at everyone else, we feel stuck, having to take it all in, without actually being a part of it. It\u2019s heartbreaking for Mai who is a social star and is used to been seen all the time. The people she wants to notice her don\u2019t, more so they can\u2019t. Despite her success\u2014she\u2019s totally alone. Sakuta can relate to this since he\u2019s vicariously experienced it through his sister, Kaede. It\u2019s soul-crushing, and he wants to help.\\n\\n\r\nPuberty Syndrome is a culmination of all the things we hate about growing in adolescence, mainly the things we\u2019ve gone through at our lowest points. It\u2019s a visualisation of them, placing a magnifying glass on the invisible, examining what makes these particular things so painful. Sakuta\u2019s friend, Rio Futaba acts as the show\u2019s narrative device, offering exposition on this phenomenon and quantum mechanics that might otherwise come from a floating voice from the sky. Information is always better revealed through character interaction since we\u2019re experiencing the story through the eyes of Sakuta. Futaba doesn\u2019t just serve that purpose, she slots into the dynamic, falling for people, just as other characters do and experiences Puberty Syndrome herself. Although this supernatural occurrence is fascinating, it isn\u2019t the selling point. That belongs to the characters, their dialogue, their interactions and chemistry together\u2014especially when it comes to Sakuta and Mai.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a \u2018spark\u2019 when our main protagonists are together, it\u2019s like a captivating dance. They are always in sync, but they are always moving. One pushes, the other yields. Then the roles are reversed. Back and forth, back and forth. They\u2019re not fighting. Their energies are harmonized\u2014towards the mutual goal of a seamless performance, eventually, they're perfectly balanced against one another. Even in instances where the pair is fighting\u2014whether it be sub textual, verbally, or physically, the balance remains. They are evenly matched. Each gives as good as he or she gets\u2014and there is inevitably a certain measure of respect, one for the other\u2019s skill. They spar almost from the moment they meet. Their arguments are earnest, but their energy is always aligned, the chemistry between them is the best thing that Bunny Girl Senpai has going for it. This is the result of putting two lively characters together where they create a dance of opposition and harmony, having a focus on dynamic character archetype, creating coherent conflict, and lastly, enacting change.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s to appreciate here is that Bunny Girl Senpai manages to avoid delving too far into that clich\u00e9 by keeping Sakuta solely interested in Mai. In fact, they become a couple, and early in the series. It\u2019s very refreshing to see an MC who isn\u2019t so easily swayed by other women and instead tries to keep things platonic between him and the other girls struggling with Puberty Syndrome. Sakuta treats people the same, and while his smug and sarcastic nature usually enjoys poking fun, underneath his deadpan persona is a genuine guy who is caring and respectful. Mai is a character who goes through a great deal of development, she has changed so much throughout the course of the show without sacrificing her traits to be carried by Sakuta; she\u2019s strong-willed, intelligent, independent and honest. The dynamics between them and the casualness of their relationship is a refreshing change of pace from the hyperactive romance we are used to seeing. You feel invested in not just the plot, but how the plot affects all these characters.\\n\\n\r\nCloverworks got the opportunity of adapting Hajime Kamoshida\u2019s Light Novel. The character designs are very much like a hodgepodge of styles, to the likes of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU and Monogatari. They look great, they feel great and they sound great\u2014thanks to a talented selection of seiyuus that bring their given character's personality to life, making them believable and hitting comedic scenes out of the park. The colour palette is pulsating with vigour and energy, the background art, the layout of the architectural designs and shot composition is gorgeous and all combine to complement the alluring atmosphere of Bunny Girl Senpai. The animation has had consistency issues, but never in important moments, it\u2019s very scarce. Most of the soundtrack is casual, relaxing and suits the light-hearted tones and pacing. There are also tracks for the \u2018gut punch\u2019 scenes that evoke emotion, especially in instances where characters have melancholy reflections. The OP \"Kimi no Sei\" by the peggies is a perfect song choice, it\u2019s a very catchy acoustic rock ballad. The ED \u201cFukashigi no Carte\u201d is sung by the seiyuus of Mai, Futaba, Kaede, Tomoe Koga, Nodoka Toyohama and Shouko Makinohara at the end of their given arcs. It gives an eerie and whimsical feeling equal to the story they're telling.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai\u2019s message is incredibly relevant to the difficulties of teens today. It manages to be a surprisingly poignant metaphor for the effects that issues such as bullying and ostracization can have on youth.  It manages to keep a consistent quality of the plot without sacrificing anything to adhere to quotas of fanservice and otaku pandering. The dialogue, the characters, the progression, the music and visuals are operating as powerfully and effectively as possible. The \u201cSakuta Effect\u201d works because he is a strong character who handles situations maturely, he\u2019s not pessimistic nor arrogant in the sense he tries to do everything himself. He reaches out for help, he knows his limitations and flaws, he\u2019s self-aware, he\u2019s genuine and honest. Great characters make for great writing, and Bunny Girl Senpai is definitely a smash hit from Cloverworks and joins the discussion of Anime of the Year.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NON-CRUCIAL SPOILERS FROM ONE EARLY EPISODE\r\nRaskal Does Not Dream of Copyright Infringement\r\nThere is going to be a lot of mentions of Monogatari series in the review, because you need to understand that this series is not just similar, or inspired, or derivative. No - it\u2019s an unbelievably blatant plagiarism, it steals everything from Monogatari, and I mean EVERYTHING, except for a couple of elements stolen from Oregairu and Haruhi instead. Comparing it to the famous cases of literary plagiarism ruled by court (Like Harry Potter\u2019s rip-off called Tanya Grotter), it would 100% be ruled a copyright infringement if Nisio Isin/Kodansha ever botheredto sue (and it baffles me that they didn\u2019t). If you\u2019ve seen Monogatari before, you might get a kick out of spotting entire scenes and minute-long dialogues meticulously copypasted word-for-word (don\u2019t make it a drinking game, you\u2019ll die) but there really isn\u2019t much point in doing that over an actual rewatch, because production values are not as good as Studio SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\nWell, one might ask, wouldn\u2019t a carbon copy of a good series also be good? No, because there is another element in play - the author is a talentless hack. Something called \u201cstupidity\u201d manifests in multiple aspects of this story making it impossible to enjoy. Here are some examples:\\n\\n\r\n1. Primitive surface-level copying results in nonsense. The best example is the show's title - it\u2019s terrible for marketing purposes because it made many people believe this is going to be some ecchi harem. Well, the title comes from the female lead wearing a bunny-girl suit ...for approximately 15 seconds that basically amount to nothing plot-wise. You see, in Monogatari heroines have animal leitmotifs, and that got copypasted - except the writer couldn\u2019t think of any actual reason for this inside the story, so it\u2019s just an awkward non sequitur, sitting there, doing nothing except making the title stupid - and there are many other examples like that.\\n\\n\r\n2. Insufferable protagonist. There is a certain trope familiar to most anime watchers - \u201cbadass loner\u201d, aka \u201cGary Stu\u201d, aka \u201cSelf-insert Jesus-kun\u201d, aka \u201cliterally me\u201d. Araragi from Monogatari looks like one - until he isn\u2019t, because writing anime cliches as complex real people is what that series does. Hachiman from Oregairu is another take - he is also real, i. e. an awkward teenager who has trouble socializing. Being a talentless hack he is, the writer of Aobuta couldn\u2019t do anything but write this trope completely straight. The MC is supposedly antisocial pariah, but he has social skills and confidence of a god. When some dumb females give him shit he just says \u201cbegone thot!\u201d and they run away in shame, defeated by his awesomeness. He beats a jock twice his size in a fist fight by \u201coutsmarting\u201d him, nevermind a gang of jock\u2019s friends standing there doing nothing. It\u2019s just so cringy to watch. Kirito from SAO is a better protagonist, at least that guy farmed levels or something.\\n\\n\r\n3. Idiotic non-logic. Monogatari has supernatural phenomena explained with ghosts. Aobuta has supernatural phenomena explained with quantum mechanics. That is, dumb and cringy \u201cis math related to science?\u201d level of quantum mechanics understanding. That\u2019s not my point, pseudo-science is just a particular case of a bigger problem of nothing making sense. This is also better explained with an example. Spoiler ahead:\\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler begins here**\\n\\n\r\nHere is a conversation between two characters:\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cI\u2019m trapped in a day-long time loop.\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cThat means there is another person also trapped in the same loop.\u201d\\n\r\nNonsense, right? Well the conversation is slightly longer but boils down to exactly that. Here is a full version with my play-by-play:\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cI\u2019m trapped in a day-long time loop.\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cWhat if you're not trapped, but instead perfectly predict the future, and experience it as an advanced form of jamais vu?\u201d     //How could this possibly be a first idea in reaction to the time loop? How does that work? Why is it a time loop that repeats multiple times instead of just being clairvoyant? You what?\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cHow so?\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cLaplace\u2019s demon. A theoretical intelligence that can perfectly calculate position and behaviour of every particle in the universe, therefore, can predict the future.\u201d      //But why would it make a repeating loop instead of just being clairvoyant??? Why would Laplace\u2019s demon be your first idea if it doesn\u2019t actually fit the nature of the situation?\\n\r\nPerson A: \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Laplace\u2019s demon, I\u2019m a normal human\u201d\\n\r\nPerson B: \u201cThat means some other person is Laplace\u2019s demon and they do the calculations. You\u2019re quantum entangled with that person so you experience their time loop.\u201d     //Again, how could this possibly be your first idea? Other person being Laplace\u2019s demon doesn\u2019t actually answer any of the questions posed. Also, quantum entanglement... a) Is an actual physical phenomena, not theoretical construct, and it doesn\u2019t fit the situation at all, so it wouldn\u2019t be a thing that comes to mind here; b) Doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Laplace\u2019s demon, so it wouldn\u2019t come to mind based on that; c) DOESN\u2019T EXPLAIN WHY THE TIME IS REPEATING IN A LOOP, INSTEAD OF TWO PEOPLE BEING CLAIRVOYANT. \\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler ends here**\\n\\n\r\nNotice the pattern? Wrong physics aside, none of the conclusions of Person B logically follow from previously reached conclusions, it\u2019s a bunch of random lines arranged one after another. Either the author is a moron and \u201clines arranged one after another\u201d is his understanding of how logic works, or he thinks the audience are morons and he can scam them with this garbage if he talks fast and sounds confident. Incidentally, if someone tries \u201cbut that\u2019s just Person B\u2019s theory, it doesn\u2019t have to be true\u201d on you - spit them in the face because the characters act on those assumptions and they are proven to be 100% correct.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 because this series provides nothing of value and has no reason to exist, except to give an answer to a weird thought experiment - what if some acclaimed series was the same, but written by an author 50 IQ points lower.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Puberty.\r\nPuberty makes us do some crazy things. For example, oft times when I\u2019m taking a stroll through my local library in my double XL, extra cleavage bunny boy costume and I\u2019m being ignored, I think to myself \u201cthis must be just another Quantum Mechanics issue!\u201d. I\u2019ve consulted a multitude of other people on why I\u2019m being socially outcast, but they seem to think I\u2019m the problem! Can\u2019t be, right?! That was the moment in which I was so graciously blessed by this anime, to save me from myself, and help me understand what I\u2019d known all along. That of course, it was the cat.Schrodinger\u2019s cat.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai, Cloverworks\u2019 wildly popular light novel adaptation, is the type of anime to present itself as something to be desired, only to constantly undermine itself with every waking moment. It takes any amount of credibility you could attribute to its core themes and tells you to go elsewhere. It\u2019s the type of show I so desperately wanted to enjoy, something that I could wholeheartedly say earned my AOTY, but turned me away at nearly every step of the journey. \\n\\n\r\nSakuta, our story\u2019s protagonist, is generally an inexpressive, unintentional lady killer. His intentions are deceptively pure, and most notable of all, he consistently manages to be the most inconsistent character in the series. He takes on the persona of a perverted, dense teenage boy.  His demeanor is relatively cynical, and his method of solving issues is inconsistently bizarre. There are moments in which takes a full 180, falling victim to the notion of dramatic climax. In these times, he expresses his cathartic side, often tearing up or yelling wildly. His outbursts come off as less of a part of his character, and more as an effect of the story. Sakuta receives what some may call \u201cdevelopment\u201d throughout the course of the arcs, and while I can see why it may be perceived as such, it falls short on a few fronts. First and foremost, Sakuta does not change at all in between or during the arcs. He maintains the same outlook, attitude and demeanor throughout the entirety of the show. The only development that is visibly noticeable is Sakuta\u2019s life changing interaction with Shouko. The Sakuta the viewer is made known to, is as I described above. The Sakuta we are exposed to in his occasional flashbacks, is not the same person. This meaning, while the two Sakuta\u2019s we are made known to are different when compared before and after, it has nothing to do with Sakuta\u2019s character in the story at large. All this interaction serves as, is a justification for why his current attitude is the way it is. It\u2019s two contrasting personalities, that are inferably conjoined, but not detailed enough to connect on a developmental level. Sakuta does not change over the course of the story, but rather changes before the story, and uses that as a lame justification for lazy character writing. Sorry for the redundancy, just wanted to make that clear. I\u2019ve heard arguments as to the change in his optimism as a result of meeting Mai. Considering Sakuta was by no means \u201csad\u201d before meeting Mai I believe the scenario speaks for itself. Being happy is not development, happiness exists as a by-product of being alive.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Sakuta\u2019s inconsistency comes in (other than the outbursts) is how his methodology of dealing with conflicts changes as the story progresses. Keep in mind that the basic frameworks of his character are not changing as these solutions change. Initially, Sakuta is displayed as someone willing to go to the ends of the earth to solve a problem he is invested in. He believes that if he can assist in someone\u2019s woes, he inevitably will intervene. He maintains this mentality for the next arc, going as far as to publicly embarrass himself for the sake of Tomoe. After this though, he takes a sharp turn in how he approaches issues. He begins allowing those he\u2019s helping to fix their own situations. He \u201cadopts\u201d a mentality in which he believes that there are times when people can only truly help themselves. He isn\u2019t conflicted over this change in world view, just accepts it as though it never happened. Had he consistently used this philosophy or any philosophy for that matter, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but then after a couple arcs, he slowly begins gravitating back without any apparent thought process, intervening at some points, withheld at others. Inconsistent character philosophy is not development either. It\u2019s frankly the exact opposite and removes possible room for development by creating a gray area in the projected principles of the character. \\n\\n\r\nMai, the main heroine and incidentally the \u201cbunny girl\u201d, is a character design with a voice actor. She has no feasible motive or desire that\u2019s worth caring for aside from her relationship to Sakuta and wanting to be in show business. Once her character arc is over, she becomes a cameo. She shows up whenever Sakuta needs motivation or inspiration and helps him tie up the loose ends of whatever he\u2019s dealing with. That\u2019s seriously all there is to her.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of whether you found these characters likeable or not, they remain unexplored throughout the entirety of the show, with a frighteningly scarce amount of decipherable insight as to the purpose of their actions, or how to interpret their occasional manic episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my mind there lies a cut and dry line between characters that are memorable, and characters that aren\u2019t, and this applies to the supporting cast as well. When the sole purpose of a character\u2019s existence is to be \u2018acceptable\u2019 and convey the story in a way that is admissible, I think that character is worthless. With no hyperbole intended; most of the characters in this anime are arbitrary. This is not Sakuta\u2019s story. Nothing about this story is Sakuta\u2019s, in the same way that any other run of the mill character with a C-cup could replace Mai and be just as effective. I can best describe this as a story told through Sakuta\u2019s mouth, not his character. He, and everyone else are approached as though they are merely liaison between the writers and viewers, not vital to the story. \\n\\n\r\nTaking the cake for the worst character introduction ever written, is Rio Futaba. For the first six episodes, her entire character is based on the idea that she is \u201csmart\u201d. She solves the mysteries. She knows, realizes and explains things that only the most omnipotent of light novel characters could imagine. You thought hacker Kirito was obnoxious? Well this is Kirito\u2019s brain on drugs. She\u2019s (not) well versed in quantum mechanics. She knows the ins and outs of other\u2019s relationships and how they think, yet she is as emotionally aware as a stick of glue when it comes to herself. She is essentially included as a means of easily explaining the content that the writer didn't know how to include in the dialogue (for good reason). To be fair, her personal arc is decent. For a brief non-spoiler synopsis, she encounters an issue in which she is forced to confront romantic feelings and deals with them accordingly. This at the very least makes use of her emotional obliviousness to expand on her character depth (ever so slightly) and create some sense of human existence within her robotic air. This, in my opinion was the only way to salvage her character, and I appreciate Kamoshida\u2019s basic understanding of the characters he had created.   \\n\\n\r\nKaede is in fact a decent character, in both design and execution, and managed to outclass both main characters in her first five seconds of screen time. She has the only interesting character introduction that isn\u2019t butchered soon after, and her panda pajamas were an awesome complement to her shut-in status. She exemplifies both the irritating younger sister, as well as the retrospectively mature one once she undergoes her character arc. She receives the season finale, and deservedly so. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot structure of this show is both interesting and immensely disappointing. Much like the Monogatari Series, the main character encounters some sort of supernatural issue with a future member of his mock-harem every few episodes and assists in resolving it. Coming from someone who only liked one member of the supporting cast, and none from the main; I found every piece of character interaction in this anime to be uninteresting. Stories with no overarching plot rely heavily on character interaction. So, you might be able to tell where the \u201cimmensely disappointing\u201d part came from.\\n\\n\r\nStory-telling is far from my specialty, but I have to say, introducing a concept, not defining it, loosely basing it on a bunch of random things and then running with it isn\u2019t such a good basis for a plot. The million-dollar question: What is puberty syndrome? In short, it\u2019s whatever fits the direction that the story goes in. \u201cAbnormal experiences rumored on the internet to be caused by sensitivity and instability during adolescence.\u201d, is how MAL chooses to define it. However, Rio likes to think outside that limiting box. Kamoshida (LN author) created a drinking game where every time a character is affected by the ambiguous \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d he\u2019d take five shots, get out a different high-school textbook and vomit some Rio dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe first \u201cencounter\u201d is that of Mai becoming \u2018invisible\u2019 and forgotten by the world around her. Hundreds of interesting metaphors could be drawn from this. Hell, you could derive a social commentary on celebrity culture in a heartbeat, and my god the list goes on. Honestly it looked like the show was heading in the direction of using metaphorical insinuations as a means of explanation. Instead, off the rails it went. Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Yes, that Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Why? Cause Rio said so. I understand the idea of using real concepts to ground fictional ones in the same reality, but the concepts must be at least somewhat related. It\u2019s because they take such a farfetched grab at using this repeatedly, that it comes off as a lame gimmick that ignores basic knowledge on the subject. Just as an example, for Mai\u2019s arc, the writing excludes the concept of a half-life, radiation emission probability not being linear; point being, why use a real concept if you\u2019re going to alter its factual basis? Like I said before, it makes it seem more like a gimmick than a tactic. This all to further prove my theory that the pseudo-science exposition is used only to make Rio sound smart and bait the viewer into believing whatever nonsense she cooks up. I used the first encounter as an example to avoid spoilers, but I assure you, none of the other encounters are resolved with any sense of clarity in mind, and almost play out the exact same every time. Some of you may be like me, in that you find the metaphorical insinuations much more interesting. I fully understand and would love for that to be all there is to it. Unfortunately, though, the writer decided to use this method of half-assed pseudo-science to explain puberty syndrome, or at least ground it in some way, shape or form. I hope I don\u2019t have to explain why saying that \u201cthe reality of a concept is unimportant\u201d, is completely ridiculous when the intent of the concept is to be made realistic by comparing it to other real concepts. In all honesty any attempt at clearly defining Puberty Syndrome will be haphazard at best, because the author is hell bent on basing it on real concepts that just don\u2019t relate.\\n\\n\r\nRomance is a tricky genre to tread. In this I think Bunny Girl Senpai is at its finest. As a once upon a time fan of The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, I know for a fact that Kamoshida is capable of writing somewhat captivating romances, which is the main reason I picked up this anime. There is a substantial amount of embarrassingly uncomfortable confessions here if that\u2019s your thing. If you are willing to put up with the rest of the shit-slinging, there is a romance story to be had.\\n\\n\r\nHigh-school rom-com anime have the world\u2019s worst track record for horribly integrated settings. The characters in this show have no interaction with the world around them. There is an unwritten standard for both emotional and striking scenes in anime, or any medium for that matter. The iconography/detail of the background and location plays a huge part, and obviously a plethora of other factors contribute as well (BGM, etc.). For the most part though setting is hugely related to the impact of a scene. I\u2019ve racked my brain over and over, to arrive at the conclusion that the only scenery that could hold emotional value in this anime is the beach. The reason being, Sakuta receives his adopted world view from Shouko there, and most of the arcs end up in that area. This is fine, they succeeded in created one area that, while being scarcely occupied by them, holds some value to the viewer. Where the issue lies is that there is nowhere else in this show that is iconic in any meaningful way. Nowhere in the entire world. Not the school in which they spend most of their time, not Sakuta\u2019s stark bedroom. Nowhere. This is one of those instances where this show represents itself as desirable, and then immediately undermines that sentiment. There are plenty of examples of how secondary settings in school anime can become emotionally valuable to the viewer. Take Yui\u2019s bedroom from K-On!, 3-Gatsu no Lion\u2019s stairwell, Clannad\u2019s clubroom, Oregairu\u2019s roof top, Love Live\u2019s roof top/stairwell/school, or any other show known to have massive emotional attachments to their respective fan-base. They all have at least a few locations that manage to create a summative semblance of a world around them. When every background is as bland and unimaginative as possible, the characters become painstakingly vital, and we just established that the characters aren\u2019t even treated as characters at all. Because of this, even when it\u2019s time to reach the heights of the show\u2019s respective arcs, everything is trivialized by the fact that nothing about the world around the characters is important. On top of this, every bit of melodrama incorporated in the scene is amplified infinitely. Melodrama and characters that I don\u2019t like are not a combination I\u2019m too fond of. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, Bunny Girl Senpai introduces a jarring amount of interesting ideas and fumbles nearly all of them. The topic of being an outcast is referred to a few times in this story. Relatability aside, this is an easy and reliable way to create viewer empathy towards the protagonist\u2019s cause. What would be the one thing that the author shouldn\u2019t do immediately after introducing Sakuta as a social outcast? In my mind it would be giving him a decently large friend group. Guess what, he has the jock guy as a friend, Rio, Mai and the reporter all within the first two episodes. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s just sloppy writing. Next up on the list is sexual stigmatism. Sakuta is someone who likes to make puns out of sexually charged remarks. I like this aspect of the show. I think people are far too awkward about sex, and it\u2019s always refreshing to see anime tackle this in a way that isn\u2019t too obnoxious. So, let\u2019s run through this again. What is the one thing that the writing must avoid in order to promote de-stigmatizing sexual remarks and make it ubiquitous with the dialogue? I would say choosing character tropes that have trouble confronting romantic emotions is a big one to avoid. \\n\\n\r\nHead count: \\n\r\nMai - comfortable with sexually charged jokes.  \\n\r\nMai\u2019s sister \u2013 uncomfortable with Sakuta\u2019s humor.\\n\r\nTomoe - can\u2019t confront romantic emotions. \\n\r\nRio - emotionally unaware and distressed\\n\r\nKaede \u2013 emotionally distressed, but comfortable with Sakuta\u2019s humor. \\n\\n\r\nMore than HALF of the main female characters not only can\u2019t deal with sexual remarks, but also have some quantity of emotional ineptitude within themselves. I\u2019m not so ignorant as to believe it would be natural to have every female character in the show be into raunchy humor, but more than half of them aren\u2019t. There is the likely explanation of viewing Sakuta\u2019s perverted attitude play off other character tropes. Unfortunately, when you give more than half the cast the same reaction, it\u2019s tough to remain interested, which leads me to believe the raunchy comedy is indeed an attempt as destigmatizing sex among the demographic watching it. Either way, there were inherent flaws in the way this concept was presented, which is unfortunately the case the with the better half of every concept addressed in this show.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most remarkable technical aspect of this show is its pacing. For a 13-episode light novel adaptation, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that genuine thought went into the storyboarding and layout of the episodes. Director Souichi Masui, having storyboarded on huge titles such as \u201cBeck\u201d, \u201cSoul Eater\u201d and \u201cSamurai Champloo\u201d, may have had a significant impact on how well the pacing turned out. However, this story is adapted from a light novel, and even premonitions aside, the additional effort that it takes to realize writing into animation with no layout of the authors thoughts in the form of scenes and direction makes for a more difficult time generating creative trademarking. This doesn\u2019t mean that the sloppy cuts and uninteresting angles used are excusable, but certainly had a hand in the overall ineffectiveness of any intended artistic integrity. A comparable show like Monogatari (in plot structure, and the fact that they are both light novel adaptations) which uses style as a defining factor makes it known that it\u2019s possible to combine light novel adaptations and individualistic direction, so why is this show so incredibly dispassionate? I can\u2019t answer that question without some lofty speculation, so I\u2019ll briefly summarize the point of this paragraph. Essentially, this anime is paced well, but lacks creative influence. Bunny Girl Senpai pays tribute only to the concept of storytelling, disregarding any sense of innovation. This is not a criticism, this is an effect of viewing common seasonal anime through a critical lens. Although the above will inevitably shorten this anime\u2019s longevity, it\u2019s more than possible that a large portion of viewers don\u2019t care about this in the short term.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable aspect of this show is its sound design. Bunny Girl Senpai\u2019s OST falls somewhere just above average, with a catchy opening, decent \u2013 dramatized, albeit \u2013 but decent insert tracks, good sound effects,  and decent audio engineering in general that does well to create some sense of professionality in an otherwise rudimentary production. \\n\\n\r\nTo say that the collective reaction to Bunny Girl Senpai was one of pleasant surprise, would be the understatement of the century. \u201cA trashy bunny girl costume and a confusing, shoddy premise\u201d are the thoughts I had going in. Although only one of those two expectations were made to be inaccurate, I can say with the utmost confidence that this show is much better than a lot of people would have assumed going in. It takes a good amount of blood, sweat and tears to create something greater than the sum of its parts, and frankly this show just didn\u2019t make it there for me. It takes ideas that look acceptable on paper, and fruitlessly attempts to convert them to animation. There\u2019s really nothing wrong with missing the mark but missing the mark in almost every category (characters, plot structure, setting, core concept) and being applauded for it seems rather counter-intuitive. I understand why this show comes off as likeable. It\u2019s a very reticent, palatable show with enough charm to keep its fanbase interested. Beyond that though, there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a surface level show with exactly what meets the eye, and while some may consider that genuine, I can\u2019t bring myself to call it anything other than uninspired. So, when all\u2019s said and done, Rascal may not be dreaming of Bunny Girl Senpai, but you can bet that I will be\u2026 and with a few complaints he\u2019s well on his way to a second season (that I won\u2019t be watching) of \u201cMy Teen Romantic Calamity Pseudo-Science SNAFU\u201d.  \\n",

However, you aren\u2019t going to watch a girl wearing a bunny outfit all the time \u2026 sorry to disappoint. Also, the audience can relate the anime with Bakemonogatari, Sakurada Reset to name some and the similarity between the main characters' behavior, the mystery in the plot, and the supernatural events.\r\nOn the other hand, as a positive aspect about the series, we have the characters chemistry and an entertaining plot. The story is interesting and mysterious, it could be a bit confusing for some, butit has a taint that boosts the characters interactions and hooks the spectators with good pacing. In this anime, the author cared to develop a world where the school is the center, and the events affect the characters and the interaction with the outside world. \\n\\n\r\nWe have two main characters, but their personalities differ a lot, so the contrast makes the characters more vivid. They aren't the typical high schoolers with the same generic background as most of the high school series. The main male character Sakuta has a nice introvert attitude and with an awkward past and could be a weirdo. Furthermore, he is ironic, sarcastic and with some sense of humor executed flawlessly. The main female character aka the Bunny Girl Mai (her face looks like a bunny :3) is a famous actress but with a mature air that is not normal in this kind of series. I am finding the background very interesting, but she will experience some unexpectant events related to a certain syndrome that I am not going to explain because we have only seen four episodes and this syndrome will affect the plot outcome in several ways. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is clean and precious. I am surprised by the quality and color management. However, it is not perfect, and some camera angles could have been improved, but you won't notice them. \\n\r\nThe OP (Kimi no Sei) is marvelous. I think the peggies did a great work performing the song; the lyrics are magnificent and have a great score that helps to follow them. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the series is good so far, albeit there are some plot mysteries related to the \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d that need to be revealed and explained but there are good theories in MAL\u2019s forum.\\n",

            "content": "Bunny Girl Senpai is an anime about this famous child actress who turns invisible, a main character dude who doesn't give a fuck about anything, and his little sister who was verbally assaulted to a point that she started bleeding blood and became a shut-in. All of this happens because of some magic disease called a puberty syndrome.\r\nThe events include our main bro being some sort of women-helping Jesus except if the women are bothering him in which case he roasts them by claiming they are on their periods or otherwise strips in front of them to make them awkward blushy blush, because apparently, heis the only person in the series who doesn't get embarrassed over nothing. \\n\\n\r\nOur series relies on certain levels of edge and apathy when it wants to, but usually these things are forgotten in 3 seconds when our main bro starts roasting someone. Be it him calling a dude who is using a camera a wannabe photographer or just appearing superior to anyone else for no other reason than others being inferior to him.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really makes much sense here. Our dude cares so little about anything that he can see the invisible bunny costume-wearing senpai and then they become friends or something and chat about the supernatural things that occur in this series with the same disinterest the main bro is already radiating regarding everything that exists because that's the sole point of his character.\\n\\n\r\nThere has been quite a few series that have dealt with similar themes in highly similar manner. These include Bakemonogatari, Oregairu and Suzumiya Haruhi. The problem here is that everything in this one feels forced and fake. The main cast can be believable and realistic at times, but most of everyone else isn't. Rather they seem to exist just for the main characters since they so often are some one-dimensional buttholes or angry lil girls who get served by the mc and then disappear. Especially scenes such as random girl appearing just to fuck with the mc's shit and call him a pedophile are cringe and feel nothing other than stupido filler.\\n\\n\r\nI think melancholy, vanity, disinterest and in generally being the outcast offer incredible potential under these settings, but I fail to see what makes Bunny Girl a good exemplary of these. The best thing about this series is how familiar and welcoming it feels, but unlike so many other series similar to it, it seems like a good example of a series that is not living up to its potential at all. Real zero effort stuff. I also feel physically ill from the existential philosophies presented in the series. I feel like this series is disrespecting its audience. It's like asking philosophy student \"know who Sigmund Freud is?\" The dialogue can also be pretty meh seasoned with lame. Lewd and sexual remarks presented in a highly teenage manner and not with the level of maturity and awareness that is usually seen in the dialogue of similar anime series. I'd much rather have the cast hit the tarantino-effect instead of this nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this series promoting itself and its characters with the \"I am not like all the rest\" -attitude, what I am seeing here is pretty much like most of the rest: A completely average anime series, soulless and empty version of what it could have been. Attempt to make the next big hit under these settings, but failing to see what made any of the earlier ones worth of praise in the first place. I give this a 4 instead of a 5 just to show how little effort it takes to be as edgy as the mc.",

This phenomenon is known as ''puberty syndrome'', the protagonist's little sister has been a victim of this phenomenon in the past. The anime begins with Sakuta meeting Sakurajima Mai, who is also being the victim of this phenomenon, from there the protagonist decides to help her.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe opening and ending are very good, when they starts you get so excited. The soundtrack also is good, although it is not perfect, but it is  enough to cause impact during drama scenes.\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThe maincharacter, Sakuta, is so badass! man, i wish be like he. Sakuta in only 5 episodes prove be a excellent character, he goes against all protagonist cliches and surprise you in each new episode. The heroine, Mai, is also a good character, she isn't like the others girls that you usually see in animes, she is racional and not a stupid tsundere. The others characters is also good, in special the cientist girl (dude, i like much her)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDude, I honestly would give 10 easily to this anime just for the entertainment. You start the episode and when you realize it is over. You become totally focused, the time seems to accelerate. The fact that each episode brings up something new that breaks down cliches surprises us more and more (Especially the protagonist, who goes against 90% of other animes).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like animes that are not cliches, in which there are great characters, romance that progresses, and of course, an excellent protagonist, I highly recommend watch Seishun Buta.",

I was watching the first few minutes of the first episode expecting something probably as ecchi as it seems on the cover art, but hot damn did I got hooked by the quirky characters, mainly the interactions between our main protagonists. This show within the first episode reminded me of Bakemonogatari, which till this date Istill think has one of the best monologues and dialogues, and now at the end of it, I think we have a great contester to dethrone the monogatari series, and here I present you, Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai.\\n\\n\r\nStory / Character -10-\\n\r\nRevolving around the idea of \u2018Puberty Syndrome\u2019, this story mainly focuses on how our male protagonist, Sakuta settles this problem for the ones undergoing this syndrome. Albeit totally supernatural, there are sufficient backstory and explanations relating to quantum physics and what not (if you can understand that is), in which I think is always a great touch to the story to not let the audience sit in confusion. Puberty Syndrome is where you might find random bruises or cuts throughout your body, or having a juxtapose of yourself that takes your rightful place etc. However, because the setting of this story is actually in high school, it can be very relatable to some due to the fact that the problems usually are involved with gossiping, bad mouthing or simply falling in love. Consequences of not properly solving Puberty Syndrome can lead to severe problems, just like in real life, one wrong move and it might cause you the win or lose. \\n\r\nNow moving on to our protagonist, ladies first, and it is our best girl Sakurajima Mai senpai. Humorous, bold, outgoing, what more can one ask for, it\u2019s an all in one package here for your service. Sakuta, again humorous, kind, and mostly perverted. With the encounter of Makinohara Shouko, Sakuta starts to treat others kinder and is the core of why Sakuta helps (perpetually) everyone out throughout the story, because he wants to be kind. As of the side characters, imouto, kouhai, thicc af girl IN LAB COAT, theyre all really great and likeable characters, with each of them having their own unique personalities. They also contribute a lot to the story, making this entire show a very wholesome one. Catchy settings and directing is what makes this anime stand at the top against the others this season, maybe even the year of 2018, you get so invested into the characters by the first episode it is hard to just not love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt -10- \\n\r\nCloverworks ( A-1 Pictures) nailed the crap out of it this time. The art style is really smooth to the eyes, and looks a lot like Oregairu (which is definitely an extra point), animations are fluid and some compositions are seriously on point.  Subtle emotions are well laid out on the characters and they really add up to the feelings and they convey well to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSound -10-\\n\r\nAnother big part that contributes to the wholesomeness of this show is the voice acting and the OSTs. The opening which at this point everyone probably knows how to sing, is hella catchy, and is like a blackhole sucking you in, once you heard it, theres no turning back. Same goes for the ending, every character had their own uniquely designed ending, just like how the monogatari series has the VA sing the OP for their respective arcs (in which case is the same here). Voice acting is top notch, whats better than having a quirky conversation? A lively and energetic one. And its all here in this show, cocaine for your ears my buddy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -10-\\n\r\nDefinitely my top pick of this season (year as well), if you haven\u2019t watch it, please do so already, you really don\u2019t want to miss out this show, even if the cover art turns you off (or the otherwise ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) You want some fun time watching some slice of life-y anime? Check! You want some home hitting feelings or tear jerking moments?  Check! Having doubted this anime at first was my single worst mistake Ive ever made, because this series has proven itself worthy of being one of the best animes possibly out there. With an movie adaptation for another arc in the future, I can safely say that everyone should be looking forward for that, just like how Sakuta looks forward getting teased by Mai everyday.\\n\\n\\n",

Having supernatural themes, this series is highly anticipated by various people, but the solution they provide is forced as if they only gave a very simple impression but we can accept it.\\n\\n\r\nNot forgetting this series is also in the romantic category, indeed some of the scenes that are displayed are very simple and limited to such as holding hands (therefore this series can be watched from among the ages, but there are some scenes that contain sexual jokes that are not worth watching for children but it's still natural). The conflicts they are not very significant, they only argue about the problems they and they can solve them very simply.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nRecently, exactly two months ago a company called \"Cloverworks\" which was the parent company of \"Aniplex\" released a number of popular anime series, for example they collaborated with several studios in the recent \"Darling In The Franxx\" series. cause controversy in the whole world. In their adaptation they have no shortcomings, arguably in every adaptation they have worked very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has a rigid animation design and does not have a special characteristic, a simple character design adds to the impression that this animation becomes very simple. But the audience does not care too much about it, they only focus on a very interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAn anime series will not be good if it is not supported by the sound part. From the voice part or seiyuu they are very good, the match between the voice and the characters is very suitable they can produce good sound quality according to the age of the character they are playing.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme of \"Kimi no Sei\" sung by The Peggies is very simple but has its own characteristics, while for the closing theme \"Fukashigi no Carte\" they are very good at replacing singers in each chapter based on their respective characters.For their BGM they are very careful in their selection, sometimes BGM is at the center of attention, for example when fighting is not only important animation but BGM also plays an important role in this matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThis series has two main characters, telling about their school life is not an ordinary student they have strange puberty. Sakuta is a student who is boring in the eyes of many people, he has a dark past therefore he is shunned by many people but he still live his life as usual. After meeting Sakurajima Mai Sakuta's life changed which initially had no purpose in life now with the spirit of living his life.\\n\\n\r\nHas a strange youth Sakurajima Mai is very bored because at any time she can disappear in the eyes of everyone, but one time when she was in the middle of a meeting she met a Sakuta, he was able to see the form of Mai wearing a rabbit costume. artist who has ignorance to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAfter him meeting with Mai, Sakuta is now acquainted with a girl named Koga. She is the younger sister of Sakuta's class who has a cheerful nature but behind her cheerful nature, she has a strange youth. Different from the others, Koga can return time based on her will.\\n\\n\r\nHaving a smart and beautiful friend is the hope of everyone. Futaba, who is Sakuta's classmate, has an easy to talk nature, but this Futaba has a strange youth where he can split into two.\\n\\n\r\nMai has a half sister named Nodoka, she is an artist like Mai. Nodoka has jealousy towards people who are stronger than him, as a result of his character he can exchange bodies with other people so that he can feel what the person can feel.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta is also just like Mai, she also has a younger sister, but the difference is the younger sibling. The sister of Sakuta named Kaede, she is a confined and timid girl but she has a reason why she is moody. from his classmates, therefore he became a confined and timid girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis season has many interesting anime series and one of them is Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai tells about puberty syndrome, this series has a very interesting story in each episode even we are invited to think how to solve the problems they are facing.",

            "content": "This review contains some light spoilers.\r\nOftentimes the word \u201cpretentious\u201d is thrown around to criticize shows with complex plots or extravagant visuals with the assumption that calling the anime \u201cpretentious\u201d with no explanation of how that detracts from the quality of the show is a valid criticism in and of itself. However, in the case of \u201cBunny Girl,\u201d Kamoshida\u2019s pretensions are detrimental to the quality of the writing to the point that the incredibly simple ideas presented in this show become unnecessarily difficult to understand solely so Kamoshida can stroke his ego.\r\nThe first arc of Bunny Girl is dedicated to Mai Sakurajima\u2019s case of adolescence syndrome.This syndrome caused Mai to turn invisible and made everyone forget except for the Sakuta (the MC) and his friends to forget that she exists. While I think this is all fine, the issue arises from Kamoshida\u2019s attempt to explain this simple concept using Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Not only does Kamoshida fail to explain Schrodinger\u2019s cat correctly, but it isn\u2019t even an accurate representation of Mai\u2019s situation. There is a much simpler and more widely known thought experiment that goes: \"if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\" If no one perceives Mai, does she exist? The tree falling thought experiment reflects Mai\u2019s syndrome so much better that it is just dumbfounding that Kamoshidadecided to incorrectly apply Schrodinger\u2019s cat to the situation instead. This is just terrible writing. Kamoshida takes a concept that could easily be understood with little explanation, and then makes it as complex as he possibly can for no reason other than to show of his poor understanding of Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Unfortunately for us, this isn\u2019t the last time Kamoshida shoves his lack of knowledge of quantum mechanics down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc of the series focuses on the Sakuta\u2019s underclassman whose case of adolescence syndrome created a time loop that caused everyone to relive the same day 3 times. This isn\u2019t a complicated or novel idea. Hollywood movies like Groundhog Day and even children\u2019s shows like Cardcaptor Sakura have made use of time loops. Of course, Kamoshida decides to make it as convoluted as possible by using Laplace\u2019s Demon to explain this simple plot device. \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime to be be pretentious in the way it is written, it has to present itself as being deeper than it actually is. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s inherently a bad thing While I think this word gets overused as a lazy criticism to describe any \u201csmart\u201d anime, in the case of Bunny Girl, Kamoshida\u2019s pretensions significantly diminish the quality of the writing. Kamoshida takes straight forward ideas and makes them unnecessarily complicated by introducing unnecessary quantum mechanics that he doesn\u2019t even fully understand. But if you think this is the end to the terrible writing present in this anime, you\u2019re dead wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEvery line of dialogue in this anime sounds as if it was painstakingly crafted by the author to sound as clever and witty as possible. Unfortunately, Kamoshida is neither clever nor witty and the dialogue just ends up feeling incredibly stilted. The dialogue is composed of the kind of lines that people wish they had said when thinking about a conversation they had minutes ago. No one speaks like this! It\u2019s unnatural and unrealistic. Everything that comes out of Sakuta\u2019s mouth is just an obnoxious one-liner. Kamoshida clearly doesn\u2019t even understand the most basic rules for writing passable dialogue, and the fact that it\u2019s the primary point of praise for this show is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough less bothersome than Kamoshida\u2019s sheer incompetence as a writer, the fan service in this show is almost offensive because it\u2019s the kind of fan service that thinks it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t mind fan service or being blatantly pandered to as long as the show is honest about it, but Bunny Girl tries to justify its fan service in the most pathetic ways possible. The worst example of this is in the beginning of the series when Mai dresses as a bunny girl to test whether other people can see her as if that\u2019s the most logical thing she could do. It\u2019s not reasonable, it\u2019s just a pitiful attempt at disguising fan service because Kamoshida thinks he\u2019s above it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakuta is a bit more cynical and edgy than most generic self-insert main characters. Mai is slightly more understanding than most tsunderes. Those are the only things that make the characters in Bunny Girl unique. If you\u2019ve seen a light novel adaptation before, you\u2019ve seen these characters before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the art, it\u2019s just very average. If Cloverworks didn\u2019t take every available opportunity to assault my eyes with a mob of hideous 3DCG background characters, I would give this category a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Bunny Girl is just godawful and nothing else about this anime is really worth mentioning.\\n",

            "content": "\"Never judge a book by its cover.\" - Some random person.\r\nThis Fall 2018 anime season, there are a lot of shows to watch on. Honestly, on my opinion, I enjoy this season pretty much more than any other seasons this year. From Goblin Slayer giving us memes and war, SAO back at it again with another season of Kirito OP-ness, to Jojos returning to TV screen with its title \"Golden Wind\", Fall season this year is definitely a must-see season.\r\nLet us not forget the romance or drama genre of anime which are plenty this season as well. One of them, giving us audience a prettymuch click-baiting cover is \"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\" or in short, \"Bunny-girl Senpai\". When I looked at the cover picture of the anime on its MAL page and its synopsis I was like \"Oh... It is another typical and generic harem anime that the protagonist is always at the center of everything and he is not that lovable to the audience perspective I bet.\"\\n\r\nThat WAS my statement until I watched up to episode 3 and kept going until I finished it. I was so damnnn wrong.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe follow the story of Azusagawa Sakuta to his daily high-school life. It was normal, until he met Sakurajima Mai wearing a bunny suit in a library. Weird am I right? But as the story goes on, we get to follow that Mai is suffering to a what is called as a \"Puberty Syndrome\" which incase for her, turning invisible to other people (except Sakuta because he is the protagonist). \\n\r\nThis was the starting point of the story. We get to know so many types of Puberty Syndromes that revolves around Sakuta's girl colleagues not only Mai. Does this sound pretty familiar? Yes.. It is almost like the plot of the Monogatari series. In spite of that, Bunny girl senpai tends to create a unique atmosphere to the audience. It is more on drama, feels, romance and the sufferings of the girls along with Sakuta in the story, portraying real-life issues on our society. One of the girl suffered bullying, one suffered jealousy or envy, one suffered hatred on herself and not knowing how to act what she wants, one suffered ignorance to reality and wanted loneliness and one suffered one of the harsh reality of love. Every single bit of this issues complements the story's goal and the main protagonist Sakuta who really is the center of them all. But making him the center of it doesn't make it\\n\r\nas your typical and generic harem anime unlike other anime out there that the protagonist is the center of everything and the harem is very plain. In fact, it is not even labeled as a harem on MAL which totally makes sense because the vibes of it being a harem is not there. Instead, we get the vibes of every character's problems or issues they are encountering along with Sakuta which is totally fine for the story. Hence, Bunny girl senpai's story unveils problems or issues of teenagers to our modern society that make it more of a story foreshadowing this topics and having the audience learn from it because of the experiences of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, there are soooo many waifus on this show. But let us talk about the one, the only, man of culture, Azusagawa Sakuta. Unlike any generic protagonist out there who cannot portray their real feelings in real life in front of a girl, Sakuta is different. He will say anything that comes to his mind whether it is a perverted one or someone that makes someone offensive. His replies to the girls especially to Mai-san always get me and say \"How do you have the guts to say that?\". In any case, Sakuta is one of the best male characters I've ever seen this season or maybe this year as well. Now for the waifus. My favorite Sakurajima Mai have like some sort of unique trait on her. She doesn't really care about what Sakuta is saying even it is something perverted. She is always composed but have the blush to protect. She have some little tsundere vibes but not that much unlike her little sister Toyohama Nodoka. Nodoka is like the opposite of Mai-san. She is your typical tsundere type of girl but her story gave us more details about their relationship as a sibling to Mai-san. Next girl is Koga Tomoe, which I think represents a girl that is a tryhard and wants to keep updated always to whats happening whether in real life or social media. She fears loneliness and because of that she tries to become like her classmates. Then there is Futaba Rio, the one who wears lab coats on every scene she is on and the one that advices Sakuta of the causes of Puberty Syndrome through the power of SCIENCE!. We can say she is a very smart girl considering her intelligence on quantum mechanics, physics and all sorts of mumbo-jumbo science stuff. But then like any other girl in the series, her fear or Puberty Syndrome complements to the story of the anime. It is something most of us wanted to do for the sake of others but we are unsure if we can really do it... and again because of love.. Of course we shall never forget the little sister of Sakuta, Azusagawa Kaede. Because of her I tend to like Sakuta as a main protagonist because Sakuta.. surprisingly... not in love with her little sister! Like how many times we get to see incest in anime. Like literally every season I guess? But here, Sakuta doesn't like Kaede hugging him while he was in bed and he even quoted this statement \"Who'd get excited over their little sister?\" Sakuta aside, Kaede probably have the worst type of Puberty Syndrome and it impacts Sakuta as a brother of her as whole as well. Even the parents of Sakuta and Kaede are devastated. That's why I can describe Kaede as Sakuta's challenge that makes him a hard challenger and never give up on her. And finally the little girl Makinohara Shouko is just a pure mystery to me. I mean this girl is someone important to Sakuta but there are circumstances that makes her a mystery and somewhat special. Overall, the characters are lovable to the audience that makes it entertaining to watch on every week.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOn the art side, it is good. It is not that special or anything but it is indeed watchable and pleasant. the character designs are pretty much cute as well with their eyes big but bright. It is fairly a unique art style among other art style this season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nUnfortunately, unlike the good OST of Monogatari, Bunny-girl senpai doesn't have much of that. The soundtracks are good and thats it. It just fits into the atmosphere but it is something that I will not put on my music playlist as it is not my taste. But... the opening and endings are veryy good for my ears. The opening have good sound that catches my ear and the ending portrays some sadness because..... the episode ended of course. But i said \"endings\" earlier. The endings have different characters walking in a beach. For example, if the episode is mainly about Futaba, you will see Futaba walking into the sands of the beach. The same applies to every character of each arc. Overall in terms of sound, opening song and ending song are likable while OST's are good but not for my playlists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nHence, Bunny-girl Senpai is one of those anime that makes the story sounds pretty similar to other genre or anime but its intake to it are unique. The fact that it implies some weakness or fear of teenagers makes it relatable to people and gives out feels to us. If you are looking for an anime that have a bunch of girls but have a good story and a well-narrated protagonist, this is it for you and I highly recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "TLDR: A really good Romance/Mystery anime with a lot of potential. Definitely a must watch this season.\r\nSTORY:\r\n Although I have seen similar stories in anime but so far the execution is pretty good and Far Better than MOST anime.  It is a Mystery surrounding \"Adolescence Syndrome\" where different characters face supernatural phenomena while going through adolescence and how it affects the main couple.\r\nThe show has built a lot of intrigue this far.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\n The 2 mains are compelling. The main guy is an outcast with a mysterious past. He cares about people but can give someone a verbal bitch slap if needed. He is kindbut courageous enough to stand up for himself and say what he wants. He is not a wishy-washy pussy like most romance protagonists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe girl is serious but not stuck-up. Her responses are honest yet measured. She is sometimes blunt but never rude. She is mature enough to admit her mistakes but not dwell on them.\\n\r\nShe is neither a Puritanical Prude nor an overtly seductive bimbo.\\n\r\nMost anime often have a difficulty finding a balance between these 2 traits.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThey have great chemistry. They tease each other and constantly try to one up one another, while also sharing their secrets with one another.\\n\r\nTheir conversations are interesting even when talking about mundane things.\\n\\n\r\nNO fountains of Nosebleeds/accidental boob-grabs or any silliness of that sort.\\n\r\nEverything is talked about openly and there seems to be a genuine connection.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast is fine too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & ART:\\n\r\n It is really good. Kind of looks like \"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n Good. For some reason the Opening song reminded me of \"Your Name\" opening song. May be they share similar beats, rhythm and instruments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend this show to Fans of Romance with supernatural/mystery elements.\\n\\n\r\nI have given this an 8/10 because I don't know how the story will be handled in the next episodes.\\n\r\n The score can go up or down depending on that. It definitely has the potential to be one of great ones.\\n\\n\r\nFingers Crossed",

            "content": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough Pornhub videos to know how this series is going to end.\u201d \u2014 Krunchyman\r\nThis series truly speaks to me as a fellow \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d sufferer, as I use to \u201cbaste my ham\u201d five times a day on a regular basis, and let me tell you something folks: rug-burn is an inconvenient truth.  But enough about my own troubles, because this anime is troubling enough in its own right.\r\nFirst of all, allow me to propose a theory that I kicked around in my head since viewing the first episode.  The Bunny Girl Senpai, otherwise known as Mai, is simply a figment ofSakuta\u2019s imagination, brought about by the \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d phenomena that he has superimposed on her to convince himself that she is in fact real.  Given that Sakuta has yet to experience a sexual relationship (as far as we know, at least), he envisions a girl in a scandalously lewd outfit in a public library.  Despite having a golden opportunity to live out his lustful fantasy, he decides to slow play his hand, by initiating a methodical, emotional approach to getting into Mai\u2019s pants.  If you wish to deceive yourself into believing a fantasy girl is \u201creal\u201d \u2014 like Sakuta was attempting to do \u2014 then she has to seem authentic; otherwise, the imaginative experience will fade away into the ether (just like their first encounter).\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, the concept seems plausible from a demographic perspective.  Many of the consumers watching this show are young, adolescent boys who have yet touch a girl.  And what is abundantly clear about male, anime consumers from the various salacious photos posted on their profile\u2019s?  They fantasize about provocative senpai\u2019s, whom they will never meet in their lifetime\u2019s.  Literally every anime fan has this phase in their lifetime, but, unlike most people, Sakuta had the courage to sprint toward his convictions, and make his fantasy become a reality.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I present to you: the Tyler Durden theory.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\u2026.<ahem>  Welp!  Episode three blew that theory out of the water, back to the drawing board.\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuick recap: the series is banal, the character\u2019s are ill-explored, the character designs look remarkably similar to one another, and the entire concept is so uninteresting, that I concocted a version of it in my head to maintain my level of sanity.  The scene where Sakuta started screaming towards the school, professing his affection for Mai was the lone bright spot, because I nearly fell out of my chair from laughter.  That being said, the entertainment value for Bunny Girl Senpai is noticeably absent, and I would ardently recommend that you look elsewhere for anime-related amusement.  \\n\\n\r\nContrived, school-aged bullshit; nothing more need be said.  \u201cThen why did you write the review in the first place,\u201d random MAL user \u2014 because, silly billy, hateful comments recharge my power crystals.",

            "content": "This is my first and probably last review on MAL. I think there are a couple of things to say about this anime which are not said yet. I don't want to go to much into detail so it would be better you have watched the anime before reading this.\r\nThis anime is a fanservice trash anime that pretends to be not trashy nor fanservice and attracts all people who love trash and let them believe they have found a superior good and deep anime which is at the bottom of it's heart as stupid as SAO or any other harem ecchi anime out there. \r\nIdon't want to offend anyone. I also enjoy those kind of anime like yamada kun for example. But this anime is on the one hand stupid as hell and on the other hand every single charakter and problem is a 1 by 1 copy of bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nMain charakter: He is absolutely one dimensional. He has no emotions and acts indifferent to everything what happens arround him but at times he make some couple of unfunny sarcastic jokes and tries to solve the problem of the girls from his harem (which gets bigger by almost every episode). \\n\\n\r\nSakurajima mai: Maybe the waifu of the year. The relationship between her and the mc is fanservice at it's finest. You have a celebrity good looking and cute girl who is attracted by the lowkey lowlife loser mc, which maybe represents the average consumer of that kind of anime. This is maybe why this anime gets such high ratings. Because this kind of relationship satisfies the needy needs of the male consumers.\\n\\n\r\n(Apart from mai you have all over the anime those ecchi moments like panty, boobies and so on)\\n\\n\r\nFutaba: Honestly this anime is not that bad but also not that good but this character wants me to smash my head with lightspeed against the pyramids of gizeh. \\n\r\nEverytime our beloved main character is confronted with the puberty syndrome he has no idea what's going on because he is stupid. This often take a couple of time until he realizes it and than goes to futuba who is supposed to be the smartest person in that anime. And wow every conversation between them which is about the puberty syndrom gives cancer to my ears. He tells her that person xy has problem z. She responds with some pseudo sientific and deep answers which contains some phenomens of the physics. Those responses are totally random and make absolutely no sense. This is how a conversation between her and me could be:\\n\\n\r\nMe: Futuba-chan my stomach doesn't feels so good\\n\r\nHer: Have you been to the toilet today\\n\r\nMe: Eeeeh no?\\n\r\nHer: Well i think this is because schr\u00f6dingers cat.-blabla explains it- and so is your stomach. The answer to the question what's going on with your stomach is that you have constipation and diarrhea at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nReally those conversations are so boring and stupid. If you are not familiar with quantummechanics or physics at all this might sound very deep and intellectual to you but trust me. It's just shit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last point is really everything of this anime is equivalent to bakemonogatari but only like 10 dimensions worse and boring.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta = araragi (both lowkey and lowlife persons)\\n\r\nMai = hitagi (one is a soft tsundere the other tsundere and yandere in one person)\\n\r\nFutaba = meme oshino (mc come always to them because they have no idea about their mysterys)\\n\r\nNodoka = nadeko\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest of the characters are almost the same\\n\\n\r\nAt last i want to say is something good. If it comes about teenagers and their problems in that school age this anime has it's strength. Most of them feel very realistic and autehntic. If the mc wouldnt be that one dimensional the relationship to mai would feel a bit refreshing because their contact feels alive and not that exxegerated. But the anime deals it very bad or with other words it packs it in a very shitty way. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is a bit disappointing to me. It had much more potential if the writer would have been courrageous and made something independently and not that trashy fanservice copy of an anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The challenges we face during our adolescence may be irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, though their magnitude in the moment can feel overwhelming. It's no surprise then that media which intensifies these issues through supernatural phenomenon would be popular, since teenage audiences feel as if the weight of their problems is understood. However, does this media actually help its audience to overcome their problems, or is it merely wish fulfillment to escape from them? Seishun Buta Yarou may have something compelling to say about the adolescent experience, but it's unfortunately buried under layers of tropes and cliches.\r\nBut of all the elements of theshow that feel superfluous to the narrative, the protagonist Sakuta sits at the top of the list. Unlike the girls of the show, he doesn't undergo any development over the series, and only exists as the self-insert lens through which we view their arcs. He hardly exists as a character, and his only trait seems to be his tendency for frequent dehumanizing sexual harassment directed at basically every girl he meets. He's presented as the catalyst that instigates the girls' growth, but instead he just comes across as a plot device that knows exactly what to do to solve their problems for them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, each arc of the show is modeled after a classic thought experiment, and wow do I wish they hadn\u2019t done that. Not only do these allusions not add anything to the narrative, but their integration feels completely unnatural. (\u201cSurely you\u2019ve at least heard about the cat in the box, right?\u201d a friend asks the protagonist, nearing the end of the first episode) Seishun Buta Yarou is hardly the first series to have pulled this allusion, but at this point, referencing Schrodinger\u2019s Cat seems like shorthand for a light novel thinking it\u2019s smarter than it is, and I can\u2019t think of anything else that had the audacity to follow it up with \u201cHave you heard of Laplace\u2019s Demon?\u201d three episodes later.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the contents of each arc, the conflicts that the girls deal with mostly come off as artificial. Still, even if the substance itself is lacking, I can\u2019t fault the presentation. The animation and vocal delivery is expressive, and it\u2019s also neat how there's some overlap between events that help to make each one feel less like an isolated incident. However, I think that Seishun Buta Yarou\u2019s most compelling asset is how the characters behave outside of the central narrative. Despite everything else, it\u2019s fun to see these characters relax and bounce off of each other. It's a shame that the show's best feature is also its least central.\\n\\n\r\nMy feelings towards Seishun Buta Yarou are conflicted. I went into it expecting a cross between Monogatari and Oregairu, and that\u2019s not really what I got. It took a while for me to accept the show for what it actually was, but once I did, I was able to find a genuine emotional core underneath all of the light novelisms. Ironically, I think the more interested you are in this genre, the less likely it is that Seishun Buta Yarou will appeal to you. It leans hard into its genre trappings, and your enjoyment will be largely determined by your tolerance of them. Still, if you're a fan of deadpan loner protagonists, you could do worse.",

            "content": "What do I think about Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai? It\u2019s an amazing show. That\u2019s the simple way to say it but the complicated way is explaining it from my perspective. To be fair, I think this anime gets judged based on a lot of facts before it even aired. Like for instance, the brainchild behind the light novels is the same person that made Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. (The Pet girl of Sakurasou) Anyone who has seen that anime may think what to expect from this show. But I think a bit differently. Hajime Kamoshida helmed thestorytelling for both series but there\u2019s quite a bit of differences. I don\u2019t want to talk too much about comparison because the fact is, Bunny Girl Senpai pretty much stand out a lot on its own feet.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s get the most obvious out of the way first. When you see that key visual on the anime entry page, what really comes to mind? On the front is a beautiful long haired beauty dressed in a sexy bunny outfit. When you look at it, she could probably resemble a playboy girl on the front page of a magazine. The visual impression alone had my interest although it\u2019s clear that the anime isn\u2019t just about a bunny girl. It\u2019s about a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa in which his life changes forever after encountering our poster girl, Mai Sakurajima in the library. At the heart of the series is also a mysterious phenomenon known as the \u201cAdolescence Syndrome\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow I should say right off the bat that you\u2019d better be prepared for social commentary. This is essentially a very talky show with no shortage of dialogues. In fact, it explores many social problems that is very real in our world today. Anxiety, depression, bullying, inferiority, isolationism, lack of confidence. You name it. If I had to guess, there\u2019s probably someone out there in your life that also suffers from something along those lines at one point or another. So in many ways, it\u2019s easy to say this show is relatable on a realistic level. But you\u2019re probably thinking that logic makes no sense considering the set up for the first few episodes. Indeed, Mai\u2019s debut in the anime is perhaps way too bizarre to be considered real. It could even be considered surreal. I mean, who has ever seen a girl in a sexy bunny outfit walking around in a public library?\\n\\n\r\nUntil I realized what this show really wanted us to experience, it sort of reminded me of an anime known as \u201cBakemonogatari\u201d. My first impression of the fated encounter between Mai and Sakuta felt similar compared to that series. We have a regular guy meeting a girl under unusual circumstances and they begin to connect on a more personal level. What does make the first few episodes for this anime more distinctive is the amount of human emotions shown. Early in the series, we get a confession from Sakuta as he expresses it with brutal honesty. That love confession defines Sakuta as a character who isn\u2019t afraid to hold back his feelings. In fact, Sakuta seems like a guy who doesn\u2019t care much about what others think of him. Some people would call his behavior as cynical and anti-social. Indeed, Sakuta isn\u2019t a guy that\u2019s easy to make friends with but he does truly have people he cares about. Mai and his sister, Kaede are perhaps the two most important people in his life. That brings about his relationship with them. From the beginning, he and Mai develops a strange bond that blooms from strangers, to friends, and to a couple. Their relationship develops more and more despite some of their similarities and differences. It\u2019s shown that both characters suffers from some anxiety issues. However, Mai\u2019s problem suffers more as she fears about being forgotten. On the other hand, Sakuta is indifferent about how the world and doesn\u2019t even care if everyone hates him. (with exception of his closest loved ones) The first arc details the show exploring their deep inner problems. In fact, these inner struggles manifest in the form of the mysterious \u201cAdolescence Syndrome\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched more and more of this series, it became easy to see the direction of the overall storytelling. Each arc contains a story that deals with a different issue and a different character. However, several recurring themes apply and the most prominent is the amount of social psychology. There\u2019s meaningful interactions that is essential for the plot and character development. I\u2019m quite impressed how much every arc made me feel invested by these different characters. The second arc explores Tomoe, a schoolgirl that gets involved in a time loop. Think of Groundhog Day or the Eightless Eight. At this point, I knew what this show as aiming for: having the main protagonists help conquer their problems while solving the mystery of the Adolescence Syndrome. Tomoe\u2019s problems involves her fear of losing friends is another example of a social problem. It paints the picture of people suffering from problems that they try to avoid yet seemingly need help in doing so. That\u2019s where Sakuta comes in to deal with them. He\u2019s like an anime life coach.\\n\\n\r\nWith the pattern of the story structure, I knew what to expect as Sakuta also helps deal with problems involving Rio Fubata, Nodoka Toyohama, and even his own sister, Kaede. I should say that at times, the manifestation of their problems feels like a superstition. We get doppelgangers, body switching, and memory loss. It\u2019s rather creative how they represent each of the characters\u2019 inner struggles while capitalizing on the psychological appeal. One character that manages evade these social problems is Shoko Makinohara. Regrettably, I\u2019d say that compared to the other cast members, her presence is easily forgotten despite her connection to Sakuta\u2019s past. Speaking of which, Sakuta has problems of his own that includes his troubled past. He even suffers from a physical scar on his chest due to his sister\u2019s Adolescence Syndrome. Throughout the series, I think it\u2019s important to realize how the creators managed to capitalize on its emotional content. The final arc in this anime adaptation shows Sakuta as a kind brother who is willing to do anything to help his sister. It\u2019s the type of family bond that is emotional and contains a lot of heartwarming moments. And even as emotional as the story gets, this show still finds time for comedy such as with Sakuta\u2019s lewd comments about girls and his dry sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that CloverWorks is involved in this project. They\u2019re a studio rebranded from A-1 Pictures as its own identity. To my delight, they managed to capture the essence of this show perfectly. The main selling point of the quality is the character interactions. Because this anime consists of a lot of dialogues and interactions, it\u2019s important to capitalize on their social lives. Thankfully, Cloverworks knew what it was doing as it draws out human emotions of the various characters. Characters such as Mai, Kaede, Tomoe, and even Sakuta are firm examples of this during more of their emotional moments. The visual quality also stays consistent throughout the duration of the run without relying on it too much. Bravo CloverWorks, you\u2019ve made quite an impression this year already. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song \u201cKimi no Sei\u201d is perhaps one of the catchiest ones for its usage of lyrics and delivery. It contains a variety of characters and while it\u2019s not anything too unique, it captures the surreal-like feeling of the show. There\u2019s even Mai in her iconic bunny outfit. Additionally, there are interchanging ED theme songs performed by the various voice actresses of the characters. Each of them follows their respective arc but all of them earned my praise for their consistent delivery. \\n\\n\r\nThis show may have a long title but it only took me a short time to accept what it really is. The amount of social psychology content made the story flow on many levels with each arc. Almost every character in the end felt important for the overall themes of the series. And while I can\u2019t say Bunny Girl Senpai may be recommendable for anyone, I\u2019d definitely giving this a try if you\u2019re thirsty for meaningful character relationships and dialogues. It\u2019s not a Bakemonogatari 2.0 and in fact, I\u2019d say Bunny Girl Senpai is much more appealing than what it appears to be.",

They are not the generic characters you see in most as they are quite interesting and hopefully shouldn't disappoint you at all. As the show go on, you'll find some relatable content and perhaps afew times make a weird noise that sounds like HNNG. \\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, if you like romance and good character interactions like I do, you'll definitely enjoy and have a fun time watching Bunny Girl.",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai/Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is a light novel adaption. And like many light novel adaptations, it's a rather uninspired attempt to sell more copies of the source. And it's possibly as bad as Cloverworks last badly made project Persona 5 The Animation. The Opening is objectively the worst Opening I've seen this year, consisting people running, poorly edited out of context pictures of the heroines, horribly blended in CGI, lifeless backgrounds. Which is actually a good indicator for what the show actually is.\r\nA self inset ball of snark has monotone banterwith main heroine and becomes popular among teens. Is a quote that can also be used to describe, The Monogatari Series, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Oregairu, Hyouka as well as a few other popular shows. However where those shows had strong writing, visual direction, or well thought out characters to work with, it becomes obvious that Bunny girl is just a weak imitation. Even this could be forgiven if it weren't for the standard animation, lazy background art, terrible CGI and half-assed scene transitions that plague this show. I've heard people saying that they haven't noticed these issues but I'd ask them if they were being too focused on the subs to notice what's actually happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst anime I've seen so far this season. Don't get me wrong this does have strong emotional moments. But you need to ask yourself if a few emotional highs are worth trudging the anime through.\\n\\n\r\nAs a finishing note I'll just leave an example of how this anime copies a far better show poorly.\\n\\n\r\nMai's backstory is a complete parallel of Hitagi from the Monogatari Series. Only difference is Hitagi's made sense.\\n\\n\r\nBoth have abusive mothers but while Mai's mother is just a lazy asshole, Hitagi's mother turned abusive because she got roped into a cult. Their breaking points happened when Mai was forced to do a swimsuit scene and Hitagi almost got raped. The interesting bit in monogatari is that Hitagi's mom got into the cult because it \"helped cure\" Hitagi in a prior incident. This complicates their relationship. Meanwhile Mai's mom is just an asshole.\\n\\n\r\nBoth girls instantly fall in love with their saviors. However in Bunny girl this is played lazily as possible Her savior is her romantic interest and the show pretty much forces them into a relationship instantly. Though they have good banter. Similarly Hitagi also has good banter with her Savior. Except Monogatari puts more thought into the actual concept. Instead of Hitagi being stuck into a relationship with the first person who showed her kindness and all problems being solved instantly, she doesn't end up with Kaiki. Instead she actually learns to deal with her problems and moves on.\\n\\n\r\nBunny girl senpai took Hitagi's entire character arc and just made it bland. And this is just what the show does with everything.",

            "content": "\"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\", which I'll be referring to from here on out as just Bunny Girl, is a light novel romance with a a snarky, perceptive male protagonist and a cold, standoffish (at least at first) lead girl. If this sounds familiar--it should! Early viewers have drawn comparisons to the Monogatari series, and despite being competent all around, with a talented voice cast and above-average production values, this, like many recent light novels, feels like a Bakemonogatari stripped of much of what made Bakemonogatari fundamentally interesting. While I'm not necessarily asking for SHAFT-style visuals, Bunny Girl's artstyle, especially its backgrounds, are bland as generally expected from an A-1 offshoot studio--the same residential Tokyo setting seen a million times before without any special touches. The voice acting is generally flat but passable.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Bunny Girl is strongest is in the relationship between Sakurajima Mai and Azusagawa Sakuta. I may have been unfair in describing the pair as an ersatz Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi, because despite surface similarities they're not entirely copies of each other, and their dynamic is enjoyable--indeed, by far the best aspect of the show--for its own reasons. Rather than a single laugh-out-loud punchline, the back-and-forth banter was, while still not up to par with better-written series like Monogatari, generally enjoyable, particularly Mai. Still, at the end of the day it feels like a rather conventional tale of a tsundere-ish girl slowly opening up to the \"relatable\" protagonist who is so helpful and always knows better--who, while more memorable than the average harem MC, is still a bit too much of a bland self-insert specifically targeting the sort of disaffected teenager who think he has it all figured it out, suggesting a target audience of angsty teenage boys (like most light novels). He's reminiscent of other light novel protagonists like Kyon and the aforementioned Araragi, yet lacks the depth or genuine character flaws that make those characters more endearing. As of the fourth episode, Mai is also becoming an increasingly less interesting character and more conventional tsundere (leaning more on \"dere\"). Also notably irksome is that this anime, like many other pseudo-intellectual light novels, introduces and then butchers the concept of Schrodinger's Cat using the designated exposition girl, something that I plan to treat as a red flag from now on.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, which I had completed at the time of this review, covers the main character meeting a mysterious girl who walks around in a bunny suit to no visible reaction from bystanders. He discovers through talking to her that she was a former child actress who has since struggled with a mysterious \"adolescent illness\"--a supernatural element which sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise entirely \"normal\" setting (IMO this would have worked better if the show had a greater supernatural element instead of applying pseudo-scientific explanations to the adolescent syndrome)--that makes the vast majority of people unable to see her, even her mother. This problem is solved in a predictable way that will appeal to the easily-manipulated, but the first arc's conclusion, despite being paced well and having no time for \"will they or won't they\" drama, was predictable and not in a good way. While I think there are enough positive elements of this anime to make later arcs salvageable, I struggle to find it much better than average in almost any regard. (The titular bunny suit, by the way, only shows up in a single episode and is retired after that, which I admittedly found to be a bit of a disappointment because she looked great in it).\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nArt 4/10\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n",

            "content": "The amount of high scoring reviews for this anime blew my mind, so much so that it drove me to writing my first review on this site. While yes, only 3 episodes have aired at the time of me writing this review, my main problems with this show will surely not change since the show would look entirely different if that were to happen. Before I start, warning there might be some slight spoilers for the first 3 episodes.\r\nA lot of people are comparing this anime to Bakemonogatari or the Monogatari series in general and while I can sort of see the comparisons with the2 main characters and the fact that there's a lot of talking, what makes Monogatari great is severely lacking in this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only solid aspect of this show. Our MC and his close friends are the only ones who can see or remember who Bunny Girl and MC and Bunny Girl fall in love yada yada. It's fine as a story but there are some plotholes/questionable events which can possibly be cleared up in future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where 'Bunny Girl' starts getting very lackluster. If you want to make a story that is heavily based on dialogue, then you better have some amazing art and sound or I might as well have just read the damn source material. Everything from the setting to the animation to the character design is so boring and uninspired it's just uninteresting to look at. The sound does not help either as it being just boring light piano music is just as boring and uninspired as the art. Please take the time to just go and listen to any great soundtrack(Monogatari Series, Cowboy Bebop etc.) and then listen to the Bunny Girl OST and see how boring and bad it is in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWe have all seen the characters in this anime before. Our MC is just a normal anime dude who has brown hair instead of black hair, which is fairly common but nothing out of the ordinary. Our 'Bunny Girl' is just your standard anime black hair girl except she has a bunny hair clip. The other characters so far are nearly irrelevant. Our MC's friends are basically just there to confirm Bunny Girl actually exists and he's not crazy. Scientist lady is also there to conveniently explain some things..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\" is, in short, wasted potential. If this show was done without a small budget and time constraints it could genuinely be a great anime, but right now what we have is a rushed show with nearly nothing redeemable outside of the story filled with question marks and plotholes. This is anime is the epitome of mediocrity and probably as close to a standard anime you can get. Go watch something genuinely amazing instead, it's a better use of your time.\\n",

            "content": "The fall 18 anime season was great. Compare to the unfortunate lacklustre Summer 18 anime season it was the season that gave us back to back great titles that I consider anime of the year material such as theses following anime.\r\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime aka the best Isekai anime I have seen in a while.\r\nGolden Kamuy S2 A fantastic continuation to an already great series that has well-written characters and a strong narrative.\r\nBoarding School Juliet: a nice portrayal of Romeo and Juliet in a school setting.\r\nBloom Into You the best Yuri I have ever seen since Simoun.\r\nYeah the fall 18 seasondid a couple of sinkers popular stinkers like Tokyo Ghoul re: S2 and Goblin Slayer as well as a few anime seasonal shovelware that no one cares about but compare to the summer 18 season theses sinkers didn't stand out that much as all of them with the possibility of Goblin Slayer ended up being thrown in the seasonal anime scrapyard where they will be left to root until the end of time. While the sinkers from the fall 18 decided to begs their knees for forgiveness for sucking there was one anime from fall 18 season that mysteriously bunny hoped every single anime from this season to victory.\\n\r\nThat anime is Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai done by Studio Cloverworks and no surprise this anime ended up being my favourite anime of the season thanks to its great use of witty dialogue, nicely written characters, well executed supernatural elements and beautiful visuals.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows our male lead named Sakuta Azusagawa whose life takes a turn for the unexpected when he meets teenage actress Mai Sakurajima after she wanders into a public library while dressed in a sexy bunny suit and realizes only he can see her. Mai admits she has taken a hiatus from her acting duties and has been attempting to live a normal life, but people are unable to see her, except for Sakuta, who is no stranger to this phenomenon, which he calls \"Adolescence Syndrome.\" Sakuta decides to solve this mystery while continuing to get closer to Mai and meeting other girls who suffer from Adolescence Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the story of Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai. It may not be the best story of 2018, but it's one of the more intriguing of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that made Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai interesting, is that the show is the dilemma that characters are facing don't have a black and white conclusion. For example at the end of the Mai arc, she goes back to being an actress but part-time balancing school road. If this was in any other show than Mai would have only chosen one opinion while completely giving up the other for example giving up her school life in favour of being a full-time actress. This alone element alone gives a lot of life lessons to the viewer where it teachers opinion c can happen if you simply make it happen. On top of that, this element really makes you empathize with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part about Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, is the unique use of witty dialogue. Most dialogue in anime these days is there strictly for exposition or telling crappy jokes but Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, is very clever in the way it uses is dialogue. Sakuta witty dialogue is way more complex than most would imagine where instead of Sakuta telling of what he feels but does it in these little one-liners and they are actually intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl, is very good for the most part thought at times the series slows down quite a bit in the middle portion of the series.\\n\r\nThe mystery elements were nicely down as it perfectly plays with the themes of the series which I won't mention all that much in this review due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I close the story part of the review I want to talk about the misconception about Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai.\\n\r\nThe misconception about Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, was how people wrote it off as poor man's Monogatari Series. Well after watching this show I can definitely say it's not. Yes, it may be similar in terms of structures where the protagonist would have to deal with set problems for set girl for set character girl arc other than that series its own thing. Furthermore, this series is more accessible compared to the Monogatari Series as you don't need to watch a big chunk of episodes especially when not all the entries in the Monogatari Series are consistently good. For every Owargatari and Monogatari Series 2nd season there's Nisemonogatari and a Koyomimonogatari aka the not consistently good Monogatari entries in the franchise.\\n\r\nOverall I thought the story was great and intriguing.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters is where Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, starts to shine as they not only nicely written but they are all interesting in their own ways.\\n\r\nIf I had to choose the best male lead of 2018, it would be Sakuta Azusagawa. On first glance, he may appear as this boring light novel protagonist that we all seen before however during the first episode he completely separates himself from the other boring light novel protagonist as he's not only a very intriguing character who loves to pull witty dialogue with his excellent one-liners but simply a flawed character who has a tragic background which caused him to have these large scars on his chest. On first glance, he may appear as this boring light novel protagonist that we all seen before however during the first episode he completely separates himself from the other boring light novel protagonist as he's not only a very intriguing character who loves to pull witty dialogue with his excellent one-liners but simply a flawed character who has a tragic background which caused him to have these large scars on his chest. Great character.\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character this show is without the question is Mai Sakurajima and no she's not my favourite character because of her sexy bunny outfit. She's a famous child actress turned actor. She develops puberty syndrome and starts disappearing from reality until nobody in the world apart from our protagonist Sakuta can see her. This really makes her isolated towards the world as no one in the world could see her existence in the world and we the viewer slowly get to fill her pain of isolation.\\n\r\nThe best part about Mai is outside of her character development she's not a typical walking tsundere.The other characters in Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl, are also very good Some of them of the characters, may be hit or miss depending on your tastes overall but they all great character development. \\n\r\nEven I have a soft spot for Tsundere as a whole it was a refreshing sight to see a main female character in the show to be a total whine girl towards the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl, are also very good Some of them of the characters may be hit or miss depending on your tastes overall but they all great character development. \\n\r\nOverall the characters in Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, were very good, and it's easily the show biggest strength by a long shot.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nCompared to Persona 5 the Animation and Darling in the Franxx the visuals in Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is simply beautiful.\\n\r\nSome would say that Violet Evergarden and Hanebado!\\n\r\nare better-looking shows than Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai visually however unlike those two shows this show actually has substance as the show visuals have a perfect blend in the show great writing and dialogue.\\n\r\nThe characters designs were amazing and appealing to look at they are very drawn to the eye.\\n\r\nThe use of a flat colour palette for character and background designs were simply outstanding as not only it going to a realistic style of balance out the supernatural elements but makes the setting of Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai feel alive and modern. This is easily the best-looking anime from fall 18 season.\\n\r\nThe same thing can be said for actual itself as it had fluid character movement, nicely done background animation for the most part and great facial expressions.\\n\r\nThe only slight complaint I had with the visuals it would be some use of CGI for the background characters thought it's nowhere near as bad as the dreadful CGI students in Cloverworks previous work Persona 5 the Animation.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nSo far I have been praising Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai but I feel it's time to talk about the weakest part of Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai and that is the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to say right now the music is Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is not means bad in fact I think the soundtrack is pretty solid overall with its a nice use of light smooth piano pieces that were played in the anime. The problem the soundtrack is that is not only being pretty forgetful for the most part but I thought the music direction was a bit mismanaged where you think that light smooth piano pieces would play in key moments but they, unfortunately, don't.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme Kimi no Sei by the peggies is a pretty catchy song and while it wasnt the best anime opening of the season it was still a fun opening theme.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Fukashigi no Carte is easily one of the best ending themes of 2018. Not only the song itself is beautifully calming to the ear but the way they constantly changed the Seiyuu who voiced one of the main female characters in every two episodes. Plus I really loved how each version of the ending theme uses a different colour palette for the background scenery, for example, the background beach scenery in the in the Mai Version is a blended mix of orange and red while the background beach scenery for the Nodoka version is all in yellow. This is a detail that I wish anime would use more often as it gives set more of an identity and purpose.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately from the time of Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, hasn't got an English dub thought you can expect a quality dub for Aniplex sometime in the future.\\n\r\nHowever despite the lack of dub the sub is very good and well acted.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, is simply brilliant. While it did have a couple of small shortcomings during its bunny hopping journey the characters themes the visuals and dialogue completely make it up. If you're looking for a good slice of life romance anime that had dealt with supernatural elements in a grounded way than I recommend Rascal Does, not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai.\\n\r\nFinal score 9/10",

            "content": "I consider myself diverse in what i have watched in my anime life. This, is simply amazing.\r\nThe cover art and the synopsis do not fully explain what is happening here. This Anime has hit the top of my list and it is going to be really hard to knock it off.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is great, incredibly intriguing and as far as I am concerned. I have never seen a primes quite like this one. It is not your typical romantic comedy as these two become very close very quickly. The struggles they go through are realistic ones for the most part and it sheds a reallygood light on the modern day struggles that a lot of kids that age have to go through. It's some fantasy and romance combined into one but what really makes it so good is the relationship between the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are perfect for the two roles. The faults they do have are covered up by how incredibly clever they both are and the interactions between the two are absolute gold. Every interaction between pretty much every single character in this show is amazing. It fits perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue:\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is absolutely the best part of this anime. All the characters seem to be incredibly clever and none are afraid to say exactly what they are thinking. It is on the level of what you would see in Monogatari without all of the choppiness. The writing so incredibly intriguing that the most obsolete interactions between characters are made interesting or funny and even if you are a great reader of subtitles, you will inevitably have to rewind to make sure you got exactly what they said down. Its all pure Gold, that's all i can say.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNothing incredibly special with the art, although it is good and perfect for the show. Nothing really stands out. The only real problem with the visuals is some of the dialogue moves so quickly it\u2019s hard to get a good look at some of the art. The bunny suit is a nice touch though i won\u2019t complain about that :)\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nThe music fit very well into the show. The OP gets you into a good mindset for what your about to watch and the translation of the OP is quite funny and seems to fit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIn a season where three of my favorite anime have gotten new life, Fairy Tail, SAO, and Index, this show completely overshadowed all three in my opinion. If you like romance, fantasy and mystery, as well as great characters, you should definitely check this one out. I loved this show more and more with every episode and the ending was almost perfect. I will say that if they do a dub, I don't think it will do the dialogue justice so, keep that in mind.",

            "content": "\u201cI don't mind if I only had one person, even if the entire world hated me, I could keep living if that person needed me\u201d - Azusagawa Sakuta.\r\nBefore trying it, I was not expecting much by just looking at the name, synopsis and the cover art. I was expecting a typical ecchi rom-com harem with cliches and whole lots of fanservice, but as soon as I finished the first episode I knew I was in for a treat. \r\nRascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is extremely interesting and it's just... good. It's refreshing to see an anime with this potential, good story writingand character dialogue. The anime has a great balance between romance comedy and the touch of supernatural things. The show has great direction and it\u2019s taking a smooth path while having a great pace. I\u2019m not really a fan of rom-coms due to their predictable outcomes, cliches and how they leave the emotion reveal to the end. Said this, I can say Bunny Girl Senpai differs from most rom-coms I\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n\r\n\u25fc\ufe0f Story: 8/10 \u25fc\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nSo far, the story is extremely entertaining and immersive. It instantly gets you hooked and you can't stop watching. I guarantee you will eat the first arc (the first 3 episodes) in no time. The story starts by introducing the main character, Sakuta and his younger sister Kaede, which both have suffered from the \u201cAdolescence/Puberty Syndrome\u201d, a syndrome that affects teens and makes them experience supernatural phenomenons caused by the social pressure or the person's instability. These symptoms include getting random cuts from the pain of being bullied online, altering time or people not being able to see you due to the fact that they forgot about you, which is the case of our main girl, Mai. Sakura meets Mai at a library by noticing that she is wearing a bunny suit, but it seems that no one can see her but himself. Sakuta knows that she might be suffering from Puberty Syndrome and decides to help her. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery and supernatural side of the story is added in a superb way and makes it even better to watch. Once the first arc finishes another one just as interesting as the first one begins. I really like the \"Puberty Syndrome\" thing they have, it's consistent and explained really well; while also adding the touch of enigma and makes every character who suffers from it unique. The way they add scientific thoughts and use it explain the manifestations of this syndrome is just pleasing to watch, and it gives the surreal symptoms the characters are suffering from a logical and scientific explanation.  In just the first few episodes you get to know the background of the main characters and get to see how the other's are, you get to like them very fast. Also, despite so many events occur in one episode, it never feels rushed or too fast for the watcher to enjoy. So far, the story is great and it lets you waiting for the next. \\n\\n\r\n\u25fc\ufe0f Characters: 9/10 \u25fc\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is one of the best factors this show has, they're all written in a very unique and interesting way, and it\u2019s by far my favorite thing about this anime; which isn\u2019t a surprise considering the writer of it is the man behind the other good notable shows \u201cThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou\u201d and \u201cJust Because!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Sakuta, is a straightforward, awkward and honest guy who doesn't give in for the cliches. He\u2019s definitely not the typical dense character you will find in rom-coms. He doesn\u2019t or care about the opinions and if he likes something, he'll say it. Moreover, he's very mature at handling situations, yet being sarcastic and has an impeccable sense of humor. Sakuta will tell the other characters what they need to hear, whether it's good or bad, which is a key factor for the story to keep progressing and prevent annoying rom-com-like misunderstandings we all hate. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the female protagonist, Mai. Mai is a serious girl who was a very famous actress at her time. She is older than Sakuta, which leads to her sometimes trying to tease him, ending up in some hilarious interactions between the both of them due to Sakuta\u2019s pure honesty, which causes Mai to get flustered. The dialogue is delightful and satisfying, especially the one with Mai and Sakura, they banter with each other back and forth. They both connect to each other without saying all the details and they're each other's balance, it's like they both are on the same wave length. The chemistry between all the characters is shown with the top notch writing and dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nThe other character we\u2019re introduced in the second arc is Tomoe Koga, a first year who met Sakuta in a pretty hilarious way. She was a country girl with no friends that moved to the city. She\u2019s excessively self conscious and lives for others opinions about her. Koga, does everything she can to get her friend\u2019s approval and cares about simple things that might affect her status such as not being the last one to talk in the groups or being the first one to log off. Her character can become relatable due to current society caring too much about social media and other\u2019s opinions.\\n\\n\r\nWe haven't yet seen much of character development for the other characters apart from the main ones and some side ones, but I'm sure they will explain each character's background and personalities further (more than they already have).  Each character is unique, interesting and likeable \\n\\n\r\n\u25fc\ufe0f Art: 7/10 \u25fc\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good but not outstanding. I like the way everything is drawn and colored and I don't have any complains towards it. The animation expresses the emotions of the character\u2019s very effectively, and the pauses and movement of them are perfect for each particular scene. \\n\\n\r\n\u25fc\ufe0f Sound: 7/10 \u25fc\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nThe intro and ending songs of this anime are wonderful. The intro is a great song that gets you pumped and it's very catchy. However, it\u2019s slightly louder than all of the other audio in the episode but it's not a big deal. Now, the ending... The ending song is just perfect, by far the best one this season in my opinion. The ending's vocals vary on which girl the episode was centered in, the first 3 being voiced by Mai's voice actress and the ones after that by the actress of Koga. The ending song is a chill jazz-like tune that gives me these relaxing vibes, I'm in love with it. The music and sounds during the episodes are good too, they improve the scene\u2019s emotions and creates impact when it\u2019s needed to. \\n\\n\r\n\u25fc\ufe0f Enjoyment: 10/10 \u25fc\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nAs you could probably tell from this review, I absolutely love this anime so far and I've been recommending it to all my friends and people who ask me about it. This anime gives me a reason to be excited for the middle of the week and watching the episodes is amazing. When you watch an episode you get so consumed and engaged to the story that time literally flies, the episodes seem so short and you barely notice when it\u2019s going to end until you\u2019re greeted by the amazing ending song. The episodes are so good that you have to rewatch it at least once, and it leaves you craving for the next one. \\n\\n\r\n\u25fc\ufe0f Overall:  9/10 \u25fc\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nThis is by far one of my favorite animes this season and I definitely recommend giving it a go. As I previously mentioned, Bunny Girl Senpai diverges from the typical rom-coms. I\u2019m immensely excited to see how the story develops and what other cases of \u201cPuberty Syndrome\u201d we get to see. If you're like me and just jumped right in not expecting much due to the title and the first impressions you got, this anime will surprise you, in a very good way. \\n\\n\r\nI'll keep updating this review as the series progresses. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cI don't mind if I only had one person. Even if the whole world hated me, I could keep living if that person needed me.\u201d -Sakuta Azusagawa\r\nIncredible. Absolutely frickin' incredible.\r\nThere is no doubt at all I enjoyed the heck out of Bunny Girl Senpai. Bunny Girl Senpai has so much to offer, whether it is an interesting story, likeable characters, captivating dialogue, sad moments, or just laughs. It is also really refreshing as it goes against many of your generic high school, romcom anime tropes to create an overall very enjoyable take on the genre as a whole. I am aware that Bunny Girl Senpaimight have some flaws, but, for my own sake, I managed to look past those just so I would be able to have a better time watching it. Despite the title and cover art, this is NOT about bunny girls! I repeat: this is NOT about bunny girls! Like anyone who has not read the novels prior to the airing of Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai or \u201cBunny Girl Senpai\u201d for short, I too have fallen for the biggest clickbait of this anime season. However, I was not the least bit disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n[spoilers ahead]\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe plot of Bunny Girl Senpai follows our main protagonist Sukuta Azusagawa the \u201cButa Yarou\u201d as he encounters several girls who all suffer from \u201cpuberty syndrome.\u201d This fictional ailment is recognized as various supernatural phenomenon being associated with the different common challenges faced by teenagers. I thought this device was ingeniously used as an analogy to develop a more interesting storyline by characterizing the mental and social struggles the characters face with physical manifestation. For instance, upperclassman Mai Sakurajima, the poster girl of the series, meets Sakuta one day in a library wearing a bunny girl costume; hence, the title of the series. The purpose of dressing up as a bunny girl is to test if other can see her as she develops invisibility and her existence gradually fades from the memory of others due to her stress of being a famous model and her desire not be as known publicly. Despite all odds, Sakuta manages to rescue Mai in a way that would only suit him. While he was doing this, I couldn't help but cheer him on from like I would cheer on a Saturday morning cartoon hero as a kid. Go Sakuta! Rio Futaba, a classmate Sakuta often seeks for advice about puberty syndrome and explanations in terms of quantum physics, attributes Mai\u2019s case to Schr\u00f6dinger's cat since everyone but Sakuta failed to \u201clook in the box\u201d for Mai. I personally am not an expert on quantum physics myself, but I still did find Futaba\u2019s justifications for the supernatural occurrences fascinating throughout the various character arcs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe chemistry (*looks at Futaba brewing coffee*) of the cast is undoubtedly my favorite aspect of the show. Sakuta deviates uniquely from the typical male lead of this genre by having blatantly no concern for what others think about him and being extremely candid including when making perverted remarks. I oftentimes find Sakuta\u2019s remarks hilarious since they are not only very well-timed, but also demonstrate his mastery of sarcasm for the sake of joking around. In addition, I actually really like that Sakuta is not portrayed as a classic optimist as he himself shows that he is not a fan of clich\u00e9s either. This is exemplified in one of the best moments in the show when he tells Futaba \u201cIt\u2019s all right if you hate yourself\u201d and \u201cLiving with such as positive attitude is so exhausting,\u201d comforting her with his honesty and prompting Futaba to resolve her crisis. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Sakuta genuinely does care for all of those around him as he goes above and beyond to helps them all through their struggles. Mai, *ahem* the best girl *ahem*, lives up to being Sakuta\u2019s girlfriend by not only tolerating Sakuta\u2019s straightforwardness, but also reciprocating with her own witty remarks to produce immensely engaging exchange of banter between the two. It was very interesting to watch Mai grow to trust and rely on someone like Sakuta. Even when he gets further involved with the other girls with puberty syndrome, it is highly satisfying that the romance between the two is still maintained. Underclassman Tomoe Koga\u2019s adolescence syndrome originated from her desire to fit in with her peers and had the ability, attributed to Laplace\u2019s Demon, to create simulated futures that may be rewound back in time if she did not desire the outcome. Since Sakuta\u2019s younger sister Kaede also suffered from social pressures, he sympathized with Koga to the extent that he would pretend to be her boyfriend while teasing her frequently, much to the audience\u2019s entertainment (canned peaches lol). Koga\u2019s story was enjoyable since it is the first of many arcs that were based on a more relatable difficulty during adolescence. Due to quantum teleportation, Futaba split into two versions of herself that were a result of the dichotomy between her wanting attention, but not using her body to do so. It was exceptionally touching to witness Futaba as a stoic introvert being able to properly acknowledge her own feelings with Sakuta's guidance. Nodoka Toyohama, Mai\u2019s half-sister, switched bodies with Mai as a result of Nodoka\u2019s envy of Mai\u2019s success. Sakuta again makes an inspirational effort to help others by alleviating Nadoka from her inferiority complex. At first glance, Kaede appears to just be a comedic, reclusive imouto that happened to experience puberty syndrome; however, it is revealed that her condition is much more complicated. With the help of her Onii-chan~, Kaede makes tremendous progress toward being able to go outside in her wholesome, powerful attempt to reintegrate with the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAlthough relatively recently establish, CloverWorks has done a pretty good job animating the few series I have watched from them. The animation is consistently good throughout the series as facial expressions and body gestures are effectively used well in portraying emotions or personalities. The opening and ending songs are especially nicely animated to capture the tone of the respective songs.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n\u201cKimi no Sei\u201d by the peggies is a very exciting like many other openings and overall pretty catchy song. It was also interesting to see how small details were incorporated into the visuals like the titles of all of the novels being shuffled through. \"Fukashigi no Carte\u201d is, in my opinion, one of the best ending songs this season. It is quite creative that the vocals are performed individually for each one of the girls during their own story arc along with a change in visuals. The lyrics to both pieces were also great. The soundtrack is works well in conveying the appropriate emotions and give more meaning to certain scenes. The voice acting is also superb in communicating the intended personalities of the characters and bringing them to life, especially Sakuta played by Kaito Ishikawa. Fun fact: This is the same seiyu that plays Iida from Boku no Hero Academia and Kageyama from Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBesides all the other points I made, I also really loved this show for the sheer entertainment value it provided. Each and every week I would look forward to the Wednesday evenings when I could catch another episode of Bunny Girl Senpai. And, man, it would feel like such a quick ~24 minutes every time. Although some might say may this shares similarities with other series, I still feel the uniqueness of it that allows me to enjoy it. I understand that others may not enjoy that this series resembles the Monogatari series; however, I still thoroughly enjoyed both since they both excelled at story telling and character development while one or the other still did well with other respective aspect. As a result, I do not see this necessarily as a \"rip-off\" but possible more of an \"inspired work.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf this series taught me anything, it is to not judge a book by its cover. After the last episode, I am going to miss this show, but I am still really looking forward to the upcoming movie about Shoko, the next focal character. Bunny Girl Senpai has cemented itself as one of my favorite anime of all time and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy thoughts are a hundred times more lewd than what you\u2019re imagining.\u201d -Sakuta Azusagawa",

            "content": "This is my first review and as such won't be as refined but some things I'd like to point out about this show. I liked it.\r\nStory: 9 - Art: 8 - Sound: 8 - Character: 9 - Enjoyment: 10 - Overall: 10\r\nI was looking forward to the fall season with how many anticipated shows were airing, this was one of those shows that originally flew under the radar as the title and cover didn't exactly catch my interest at first, but after noticing the positive traction that this show gained over the first two weeks decided to watch the first 3 episodes and was quitefrankly astounded.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have quite the depth, fleshed and well-thought out over the series and is recognizable through their seemingly 'realistic' display of emotions and expressions. They had their own motives and with Sakuta, your main protagonist who appears to have an unending flow of quirkiness is a delight to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAs to why some consider Sakuta a Gary Stu I'll never understand. It's safe to say pretty much any character who has a sort of internal delema could not be one. The daily problems that he faces, trying to find the meaning of his life, constantly seeking his friends for some quantum mechanic doohickey counseling and the respect and recognition he gets from his classmates. If he's happy with his life doesn't mean that its perfect in every way. Not everything works out for our boy.\\n\\n\r\nI'd have to say the art and sound are above your typical high school rom-com show, although there is some slight degradation as we go further however improves well in the end. The opening is catchy and well designed, and even included some of the novel titles that appear to be shuffling around. The ending has the really nice tone and sung be the main girl of their respective arc which is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't go to say that this show is overrated, considering that the initial reputation and hype was not exactly up there, but it was enjoyable and a refreshing take on the boy meets girl in high school and gets together and other girls get in on the action.\\n",

            "content": "Wow. Now that it's over, I've got a lot to talk about. This show was one of the best ones to air this year, and it's got a lot to back it up. Everything from the opening to the character arcs shows that there was a lot of care and effort put into this show.\r\nStory: Seishun Buta Yarou follows an arc formula, with you following a certain character through the perspective of the main character, Sakuta. He goes around trying to explain and uncover the reasons as to why certain characters experience \"puberty syndrome\", which can probably be seen as a hidden want that thecharacters desire due to anxiety, stress, etc. The idea may seem a bit far-fetched, but it does end up creating character arcs that highlight how one character acts, thinks, and how they really are deep down. This system allows for great flow from one episode to the next, only being interrupted when the show has to switch from one character to the next. This fluidity allows for the events to feel natural, and not just because the show has dates strewn through the transitions. They aren't just put in for decoration, because they allow for a sense of realism as you can properly see that these arcs aren't done in a day. They're done throughout weeks, maybe even months.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art, actually, is pretty standard. It has some scenes that do shine, but it's mostly just something accompanying the story and wouldn't be what people watch the show for. However, that's not to say that the art is bad. It's just that it doesn't stand out in particular... except for Futaba's thighs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Wow, besides the obvious \"voice actors did their parts really well!\", the things I want to highlight are the music and actually the voice actor on Sakuta especially at the end of the show. The music fits into the situations nicely, and the opening is just catchy as hell. The ending is much more mellow, feeling a bit like mellow jazz. It really shines as the ending theme just feels right to be added at the end of each episode, kind of like a calming factor. It's quiet, mellow, and starts off in 6/8. What's not to love? Anyways, with the last episode (no spoilers!), Sakuta's voice actor really shines through in capturing the pain that Sakuta's experiencing throughout the first half of the episode, and it really shows that lots of effort and care was put into every aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The show gives us charming and loveable characters that are given a substantial amount of development throughout their arcs. You find out everyone's wants, needs, desires, etc., and this all shapes their character as you also get to discover who the character really is later into their arcs. For 13 episodes, you can find the same amount of development that may be seen in a 2 cour, mostly because they get straight into the development rather than delaying to explain the plot for the episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: After the first episode, I was intrigued by the premise of the show. I watched after the third episode had aired and I was told that the show was completely different from what its description had led most people to believe. This was one of the best decisions I made when it came to watching anime, and I don't regret it. Every episode has its charm, and every arc has a purpose. That can't be said for most shows now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really like this show. It's got intriguing story, great music, amazing character for a 1 cour show, and it's extremely enjoyable. Art-wise, I felt it lacking a little, but as it's not the main focus, it can't lower the score dramatically like most would do. If you were on the fence originally, I highly advise you to at least watch the first 2 episodes at a minimum. It's an experience that could be in the running for anime of the year, even if we do have giants like MHA and JoJo that will surely get lots of recognition.",

Perhaps one of the few flaws of the anime is that the first and last arcs are so good that they make others look worse, but they are not. In fact each of the situations that this great protagonist (perhaps one of the best) Sakuta is placed, you can already expect the best and funniest dialogues of all time. The characters are few, but they are extremely charismatic, each with its own developmentsthat flow through the anime making it very difficult to get tired of the dynamics. Visual is very beautiful, especially in more emotional scenes, the music is very good, especially the opening and ending. Bunny Girl is an anime highly recommended for those who like engaging dialogues with a protagonist who escapes from clich\u00e9s and who likes fun and emotional situations with adolescents at puberty.",

The music helped every situation feel refreshing and not only that but the character dynamic was amazing between every character. Just watching them talking to each other was enough to fill me with joy. Each arc of the show did not fail to impress after just watching three episodes I felt that the show could've ended and not only left a good impression but also leave viewers hoping for more. Not only that but the romantic development even though it mayhave stagnated it never felt like it was forced. Lastly the theme of this show was one that felt that many could relate to especially with the logic of social norms, this show presents the effects that social norms have on people. Hopefully this gives you an insight on this amazing anime.",

THIS IS TRASHHHHH!. I will beg you if you have seen the title and the display picture and are about to click away from this show. Don't. You will regret it.\r\n            The show follows Sakuta, a second year highschool kid.The show follows him and how the mysterious puberty syndrome effects him and those around him and how he will stop it. First off all let me just say that the show is very enjoyable when taken at face value, but every time I finished an arc I had to sit back and really think about and digest what I had just seen so I could really understand what it meant. Every arc has something to say about growing up and life in general. Espicially the last one.\\n\\n\r\n            The characters in this show are also amazing. Each character starts off as a cliche anime character and through their arcs gets developed into interesting and enthralling characters that we can relate to.\\n\\n\r\n            The shows ending is left without a proper conclusion as there is a movie coming out that will end the series.\\n\\n\r\n             The art and sound in this series is the one place where the show is average. It's not god awful but it's certainly nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\n            However the average production is not enough to drag this show down from what I believe is a perfect score of 10/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: WATCH THIS SHOWWWWW!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna save you the pain and say just stop reading these reviews. Most are triggered Monogatari fans who think this show steals everything. While I haven't seen any of the Monogatari series, I don't see this as a helpful thing to mention for potential fans. \r\nThis anime is something else. I personally didn't expect much from this, maybe like a fanservicey type of drama. What I got was instead my new favourite anime of all time.\r\nThe story isn't exactly anything special, but I've never seen a take on Adolescence like this. Basically the characters each go through Adolescence syndrome, and they have to findways around it and fix their problems before things go south. Again, nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, I dare say compareable to Your Name in terms of charm and quality. Everything blends together so nicely and it is pleasing to the eye. There are some minor errors here and there but overall the art just couldn't get any better. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and EDs are fun to listen to. For each major character arc, the end themes are sung by that character with their own special lighting and mood. This was a nice touch of detail and all the voices were beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really makes this show so special. The man himself, Sakuta, isn't your average MC meant to ponder to a typical person. His snarkiness is legendary. He has his own personality and his own beliefs, he's not an empty hollow shell. Just like him, all the other characters aren't there to simply fulfill a role. They have their own problems and personalities, making them feel \"human\", as opposed to many characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to mention is the teachable moments this show offers. There is a lot of life advice here that can be used in our everyday real lives. The problems each character go through can be relayed to anyone out there who may be struggling in a similar way. I think that this level of writing, along with the characters themselves are what truly make this anime so special. This is a 10/10, nearly perfect anime.",

Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is a overall 10/10 for me. It reveals the characters and their qualities at a perfect pace and does not ever feel like the art our sounds were out of place. What really made this anime standout for me was the story. The story was not very complex so it was easy to follow and enjoy. It had a the perfect pace and was not predictable at all. I originally clickedon it because of the bunny girl but the story hooked me in like roadhog from overwatch. It could have had a little more fanservice but the amazing art made up for that. The characters were very well rounded and sometimes cliched a bit too much, but who doesn't love cliche anime from time to time (ONLY SOME SCENES.) I'm probably going to revisit this anime when the movie comes out so that's it for now.",

            "content": "Yikes. The exaggerated hatred in some of these reviews compelled me to write one. This may not be the best anime created but it\u2019s pretty damn good. Also, this anime is not Monogatari and is not meant to be compared to Monogatari. Monogatari is not the better version of this show. Believe it or not, not everyone likes pedophiles as MCs. \r\nMoving on, Bunny Girl Senpai is a show that tries to tackle a variety of issues associated with puberty (I would say the issues go beyond just puberty though). Sakuta is our protagonist, a smart-ass pervert of a loner who encounters different instances ofAdolescence Syndrome, which is a syndrome that pretty much manifests whatever the problem the person is going through in a supernatural way. There is a lot of pseudoscience bullshit here, but it didn\u2019t affect my enjoyment of the show, because pseudoscience bullshit is pretty much the norm for these type of shows. Each arc deals with a different case of Adolescence Syndrome, usually taking 3 episodes for the resolution of each arc. I will say that the show does not reach the highs of the first arc again, which I found amazing, but each arc was quality in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nNow what\u2019s to like about this show? For one, the banter between Mai and Sakuta is enjoyable, as well as the fact that they act naturally around each other. You won\u2019t find the romance stagnant like other anime shows where it takes the MC 300 episodes to be around the girl he likes without squeaking like an idiot. That\u2019s a plus in my book. Two, the show does not shy away from tackling topics such as bullying, the sexualization of minors and girls, insecurity in maintaining friends, terrible parents, etc; and for the most part, it tries to do it in a genuine way. Can the progress and development of the characters feel a bit forced at times? Absolutely, but I never felt like things were rushed to the point of being absurd. Which bring us to three, the characters. Yes, I won\u2019t deny that the characters (Mainly Futaba) can seem like vehicles for the issue that the writer is intending on focusing on, but they have enough of their own personality that I found them distinct enough to actually give a damn about them during their arcs. I even shed a tear or two in some parts, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this show is generic, but it does it job. Not much to say about it. The soundtrack is solid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this a great anime. I definitely recommend it.\\n",

Honestly only even started this cause I wanted to see even more of what Cloverworks had before The Promised Neverland. But holy cow am I glad I did. \r\nFantastic show in all regards. I don't think there's a single overt, glaring issue with this show. don't even think I'm exaggerating. Maybe a little but still like come on. It's really incredible. Feels like Oregairu and Sakurasou before it. A sophisticated look at young love. done right and with maturity. Treating these youngadults as such and not comedic fodder. The whole cast is kept small and intimate while showing us depth to each one of them. \\n\\n\r\nThis show did such a good job of translating the seemingly complicated idea of Puberty Syndrome into something that made sense over the multiple arcs and made us care for the new focal female character. Each arc had me reeling and getting pretty emotional each time. The writing and character work are truly commendable. Sakuta and his snark really helped set him more apart than most of his contemporaries. Mai and her take no shit attitude was refreshing as well. Their bond was the heart this show needed. \\n\\n\r\nthis is undoubtedly one of the years best. A must see for drama and romance fans. Astounding.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. \u2764\u2764\ud83d\udc30.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nBased off a popular light novel of the same name Seishun Buta Yarou Wa Bunny Girl Sempai No Yume Wo Minai which is better known by its English title Rascal Does not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai is a romance, comedy, supernatural and school genre anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a teenageboy who always approached his life with cynicism due to his bad rep that came about due to the intervention of a supernatural event that only he and his family had encountered were to meet not just one but a series of girls that are suffering from the same syndrome that has changed the life of not just him but his family as well. A condition that goes by the name of Puberty syndrome that according to rumors is caused by a teenager\u2019s sensitivity to the many issues that transpire during this period of their life and the sense of instability that can come about from experiencing them. While animes that make use of supernatural themes that combine them with other genres like romance isn\u2019t itself rare within the field of anime the premise for Rascal is one that can be said to be rather unique as while allowing the mc Sakuta to encounter many different girls whose unique problems are the cause of their syndromes rather than make use of abilities that would allow them to solve them in one go the series instead takes the opposite approach and takes a more methodical approach as it allows us to see the whole process of how the origin of the problem is identified and how Sakuta helps the girl gradually overcome the struggles that come with it and eventually freeing her from it. This approach I felt was rather unique as in addition to the other genre\u2019s it also added in a sense of mystery to the series as to help each girl Sakuta and co had to get to know them as individuals and slowly piece together each clue that they find as they try to figure out what the problem is. This act of combining the act of solving a mystery with character development I felt was interesting and was one of the main reasons that drew me to watch this anime. The first episode of the series while doing a great job at introducing the series main setting and characters also did well In showing the peculiar effects that Puberty syndrome can cause to the people that suffer from it and proved intriguing enough that I would watch this series to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series takes place within the modern day within the confines of Kanagawa prefecture and follows the life of Sakuta Azusagawa a second-year high school student who attends the local Minegahara High school. Sakuta whose life has been adversely affected by a traumatic event in the past that not only ensured that he has few friends but also be labeled by others within the school as a delinquent that is to be avoided at all costs. While out wandering the local library Sakuta has a seemingly supernatural encounter with a high school girl that\u2019s dressed in the rather eye-catching outfit of a bunny girl. But despite this enchanting attire, Sakuta is the only one that is able to see her much to the surprise of both. Seeing this the girl introduces herself to him introducing herself as none other than Mai Sakurajima a popular actress and idol that is on hiatus. Mai astounded that she has finally been able to find someone that is able to see her reveals to Sakuta the reason for her attire which is to determine whether anyone else but her can see herself because for some reason she has seemingly become not just invisible to others physically but also mentally as well. As Sakuta listens to Mai\u2019s problem he starts to realize the similarity that this has with the problems that had so affected his family in the past and as a result of this curiosity decides to help her find out the true cause of this problem while at the same time trying to determine what the underlying cause for these problems are. Along the way, while helping Mai try to figure out and overcome the underlying problems that are causing her invisibility Sakuta also starts to encounter an increasing number of girls who not only are experiencing similar effects to Mai but are also having these adversely affect their lives much like it had for Sakuta in the past. Sakuta while loathe to help others finds himself unable to stop himself from trying to help them overcome the problems that caused them to develop such a condition perhaps out of a desire to save them or maybe to prove to himself and others that the condition that caused so much change to his life was not fake and was in fact real. Whichever the reason one things for certain for Sakuta\u2019s seemingly average life as a high school student is able to become much more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSakuta Azusagawa \\n\\n\r\nSakuta Azusagawa portrayed by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Gate and Owari No Seraph game is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year student that attends the local high school Sakuta from initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, calm and collected person by nature that seemingly approaches his life with a degree of cynicism that\u2019s rarely seen among people his age. Despite this cynical nature of his and his seemingly laid-back attitude Sakuta is someone that can be seen to be intelligent, understanding and earnest and can be surprisingly perceptive as well. While Sakuta\u2019s laid-back attitude can often give people the impression that he\u2019s not giving his best at things and is a bad trait of his the opposite is instead true. Sakuta\u2019s laid-back nature while often giving people the wrong impression of him can be seen to be something of a time skipper for Sakuta that reflects his true personality for while appearing to be laid back beneath this nature of his Sakuta is in fact a particularly sharp person that thanks to his perceptive skills is able to offer surprisingly sharp comments that while bypassing traditional conversational convention gets straight to the heart of the matter. This desire to get to the heart of a matter without wasting precious time in pointless chatter can be said to be one of the hallmarks of Sakuta\u2019s personality. As a result of both his cynicism and a result of his past at the beginning of the series Sakuta was widely seen as someone to be avoided and while not lacking in friends he had precious few people that he can trust outside of them. This lack of bonds with his peers and the sense of isolation that he got from them soon caused Sakuta to develop a sense of caution that he applies to his everyday life which is shown in the fact that he is not willing to trust someone\u2019s word at face value and always strives to find everything that he can about something before making a decision something that will put him in good stead as the series goes on. However, despite Sakuta\u2019s determination to live a low key life that avoids all the types of drama that life can throw at you it can be seen that he is someone that cares deeply about his friends and indeed is someone that cannot avoid helping those that are in obvious trouble despite the bother that this would have caused him which is showed in his attempts to help not only Mai but each of the girls that he encounters throughout the series and showing that despite his nature he is someone that is helpful, honest and determined to help people until their problems are solved. A prominent trait of Sakuta\u2019s that comes about as a result of his cynical nature is the fact that he is able to crack off random jokes and witty comments at will something that I felt was not just interesting but also aid in taking off some of the tension that comes about as Sakuta and Mai encounter the various situations that impact not just them but also their friends as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Sakuta\u2019s character is expanded upon Sakuta\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series largely due to the isolation that he gets subjected to by his peers Sakuta was someone that treated bonds and relationships with others somewhat cautiously as if always expecting the worst to happen in them. While shown to be very loyal to his friends Sakuta was however shown to be wary of strangers and was unwilling to trust them until they proved that their request was genuine. However, once he is satisfied that their requests were genuine and that they really needed help Sakuta\u2019s attitude would change from that of wariness to one that would be determined to help them solve their problems. This aspect of his character is shown best in how he decided to help Mai in her quest to solve the mystery that caused her to become invisible to society. Thought Mai while somewhat famous was still someone that was largely a stranger to him Sakuta not only worked hard to determine what was the underlying cause behind the problem but also worked hard to determine the conditions that would allow it to be solved. This shows that despite his loner like attitude Sakuta is someone that cares deeply about the plight of others and would do all he can to help those people that he had managed to bond with and understand something that is shown to a degree in all the relationships that he ends up forging as the series goes on. Despite his determined nature that would suggest that Sakuta would prefer to solve situations with brash decisions Sakuta is someone that can be surprisingly considerate of the needs of others and is willing to make short-term sacrifices that while potentially causing him trouble also allows him to get to the best possible deal out of a given situation in the long term a trait that is shown well in the relationship that he establishes with Mai within the series and the steps that he takes to make that relationship a success. This side of Sakuta that showed that beneath his quiet and brash nature lay someone that was willing to make short-term sacrifices in exchange for securing a better overall outcome I thought was one that suited Sakuta well and did well to both contrast his character while adding more depth to him. The character of Sakuta I felt was an interesting one whose attitude to life and to bonds in general contrasted well with the care that he can display towards his friends as well as the lengths to which he will go to help those that are in need. While his cynicism and his witty comebacks and jokes may sound out of place at times, I felt that these served well to balance out the many tense situations that can result from the various problems that he meets over the course of the series. At the same time, I felt that his innate nature also served well to enable him to become a balancer of sorts within the series where he can provide logical questions and answers to Mai that not only expand the plot but also stop them from making rash decisions. \\n\\n\r\nMai Sakurajima \\n\\n\r\nMai Sakurajima portrayed by veteran seiyuu Asami Seto of Tokyo Ghoul and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A third-year student that attends the same high school as Sakuta Mai in her initial appearances is seen to be a quiet and direct person by nature that while polite and considerate to others had a curious tendency to maintain a distance from her classmates. As a result of this loner like attitude Mai in the beginning of the series while a relatively well-known person within the school due to her fame as an actress was someone that was followed by many nasty comments and rumors that came about as a result of her late entry into school and her skip to senior year which ensured that despite her fame she was largely seen as an outsider by her peers. As a result of this, it's perhaps unsurprising that this would lead Mai to adopt an attitude that ensured that she was wary of any person that approached her. However, despite this wariness of outsiders, she was not averse to bonding with people that have shown themselves worthy of her trust as shown in the interaction that she had with Sakuta that proved to be the spark that started their bond. Once with friends that she can trust however it can be seen that beneath her icy nature Mai is someone that\u2019s intelligent, perceptive, responsible and understanding by nature. Despite gaining perhaps the first friend since she entered high school it can be seen that she still values the sense of freedom that she gets from being a loner. However, it can be seen that rather than push people away as she would have in the past the friendship that she has established with Sakuta has opened her eyes somewhat to the advantages that having friends can bring to her life and while more accepting of this fact doesn\u2019t stop her from expressing a somewhat playful attitude in reaction to Sakuta\u2019s attempts to integrate her into society. While the effects of Mai\u2019s friendship with Sakuta did well in dispelling the initial distrust that Mai had towards friendship it also had the effect of improving the view that she had towards school as well as Mai as the series went on no longer viewed it as something to be avoided and instead approached it with a seriousness and diligence that matched well with her position as a senior. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Mai\u2019s personality is gradually revealed and expanded upon it can be seen that Mai\u2019s invisibility problem is something that is borne out of the many struggles that she has with living the dual life of being both a student and a celebrity. While certainly enjoying the fame and the fortune that comes from being an actress and the fact that she through her actions can bring happiness to the many fans that support her it can be seen that this also caused within Mai a sense of unease as while loving the world that showbiz offers her this also created a belief within her that she was merely living under the terms that were set by her mother and was nothing more than a tool for her. As a result of this belief which not only caused Mai\u2019s relationship with her mother to break down but also caused her to view her life as an actress to be nothing more than a manufactured personality that did not reflect her true self this created a struggle within Mai that proved to be the catalyst that started her crisis while at the same time leading her to meet someone that would truly change her life. Though at first viewing the fact that was invisible to everyone with some degree of amusement this was soon replaced by a deep fear as Mai began to realize that if it got worst, she would not only be forgotten as an actress but also as a person as well. As a result of this fear Mai began to realize that more than anything the bonds that she has established with her friends is something that she rather than trying to avoid should instead learn to embrace as while her career as an actress may be important to her this pales in comparison that outside of that Mai\u2019s real persona actually no one that she can rely on and help her when she needed it the most. Due to this Mai\u2019s bond with Sakuta gradually began to improve as she was able to witness firsthand the kind of efforts that he put in to help her despite how weak their bonds were. While improving the relationship that she had with Sakuta this act of friendship also opened Mai\u2019s eyes to the fact that while her career as an actress was indeed one that was created by her mother the love of showbiz and the life that came with it was not fake and indeed was something that she genuinely loved and that if she wanted to overcome the inner struggle that was causing her crisis she must learn to embrace the fact that while grateful to her mother for building her career Mai must learn to walk her own path in life. As a result of this life-changing experience, Mai in the aftermath of this crisis began to gradually change her attitude toward life. While still quiet Mai gradually becomes much more talkative and more willing to take the initiative in her interactions with Sakuta which is best shown in the fact that she openly chides him and teases him often which while doing well in shredding the last of her loner like attitudes away also shows the gradual change of their relationship from friendship to romance. Though working hard in the aftermath to rebuild her career into the life that she wants to live Mai also takes great care to treasure every moment that she spends with her beloved despite the inexperience that both have in the art of romance. This development in their bonds I felt while certainly welcome was one that I felt represented well the kind of lessons that Mai learned from her interaction with Sakuta and her determination to live the life that she rather than her mother wants. \\n\\n\r\nTomoe Koga \\n\\n\r\nTomoe Koga portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Beatless and Asterisk Wars fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is the main heroine of her respective arc within the series. A first-year student that attends the same school as Sakuta and Mai Tomoe at the beginning of the series from initial appearances is seen to be a kind, caring and quiet person by nature that tries to approach each day with cheerfulness. A friendly, teasing and intelligent person by nature Tomoe while possessing traits that would usually have ensured that she possess healthy levels of self-confidence within her is shown instead to be someone that gets flustered and embarrassed quite easily and indeed is someone that can be seen to be sensitive to the moods of her friends as well as the latest trends that they are going through at the moment. While obviously loyal to her friends it can be seen that this rather than being loyalty is more along the lines of reliance on them. Despite the ease in which Tomoe can become embarrassed it can be seen rather amusingly that she\u2019s brave enough to argue with others over the simplest of things and while these arguments are rarely serious ones, they are still ones that do well in providing a sense of amusement to the series. One of the best examples of this was the argument that took place between her and Sakuta during their first date when they argued with each other via text messages. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and more of Tomoe\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that interestingly despite Tomoe\u2019s perceived sense of popularity within the school and the number of friends that she can call upon to help her when she needs it the sense of pride that should come back as a result is not present. Rather than a sense of pride, it can be seen that beneath her kind and caring nature Tomoe is someone that too is wrestling with a deep fear of what will happen if all of her friends would forget her. While Tomoe\u2019s surface personality of being a kind and caring person is indeed genuine it can be seen that the importance that she places on the forging of friendships and bonds with others and her need to not just fit in but also maintain that level of relationship borders on a sense of desperation that is rarely seen among schoolgirls. As Tomoe\u2019s past and the pain that she suffered in the past is gradually revealed it can be seen that this sense of desperation to both forge friendships and maintain bonds with her friends is a result of her desire to not relive the pain and sense of isolation that she had not just experienced but grew to fear when she was in middle school. A condition that reminded Sakuta well of the time that his sister Kaede experienced the same level of pain that came about due to the outbreak of puberty syndrome within her when she was in middle school and contributed greatly to his decision to help her. At the beginning of the series, Tomoe\u2019s first impression of Sakuta was not a positive one as she saw him as not just lacking in terms of romance matters but also somewhat rude due to his direct nature as well. At the same time, she often found himself quarreling with him for the simplest of reasons which gave her endless levels of frustration. However, despite this over time Tomoe\u2019s friendship with Sakuta began to improve as a result of the fact that for the first time she was able to forge a friendship with someone that knew not just the number of inner struggles that she was hiding beneath the surface but at the same time provide her with a sense of bluntness that provided a calming effect that made her realize that he would never betray the friendship that has been forged between them. As a result of this Tomoe\u2019s personality gradually began to level out and while still retaining the kind and caring personality traits that define her she also comes to realize that true friends are those that you are able to be honest to with in all things and that no matter how well she tries to fit in as long as secrets remain your friends will still maintain a distance between you and them. While losing much of the desperation that was most prominent about her character it can be seen rather amusingly that she still retained the wittiness that truly made her character stand out something that I was really glad to see as this was the perfect counter to Sakuta\u2019s cynical nature and their little quarrels are always amusing to see. The character of Tomoe I felt was an interesting one whose underlying core struggle I felt was well done and contrasted well with not just her personality but also reflected upon one of the core issues that high school girls her age could suffer from if they moved from one location to the next to attend the next level of school as they progressed in their education. \\n\\n\r\nRio Futaba \\n\\n\r\nRio Futaba portrayed by veteran seiyuu Atsumi Tanezaki of Owari No Seraph fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is the main heroine of her respective arc within the series. A second year student that attends the same high school as Sakuta Futaba along with Sakuta\u2019s friend Yuma can be said to be the only true friends that the former had within the school until Mai came along thanks to the fact that they were classmates that went through the first year of high school together. From her initial appearance, Futaba is seen to be curious, intelligent and logical person by nature that prefers to believe in solid facts before making any kind of assumption. This belief in trusting actual evidence versus believing in something that cannot be substantiated such as supernatural events resonates well with the fact that she\u2019s a member of the school\u2019s science club a role that\u2019s further enhanced by the lab coat and glasses that she wears that reinforces the image that she\u2019s not just an intelligent girl but one that acts as the voice of logic and intelligence within the series. True to her role as someone that believes firmly in logic Futaba is someone that is calm, attentive and composed by nature and while largely remaining indifferent to both the interactions that she has with Sakuta and the many problems that he brings to her she also doesn\u2019t display any sense of frustration at him for bringing them to her. This shows that while she may view the problems that are brought to her as troublesome, she still views it as a challenge that was brought to her by a trusted friend and while difficult to see it can be seen that Futaba likes the fact that she will be of some assistance to someone that can be said to be her closest friend.  A good indication of this sense of friendship that she has with Sakuta is the witty comebacks that she exchanges with him every time he brings her a new problem. However, despite being a realist and despite having a background in science Futaba was seen to be someone that didn\u2019t behave like a normal science-minded person. While Futaba is someone that tries hard to come up with deductions on the various problems that she is presented by Sakuta with logic that is based off the knowledge and data that she has to hand it can be seen that surprisingly she is someone that\u2019s capable of branching out and thinking outside of the box when things make no logical sense something that I felt was quite surprising for her. At the same time while regarded as someone that had both looks and intelligence within the school it can be seen that Futaba didn\u2019t treat others that may be less intelligent than her any differently and would take great care to explain to them how she got to a particular deduction in a precise and easily understood manner showing that beneath her indifferent nature Futaba was also someone that was considerate. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and more of Futaba\u2019s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that she also has many struggles that she seemingly hides beneath her surface personality. Despite possessing both looks and intelligence it can be seen that Futaba rather than embracing these qualities of hers that would have ensured that she has no shortage of friends instead does the opposite of adopting instead the path of a loner that while giving her peace of mind also ensures that she has few friends. While seemingly content with the solitude that comes from being a loner and the small circle of friends that are centered around Sakuta and Yuma who can be said to be her closest friends it can be seen that this is far from the truth. While it can be said that Futaba does enjoy the time that she is able to spend with her friends both in helping them in solving the many problems that can come from living as a teenager and in solving the problems that Sakuta brings to her it can be seen that beneath this Futaba actually has a secret fear that one day both of these dear friends will eventually leave her and make her alone again. This sense of fear that she got from the thought that one day she will be alone once more when used in combination with the sense of inferiority that she feels about her body soon caused within Futaba a split in her personality that manifested itself in a very science like way. At the beginning of the crisis, Futaba while certainly curious about the split persona and the reason that led to its creation was largely tolerant about it and indeed seemed to view it with a degree of amusement. However, as the crisis deepened this sense of amusement began to fade and was replaced by an increasing sense of fear due to the actions of the persona that showed the hidden feelings that she had for so long been hiding from her friends. However while certainly fearful of the effects that this would have on her life Futaba began to gradually realize that this manifestation of her hidden feelings was no one\u2019s fault but her own for if she had been more willing to accept the hidden feelings and fears that she had then maybe she would not just have more friends but also be able to live a high school life that was full of laughter and fun times with her friends instead of being secluded in a science lab every lunchtime with nothing but the beakers to keep her company. In the aftermath of the crisis Futaba while largely retaining her core personality traits of being a rational, intelligent and curious person began to show a more positive attitude to life and began to show more of her feelings openly rather than conceal them as she did in the past. At the same time Futaba while still far from securing dozens of new friends begins making gradual attempts to expand her circle of friends which is shown in the fact that she managed to establish a surprising friendship with Mai in the aftermath. While accepting the fact that while its true that Sakuta and Yuma may indeed leave her in the future until that day arrives, she would ensure that she will enjoy thoroughly the time that she can spend with her two best friends. The character of Futaba I felt was an interesting character whose core struggle and the evolution of her character reflected well on one of the deepest fears that high school students would develop as they approach their senior years. I felt that Futaba\u2019s gradual evolution from someone that kept much of her fears and true feelings hidden while trying to enjoy each day with her friends to someone that was not just more open with her feelings but also more willing to expand her circle of friends was well done and showed just how much she had learned from her previous error and how much she wants to remedy it by enjoying the time left to her in high school.  \\n\\n\r\nNodoka Toyohama \\n\\n\r\nNodoka Toyohama portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Yamada and the Seven Witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is the heroine of her respective arc within the series. A teenage idol and a member of the popular Idol group Sweet Bullet Nodoka from initial appearances is seen to be a confident, prideful and competitive person by nature that while showing well the qualities that idols may be expected to display makes Nodoka a difficult person to get to know personally. True to her career as an idol Nodoka is someone that is seen to be intelligent and fast thinking and while showing some curious attitudes towards her career as an idol is seen to love the role and works hard to fulfill the many roles that are assigned to her in that field. Despite the flashy looks that Nodoka possesses that would otherwise suggest that she will be a difficult person to get to know it can be seen that rather the opposite is true. While certainly, a prideful and competitive person by nature Nodoka was also someone that was both perceptive and understanding skills that while useful to an idol also do well in allowing her to see the true reason for someone\u2019s actions. This within the series is shown well in the relationship that she establishes with Sakuta as while the two of the them did not have the best of first impressions their relationship gradually improved as a result of Nodoka seeing and understanding the depth of love that he feels for her half-sister Mai.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Nodoka\u2019s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that despite Nodoka\u2019s positive and cheerful nature she also has many struggles that she keeps from both her family and from her half-sister Mai someone that she not only idolizes but respects greatly. In the beginning, while shown to be someone that idolized her half-sister it can be seen that despite the positive attitude that she has towards her that Nodoka actually conceals a sense of resentment towards Mai that created within her an inferiority complex that expanded every time she saw one of Mai\u2019s performances. While Nadoka knows very well that despite all the efforts that she puts into as an idol she will never be able to get close to Mai at the beginning of the series she was seemingly content with this glad to be at least able to carve out her own place within the entertainment field that was free from both her mother and Mai. However as the crisis that involved both her and Mai deepened and after seeing the effects that Mai had in her attempts to keep the situation between them a secret from the media this attitude of remaining content gradually began to vanish and instead be replaced by a sense of open resentment of Mai and a belief that no matter how much she did she is still unnecessary in the larger scheme of things a belief that was also fueled by the large number of feelings that she had bottled within her. However in the aftermath of not just discovering that the main reason for her sense of resentment was fake and after realizing that rather than being seen as a rival Mai was instead treating her like an actual sister this sense of resentment began to vanish and be replaced by both a genuine sense of gratitude and a new sense of determination to prove to not just Mai but to everyone that supported her as well that she will be able to make her own mark on the entertainment field as well. The character of Nodoka I felt was an interesting that demonstrated well the kind of challenges that can come from having a sibling whose career is continuously being compared to yours as you progress in life and the challenges that it can cause to both the mental state and the physical state of one\u2019s mind and the view to which they view their jobs. The evolution of Nodoka from someone that while appearing to support and idolize Mai was secretly hiding her resentment of the fact that she was always being seen as second fiddle to Mai to someone that realized that her resentment towards her was not just misplaced but also the fact that Mai never saw her as an outsider and instead saw her as family I felt was well done and demonstrated well that no matter the fame that one can secure and the distance it causes between siblings it cannot suppress the bonds that are forged between family members.  \\n\\n\r\nKaede \\n\\n\r\nKaede Azusagawa portrayed by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of Youkoso and High School Fleet fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is the heroine of her respective arc within the series. A middle school student and Sakuta\u2019s younger sister that lives with him Kaede from initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, curious and positive person by nature that was shown to have a deep bond with her brother. While curious Kaede was also shown to be rather prone to making misunderstandings which is best shown when she meets Mai for the first time. In the beginning of the series as a result of a serious bullying event that caused her to experience a rather traumatic event in the past Kaede largely stayed at home and indeed stayed away from all aspects of society whether its phones, internet, and tv instead opting to spend most of her time either with her cat or with her brother. As a result of this lifestyle, Kaede in the beginning was shown to be extremely wary of outsiders and would get spooked quite easily despite the attempts by both Sakuta and the visitors to calm her. As a result of this fear Kaede was shown to have a heavy reliance on her brother and indeed from looking at the relationship that exists between them it can be deduced that to Kaede her brother is akin to her emotional foundation as it is only with his support can Kaede continue to exist within the world after the trauma that she went through when she was younger. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and Kaede\u2019s personality and past is revealed her personality gradually starts to change. While noted at the beginning of the series to be someone that was both wary of others and at the same time someone that got scared of others easily as the series goes on this aspect of her personality begins to gradually change. As a result of being both the younger sister of Sakuta as well as the fact that she lives with him as well Kaede throughout the series had the opportunity to meet many of the girls that Sakuta had met over the course of the series and witnessed first hand both the types of struggles that each girl was going through as well as their determined attempts to overcome the problems that had not just constrained them but also caused them much hardship whether physically and emotionally something that Kaede had also encountered in the past and can easily relate to. As a result of seeing these girls work so hard to overcome the problems that were bothering them Kaede also began to realize that while she too may have problems that have also caused her great emotional pain unlike these girls she was not only taking no steps to overcome them but was also dragging down her dear brother and stopping him from enjoying the life that he wanted with Mai. As a result of this realization Kaede while still wary and scared of others as before gradually tried to take steps to both overcome not just her fear of strangers but also strive to not only become independent of her brother but also take the first steps in her journey to reintegrate back into society. While the journey itself was anything but easy Kaede as she embarked on her journey of reintegrating herself back into society began to show marked improvements to her personality that showed well the fruits of the labors that her determination to succeed had managed to awaken. While still a quiet girl Kaede\u2019s attitude toward others began to gradually improve and though still wary of strangers towards those that she knows well like Mai she is able to converse with normally and is able to bond well as well. At the same time while still wary of electronic items that would allow her to talk to others directly Kaede rather than be scared and avoid it every time it rings as she had done in the past at least tries to try to answer it. Arguably the best example of Kaede\u2019s attempt to integrate herself back into society is her creation of a wish diary that as the name implies contains the wishes of the items that she wants to be able to do herself as proof of her attempt to integrate herself back into society. While most of these wishes are simple matters to Kaede they are far more than that as to her they are akin to giant hurdles that she must learn to surmount if she wants to be able to overcome the trauma that had for so long held her back. One of the most important wishes within the wish book is without a doubt the wish that stated clearly that she wanted to go to school. To Kaede, this was perhaps her most important but at the same time, her hardest wish for it was her time at middle school that was the main origin point for the trauma that had so changed her life. However conversely the school can also be said to be the final hurdle that she must overcome if she was to overcome her trauma and accomplish her goal. The wish book concept I felt was an interesting idea for while it showed the many wishes that Kaede wanted to accomplish it also had the effect of showing the depths of her Kaede\u2019s determination to not just accomplish these goals but by doing so be able to take her first steps into integrating herself back into society, as a result I felt it was a perfect complement to Kaede\u2019s character. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Kaede I felt was an interesting one and her core struggle of a bullying incident that caused her to not just lose her memories of the events but cause an entirely new personality to not just be created but replace her default one was a surprising move. At the same time, I felt that linking Kaede\u2019s social anxiety which is a result of the trauma that she suffered in school with the bullying was interesting as while social anxiety has many different causes bullying in a school setting is by far the most common cause. The effects by the cast and by Kaede herself to overcome her trauma within the series was an aspect that I thought was done really well with her determination to take the first steps out of her apartment and her attempts to go to school despite the trauma being especially well done and was something that was both heartwarming and something that resonated well within my heart because the pain from bullying is something that I have also suffered as well. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I thought that the series animation was something that was really well done within the series being not just bright and rich in variety but also relatively clear as well. This aspect of the animation also served well to showcase not just the main setting of the Kanagawa prefecture but also served to enhance its beauty to the viewer. The various locations that were featured within the series I thought was not just well animated but also featured a great deal of variety to them as well. While these locations were relatively simple ones that wouldn\u2019t be out of place within any city, I thought that this simplicity was actually an advantage of the series as these locations were both relevant to high school students that serve as the series main cast and at the same time resonating with the series main theme of social problems that are being experienced by teenagers. The character designs for the series main and support cast I thought was something that was done really well as while each was unique, I felt that they reflected well on the social status that each character adhered too within the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme for the series which was Kimi No Sei that was performed by the Peggies and Fukashigi no Carte. The ending theme of Fukashigi No Carte is rather notable in this case as while the lyrics for the song remain the same the ending theme is sung by the seiyuu\u2019s that portray the heroines for their respective arcs when the series start their respective arcs. This aspect of the series I felt was interesting as while it allowed the seiyuu\u2019s themselves to show off their vocal talent it also highlighted the fact that their respective heroine was the current heroine within the story. Both the opening and ending themes I felt were excellent ones that while catchy gave me contrasting impressions on them with the former giving me a sense of excitement as if drawing me in an adventure while the latter had a relaxing feel to it that gave the impression that the adventure was now over and that it was time to relax until the next one starts. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned roles within the series whether these were main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Kaito Ishikawa, Asami Seto, Nao Touyama, Atsumi Tanezaki, Maaya Uchida and Yurika Kubo deserve special praise as I felt that they all did a fantastic job in portraying the characters of Sakuta, Mai, Tomoe, Futaba, Nodoka and Kaede respectively. While she didn\u2019t have a large role within the series, I felt that Inori Minase also did well in portraying the character of Shoko a character that proved vital across several arcs within the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai was an interesting anime that I really enjoyed and is arguably one of the best animes that aired this anime season. In my opinion its main strengths that allowed it to truly stand out in my eyes was its interesting premise, interesting and well thought out story, well designed and developed characters and a skillful combination of creative social problems and story arcs that made great use of the series main theme of the unique pressure and struggles that teenagers struggle with within society. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the series I felt was definitely one of the highlights of the series and while at first it may appear to be a standard school-based romance story that would allow Sakuta and Mai to become an eventual couple this simple idea soon collapsed as the series went on to expand the plot by introducing the main problem that each of the characters struggle with which is the puberty syndrome. Perhaps more than anyone within society teenagers are particularly vulnerable to sudden changes to not just society itself but also to how society sees them as well largely due to the fact that they are at an age where they are starting to take their first steps into a place that until now was largely unknown to them which is society. While most teenagers would gladly laugh off such pressures and focus on the chief advantages that being a teen gives you such as taking it easy and falling in love with the girl of your dreams not all problems can be dealt with this way. For as free as society can appear to be there are also many problems that can cause others great pain through even the simplest of offhand comments and beliefs pain that if left unchecked can cause even larger problems. Even in a free society, not all problems can be revealed to others in confidence as society can often be unforgiving on those that speak of problems that can be considered impossible as Sakuta and the main cast found out. Faced with the potential display of ridicule, distrust and the potential rise of nasty rumors the sufferers only choice is to bury their problems inside them and hide it from society as they live out their lives until either it's forgotten or it surfaces in a most unexpected manner. Puberty syndrome while a fictional affliction was an idea that I felt made great use of the social aspect of the theme as while showing the kind of physical effects that it can cause to those that suffer from it the affection also allowed the visualization of some of the more common problems that not only exists within society but ones that society often has a hand in causing whether intentionally or not. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story that made use of such an interesting premise and theme I felt was another of the series main highlights. While animes that make use of multiple story arcs within the overall plot are by no means rare I felt that Rascal\u2019s overall plot was rather special in that while it made use of five main story arcs that correspond to each of the volumes that the series covers the story arcs themselves never seem to be a series of short stories as I have experienced in the past. This is due to the fact that each story arc within the series rather than being a stand-alone adventure that served as a detour for the main plot is instead very much part of the main plot and while the individual events of those arcs are rarely mentioned the fact that they are mentioned at all helps reinforce the fact that while Sakuta\u2019s journey of helping the girls may have been hard it was one that not only allowed him to gain new friends but also break them out of the struggle that society was putting them under. Something that not only helped Sakuta develop as a character but also allow the girls to not just do the same but allow them to show the fruits of their labor outside of their respective arc. Each of the story arcs that were featured within the series as well as the heroines that acted as the arcs central focus I felt was really well done as each of the problems that they face not only matched the heroines social status but also showed the many unique problems that can come from both their feelings towards their status as well as societies view on them as well. These problems I felt while relatively simple ones were paired well with both the unique themes that each arc made use of and the unique feelings and circumstances that each heroine possessed that led them to become a victim of the puberty syndrome until Sakuta came along. The manner of how Sakuta and co-managed to solve the core struggles that each of the heroines were burdened with I felt was interesting as rather than being an outsider Sakuta was someone who had been in their shoes and as a result knew full well the kind of pain that can come from not having anyone believe your story. Seeing Sakuta not just try to understand and bond with each of the heroines as a person but also try to understand their core struggle and the circumstances that led to it before embarking on an attempt to solve it was something that I really enjoyed seeing as Sakuta despite having no reason to actually help the girls with their problems not only decides to do so but in the process not just help the girls solve their problems but also in the process overturn the dire reputation  that society has labeled him with by forming not just bonds but also friendships with the girls as well. In a way it can be said that the shared sense of pain that Sakuta and each of the girls had suffered as a result of the struggle that they went through as a result of contracting Puberty syndrome while a hard journey also allowed them to realize that while society can indeed be a hard place to live in they now realize that they are no longer alone in their struggle for through their shared pain they have found the one thing that they can always rely on when trying to live their lives and take the first steps into society. \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai was an interesting anime that provided us with the opportunity to look into not just the kind of struggles that teenagers can experience within society but also the kind of pain that some aspects of society can have on the fragile mind of the next generation. The combination of its use of a real life but often neglected aspect of society which is the effects that the pressures of society can have on the fragile minds of teenagers and the use of the supernatural, romance and mystery genre\u2019s while seemingly unwieldy at first glance I felt proved to be not just a unexpectedly potent combination that worked surprisingly well together but also provided a solid foundation that allowed us to see not just the kind of struggles that can exist within the teenagers that live within society but also the kind of trauma and circumstances that can lead to their formation. At the same time, this combination of genres also allowed us to understand not just the kind of negative feelings that result from such trauma but also appreciate the kind of positive feelings and actions that are needed to overcome it. As a final score I would say that Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai easily deserves a final score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mid Series Review - This is a review written after watching 7 episodes of this amazingly well crafted series. This review contains plot spoilers and some amount of constructive criticism.\r\nStory- To start of when i first saw this anime's cover art i expected it be one of those extremely cliche ecchi anime but like many i was very suprised once i watched the first ten minutes of the first episode , the story is just incredibly well thought out, it keeps you immersed and suprises you in every single episode (especially in the 6th episode when sakuta returns back to the previous day again).The only criticism i have  is the concept itself the puberty syndrome feels like a large plothole like the one in orange where the time travelling letters are never explained properly it just happens.If this is explained properly in the episodes to come the story is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is stunning and perfectly suits the theme of this anime, the background constantly changes according to the situation but it always has that light heated feel especially in the scene where sakuta regains his memory of mai and rushes out of the classroom to confess his love.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound is as good as this anime looks, it just goes right along with the theme and the voice actors do a great job with portraying the characters , although the opening is kind of underwhelming compared to the ending which i personally like more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- There is only word to describe the characters brilliant , all the characters are incredibly well written especially the main character sakuta is one of the reasons I find this series as entertaining as it is. I feel that anime badass/smart guys are cliche i.e not interested in anything(girls) and always on top no matter what and are generally just unfazed no matter what the situation , but sakuta on the other feels relatable( except for the getting a hot seenpai part :p) , he just wants to be a normal person and instead of being the annoying white knight who comes to every girls rescue he just lets things play out and does his best to help each character out.i could go on for  a while because mai and futaba(science girl) are also extremely well written characters (watch episode 7 for futaba character development not your average anime nerd girl) and mai's equally hilarious comebacks to sakuta are super entertaining the more screen time the two  have together the better the anime gets.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Oregairu is one of my favorite school anime because the main character was entertaining as hell , this anime is right up there with oregairu for the same reason. Sakuta just makes this anime a delight to watch , his hilarious interactions with the other characters kicking koga(junior girl) in the butt and being taken to the police station and the best is when he tells that senior that he stepped on shit with the same shoe he kicked him with in the railway station fight scene was just hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Upto this point in the anime it is just completely entertaining and makes me  want the next episode to come out instantly because its just so good but i do hope that the upcoming episodes address the puberty syndrome properly and not let it become a major plothole , other than that would 10/10 recommend this series.    \\n\\n",

ITS AMAZING!\r\nI decided to go ahead and watch the anime without researching it or reading about it at all. At first I was skeptical when I saw that the cover was a bunny girl and that even the very title of the anime has \"Bunny Girl\" in it, but BOY I WAS WRONG! \r\nAs I was watching the first episode I got nothing but Kimi no Na wa vibes from it for some reason, even though the story has nothing to do with it as it is something that Ihave never seen before in any anime. The Art style is outstanding! (So many cute anime grills! ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) The Soundtrack, boy it  definitly has one of my favorite anime OPs this season! And the characters!... man dont get me started on them... the main characters are by far my favorite! The humor and the jokes the characters make are on point! (Something that other anime studios should learn from)\\n\r\nOverall giving it a solid 9/10. If you liked Kimi no Na wa or other Romance animes you are definitly going to love this one, so go ahead and give it a go! <3",

            "content": "Rascal Does Not Dream of a Bunny Girl Senpai at a glance can definitely be mistaken as a typical ecchi harem. The name and thumbnail picture certainly doesn't help with this. As a big fan of SNAFU my friend kept telling me to check this show out and I finally did. As of this moment only six episodes have aired and I have rewatched all of it twice. I don't regret a single moment of it. \r\nFor starters, I just want to mention Hajime Kamoshida, who is the writer for this story. He has written both Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo as well as JustBecause! which I have not watched yet. After watching this show I became in absolute awe on how well he delivers his concepts and characters. Sakurasou was one of my all time favorites, but he hits home for me once again this time with a realistic story about adolescence, environment, and unrequited love.\\n\\n\r\nAdolescence is certainly not a topic that is covered often in anime (if not at all) and although I feel like they over exaggerate the concept of adolescence a little bit, the urge to always to be liked by others and to maintain a certain status really hit home for me. This reminded me of the days of when I was in high school of how everyone seem like \"sheep\" all of which who just follow the ongoing trend of today's culture. This always has bothered me as I was one of the few kids who distanced myself from those types of people. Fortunately for me I was still able to find a group of friends I could be myself with. Bunny Girl Senpai exemplifies this concept this so well and so effectively and I applaud Hajime Kamoshida for understanding how the culture is the way it is today. As a viewer it has taught me that people can be extremely self-conscious of themselves in today's social society, and are always striving to impress others at the expense of their own true self. Meanwhile people who suffer from adolescence, loneliness, and depression can be easily forgotten about but are in a need of emotional help and support.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to touch on environment really quickly, and how it ties in with Adolescence. In Japanese culture,there is a term known as \"reading the air\". Although there is no direct translation to this from Japanese to English, it essentially is being able to figure out the general mood and atmosphere that is around you. What do people think about you? Are they thinking badly of you? Are they spreading rumors? Do they hate me? The amount of pressure from this social pressure is too much to bare for some. Some change themselves in order to fit with the rest of society, however others are too scared to even leave their front door. \\n\\n\r\nAside from this interesting plot, the characters displayed in this show is nothing short from amazing. The main characters undergo a lot depth and development all of which are logical and relatable. The passive-aggressive relationship between the main couple constantly keeps me on my toes as well as providing great comedic relief. If I could only learn the charisma of these characters, I would. \\n\r\nAs of writing this the six episodes to me divides into two character development arcs, one arc for Mai and another one for Koga. Both of them were enough to bring tears to my eyes and I am thoroughly impressed how invested I was into these characters in such a short amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nI seriously recommend re-watching this now or after it is completed. I picked up a lot after watching it the second time around. It can be a little tricky to grasp everything it is trying to throw at you, but once you understand it's concepts it is both fulfilling and rewarding. The psychological Japanese concept of \"reading the air\" and the concept of \"La Place's Demon\" made me very interested into looking more into what these terms mean. I advise you pay attention to every single dialogue there it is, as you will come out questioning both yourself, today's society, and hidden symbolic meanings.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I absolutely adore this anime. It's been a while since I felt this \"genuine\" feeling from a show and it is both original and deep. It's been one heck of a ride so far.",

            "content": "\u201cRascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\u201d does one thing very well.  That is, taking the commonly done and quite stale school drama and turns it into something much more interesting with its usage of \u2018Puberty Syndrome\u2019, a supernatural disease that visualizes the characters social issues in a more creative and engaging way.\r\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t have a lot to praise after that.\r\nOn the surface\u2014 this show, based of the title and artwork, is not what it seems. But with that being said, it doesn\u2019t make the show better than what it is.\r\nThe biggest problem is the characters. Immediately we are presented with themain character Sakuta being incredibly brash and quick witted. This makes sense at first, but the show doesn\u2019t waste any time in abusing this. Sakuta constantly comes off as fake, forced, and incredibly out of place. It was clear he was an attempt at a sort of larger than life character, but the writing utterly fails at producing this image. When you compare him to other characters in a similar situation, like Kyon from The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi, or Araragi from Monogatari, the world built around them is much more suited for the way they act. In Kyon\u2019s case, he is surrounded by complete weirdos, in every sense of the word. Him being the only normal one, the show was able to execute his \u201cstraight man\u201d behavior in a hilariously unique way. In the case of the show more compared to Bunny Girl, Monogatari, the whole world is built on the character interaction being a sort of battle for the high ground. In Bunny Girl, there is no \u2018battle for the conversational high ground\u2019. It is just Sakuta imposing his incredible wit and intelligence on everyone else, somehow always having a quote worthy response to any situation. Nobody else is like him or responds with retorts that actually live up to his. The best example is the scene where he gets into a fight with the dudes harassing Tomoe. Not only does he end up winning the fight in the most ridiculously contrived way, but he shouts out a cringey line that nobody seems to care about. The show constantly does this with him. I never cringe when watching anime. This show made me. The other girl characters are mostly just flat and forgettable. I will say that Mai is decently written, but the other girls really never get a chance to stand out in any way. They feel more as just ploys to the narrative, especially Tomoe and Nodoka. This isn\u2019t really a bad thing, but it certainly doesn\u2019t make them memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing has seen some criticism in its \u201cpretentious\u201d way of describing the Puberty Syndrome by linking it to the workings of quantum physics. I am not going to pretend like I understand quantum physics in the first place like others have, but I will say that it adds a layer of confusion that didn\u2019t need to be there in the first place. I don\u2019t really want to be lectured an extremely hard concept to grasp fully just to understand why Mai is disappearing. Even people who have praised the show called the quantum physics tie-ins B.S.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and character design is very lackluster. Sakuta and his male friend have literally the exact same haircut. The color of his hair is almost identical to Tomoe. There is a random character that looks exactly like Futaba at the end of one of the episodes. Mai and Shouko look way too similar. The school uniforms are just brown and ugly. The art in general is dull and uninspired. Just your typical stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show is alright. There are some good piano tracks, although they play one of them all the time, you probably know which one I am referring to. The OP is weird. The actual song they use is great, but the problem is the actual animation that is going on behind it. Random shots and CG crowds is not a good look. The ED is great, and the touch with having the different Seiyuu sing it was nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe experience with Bunny Girl Senpai (which the title still doesn\u2019t seemingly have any meaning) is a sort of strange one. It does things nicely, particularly the endings to each arc, but has too many downfalls to become anything more than just mediocre. I really wanted to like this more, because the setting is so easy to watch and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious that this show tries everything it can to become an instant classic, and while that is respectable, it just doesn\u2019t get the job done.\\n",

            "content": "Clicked because Sexy Bunny Girl\r\nFirst episode and I\u2019m pretty much hooked\r\nBunny Girl Senpai revolves around the theory of Adolescence Syndrome. Something related to quantum physics theories which I have some knowledge of. Therefore, I can relate the characters to oregairu, Bakemonogatari as well as the format of the anime to Steins Gate.\r\nThe male MC has a \u2018honest\u2019 characteristic in a sense that he\u2019s introverted. He doesn\u2019t care about other\u2019s thoughts about him, expresses what he feels blatantly and is \u2018ruthless\u2019 in a sense. \r\nHe is humorous, understanding and also kind deep down. He isn\u2019t like many typical high school male MCs and is extremely badassespecially his methods of communication. He just goes about telling people what he truly feels and is hella smooth with his speeches and characteristic also, to be frank none of the characters are very \u2018typical\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe female MC (new waifu Bunny Senpai) on the other hand is matured, cute and loveable.\\n\r\nShe is very different from the male MC as she on the other hand is a famous celebrity on hiatus and no one really knows anything about her.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very intriguing because it implements it\u2019s own theories like Steins Gate.\\n\r\nAdolescence Syndrome in the context of this anime explains the things we face in high school, more specifically the negative things like getting cyber bullied or having no friends and putting those mental negativity into physical negativity like getting cyber bullied and end up being injured physically.\\n\\n\r\nA spoiler example would be Bunny Girl Senpai. Her fame had begun to interrupt her life and she cannot go about anywhere without being recognised and this had left her to dream of being in a place where no one recognised her.\\n\\n\r\nThis has led her to go on hiatus from her career but slowly people began to not notice her to the point where she can\u2019t even be seen or remembered by others except the male MC as well as certain other characters (not gonna spoil)\\n\r\nAnd apparently, those characters also eventually forget her after sleeping. The theories involved were definitely misused but still somehow plotted to make sense theoretically. Bunny Girl (Sakurajima Mai) was apparently a \u2018part\u2019 of the atmosphere, put blatantly.. Unnoticeable. A strong emotion was needed to override the atmosphere, to create a reason for Mai\u2019s existence in the unconscious ignorance of others which makes up the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime carries on, with other misused but theoretically relatable theories for other incidents that happen after the Adolescence Syndrome incident. It\u2019s very intriguing and will definitely get you craving for more.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl can at times be pretty cliche but that\u2019s all part of developing the romance in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the romance in here is undeniably one of the best. It doesn\u2019t jump straight to the two MCs liking each other. The romance was matured, slow and developed. It emphasises the gaps between their characteristics and how they actually fit together perfectly, one being a rascal and the other one matured.\\n\r\nI really love seeing them together and well, don\u2019t blame me for wishing a relationship like theirs.\\n\r\nThe male MC didn\u2019t immediately force her into a relationship and took it slow. He showed her how much he cared and eventually confesses, this provided much development for their relationship and I love it. \\n\\n\r\nTheir romance then develops even more further up the anime and hell, I\u2019m so jealous of them right now :/\\n\r\nThe anime is also filled with very good development from every episode to the next and just very captivating, entertaining and good!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a hidden gem and taught me to never judge an anime by its cover.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of ABC animation / Cloverworks, the art style was great as always. Bunny Girl Senpai was hot and extremely pretty. The imouto was cute and everything fit perfectly. Bunny Girl Senpai (Mai)\u2019s character design was extremely cute and maybe abit erotic because she looks like a bunny, has a button nose and also bunny phone casing hair clip (accessories) basically and that is just lovely! The adaption was also extremely good!\\n\\n\r\nThe ED and OP fit perfectly with the animations for the ED always changing. The ED always has a different character featured, it basically features the characters the episode or arc is focusing on doing the same scene. For example the first episode involving Mai san (Bunny Girl Senpai) would show Mai san at the end credits and in other episodes, another character in the end credits if they are the main focus of the episode. Also, THE CHARACTER FEATURED IN THE ED WOULD HAVE THEIR SEIYUU (Voice Actor) SINGING THE ED OMFG!!!\\n\r\nAnd since the first episode did not really have a strict focus yet and was more of an intro, THE ED WAS SUNG BY ALL THE FEMALE MAIN CHARACTERS HOLY SHIT!!!  The concept of that is AMAZING and I loved it!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, I don\u2019t recognise the voice actors but they suit their characters to a T. Bunny Senpai has a mature tone and MC has a boring (idgaf) tone that fits with his persona and also his inner self very well.\\n\r\nThe rest were great too! Don\u2019t wanna spoil tho\\n\\n\r\nAll in all. Watch the damn anime not for the fan service but for the bunny girl - I MEAN FOR THE PLOT\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: \\n\r\nDAMN THE CLIFFHANGER, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE!\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nBest Girl\\n\r\nBest Couple \\n\r\nAnd undeniably one of the best RomCom this year! (2018)\\n\\n\r\nLuckily amongst my friends they all tryna be \u2018not mainstream\u2019 and like the other girls so I\u2019ll just secretly love Mai Sakurajima",

Now my judgement of my first thoughts of the show have just turned all the way around for me from all the anime i watched this really could be the anime of the year if not a close runner up the story is amazing and character are great just seeing them being fleshed out really with a differentarc each time they want to focus on a new character and there relation with the main character is really clean and a great way to do it. I have never found myself so invested into a show quite as interesting as \"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\" i love it so far and i cant wait to see have the shows ends with this great story so far\\n\\n\r\n- From\\n\r\nZingolen\\n\\n\r\nIG- Hentaigod.s",

            "content": "Bare in mind this review is my personal opinion and is based on the first 3 episodes of the anime and thus there's lots of potential for this opinion to change.\r\nI stumbled across this series with its standard long light novel title with a bunny girl plastered as the main image and thought I was in for a generic fanservice/moe style show with generic cardboard cut out MC getting his lucky pervert moments etcetera. I was pleasantly surprised that this isn't the case, and that it's quite the opposite with the story being more character based and quite well thought out.\r\nStory-\r\nAvoiding just giving a synopsisthe story stands out to me as a concept in general. Stumbling across an upperclassman in a bunny girl outfit in a library because she's disappearing from existence and wants to know when people can see her is one of the more bizarre brainchilds I've come across and I think thus far it's been quite fascinating, with certain scenes leaving me almost feeling shock and other emotions along with the characters. There's a strong psychological element, seeing how the different scenarios effect the characters and how they overcome each task, presented in a unique way to keep the story engaging.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\\n\r\nI believe the art for the series although not standout is of a very good quality, there's no 'spot the MC' syndrome and there's enough variance in the appearance of all characters (not just the main focused characters) whereby its obvious some effort has been put into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe quality and usage of the BGM in the show thus far I feel contributes dramatically to the whole feel and atmosphere (pardon the pun) of the show, and the lack thereof also, with ambient noise such as people speaking amongst themselves or air conditioning helping to set the scene and help viewers ground themselves in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- *incredibly minor menial spoilers here*\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are what stands out, the way our main character is introduced to us for example, as a guy who keeps his head down and believes 'fighting the atmosphere is pointless' after a negative event in his life, to then have him build as a character over the course of the next two episodes through different experiences and contradict said message and fight the aforementioned atmosphere for the sake of another. The portrayal of a side character in the girlfriend of one of his friends telling him to stay away to save her and his friend's reputation, presenting a realistic look on ostracisation in school environments. The relationship between Sakuta and Mai is a big highlight, the way they bounce off of one another with his perverted yet sarcastic sense of humour and her attempts at acting grownup and act as if it isn't an issue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nSo far I am thoroughly enjoying the show, and it's been the highlight of the season thus far personally, having me waiting with baited breath for each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise this show surprised me, I believe the psychological element of the show is fascinating and the characters are very well built, would definitely recommend.",

I almost didn't watch this show because I thought it would have been another high school ecchi romantic comedy with no backbone of a plot. I was 100% wrong and so glad it turned out differently. This show came out of nowhere and blew all expectations (at least for me) out of the water. Definitely recommend that people watch. The story is strong and the characters are stronger. You find yourself really caring for these characters and their livelihood, which isn't a rare thing tofeel for characters of a show, but I'm an emotional person and I found myself in love with them. Over time I loved being familiar with the characters and their little habits and speech patterns. It was a fun ride.",

            "content": "I am being nothing short of truthful when I say that Bunny Girl Senpai is the best anime of the fall 2018 season for me; and by that I mean the best by a very long way.\r\nI saw this anime on the list of upcoming anime around the first couple of days it was put on MAL back around the beginning of September. There was almost no information on it whatsoever. However simply by looking at the cover art for the series and the title I thought to myself that it would be the kind of anime for me to watch occasionally as a guiltypleasure. I mean the premise is a good looking girl in a bunny outfit, it only makes sense, right? But never have I so misjudged an anime before. I completely forgot that I added it to my to watch list until it suddenly popped up as a notification the day it started airing. Of course I was curious so I checked it out as intended. I also held back writing a review at first until now, when around half the episodes of the series are out. This was just to make sure I believed the series would stay consistently good. So with all that said:\\n\\n\r\nI love the series. Now as aforementioned I was curious about this anime. Over the recent few years romance has slowly crept up and become one of, if not my favourite genre of anime. So naturally seeing this as a tag for a show that looked the way it did was intriguing to me. However after watching the series you can see that the tag is very much appropriate as it is very much a romance based anime, and a good one at that. One of the biggest complaints by people in regards to many romance anime especially is the idea of an extremely dense protagonist. There are many romance anime where the protagonist is extremely dense towards the love advances of the females within the anime. I was therefore really worried about this going into the anime, given my first impressions before starting. However again, I've never been so wrong. Sakuta is one of my favourite MC's in recent times. Sakuta knows what he wants, and he goes for it. He's extremely sarcastic and I love that. As I said, Sakuta pushes for the romance he wants and he's willing to fight for it. He's a nice and caring guy, whilst giving off a sarcastic and nonchalant impression. Therefore he's an actual relatable protagonist for me. I love that, because I often dislike and can't relate to the main character. \\n\r\nIn addition to this, the other main character, Mai Sakurajima, is to the same effect. She is also equally sarcastic and nonchalant about things. This is great as it means that the conversations which often happen between the two main characters are both comedic and enjoyable. The chemistry which they both have due to this being the case is what makes their budding romance so enjoyable to witness and to see grow over time. While Mai simply starts off as an extremely attractive girl in the perverted view of Sakuta, she slowly becomes so much more to him over time until he is willing to fight in many ways for her and what they have between them.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a twist to the anime which entices me even more. Due to how I originally assumed the anime was going to be, I assumed that the idea of 'Puberty/Adolescence Syndrome' was simply going to be shoved into the plot to give an excuse to do things such as put Mai in the bunny costume. Therefore assuming it was going to be used for fan-service like that I thought nothing of it. However it actually is a very important and interesting dynamic to the series. To me, romance anime needs an important, unique dynamic like this. There is a lot of romance anime out there, and so something is needed to make a series with this tag stand out. Adolescence Syndrome is what that is for me in this case. It forms and drives the story, as well as putting the characters through situations which really builds and makes them understand their relationships with those around them. This mixed with it also having reference to ideas presented within quantum mechanics such as quantum entanglement and Laplace's Demon really settle it for me. \\n\\n\r\nI think overall this turned out to be one of the biggest shocks I've gotten from an anime in terms of how I perceived it was going to be versus how it turned out; and I mean that in the most positive sense possible. It's a story of romance and the forming and strengthening of relationships whilst going through the struggles of puberty. For CloverWorks to have taken a concept this open and simple and have it be expanded upon and made great to this extent is truly what I love about this show. \\n\r\nFall 2018 has been a phenomenal season for anime, and many great and enjoyable series have aired. However for me none could beat out Bunny Girl Senpai. Many people are now discovering this too and I'm simply glad to see it getting all the love and attention I believe it deserves. Oh, and both the opening and ending are both extremely good. Just an added bonus overall.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love romance anime with an element of mystery and a cast of enjoyable, sarcastic characters, then this is most definitely the anime I would recommend to you.",

            "content": "Have you ever watched something that is a literal pile of trash, no matter what angle you look at it from, and still somewhat enjoyed it? That's this anime.\r\nEvery fan of this show seems to think that the only feasible reason someone could possibly dislike this show is that the science used to explain what's happening is complete illogical bullshit. Spoiler alert: that's not why people hate this show.\r\nLet's start with the worst part of the show by far: characters. Sakuta is a combination of the worst parts of Hachiman and Araragi, which is quite ironic since this is the most blatant ripoff of theMonogatari franchise to ever be conceived. Sakuta is an antisocial loser, who also happens to be an omnipotent deity that can solve any plausible problem plaguing any member of the cast by simply existing. Basically, he's just every cancerous LN trope combined into one character, masked by the Hachiman brand of relatability. The viewer is supposed to look at this empty, two-dimensional sack of shit and think, \"Hey! That could be me! Man, this is such a great and relatable show.\" Sakuta is the Kirito of school romcoms. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters don't happen to be much better. Unlike the two-dimensional Sakuta, every single girl in this show is one-dimensional. Legitimately every single character who has an arc exists solely for the purpose of her arc. Once their arc is gone, they proceed to fade in and out of existence. Mai becomes waifu-bait with no purpose or motivations, that short haired girl talks to Sakuta like twice just so that the viewer doesn't think she's dead or something, and Futaba goes back to explaining her insanely stupid scientific theories. The only character that actually exists outside of her arc is the incest bait sister, but that's only because her arc is last in the season and the viewer needs to know she exists before then.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is mostly fine. It's just a copy paste of the Monogatari ~3 episode arc per girl. Except, instead of Araragi actually doing something interesting or cool, our god Sakuta descends and solves the arc's problem by using his poorly written light novel main character powers. In Monogatari, Araragi nearly never directly solves a character's problems. Instead, he assists the characters to overcome their problems themselves, recognize their own faults, etc. \"People have to save themselves. One person saving another is impossible.\" But no, Hajime Kamoshida can't even plagiarize correctly. Sakuta literally fixes every problem himself and then the girls magically feel better once their problems are gone. Remember when that stacked up against Hachiman and was a focus of that show's plot? Once again, just as with the characters, good writing of any kind is sacrificed in favor of pandering to the average viewer.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After some consideration, I've decided that it's reasonably fair to say that Bunny Girl plagiarizes Monogatari. Kaede's usage of third-person pronouns (referring to herself by her own name) is used in the exact same way with the exact same purpose as it is used with Sengoku (kinda hard to articulate this without spoilers). There are full, straight up conversations that are exactly the same between the series, and that happen in the exact same context. The prime example of this is the 6th episode of both this show and Bakemonogatari. Scroll to about 8:40 in Bake, and then to about 2:10 in this show of the 6th episode. If that's not plagiarism, I don't know what is. Furthermore, as I saw another reviewer point out, the whole bunny girl thing that serves literally no purpose in the show whatsoever can be viewed as a copy of the animal motifs that are ever-present in Monogatari. On the other hand, you can even take the very characters and link a lot of them between the two shows: \\n\\n\r\nSakuta = Araragi: the classic generic LN protagonist whose main purpose is to help/save every character he meets. Obviously, Araragi is a complex, well-written, and overall good character, while Sakuta is none of those, but I digress. \\n\r\nMai = Senjougahara: tsundere main girl that mostly acts dere towards the MC (this may seem like a bit of a stretch, but bear with me).\\n\r\nFutaba = Hanekawa: one of the MC's best friends, wear glasses and is smart. \\n\r\nNodoka = Kanbaru: main girl's sister/has a sister-like relationship with her. Both of their arcs focus on their conflict with their big sister character. \\n\r\nKaede = Sengoku: little sister/little sister type character to the MC. Both are victims of bullying, which their arcs focus on (Nadeko's first arc). The events of Nadeko Medusa and Hitagi End are also similar to Kaede's arc (aforementioned third-person pronoun usage being an indication of a spoiler that I will not be saying). \\n\r\nKoga is... also surprisingly similar to Nadeko. Once again, you've got the whole bullying thing playing a part in the arc and they both focus excessively on their appearance/behavior in order to be popular/fit in.\\n\\n\r\nYou can argue that a lot of these are common tropes, and they indeed are. But when there are conversations that are nearly word for word the same, and when you can draw a parallel between every single relevant character in one show to another, I see it as fair game to call this plagiarism. I mean, nearly every part of Bunny Girl can be found in Monogatari. END EDIT\\n\\n\r\nNow, everyone's favorite part to criticize: the asinine metaphysics. Simply put, they just don't make sense. This show's scientific explanations are like watching Ben Shapiro debate someone. You just get spammed with a metric ton of information that doesn't really flow logically whatsoever, but hey, it sounds smart, so it must make sense. Basically, every single \"scientific\" explanation goes like this:\\n\\n\r\nKirito: \"I am experiencing a supernatural phenomenon\"\\n\r\nFutaba: \"*relatively popular scientific concept that might be somewhat related to the supernatural phenomenon*\"\\n\r\nKirito: \"Huh?\"\\n\r\nFutaba: \"*wall of text*\" \\n\r\nKirito: \"Oh ok\"\\n\\n\r\nArt and music: pretty good. Nothing to say here.\\n\\n\r\nNow you might be thinking: how could I possibly give this show a 6/10 after everything I've said? yeah idk lol the show was pretty fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nJust go watch Monogatari instead.",

Licentious thoughts pervade his mind, eager to be breathed to life, articulated so nonchalantly to whatever girl latches onto him. The aggressive one; the pariah at school who is spoken about in hushed voices that dart in and out of student\u2019s mouths, settling at the breach between tact and uncivility. The boy views himself as an outsider and relates to this pariah, her plight is his own and due to that, he feels indebted to her. An ethereal toll which he must pay in order to regain a semblance of self-worth. But this outsider--this vagabond--edgingalong her school life eager to not make an impression on anyone, reveals herself as a lost, despondent figure who must retain a steely resolve, as any weakness would be immediately exploited and abused by the ones who have shunned her prior. This absence from reality; this vanished being, incapable of making an impression due to her affliction, is everything the boy needs. And he must save her. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there, a cascade of style erupts at the audience. A heterogeneous artistic smear across the pragmatic industry, transgressing norms whilst simultaneously accepting them, indulging in them and acquiescing to a standard that is so easy to punch through. A blithely swipe at normativity through the perspective of someone bored, sardonic, and fatigued by the constant battle against the restrictions, yet excited at the notion of being an erudite voice in the sea of retrograde production. What a perspicacious voice; what an apogee of style; what abrasive and caustic, annoying, biting, frames which flash between purpose and nonsense! An artifice of subversion and solipsism and hedonistic virtue. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough about Monogatari.\\n\\n\r\nRascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is a Light Novel adaptation by A-1 Studios\u2019 subsidiary, Cloverworks. It attempts to interpret puberty as fantastical phenomena, hinged on emotion and hormones, which causes young adults to be afflicted by peculiar maladies. Similarly to Monogatari, Bunny Girl features a protagonist who is positively flooded with female archetypes. Each one struck by this sickness and each one in desperate need to be saved. And of course, Sakuta, our protagonist, does his best to aid all these poor, helpless, idiosyncratic, feeble, powerless women. More tepid wish-fulfillment than its sources of inspiration, but as a result, far less engaging in general. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems as though the writer wanted to create a more mainstream, acceptable product while inhabiting those same ideas which brought so much energy to Monogatari. Instead, the misogyny remains but the interest disappears, as none of the artistic flourishes exist any longer. Shinbo\u2019s eccentric dynamism isn\u2019t there to give the unorthodox structure and profoundly witty and playful dialogue an arena to swell within. It all dissipates into mediocrity. Vibrant, piercing backgrounds turn into CG meshes with myopic gradients. Little to no shading exists at any one time, creating flat, innocuous scenery. An insipid grain of banalness infuses with what\u2019s presented; a lack of portentousness and hedonism which made its inspiration so memorable creates only the mundane.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl lampshades clich\u00e9 for only so long until it gives in and buckles under the weight of its production. Our ephemeral time spent with these characters feels even shorter once the final credits roll and they become nothing but fleeting thoughts and concepts. Threadbare metaphysics are mentioned to justify the ailments and, unfortunately, this misguided scientific slant is extraordinarily detrimental to any semblance of verisimilitude the series sought to create. The implementation of quantum mechanics was equally groan-worthy, as misunderstood explanations had a negative, ramifying effect on the rest of the series. Considering the definitions provided, we are left in a more frustrated state than we were when the phenomena were just that: phenomena. \\n\\n\r\nNot all is bad in the world of Bunny Girls and obsessive sisters, though, as the first arc did well to ease us into the structure of the series. The relationship between Sakuta and Mai was, if anything, cute. Due to the series\u2019 more restrained approach towards the harem elements which it was inspired by, their relationship could play out convincingly enough as to not feel dissonant from the rest of the show\u2019s tone. And while I wouldn\u2019t classify it as funny, Bunny Girl has enough permeating wit that some of the interactions felt borderline inspired. Long train rides full of stodgy exposition became bearable due to the nature of the script and how it used the prosaic nature of its acerbic characters to its benefit. \\n\\n\r\nI appreciated how Kaede\u2019s (Sakuta\u2019s little sister) story starts in medias res, as we are treated to continuous revelations about what she went through and why exactly she\u2019s such a shut-in clich\u00e9. While the explanation isn\u2019t necessarily all too surprising and her arc is floundered by laconic and rushed melodrama, the standouts did particularly well.  Sakuta\u2019s care for his little sister created for one of the show\u2019s more deceptively detailed sequences, as it gave us an extended scene where they spend their final moments together before she relapses back into her old self. Her entire arc revolves around her going back to school after her affliction and while she struggled to get there during the day, they sneak into it at night together. It creates for a gripping kenopsia as they creep around the empty schoolyard\u2014one we see many times throughout the series\u2014and peak into her future classroom. The sense of dread hangs loosely in the air, and for once the series\u2019 pithy observations take on a more artistic, expressive existence. \\n\\n\r\nRascal is an easy watch, and that\u2019s undoubtedly why it\u2019s so popular and well regarded. The emotions are tangible, the plot is accessible, and the characters are smooth enough to digest without any need for interpretation or challenge. That\u2019s not to diminish or belittle the series, but to examine why it isn\u2019t just a facsimile of Monogatari. It sheds the weight of complex structure, characterization, and presentation in favor of a mainstream, safe, and maybe even relatable experience. There is no conniption to be had here; Bunny Girl isn\u2019t heterodox or complicated. It\u2019s essentially puberty: exaggerated, melodramatic, and sweaty, but far easier than what is initially expected. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "--Review may contain spoilers--\r\nUndoubtedly the best anime of Fall 2018, and probably one of the best in 2018, this anime much like Bakemonogatari and Oregairu, is about \"Puberty Syndrome\" - a supernatural phenomenon caused by instability and sensitivity during adolescence.\r\nStory (10): Azusagawa Sakuta, a second year high-schooler, meets a senpai in a library and unexpectedly, dressed in a bunny girl costume. Sakuta notices that the everyone in the library except for himself was able to see her.  This senpai, also known as Sakurajima Mai, a famous celebrity, gradually becomes invisible and forgotten by people. Sakuta, who thinks this is \"Puberty Syndrome\" and has experiencedit before, decides to help her. And that's pretty much the summary of episode 1. The story is basically about Sakuta helping out people with \"Puberty Syndrome\" and reliving them from whatever instability they are having, thus ending the supernatural phenomenon they are having.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this anime isn't just an anime, but a message as to how cruel our society has become, especially in high school. In real life, having instabilities during adolescence can cause serious mental issues and might lead to suicide. In every arc, the anime tells something about stuff that happen during adolescence. For example, isolation and fake rumor spreading in the first arc, anxiety in the third arc and the feeling of being constantly compared in the fourth arc. Almost every episode is relatable to someone who has difficulties in real life and I hope that viewers can change for the better.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): Don't have much to say for art. It's beautiful and something you'd expect to see in 2018.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): Absolutely love the OP and ED. I enjoy them so much to the point where I might even replay them before watching/finish watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): As an Oregairu fan, I absolutely love Sakuta's character. Much like Hachiman, he is a loner but is blunt and a savage, you'd just laugh at how straightforward he is. He doesn't care about the bad rumors about him in school and just lives the way he wants. The other characters are good too but I won't go much into them as it might spoil you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (9): Overall, this anime is perfect to end 2018 with. I'm super glad that someone created an anime with a mix of Bakemonogatari and Oregairu in it.",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai in Yume wo Minai, is one of the most commented anime of this season. And that does not surprise me, after all, it's an anime that attracts a lot of attention.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story of the Bunny, really does not have anything magnificent as some are saying. BUT, it is undeniably intriguing. The first episode is enough to catch anyone. The mystery that the anime introduces in the air in the first 10 minutes is really something that makes you watch the next episodes.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nThe art of the bunny is flawless. It is not as chic as the artof other anime of the day. The art does very well what it proposes, as much in the design of the characters, as in the scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Bunny Girl is not something that attracts much attention. With the exception of OP and ED, one does not perceive the same emotion in the soundtrack. I do not say that the soundtrack is bad, on the contrary, the soundtrack is really good, BUT the direction fails to choose the appropriate moments of each one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout doubt the best point of the Bunny. The characters are realistic, well-developed, engaging and consistent. The dialogues are incredible because the characters have minimal notion of how to speak as a human being. With this, the characters become full of life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl is the classic anime, where you expect it to be something generic, and this completely surprises you. It manages to be good to both the audience who wants to have fun, both for the audience they want to analyze and to try to get messages from it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that has great potential to be the best of the season and perhaps the year. It can be a subjective and objective anime at the same time, it has complex explanations of physics for the events and, even then, you can understand with a more lay explanation. So I'll give my vote of confidence to Bunny Girl, and I really believe it will be the best anime this season.",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai has been noted as if Monogatari and Oregairu had a love child...LA agrees with this and better yet, it's an anime that has it's own flair and charm to it to make it unique to it's contemporaries.\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is about Puberty Syndrome, where abnormal experiences in teenagers are caused by instability where it affects many of the characters in this anime, think of it as a reverse, harsher Chunnibyou syndrome in which it's supernatural elements come intentionally or unintentionally real. Sakuta Azusagawa voiced by KaitoIshikawa has such a puberty syndrome of having a huge scar on his chest, but when he comes across his senior wearing a bunny costume in public, well we find out that this senior named Mai Sakurajima voiced by Asami Seto ALSO has Puberty Syndrome and thus Sakuta tries to cure Mai of her puberty syndrome and later on...several other girls with differing puberty syndromes whilst trying to have a relationship with Mai. Now the premise itself feels VERY much like a Monogatari series formula arcs, just less complicated, a stoic pervert of a main character tries to save girls with their supernatural problems...yeah...but again Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai has it's own uniqueness to it, not only because it's less complicated to Monogatari series (which is actually a good thing), but because Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is a character focused anime, we get to know these characters and how the puberty syndrome affects them ad then quickly we get invested in them and then..your hooked into not only their personalities and characters but how the puberty syndrome's supernatural element ties everything together into making great character development towards the main cast, heck even after their character arcs ended they have some to lot of relevance to the next character arc sometimes!. Why Oregairu is involved in this comparison, Mai and Sakuta are VERY similar in personalities to Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.'s Yukino Yukinoshita and Hachiman Hikigaya respectively, heck Nao Touyama voices a character that has a crush to their respective protagonist's series!. But the comparison to Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. stops there. Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is by all accounts a character focused anime and not only strives but excels in this front, getting us invested in their characters, relationships and how intrinsic the supernatural element to each of the girls dilemma is tied to to their character development, allowing the character development to be further developed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, due to the greatly investable characters, they at first land in the stereotypical but over their character arcs, they become evolving characters that also break their own stereotypes as well. Though Sakuta is probably the only one to NOT break this mold but nonetheless, Mai is the stoic kuudere type of character but with her character focused arc, she opens up expectedly but she has her own quirkiness to her, mainly because of her not taking Sakuta's shit and is a brilliant comparison to Sakuta's personality, really they were kinda meant to be together. Tomoe Koga voiced by Nao Touyama is Sakuta's junior and is the typical genki character yet she is much more complicated than being genki, as she has something with her desires of having lots of friends but needing to sacrifice her previous personality in order to do it. Rio Futaba voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki, a friend of Sakuta and is the main exposition fairy for the supernatural stuff that happens, but she has a fear of \"being herself\"...or just opening up and that gets her into trouble, Nodoka Toyohama voiced by Maaya Uchida, a popular idol but her having links to Mai, mainly of her having rivalry towards her and finally Sakuta's little sister Kaede voiced by Yurika Kubo, being emotionally scarred from cyber bullying caused her puberty syndrome to make her cut herself unintentionally but because of this she locked herself in her house and never left, she is your typical genki little sister but her puberty syndrome is what makes her somewhat unique to her archetype and probably gave off one of the more relatable and heartwarming and heartwrecking moments at the same time. Through this, LA's favourite character easily became......Mai, LA couldn't help it, and no it's not by default due to her increased screentime, it was her personality and her character development and sassy banter with Sakuta helped the majority of the time, Tomoe Koga and Rio Futuba was a close second and third.\\n\\n\r\nThough Sakuta really doesn't change his personality or have any sort of backstory in the anime, it's through his interactions with the other characters that we kinda see his subtle hints of a backstory and what he's going through, he IS the narrative focus through the majority of the anime so this is a given really. The best examples of him developing along with the girl's character arc in question would be Mai's, Rio's and Kaede's.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai does excellently with it's characters, not only through their relationships with Sakuta but also be it outside of Sakuta as well as the greatly done character development of each of the character arcs given making each character much more multilayered and multifaceted characters breaking out of their stereotypes that you just can't help but get invested in their dilemma's and thus you get sucked into the plot even more.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of Rio Futaba, Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai does get the distinction of trying to explain the supernatural elements using Futaba going into quantum physics and whatnot, but all things considering, it kinda wasn't needed, as we the audience knows of the actions that produced the reaction of the character with the puberty syndrome in question and how it was cured through emotional means, quantum physics explanation wasn't needed, though Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai seems to mostly handwave it's own explanations either way. Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai's flaws a VERY small to say the least even to the point of them being nitpicks than anything else, like Sakuta's intentional pervertedness being well intentional, fanservice is light to say the least, more or less characters dressing up in the most fanservice we get and with shipping it's there as well and finally would be how formulaic the anime is, but that's to be expected from a character focused arc format of an anime that it is.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well CloverWorks seemed to slapped themselves out of their funk since Persona 5 the Animation, as the animation done by them is leagues above their previous work, detailed characters and beautiful backgrounds with little to no derps AT ALL. What can LA say, LA is impressed. Great and exotic character designs and good backgrounding and for being an anime that is alot more talkative than action-like, well maybe that's why CloverWorks excelled in it's animation because of it, nonetheless CloverWorks, LA is impressed, why couldn't you do the same level of animation for Persona 5?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice work, LA freakin' loved this voice cast, Asami Seto did a great job as Mai, being a sassy stoic kuudere, Nao Touyama being Nao Touyama as in ALL the genki and LA loved her performance as Tomoe, Atsumi Tanezaki also somewhat channeling Asami Seto's stoicness and deadpaness as Rio, Maaya Uchida as Nodoka being a tsundere and finally Yurika Kubo doing the entire little sister scthick without being annoying (LA might be the rare few that felt this) showing off her range from outright moe to the complete opposite of a mature cadence. Seriously this voice cast was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai's ending was also handled pretty well too, as it did give off something of an open ended finale especially concerning Sakuta and Kaede but it tied off most of the plotlines involving Kaede though oddly Sakuta weirdly got the spotlight though it was more or less Sakuta getting past the situation that got him extremely depressed but nonetheless it was actually fine in a ways seeing things from his perspective as Kaede's older brother and all. All in all as much as the final arc did involve Kaede, it had as much to do with Sakuta as well and the ending was executed quite well getting the main cast involved and tying up any loose ends of the plot it had. \\n\\n\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai managed to be unique with it's contemporaries like Oregariu, the Monogatari series by the use of it's unique characters and effectively using it's supernatural element to develop their characters and make them investable as a result. Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai was by far LA's Top 3 animes heck maybe LA's favourite anime of Fall 2018 and well deserves it's praise, great plot, great investable characters, detailed and great animation along with an amazing voice cast...what else can LA say?\\n\\n\r\nMai is best girl!",

            "content": "This is an early review made on episode 4. I usually don't do those, and I will change it by episode 12 if the show proves me wrong. So if you're in the future reading this just know that I was right.\r\n Bunny Girl is a story made by someone who probably read Bakemonogatari and Haruhi, really liked it, tried to write a story just like those two, and decided to copy everything down to the tiniest detail. And that would be great if not for one small mistake: they copied everything down to the tiniest detail in the surface level, but they never understoodwhy those structures and tropes where there, meaning that everything in Bunny Girl, while looking really good on the surface, is completely shallow on the most basic analysis.\\n\r\n Yes, it has that quirky dialogue, but it is devoid of meaning and just wastes time.\\n\r\n Yes, it has sci-fi, but it will tramp over it with the power of love and sunshine.\\n\r\n Yes, it has supernatural events that will act as puzzles for the MC to solve as he grows as a person and helps the girls around him grow as well, but they are all shallow and represent nothing in symbolism to the story and only exist because that's how it went in Bakemonogatari and so they have to do it as well.\\n\r\n Just to point out how much this is a carbon copy of Bake, the MC, who is a loner and hated by everyone, had a supernatural event happen to him some time ago which changed his life forever. After that, a girl he really cares about who helped him overcome it also falls to similar event, and he has to protect her. This all happened before the story starts. The real plot begins when the author accidentally meets and finds out about his main love interest's supernatural case and helps her overcome it. They fall madly in love, but he has to keep pursuing his harem of girls with problems that he must solve, with the second one being a younger girl who accidentally brings him into a loop which she can't solve herself.\\n\\n\r\n  If I had to put Bunny Girl into two words it would be \"wasted potential\". \\n\r\n By all means, watch the first episode. If you liked the atmosphere, go on and keep watching it. It is actually entertaining. But you will have to deal with the constant thought of \"how much better this could be if just...\".",

Some of the material - especially the quantum physics part - is so cringy that it could go on r/iamverysmart.\r\nArt: Boooooring and generic like every generic anime out there. The character designs weren't even appealing. Every time Mai appeared on screen I felt like punching her face.\r\nSound: Average at best. The opening works better as a meme: \"KIMI NO GEI KIMI NO GEI UWU\"\r\nCharacter: Thisis what I hated the most. The MC, not-Araragi-kun, isn't lovable but instead is an unabashed pervert. The main girl, not-Senjougahara, is annoying in every way: looks, voice, personality. In a way she's perfect for the MC but whatever. I've never truly hated a character like this before. Mai \"not-Hitagi-Senjougahara\" Sakurajima is the worst anime girl of 2018 and you can't change my mind. The rest of the girls weren't even worth remembering. Fine, I don't expect something like the toothbrush scene but the characters weren't even memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I would give a 0 if I could. I cringed all the way through and I know, I really must hate myself a lot to have sat through the entirety of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bunny Girl Senpai is the worst anime of 2018 imo. I strongly recommend that you do not watch it. If you want a good story, watch the Monogatari series. If you have a fetish for bunny suits then watching h****i is more productive than watching this trainwreck of an anime.",

            "content": "Bunny Girl Senpai is a textbook example of never judge a book by its cover. From initial expection, it would seem to be nothing more than a typical ecchi anime featuring a dim witted protagonist surrounded by a harem of sexy girls clad in skimpy bunny suits. And you know what? I would have been completely ok with that. But after actually watching the anime, it becomes apparent that this anime offers something entirely different. Now is that special \"something\" going to please everyone? Well, based off of all of the love this anime has been receiving, it would seem that the majority of thisshow's audience would give a resounding yes. And for the most part, I'd agree.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that doesn't mean that this anime doesn't have its share of flaws.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai features a seemingly standard school setting. Sakuta is the protagonist of the story who's tasked with solving the problems of multiple girls. However, instead of these characters simply having typical teenage girl problems equipped with all of the drama that derives from these aforementioned issues, this anime adds a bit of a supernatural twist to the school drama genre. Dubbed \"adolescence syndrome\" by the anime, mysterious occurrences like the disappearance of one girl from the eyes and memories of the public or the spawning of a doppelganger of another girl coincide with the problems plaguing these characters. Each occurrence of adolescence syndrome almost perfectly embodies the type of obstacle being faced, and I personally believe that the inclusion of this supernatural element really increases the quality and intrigue of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I've noticed that it does seem to have a downside.\\n\\n\r\nWhile an interesting concept, adolescence syndrome itself is never fully fleshed out. Although  each case of the syndrome is usually explained quite well through science or something to Sakuta by his intelligent friend Rio Futaba, the entire concept itself and why it exists in this universe is left vague. Of course, this would be completely inconsequential if this was a fantasy anime where magic and mystery were the norm. But the creators portray this show as something grounded in reality where the supernatural elements can be explained through logic and reason. And for me personally, that just doesn't quite work. Regardless, adolescence syndrome is still a fun addition to this anime that gives it a bit more flare. \\n\\n\r\nTo give you a better understanding about what this anime's all about, I'd say that it's a sort of love child between OreGairu and The Monogatari Series. Bunny Girl Senpai has quite a few similarities to both of these anime, but I'm not here to compare and contrast these series. I will say, however, that Bunny Girl Senpai does one thing marginally better then the other two. And that would be its portrayal and execution of the relationship between its two protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nThe first girl featured in this anime is none other than the titular bunny girl senpai herself, Mai. And as we seasoned anime veterans know, the first girl usually ends up as the main love interest for the protagonist. And in this case, I couldn't be happier. Mai is our first introduction to adolescence syndrome as we soon learn that more and more people are beginning to forget about her existence as time goes on. I won't spoil what exactly causes this phenomenon, but I will say that it stems from Mai's experiences in the modeling industry. Anyway, she starts to spend time with Sakuta, who also had a nasty experience with adolescence syndrome that gets properly explained near the end of the anime. And let me tell you, the highlight of Bunny Girl Senpai for me would definitely be the interactions that these two characters have. They have some great conversations that range from super cute to downright hilarious, and what Sakuta does for Mai at the end of episode three has to go down as one of the greatest moments of this anime season for me. Bunny Girl Senpai is a rare anime where the two protagonists actually end up as a couple early on in the show, and unlike the Monogatari Series, the main girl doesn't get completely shafted after she ends up with the hero. Mai plays an important and supportive role towards Sakuta throughout the entire anime, and for me is simply a very strong female lead.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of Mai's arc, the anime presents us with four more girls, each with their own character arc, suffering from adolescence syndrome that Sakuta goes out of his way to help out. And thankfully, each of these arcs feature great character interactions and are good in their own right. Like in Mai's segment, Sakuta has some memorable moments in Koga's arc, and Koga herself goes through some nice development throughout the few episodes that she's featured in. Futaba's arc was interesting, and although the imouto of Mai had the weakest arc in my opinion, it had some great moments featuring Mai herself. The final arc of the anime covers Kaede, the beloved panda suit wearing imouto of Sakuta. I actually felt the most emotion during her arc and thought it was a great way to conclude the anime. But like everything else with this show it seems, there was a problem with this. And that would be cramming five different arcs in a thirteen episode anime. Now none of the arcs felt rushed or lacking despite the minimal time they had to work with. It's just that the anime could have been a little more centered with either fewer arcs or more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, I felt that this anime left a little more to be desired. It's definitely not bad, but the artistic quality just feels a little lacking to me. The soundtrack is good, and the opening theme song is a nice tune that contains a nice dose of uwu. Voice actors do a nice job delivering lines, and I think that Kaede's seiyuu puts the most emotion into her role. My one complaint would be that while I liked Sakuta's voice actor, I feel like he could have put a bit more feeling into his part. I get that Sakuta is a nonchalant type of guy, but still. A bit more energy never hurt anyone, right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I wouldn't call this anime excellent by any sense of the word, it still ended up being quite the enjoyable show. The characters were fun, the scenarios were fun, and, well, it was simply a fun anime. Bunny Girl Senpai might not have introduced anything revolutionary to the anime medium, but it certainly won the hearts of many anime fans, and I'll admit that I too was swayed by its charm. I staunchly believe that this is an anime that will be remembered for seasons to come.\\n",

It's a simple concept that is painfully dragged out over 13 episodes.  It was painful to watch but I wanted to complete the series, if for nothing more, so that I could write this review.  There is no reasoning presented for the visible wounds, a dearth of depth in telling any of the character's stories, no build to climax, and no clear resolution as to why anyonewas in their predicament.  As others have asked \"Did a 13 year old write this?\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is non-existent. At no time did I ever feel connected to any of the characters.  No deeper inspection of the psyche or needs of them, their desires (besides the lust of a teenage boy), and no real bonding between them.  Every character looked like another cardboard cutout. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is Fair - nothing to get excited about.  By the end of the series the artwork looks rushed.  As though even the artists were tired of these same characters.  As an example - look at the last hospital scene, when brother and sister are leaving, and you can literally see bad lines and coloring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - there are so many better anime series out there than this piece of junk.  This is like watching some of the horrible \"filler\" episodes in some popular anime titles.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously... this one is pretty bad.",

            "content": "Teenage years. Yes, for me, my teenage years probably my best and worst years in my life. I was a very hyperactive and tomboy girl back then so I was very much have no sense of shame but because of those personalities, I developed a huge insecurity over those years just for my early adult years trying to fix them for me. Our social life were being judged by everyone back then with parents put their highest hope for us in those years. So, yeah... Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai or Bunny Girl Senpai for short is an anime revolving around AdolescenceSyndrome that took the stress and insecurity of a teenager into reality, making this anime very intriguing and yet, relatable for us.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Adolescence Syndrome is actually pretty simple. Think of some teenage problem that would come out of your brain and try to convey it into reality. But what makes Bunny Girl Senpai special is this anime made the explanation of these Adolescence Syndrome occurrences with more scientific explanations and a certain depth of lore or history behind those. I don't know why but I love that concept which made the show smarter from a simple premise of teenage problems. And because they were teenagers, adults often said they were just a bigger version of kids so the adults sometimes would not believe what they said including the occurrences of Adolescence Syndrome. This made teenagers must deal with Adolescence Syndrome by their own and that's partly why Sakuta is a great character.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the center of great character development of this anime came out from Sakuta. While still being himself, The Rascal wants to help anyone who developed Adolescence Syndrome just like Shoko-san did to him. He was driven by kindness offered by someone who actually believed in him but still retained his basic personality trait that is a rascal. He spoke out his perverted thoughts or everything in his mind bluntly but that's why Sakuta becoming a lovable character. He seemed like not hiding anything and made everyone around him love to share their problem with him. He is the kind of guy I really want to share my thoughts with. And while he is dubbed as a rascal, he is actually have a huge commitment in relationship. He even turned a girl down properly because his feelings towards Mai-san won't change even after that painfully repeated days *a sudden memory of eight repeated episodes came in*. He is an embodiment of how a harem light novel protagonist should act while facing so many girls at the same time. His commitment is one of a kind and I love him for that.\\n\\n\r\nNot just that, I would like to say that Sakuta and Mai-san's relationship development could be the cutest and most natural romance development in this season and probably in this year. They were actually acting step by step and in a perfect pace. Those made every moment of their relationship development cute and made me squirm every time they showed some kind of small development.\\n\\n\r\nHow about the animation? I really like this anime's animation as I could see how much the animator poured their love in animating into this anime. What I really love about their animation is how they animate the expression of each characters which could make my heart skip a beat every time Mai-san blushes. With the addition of beautiful landscapes for the background, this anime is certainly a very good looking anime. As the first solo start for now standalone studio, CloverWorks who previously a sub-studio of A-1 Pictures, they certainly wanted to make their portfolio as good as possible with a very great debut that is Bunny Girl Senpai. Looking by how beautiful their animation is, I really could trust Cloverworks for adapting more anime in the future and really look forward for their future projects. Truly, a great way to start a reputation.\\n\\n\r\nThen, let's talk about this anime's music and soundtrack. This anime has a huge advantage with the catchiest opening of this season with the song \"Kimi no Sei\" performed by the peggies. The song is ultimately catchy that every time the song begin, I know that you can't stop singing \"kimi no sei... kimi no sei... kimi no sei de... watashi... UUUHHH...\" and I think most of you unconsciously read that line with the song played inside your head. I guarantee that you would not want to skip the opening of this anime every time you watch an episode as this opening begin to seep into your head and keep repeating inside your head.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has won many hearts including mine. Maybe, since this anime is already prepping itself for a movie sequel, the ending felt a little bit off but that's okay! We know that the movie is already on production and I really can't wait for the movie to solve one big question that surfaced in the very end.",

            "content": "Rascal does not dream of a Bunny Girl Senpai or lets just call it \"Bunny girl\" because I am not going to use that long name over and over again. \r\nFirst of all, if you are actually going to watch this show because of it's name, I hate to break it to you but this show has nothing to do with bunny girls. Its a bait. Yep! The writer baited you into watching something thats probably the anime of the year(atleast for me). \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe plot is actually pretty simple. A cheeky protagonist, Sakuta Asusagawa, helping out different girls in their problems. Problems known asPuberty syndrome. Now puberty syndrome itself means, \"Abnormal experiences rumored on the internet to be caused by sensitivity and instability during adolescence\". \\n\r\nI really loved how they brought in different life problems that almost every teenager faces in this world. Problems varying from bullying to self harm and even changing yourself just for the sake of others to going through stress and depression. Teenagers go through so much in the school days and this show actually takes that concept and turns it into a supernatural-Quantum physics related story to make things interesting. Now I know what you might be thinking, \"A guy helping out girls who are going through supernatural phenomenas? What is this? A new season for Monogatari?\". Well to be honest yeah it does copy a little bit from Monogatari and a bit from Haruhi Suzumiya and from Oregairu as well. The best part is the writer took all these ideas and made something amazing which is not a trainwreck. The story itself is quite enjoyable and all those Quantum Physics/Mechanics refrences(dont worry business students, they actually explain those references) made it even great. \\n\r\nIn the end Sakuta just has to find all the solutions to the problems and the syndromes that his friends, sister and girlfriend is facing in order to live a peaceful life. One wrong move could cost him something big. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe animation was actually pretty good in the start but it went downhill once the show started to bloom. Now I dont blame cloverworks for this because they decided to raise the budget of the movie(Sequel to this show) and dropped the budget of the show itself. It was a pretty good move to ensure that the movie turns out to be great because it contains the best arcs of the novels. Though I still dropped the ratings because I am sucker for animation and artstyle and it started to lack in the end and you can even notice how strange the facial expressions of the characters started to be. But alot of people will not mind this because the main focus of this show is on the story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and the endings both are freaking gold. No, they are PLATINUM GOLD(A monogatari reference). I don't think I have even skipped both the op and ed once. The best thing about the openings and endings were that the Voice Actresses used to sing the op and ed of their respective arcs. I have no idea if there is much background music in this show, even if there is, its not noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10 (Bit of a spoiler)\\n\r\n      *Sakuta Asusagawa: The main male lead of Bunny girl and the rascal which the name of the show suggests. The whole story revolves around him and there is not much screen time for other characters apart from their respective arcs and apart from our bunny girl senpai. Sakuta for me was a cheeky guy but he is a normal guy, a student just like all of us. There is a limit to how much a person can take and even Sakuta had his limits and in the end he did bursted out. He helped out all his friends when they were going through the puberty syndrome and I wish I had a friend like him in real life. Sakuta is probably the male of the year for me.\\n\r\n      *Sakurajima Mai: The main female lead of the show and our very own Bunny girl senpai which the name of the show suggests. Guess the name is not a bait after all huh? No, it is. Mai is tsundere character that alot of people compare to Senjougahara from monogatari but she isn't even close to Senjougahara. The character designer was the same as Oregairu due to which people even compare her with Yukinon but again Mai senpai is fire while Yukinon was ice, they are so different. The only screentime she gets after her arc is all the romantic situations which the writer created. \\n\r\n*Other Characters: All the other characters were briefly explained in their respective arc and we got to know alot about them due to their puberty syndrome. But every character had a little screen time once their arc ended which is why I'm not going indepth about the side characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nNow this show, even though I know it might seem to be a rip off of some of my favourite shows, it was still written by the author from one of my favorite show, \"The pet girl of sakurasou\". Personally I enjoyed this show alot. I enjoyed the heck out of it because how you could relate to some of the things in reality. It was just awe-inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal statement:\\n\r\nCyber bullying, self harm, dual personality, stress and depression now that is something that alot of writer dont even try to talk about. The show couldn't have been better for me as it was perfect just the way it is. An astounding protagonist with a tough life and teaching us all about how you should never give up. There is always a solution, doesn't matter how much time it takes, find the solution and solve the problem. At times you may feel down but you should always get back up and fix yourself because there are other people who need you. I can't wait for the movie and I am super hyped about it. \\n\\n\r\nI'll give it an overall rating of 9/10.",

            "content": "From episodes 1~3 it's a really interesting story and it makes you fall in love with the characters (mostly Bunny Senpai). You know the drill: girl is invisible, boy is the only one able to see her, they start to bond and he somehow wants to (and is able to??) stop the ~curse~ and she's visible again!!\r\nYes, all of that happens in the lapse of 3 episodes. This anime has 13 episodes. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS IN THE REMAINING 10 EPISODES?!?!?!\r\nI was already kinda skeptical before going to episode 4. I mean, it all moved SO fast... the romance (it was basically: episode 1 theymeet and find out about her \"condition\" -> episode 2 they spend the whole time together and trying to figure out how to reverse it/who else is able to see her -> episode 3 everything works out in the end), the resolution itself (it all happened in episode 3 and HONESTLY, it all felt like a series finale), the half-assed explanation as to what this syndrome is... But hey, I figured, I'm still in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSo in episode 4 they basically reintroduce an extra from episode 1 and they're like \"remember that syndrome? this chick has it too, except hers is different\" and the male MC is like \"welp. guess i gotta help HER out now, then.\"\\n\\n\r\nSee, I didn't like this girl, I thought she was very lukewarm (personality-wise as well as plot-wise). And not just that, but she sort of became the focus for a while. I have a theory that every girl that shows up in the opening will inevitably have the puberty syndrome and alas, the ONLY one able to save them is... yep! MC-kun!\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* this anime seems to be taking the turn I didn't want it to take. I thought it'd be mostly a comedy with some slight angst/drama but, well, apparently it is a HAREM.\\n\\n\r\nSo this is definitely not for me. If anyone watches the rest of this and it gets good, feel free to message me to talk about it. Otherwise, I'll just drop it.",

            "content": "Sakuta is like the most related character ever: he\u2019s a male, he\u2019s sarcastic, he breaths, he eats, he wears clothes, he even goes to school.  This man speaks to me on such a deep level.  Yo and that bunny girl be so real; she\u2019s so realistic that she turns invisible, I remember when I turned invisible in high school, good times. And they\u2019re dialogue together is so real that they literally talk about nothing.  10/10 show right here.  Real talk though, why do people like this show? I know I\u2019m dumb, but I like to think I amsmart enough to get why this show is popular.  They do get that this show is just a harem right?  Regardless, here are my lose thoughts on this harem.\\n\\n\r\n   To be frank, I only got threw five episodes of this harem.  So I know all the modern day Albert Einstein will be quick to say \u201cyou can\u2019t judge a show only on a few episodes,\u201d as if this statement is an argument and isn\u2019t just admitting defeat and moving the goal post.  In any case, I will debunk this notion anyway via an example.  If a person was to go a restaurant and ordered a steak and the steak tasted terrible--the meat wasn\u2019t fresh, it was microwaved, and covered in grease--what sane person would eat the whole steak and be like \u201cnow that I have completely finished my meal, I can say it was terrible.\u201d  No, a normal person wouldn\u2019t waste their time eating a terrible steak that the cooks clearly didn\u2019t care enough to cook properly, so they would likely take a few bits and be done with it.  And it\u2019s the same for anime.  Why would I waste my time watching a terrible show when I could just drop it and move on with my life?  And this notion that a show will get better is also ludicrous.  To bring the steak comparison back.  If I took two bits of this steak, why would I assume that the rest of the steak will taste any better?  It was cooked by the same chief; it was all cooked in the same kitchen with the same tools. Therefore, it is logical to assume that it will taste bad all around.  The same logic can be applied to anime.  Consequently, I\u2019m gonna rip the first five episodes and rate the whole show because I know it isn\u2019t gonna get any better.\\n\\n\r\n   Episode one. Skimming through this episode one (to jog my memory), I kinda get why people might like this show.  This show has very shallow observations of reality that might confuse people into thinking this show is deep when it really isn\u2019t.  For example, boring boy (Sakuta) says \u201ceveryone says \u2018I\u2019m bored\u2019 or \u2018isn\u2019t there something more interesting out there lie Pet phrases.  But in reality, none of them are really looking for a change.\u201d  The Breakfast Club called it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s script back.  But in all seriousness, lines like this never cease to make me roll my eyes.  It sounds super deep and philosophical, even though he is just making an observation to himself.  For example, I could look at a guy with a loud, expensive car and think to myself \u201conly those with week perceptions of themselves and a hunger for the approval of others would waste their resources on such ostentatious possession.\u201d  It is safe to say that that hypothetical example was pretentious and insulting to the viewer even.  I don\u2019t need these pretentious monologues from this Eric Forman of a character to understand the concepts being presented.  The show would be so much more interesting if they didn\u2019t waste so much time talking about the stuff happening in the show and left it up to us to figure it out.  Moreover, this would also make the show deeper because it would force the viewer to look deeper into each scenes to understand what is happening instead of having emo boy\u2019s pretentious monologues.  And that was just one quote.0\\n\\n\r\n   Surprisingly, the biggest insult of this episode (and by extension the whole show)  was not the CGI crowds--even though they were reason enough to drop the show.  Because, as I stated earlier, if the staff doesn\u2019t care about their own show, why should I? With that being said, the actual biggest insult of the show was the utilization of the adolescent syndrome.  I get why the writes came up with this.  The syndrome is pretty much just a metaphysical way of showing the struggles of its characters.  So, it is pretty much the homunculi from the manga Homunculus, which is a manga I consider to be one of the best.  But the reason the homunculi are sick and the Adolescent syndrome is dumb all lies in how the show present the concepts.  Remember how I said the show would be better if it didn\u2019t waste my time explaining things and just showed me what was happening and let me figure it out?  The same criticism applies to the syndrome as well, and boy does this show need to shut up.  Episode one wastes two minutes of screen time (which is a lot for an episode) dedicated to a scene were Eric and the Hermione looking girl talking about what is essentially nothing--referring to theorising about the adolescent syndrome.  And these scenes get worse; in later episodes, Hermione wastes even more off your time talking about quantum physics, with the time wasted bar reaching as high as five minutes in episode 4.  Homunculus also had scenes dedicated to Nakoshi and Ito trying to theorise what the homunculus are.  However, the presentations of both scenes couldn\u2019t be more different.  In bunny girl, hermione\u2019s explanations come off as info dumps, this feeling comes from how her theories never seem to be challenged--like the author expects us to take them as truth.  While in Homunculus, both Nakoshi and Ito have no idea what is going on, and we learn more from Nakoshi\u2019s interactions with the homunculi more than any dialogue; on top of that, Ito does not even fully believe Nakoshi when he says he sees homunculi, which adds another layer of suspense to the mystery.  In Bunny girl, we get our answers too easily, which could all be solved by showing and not telling.  These scenes would be much better if they were scrapped for more scenes with bunny b!tch and MC just talking.\\n\\n\r\n   The adolescent syndrome is not only explained to us in the most boring way possible, but it is also used for juvenile purposes.  This show is a harem, and how the harem lead finds his waifu\u2019s is because he needs to white night them as they go through this \u201csyndrome.\u201d  The first thing in episode one is him encountering harem girl #1, bunny b!tch.  Her adolescent syndrome makes her invisible to people, except the white night can see her because the show needs to find a way for the protagonist to talk to her.  This is actually an easy fix: instead of having the MC meet her for the first time, have them be somewhat acquaintances beforehand.  Then the writers could make it like he\u2019s jaded to her face therefore he can see her for who she really is or whatever.  It would be cory but objectively less arbitrary than how it is now, and it would utilize Sakuta\u2019s established character traits. Because as it stands now, the show is Erased levels of arbitrary.  And I just want to state that that solution took me less time to come up with than it did for Harmony to explain Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat fetish.\\n\\n\r\n   Episode two introduced harem girl #2, and we got problems. If this show was to stop being so pretentious, get animation, get decent sound, and clean up the script, it could be a decent show.  But then I got reminded this show is a stupid harem at the end of the day, and it just had to introduce another girl.  If this show just focused on bunny b!tch, it could of been a pretty decent romance.  Keep the first three episodes pretty much how they are, except cut out all the pretentious fat, and fill it with fleshing out the established characters. Then make the rest of the show a real talk romance with trippy Tatami Galaxy style scarios happen to spice things up.  But harem girl #2 was so bad I had to drop this show.  She was introduced by kicking Mr. Protagonist in the butt: then proceed to feel bad, hunch over, and expect him to kick her back?  Am I the only one that thinks that is the dumbings thing I\u2019ve ever seen?  Doesn\u2019t these show\u2019s have script editors?  How is it possible such a stupid, unfunny scene could get past so many incompetent people?  I\u2019d be ashamed to have my name in the credits.\\n\\n\r\n   Other than that asininity, the episode had some good elements to it.  And by good elements to it, I mean the scenes that just focus on bunny B!tch and Sakuta.  When it is just these two chatting, it is actually pretty cute.  This episode also utilized the syndrome in the way it should be used, which I greatly appreciated.  I loved how existential the show made bunny b!tch\u2019s disappearance.  However, there are still thinks in this episode I think need to be cleaned up.  For one, just give me more scenes of them just talking.  I personally really like episodes that feel like 24 hour day in the life videos.  One of my favorite episodes of anime was the Panty & stocking episode where they just sat on the couch and complained for the whole episode.  And I think bunny b!tch could use more of that.  Also, I would like to see them not talking about the adolescent syndrome and bunny b!tch\u2019s disappearance so literally.  If there was a spectrum of presentation of metaphoric storytelling with literality on one end and the abstractness on the other, Homunculus would be far into the abstract while Bunny B!tch is quite literal in how the characters talk about the syndrome and its implications on the characters life.  The show would do much better if the show was tastefully more on the abstract side of things.  How it stands now, the literal implications of bunny b!tch\u2019s syndrom take up too much of her precious dialogue with Sakuta.  It would be of much benefit if the dialogue cut back; how it is now makes the characters struggles feel jaded to reality despite the concepts being real.  Overall, focus more on concepts rather than the literal. \\n\\n\r\n   I won\u2019t talk much on episode three because I don\u2019t feel like it, and I kinda liked it.  The over the top the confession seen actually made for some really good catharsis--even I found it touching :,).  And there was no #2 to be seen, so that automatically makes the episode better.  That is about all the positives though.  Granite, those are some pretty good positives to have.\\n\\n\r\n   However, episode four was an insult to my intelligence.  I was bullied in elementary school but somehow this show managed to insult me more than my childhood bullies.  This is where #2 becomes a playable character in this grand harem.  Like with girl #1, girl #2 has the syndrome too and only the white knight can help her!  My biggest gripe with her character is that her problem that makes her seek out the MC is such a universal problem. Pretty much every high schooler doesn\u2019t want to be alone and is embarrassed to go to school, so why is this girls so special that she gets a white knight to pretend to be her boyfriend for her?  If Mr. white knight is willing to help this girl because her anxiety reminds him of her little sister, then why doesn\u2019t he just date every girl with anxiety? Because his harem would end up being a million freshman school girls too big.  Surprisingly, I actually think the anxieties and struggles of school girls could be made into a pretty good show.  Make a whole new show with new characters and present a similar scenario, and it could be good.  But as it stands, these ideas have no place in this show, and it just takes away from the already established story.\\n\\n\r\n   To make matters worse, in the same episode, Bunny B!tch and Mr. knight started officially dating.  Basically, white night agrees to help #2 while he is already date Bunny girl.  This man, who literally yelled to the enter school how he felt, now thinks it is okay to pseudo see someone else.  What was even more insulting was that, bunny b!tch even saw them together and was aware off this. If this was reality, after Mr. Knight got off from work, he should of went straight to bunny b!tch\u2019s house and cleared things up.  But no, his white knight and loli little sister got in the way and ruined the show.  \\n\\n\r\n   I won\u2019t go too in depth on episode five since I didn\u2019t even finish it.  Me and the friend I was watching this with couldn\u2019t take any more and dropped it midway through.  That and this show was drop worth from the CGI crowds in episode one--this is all just extra credit.  But the nail in the coffin for this episode was the fact that bunny girl went to MC\u2019s house.  The guy who apparently love\u2019s here didn\u2019t even go to see her when he knows she thinks he\u2019s cheating.  Not only that, the episode starts with MC just having explained everything off screen and with Bunny B!tch saying: \u201cI understand the current circumstances now. It\u2019s tough being a highschool girl.\u201d Am I the crazy one? Because I think nobody would ever be okay with this arrangement on the day you started dating. I know people will just say something like \u201cBut she can empathize with #2.\u201d  When, as I started earlier, ever high school has these problems; she isn\u2019t special.  A much more realistic response from bunny girl would be her saying that #2 needs to get over herself, and that she got over herself and #2 can too.  Or an even better fix: take out #2 and just have a romance between Bunny B!tch and Sakuta.\\n\\n\r\n   So basically, this show is bad, insulting even.  But it has stuff going for it, but it is plagued by an incompetent staff of writers and animators that will likely never achieve anything good in their careers if they don\u2019t fix their jawn.  And by fix their jawn I mean stop adapting bad light novel harems, that\u2019d be a good place to start.  So Rascal does not Dreams of Bunny B!tch Senpai\u2026 it\u2019s not good.\\n\\n\r\nIf you disagree with anything I have to say, then catch me live on twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/infinite_fiend) and insult me personally.  I stream live anime discussions and analysis.  So if you feel inclined, give me a follow, and bring forth your best arguments. I'd love to hear them. Peace, and have a nice night.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS !!\r\nWhat a disappointment, of the same author of Sakurasou in Pet na Kanojo that is a very good work, well developed and brings great messages of life, I thought that would see something similar in Bunny girl, but was totally mistaken.\r\n(Story = 5/10)\r\nThe teenage syndrome is the theme that they address throughout the plot, it is quite interesting, the problem is that it is very predictable, besides holes in the script of some parts. The rhythm of the plot is well rushed, especially from the part 1, I feel that the relationship between the protagonist between Mai could bemore worked out to be more realistic their relationship, especially with the last episode of the part 1, it was something totally unexpected coming of the protagonist so soon. Now the other arcs followed the same thing of part 1, the protagonist asks things to Futaba to know what to do in the problems of each character, so getting predictable, is a hole of script this character, besides the anime does not detail the right issues being very superficial the plot.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters = 5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very superficial, I feel they had a good background, but they were not well used, one of the main problems is that they do not seem real, the dubbing affected a lot of what I'm going to talk about, besides they did not have a good time of being well developed for us to care about these characters, one of the characters who suffered most from this was Kaede, even if she was the most superficial character could explore very well the issue of bullyng she suffered. Now the protagonist, I will confess the comedy has worked a few times because of him, is the kind of shameless character, who has good answers certain times, but greatly abused these jokes with the protagonist, getting very dull and losing grace very fast. His actions were very dubious at times, for through his reaction he did not seem to mind much, it was even odd at certain times.\\n\\n\r\n(Art,Animation = 6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe trace is pretty mediocre, sometimes even inconsistent, the character design is pretty bad, there are times when the characters are very identical. The scenery felt good, but nothing much, as well as its animation.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound = 3/10)\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Bunny Girl, the ost they play are pretty weak with repetitive piano taps with no impact at all, except that the silence often used in anime was the worst choice. The dubbing was terrible, I feel that the voice actors did not feel like dubbing this anime, I never felt such an empty and superficial character contributing so much to the dubbing badly done, it affected the protagonist very much, his actions, both dramatic ones, as in the jokes that he did, it did not seem real, they were completely empty, some times his voice was sleepy, and without ost, it was almost an invitation for me to sleep.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall = 5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI had to do this review that is very overrated here in MAL, in addition to showing my disappointment that I had with this work that created hype for being the creator of Sakurasou. Overall it was annoying to accompany this show, even with its problems if it was fun would be another experience, now when it gets difficult to watch each episode is complicated.\\n\\n",

I won't go as far as to call it plagiarism, but the parallels between this series and those like Monogatari or Haruhi Suzumiya are glaring enough that you start to question whereyou draw the line between wearing your influences on your sleeve and just trying to be them.\\n\\n\r\nOn some level, I understand why people are enamored with the show, because not everything about it is terrible.

Unfortunately, I feel like most of the time the writer didn't understand explicitly what made those older series stand out to begin with and just pulled structural elements from them hoping that would replicate their success.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the big talking points I see brought up about the series is that it's got that snappy back-and-forth dialogue that a lot of people enjoy. If the protagonist is engaging with someone, you can be sure he'll have something dry and witty to say to them, and his dance partner will be more than happy to reciprocate. That's how the scenario is supposed to play out ideally in most encounters of most episodes. It'll be played for laughs and will be used to endear us to the characters; they're like us, they're young, hip, and have that cynical internet humor going for them. This really only works, though, if the characters are being genuine about it. In most exchanges, the conversations come off as a some type of low energy defense mechanism (if that's the right way to phrase it) for the protagonist to continually reassure us that he is in fact as cool and smart as he plays himself off to be, and no person or event can shake him from that. His lack of vulnerability and the need for him to come out on top of all the verbal tussles leaves him feeling less like an actual person and more like a self-insert character prop. Even in situations where he feigns defeat, it's a win, because his concession is usually to something like being very attracted to a genuinely attractive girl, so that he can catch them off guard with how blunt he's being and regain control of the situation. In similar IP, side characters would be able to take advantage of this, but because Sakuta is consistently portrayed as the most intelligent character in the show, none of them are able to do anything with it. There's no chemistry or authenticity involved in an interaction (at least when it's the only type of interaction) that's primary narrative purpose is to remind us how cool and untouchable we should think the main character is. Imagine the most lopsided game of cat and mouse you've ever seen, but the mouse keeps coming back to play in spite of the knowledge that it has no hopes of ever winning, and is just there to make the cat look cool in front of his friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, when you get down to it, how knowledgeable Sakuta is framed to be is the show's biggest Achilles Heel. In a narrative sense, there's very little dramatic tension involved in the specific supernatural trouble each arc centers around, because once we know who it's about and what their symptoms are, Sakuta is able to tell them roughly how they could go about fixing it during their first interaction to immediately follow. The arc only continues because the person being given the advice doesn't take it right away. Once they've come to grasp that exact same piece of social understanding that we've known since the outset, the arc comes to a close. This happens in 3-4 of the 5 central stories presented, depending on how you argue the Mai segment (the Kaede arc being the sole exception). You would expect, then, if there isn't a lot of tension surrounding that portion of the conflict, the vast majority of the substance would be related to the show's thematic core and the surrounding character drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of that thematic cohesion in relation to the emotional payoff of each arc is pretty variable. Sometimes, the show will surprise us with segments like the Kaede arc, where she struggles for self betterment largely as an individual, and in a way that seems emotionally honest, providing us with what is probably the best character the show has. Her motivation and want to improve seems largely good natured, and she's willing to put in her own work with the help of those surrounding her without taking their instructions verbatim on how to get to the destination. Weird, I know, but the show is most successful when it lets the characters explore their problems to their logical conclusion in a way that doesn't feel like their hand is being held (which is especially ironic, given that Kaeda is the one that requires the most literal physical assistance of any of the cast). For every moment like this, though, we have things like the Nodoka arc or the Futaba arc. The former of which largely ignores what could have been it's most interesting narrative conceit in the exploration of Toyohama's relationship with her mother, and the latter, which undercuts any emotional payoff the viewer might have by letting Sakuta fix all of Rio's problems for her.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's core, Bunny Girl wants to be a show that has something to say about the subtle ways people interact with each other. It wants to say that you should try to strike a healthy balance between being honest with yourself about your feelings, playing an active role in how other people perceive you, and that remembering to temper those concerns with some degree of care, hoping not to get too swept up in the fleeting emotions of your peers doesn't make you a bad person. Because these things are told to us through the lens of Sakuta, though, the way they're discussed isn't especially nuanced. Often times his solutions to problems feel incredibly reductive and leave almost no wiggle room for the complexity of the emotions of the other involved party. A lot of it boils down to \"just kind of be honest and get over it\". Even late in the series, when we finally see Sakuta's armor crack a little, the tone of the scene featuring it soured the scenario for me a bit, as if to say that he can't feel those terrible sad emotions because it made him less cool, and stoic cool dudes don't feel those emotions, bro.\\n\\n\r\nA level of that attitude is to be expected, though, since characters like Sakuta are likely made to appeal to a common type of person in the anime community. High school aged guys who are kind of jaded and can't identify with the normal harem protagonist due to those characters' social ineptitude, but haven't matured enough yet to realize they aren't always the smartest or funniest person in the room. I tried to make that sound less insulting, but what are you gonna do, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, that's basically what this show is. It's average looking. It's music is mundane. It's character arcs are more miss than hit. And It's all told to you from the perspective of a guy you probably wouldn't want to be friends with because of how high he is on himself, even if he insists that he isn't. There was a lot worse you could have chosen to watch in 2018, but there was a lot better, too.",

I mean it was decent, and the beginning of this anime made me watch more of the show. Although I did like it at the very start, there was one pattern I hated throughout the show, a problem occurs, the MC has to solve it and it's left with a few minutes without any issues before it goes on to a new problem. Well that's the biggest flaw in my opinion, although I can very much see why someone would enjoy this kind of anime.\r\nStory: Got littleto say about the story, already talked about what I did- and didn't like..\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was decent, however not great. Much like many others I believe.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I mean, the music was great and all, on the other hand the opening didn't sound that good to me which also weighed down the score of this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I mean they have their own tastes which I kind of enjoyed, but the irony wasn't all that funny to me. I mean they're special and unique in its own way.

            "content": "Bunny Girl Senpai did not deserve the hype it got. I wasn't even to finish the anime, as every time I watched it, I would just get so overly bored. I would not be able to finish a single episode without looking away, checking my phone, or just plain ignoring everything in it. The first 3 episodes were alright, and captured my attention. But after that it all went downhill. The only good part about this anime was Koga, as she is a very well made character who I think deserved to be the main girl. \r\nAs for Mai, she was alright in the beginning.After a while though she grew dull. I never really liked her tsundere act she tries to pull off, and I hate how she treats Sakuta with so much disrespect. Now, I think if Koga or one of the other girls had been more in the spotlight, the anime would have been so so so much better. For instance, Koga (despite her basically being a highly disliked character) was truly in love with Sakuta, and was willing to relive the same day over and over, no matter how boring it got, just so she could be with him longer. She cherished him, and didn't take him for granted. She also treated him well, and gave him lots of love. While Mai ended up leaving him for her work (yes, I know puberty syndrome blah blah, she needed to be famous or else she was invisible), Koga stayed there, as did all the other girls with arcs. It highly bothers me how Mai treats him as well. She blows him off all the time, gets mad at him a lot, and basically makes him chase her cause she is oh so special..\\n\\n\r\nNow, the one thing I loovveedd about this anime was the art style. I thought the art was very pastel colored, which happens to be something I adore in anime (like Your lie in April, or Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid..). The art was actually what made me want to watch this, other than the fact that omg there is a bunny girl so hot wowowowow. \\n\\n\r\nA quick thought, I think this anime is similar to Charlotte. But wayyy worse. Charlotte was actually a great anime, and I loved it. It wasn't much about puberty syndrome, but it was about gaining shitty super powers while you're going through puberty. Yet, the characters in Charlotte are soo much better, and the story line there was fantastic! In Bunny Girl Senpai it was dull, and seemed to be the same thing over and over. \\n\\n\r\nThis may just be personal preference, as I have friends who just adore this anime and think so highly fo Mai..but I just never was able to enjoy it.",

            "content": "I'm not one who normally writes reviews but Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is so good I just had to write one. Not very refined since it's my first review but it's spoiler-free and briefly covers the aspects that I really liked. \r\nStory: 10, Art: 9, Sound: 10, Character: 10, Enjoyment: 10, Overall: 10\r\nRight from the very first episode, this anime had me hooked and I knew I was in for good. We are presented with Sakuta, the male main character, and 6 beautiful girls. Sounds like a generic harem anime? For starters, there are some mild sexual jokesand a bit of fan service, but after finishing the 13 episodes I can tell you that it's not, but rather, these elements merely serve as light refreshment. This anime has so much more as their strong points and has earned its spot as my top 3 anime ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe 6 girls have their own arcs to describe their respective problems, caused by the so-called \"puberty syndrome\" and they overcome the problems with the help of Sakuta. I truly enjoyed the character-driven story, the pacing, and how the characters manage to cope with their problems. Their actions are realistic and felt natural. I'm fond of the dynamics and casualness of the relationship between the characters, particularly the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship of Sakuta and Mai and the brother-sister relationship of Sakuta and Kaede. \\n\\n\r\nI must praise the writers for the in-depth dialogues that are very well written and smoothly presented. Kudos to the voice actors as well as they successfully delivered the emotions of joy, excitement, anger, fear, frustration, sadness, sorrow, depression not in the over-the-top way; a reason why it's a fresh breath of air. In the end, they're very engaging and managed to captivate my attention. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but not the best one out there. CloverWorks managed to portray the gestures and emotions very well. But another strong point here is the sound. The music themes fit really well to the respective scenes, they boost the melodramatic atmosphere and give more immersion to said scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime is worth watching if you're interested in 1) stories that revolve around psychological stress, how they impact someone, the coping mechanism, and how the affected one resolves them and finds solace in others 2) excellent dynamics between the characters and good character development supported with well-written dialogues, great voice acting, and soundtrack that really fit the emotions, and 3) tearjerker anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, the creators use a lot of metaphors and symbolism, which I think are beautiful, and again, add deeper meaning to some scenes. Some are subtle; easy to miss, but once you come to the realization, they hit you hard. \\n",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou Wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai has to be the most overrated anime of the season. Opinions are divided, there are people who think this is a masterpiece, and others think this is shit. I am kinda between the middle but towards the latter. The main issue here is whether the main protagonist Sakuta is a cool guy or just a pure asshole. Although I hate Sakuta, I can get why people at first glimpse think he is the protagonist-of-the-season, on the surface, his dialogues are pretty badass and seems cool, but when you use your critical faculty to analyse,you realize that Sakuta is a completely ridiculous character that absolutely makes no sense at all. This review will explain to you why Sakuta is not a good character and why Bunny girl is an overrated anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:1\\n\r\nI'll begin the review with the most pathetic aspect of the show, its characters. I will mainly about Sakuta, he is the root of all problems with the show, the embodiment of the unrealistic nature of the show. \\n\r\nNow Sakuta is a high-school student that is not smart, not particularly handsome, there are rumours about him using violence (tho later on it is explained it is not the case) and he doesn't care about many things, including how other people view him and he did not really have a serious in-depth relationship before. Keep in mind these traits, because I will use them to show just how contradictory Sakuta is. First of all, I also don't give a shit about many things, but his \"doesn't-give-a-shit\" is on a different level. I don't know if you have ever had a relationship before at highschool, but if you do, then  you realize how ridiculous Sakuta is, he can say stuff like \"I want to go to bed with you\" without even blushing, in fact he never feels nervous or any emotion at any point at all, remember, he is not dating just any ordinary girl, not even just any beautiful girl, but the superstar of his age. Now Sakuta is an ordinary person, not only is he ordinary in terms of appearance and his academics, there are bad rumors about him, which make it worse. This fact makes it completely unrealistic for him to act as if nothing is happening when dating the Bunny Senpei. There is no way, really, how he can feel no pressure at all, remember his no expert at dating, he had only one relationship according to the show before and is not explained in the show at all, but even if he is an expert, this whole thing feels fake and there is no way to relate to and emotionally invest in this show. But, why, do so many people actually enjoy the show and think Sakuta is so cool? Let's talk about his lines, all his interactions with girls are vulgar and bold. He would shout out that he is virgin and teased about other girls being on period, he would kick a girl's butt and etc, etc. I can not take this seriously, this is really bullshit, there is no way how anyone at anytime would behave like Sakuta. But if you think about his dialogues, those are words that kids would think: \"oh I should have said that on that date to make me look more confident and cool.\" Yes, it looks cool from a third person perspective, but the truth, his lines are absurdly unrealistic for anyone to say. If you disagree, try them on your female classmates and they will be in love with you? no way. Everything about Sakuta is artificial. Now can you have unrealistic characters in a show then? the answer is yes if it is some sci-fi shows that is set in an alternative world, but in this case, the show is about romance that is set in modern world. if a romance show like Bunny Girl has incredibly unreal characters, I don't understand how it can be pleasing to view; not only that, romance shows' conversations are important in order to make audiences feel emotionally invested, but Bunny Girl's conversations are awful, Sakuta's monotonous vulgar lines really make me sick, and people think this is cool. Sakuta looks like a corpse to me most of the time, he doesn't give a shit about anything and don't want to explain about rumors about him and just let it happen. I wonder if he even cares about how people would view his girlfriend. Let me tell you something, in reality, people start to think:\" why does Mai date with such a unfunny and boring guy? Does Mai really have that low standard?\" but apparently Sakuta can't be bothered to explain and he continues to be this boring, offensive asshole through the entire show with zero character development, as ridiculous as Sakuta is, girls fall in love with him one after another. People who enjoyed the show aren't really enjoying the romance aspect of the show, they are enjoying imagining themselves being a guy that speaks in the most bold and coarse way possible while girls keep falling in love with him. \\n\r\nWhy isn't sakuta punished for his offensive lines then? the show greets you with Mai, the most unrealistic heroine I've ever seen, A teen star who exhibits little anxiety, she is sick of attention but that never manifests in her personality at all. Is comfortable with all the dirty lines from sakuta, has very little self-aware being a teen star, dresses like a bunny girl with no other intention then to provide a huge clickbait (which by the way, was completely forgotten once the story moves forward). She is okay with his boyfriend pretending to be the boyfriend of another girl, and okay when asshole sakuta can't be bothered to explain his intimacy with the said girl. god, kill me plz, i've never seen a character so absurd other than sakuta.\\n\r\nOkay, let me say this, she is a perfect waifu, yes, we know that, but do you really think she is a good character? a realised character? \\n\r\nthis show is a fantasy, and all characters are served for that purpose. Not to mention the abysmal character development of all other characters:  a girl who developed a crush on sakuta and appeared five seconds after her arc just so we know she isn't dead. Futaba who showed up whenever necessary to explain her stupid quantum mechanics, please, do yourself a favor and go back to look at the way she speaks before her arc and after, do you see any character development? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAnimation is not really consistent through out, like the beginning of ep 12 has some facial distortion, it happens here and there. So it is worth a 7. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI do enjoy the op and ed, however, Sakuta's monotonous speaking is really vomit-inducing, he never changes the way he speaks, again, can you imagine such a guy with no emotions expressed entire time be the same guy that flirt masterfully with girls? if you can, then you need a reality check. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nYou have the synopsis anyway so I wouldn't write a summary on this. Instead I'll talk about the positive and negative aspects of the story:\\n\r\nFor the bad parts:\\n\r\n1. The show spends more than ten minutes every two or three episodes explaining pesudo-science to account for the puberty syndrome in the same setting, that is, futaba's lab. This is really boring and unnecessary, you know not any of these explanations are valid anyway. The show tempts to explain something fictional using actually science theory, this is ridiculous, it could be handled much better by just coming up with some fictional explanation. \\n\r\n2. Characters are either stereotypical or unrealistic, we have younger sister with a brother complex, a girl that looks chill but has a soft side, a cute type of girl. I don't find these character designs exciting. \\n\r\nThe good thing is:\\n\r\n1. This show has a generally good theme by solving puberty problems are atleast teens would have in reality. This show would be much better if characters are more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe first few episodes can be enjoyable but the more I watch, the more I feel it is painful to watch more. This is because the more arcs it introduces, the more cliche I feel Sakuta's way of handling issues are. Also again, Sakuta's conversation and tones can be exciting at first glimpse, but as the show proceeds, there is a point at around ep 8 where I feel I can't tolerate his way of speaking any more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:4\\n\r\nI don't hate this show, this show is definitely not trash tier anime like SAO is, It could be enjoyable but don't take this seriously, withhold your suspense in order to enjoy the show, so basically, turn down your brain in order to enjoy the show.",

The story does its job perfectly not recreating the wheel instead being an engaging string for the audience to follow tugging them back each Thursday anticipating the new episode while also facilitating scenarios for the characters which are debatably the main focus of the anime, the narrative giving reason for different characters of old and new in relation to Sakuta to interact and develop relationships along with the wide variety of other impactful character moments. The narratives other effective factors are the previously stated supernatural storyline which gives flair and originality to the slice of life elements of the anime not only creating intrigue but also allowing for more in depth development of each character represented by their symptom while also the journey to overcome it. Overall due to the narrative not being anything drastically new and original though perfecting and building upon previous attempts of this narrative type creating a masterfully executed take on the genre it receives an 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters in the anime were extremely close to being masterful feeling genuine and detailed throughout the anime\u2019s seasonal run. The main character Sakuta is developed perfectly being a comprehensive and relatable figure, from strangers he\u2019s seen as emotionless and cold but the close friendship circle around him gained throughout the duration of the season view him as emotional and caring effectively doing anything and everything to help his friends and family as seen throughout each episode. The other main character Mai is similarly complex having to deal with the struggles of her career and its effects on her high school experience further added upon by her dysfunctional family and also struggles through adolescence syndrome, this allowing for in detail development of her character in relation to her history and also relationship with Sakuta featuring a beautiful romance arc over the season. The supporting cast is brilliant and similarly well developed from Kaede his anxious younger sister and her past and present struggle through adolescence syndrome to Nodoka who is insecure of her own abilities as an effect of always being compared to her older sister Mai. Due to the lovably ensemble of characters featured throughout the series and comprehensive development displayed overall the characters are a high 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe music which accompanies the anime is one of my favourites in recent memory with a distinct op clearly representing and reflecting the themes and mood of the show with accompanying visuals only adding to the experience. This can be similarly said with the ed having so much care and attention put into it such as the changing vocals depending on the arc from the episode similarly with the visuals. The Soundtrack which accompanies each episode is also noteworthy having a wide variety of pieces that capture the mood and add to the experience leaving me with an extremely tough choice for the music to use in this review. Overall due to this it receives a tremendously deserved 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is absolutely masterful in every single element it portrays throughout the season and is well deserving of a 9/10 leaving the anime community in anticipation of the upcoming movie.\\n",

            "content": "In short, the reason i dropped this is that the only thing I actually liked about the show is Sakuta's banter with Mai but, that wasn't a good enough for me to continue watching. \r\nFirstly, there is the entire reason I'm an anime fan in the first place. Animation is capable of conveying emotions in a way that live action doesn't. BGS however, uses the medium for one visually interesting scene in the first 5 episodes. Apart from this, there were no shots that i find even remotely interesting to look at, with directing that feels flat to me and character animation that fails toconvince me of genuine feelings.\\n\\n\r\nGood visuals aren't everything though and good stories don't necessitate impressive visuals to keep me engaged. Unfortunately, there are several aspects of Bunny Girl's plot and execution that didn't gel well with me. Most importantly, the solutions of Bunny Girl's supernatural problems aren't very compelling. Both Mai and Koga get saved from their problems by Sakuta and I don't like that. I find stories of how they overcome their problems much more engaging than a love confession and Sakuta beating a guy up (I know that's not the actual conclusion but, from what i heard the conclusion is even worse). At the end of the first arc, I asked myself: what have the characters learnt from this, how have they changed, what is the lesson? None of the answers I or people I've talked to satisfy me.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story also seems fairly rushed, as if it's jumping from plot point to plot point with no time for anything to impact me, particularly when Sakuta talks about his sister's syndrome it shows the only visually interesting scene in the anime and then goes back to what they were talking about earlier which was fairly jarring. I felt a slower pace to allow for more characterisation would have benefited the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have with the anime is with the pseudo-science. This often gets brushed off as one of Futaba's character traits even but, there is no indication that Futaba is the person who doesn't know what she's talking about and not the author. If I knew nothing about quantum physics then there is no clue that Futaba is misapplying the theories - there should be a better clue than Futaba just being wrong. It also doesn't help that her characterisation up to the point i dropped it is 'science girl', so it's a fair assumption that she's the author's tool for exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me on to my next issue: the characters. \\n\\n\r\nFutaba is an extremely boring character with seemingly no depth (I've read about her later development and it's very much a case of \"why would i care about the problems of a drawing that I didn't like in the first place\"). She has a crush on a guy we know hardly anything about (that's already an overdone cliche) and that's everything.\\n\\n\r\nKuninimi (I think?) Is a bro, a one-dimensional bro that doesn't even have his name on Bunny Girl's MAL page or any real screen time but he's cool.\\n\\n\r\nHis girlfriend is annoying for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly annoying is Koga who happens to be the kind of person I really don't like, so it was always going to be a task to get me to like her anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKaede is Sakuta's little sister.\\n\\n\r\nSakura himself is relatively smart, charismatic, witty, a nice guy, apparently good in a fight, gives great life advice, is smooth with the ladies, works part-time to help support himself and his sister, is the sole caretaker for his sister and lacks any convincing flaws that make him seem human to me. The story seems to be afraid to question his views and expose any insecurities or weaknesses he has. I've been told that he later gets called out on his behaviour but, the story hasn't given any consequences for this.\u00a0 \\n\\n\r\nA good writer, in my opinion, should put a character in a situation where we can see these parts of their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nMai is an Ok character. She's a tsundere pretending to be a kuudere but, there really isn't enough to sell me on her character. For instance, how did she feel when her mother forgot she exists? How does she feel about it now? \\n\\n\r\nThere are also two other aspects that fail to move me in this show. The OST exists, probably, I can't remember any of the music. Then there's the voice acting. I just don't like how monotone it is. It makes any lines that aren't best suited to monotone like sarcastic comebacks either sound boring or lacking in emotion.",

            "content": "So Far in just 3 episodes, this anime has done an outstanding work. Probably going to be added to my favorites list soon after it ends. \r\nStory/Plot: 10\r\nvery amazing and intriguing. The plot is way deeper than I thought. the theme of the series that it portrays is that us teens and basically the whole society lives and believe things by with rumors and the so called \"everyone\" thinks, without trying to look for a different outcome/answer. and how easily everyone goes with the flow and switch their mindsets/thoughts on specific subjects by the mood of the atmosphere. And how the illusions shown by unstablepsyches or strong preconception that come from adolescence is basically our society today. But at the same time the way to alter any given atmosphere is to break norms, and present an independent perspective while also making a statement big enough for people to recognise, validate and internalise. So the only way to alter the atmosphere is a big show of social unconventional but relatable perspective, so its a huge power of love and friendship cop out, their their going to have to keep repeating\\n\r\nInteresting... very interesting.... the author is a genius\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is nothing bad and nothing too special. I guess you can call it your average anime art. good thing there are no Bad CGI in this one tho. But you can say that the art is wonderful especially the sunset part, that was pretty. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI have to say, the studio did a great job on the OSTs and it was really great listening to it while watching the anime. It really created mood and how the author intended the scene to be like. \\n\r\nBut to be honest, The Opening Theme Song (OTS) is just Horrendous. That why I graded this sound part as a 7 and not a 8. But the Ending Theme Song (ETS) is fairy Good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI think the way the characters were set up as were really nice, and they got to preserve the character traits without breaking it. The author even made sure that the characters stick to their intended traits - this was shown when Mai slapped poor Sakuta. Instead of acting in the spur of the moment (she's still human, she did tear up but quickly composed herself), she came up with a rationale decision instead of going all tsun on him (thankfully) as we commonly see in many other animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching the first 3 episodes of this anime. the first episode really got me into the story and couldn't wait to watch the next episode. After watching the first 3 episodes, it really made me think over our society today and how we are not seeing things that are pretty obvious and how easily people forget things because of one twitch to the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nTo wrap it up, I really enjoyed watching this and recommend this anime to all. \\n",

            "content": "Butayarou: It's Bakemonogatari, but instead of mental illness being represented by folklore or magical entities, mental illnesses here manifest themselves as sci-fi weirdness known as \"Adolescent Syndrome.\" This includes things like time loops, retroactive erasure from reality, characters splitting into two... Some really interesting concepts that can work really well to explore the concepts of identity and self.\r\nUnfortunately, it sucks. \r\nThis is what happens when you rip off a successful work, but fail to capture the essence of what actually succeeded the first time around. It results in some of the most banal, hackneyed trash I've seen in an anime in a long time, allglossed up like it's destined to be the next big hit when in reality it's got about zero appealing factors.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we gotta address the cast. By that I mean, they just don't exist beyond two-sentence stock summaries, most of them lifted directly from Bakemonogatari. The protagonist is sardonic and cynical, but also goes out of his way to protect everyone. Check. The main girl is a tortured and reserved tsundere who opens up quickly after her initial problem is fixed. Check. There's the nerdy glasses girl who seems to know literally everything, but has a secret romance-driven pain deep in her heart that manifests by splitting her personality in two. Check. There's the cute kouhai who is driven to great jealousy by the protagonist's relationship. The only \"new\" characters is the little sister, who is a stock personality herself, but not one stolen from a Nisioisin book, and an idol who really doesn't have much presence.\\n\\n\r\nEach of these main characters has their own character arc problems that need to be solved, and of course they always involve some supernatural occurrences (except for the sister's, but I won't go into that one because it's just too poorly done). BIG PROBLEM THOUGH: the arcs aren't interesting! The characters aren't interesting! It's all paint-by-numbers high school life!\\n\\n\r\nWe have such good sci-fi elements that get only the most cursory use, never delving anywhere past the surface level. There's a body swap story arc where two characters are forced to assume each other's lives, but it leads to one emotional outburst and mainly some hijinks. There's characters stuck in a time loop, but to only one end, and that is some wacky dating hijinks. A character accidentally creates a copy of herself, and so now two of herself are wandering around the world living as independent beings. But rather than exploring that concept of identity, it's just treated like a hurdle for the writers to get past; they don't want to deal with the sci-fi parts, they just want to get back to the kissing (of which there is none, spoiler alert). \\n\\n\r\nIt took me a while to realize what makes Butayarou a failure while ripping off from only the most successful anime of the past decade-- the characters aren't given enough depth beyond their stereotypes, but why? I know why. The protagonist, the main dude, takes away all the spotlight. The female characters have zero agency in their own story arcs, because the protagonist solves all their problems for them. In Bakemonogatari and its sequels, Araragi does his best to help his friends, but in the end, the characters only fix their problems of their own accord; the only character who was saved entirely by Araragi turned out much worse later down the line as a result. \\n\\n\r\nHere, the protagonist does all the work. The first girl is saved because the main guy learns to overcome his own feelings of awkwardness and put himself out there. The second girl is saved after the protagonist forces her to confess her inadequacies. The third girl is saved by the protagonist arranging everything to force her to see herself clearly. And so on. No agency means it's not interesting, and we can't actually explore a character's identity if their arcs have been snuffed out by a poor narrator. \\n\\n\r\nThe very last story arc is so bad that the big giant emotional plot twist was so obvious, so hackneyed, that I didn't see it coming. This was not an uncommon occurence in Butayarou. Every single time that there was something interesting the story could do, it instead resolved itself to have some sort of ridiculous plot twist to push itself back towards the normal Light Novel Quasi-Harem High School Drama status quo, and nothing ever actually changed but some of the characters seem to like each other a bit better now. \\n\\n\r\nStay away. Just rewatch Bakemonogatari and be done with it.",

            "content": "A couple of days ago I binged through \"Bunny Girl Senpai\" and thoroughly enjoyed it. It wasn't until I came to this page that I saw the discussions about it being similar to \"Bakemonogatari\", up to and including accusations of blatant plagiarism. As luck would have it, \"Bakemonogatari\" was near the top of my PTW list, so I decided to watch it and see for myself how similar they were.\r\nThe two series have some notable similarities. Both have a male lead who thorough a series of 2 to 3 episode story arcs aids a series of female characters who have been experiencing a variety ofsupernatural/paranormal phenomena that are messing up their lives. In both cases, the male is something of an outcast who has been through something similar himself who can't help wanting to aid these girls with their struggles. Also in both, he gets into a romantic relationship with the first girl, who then proves to be understanding and supportive when he comes to the aid of other girls.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, however, there are huge differences between the two. The art style and atmosphere is the most glaring difference; \"Bunny Girl Senpai\" is set in a realistic (albeit animated) world, whereas \"Bakemonogatari\" has a much more arthouse/impressionistic feel to it, often dark but at times whimsical and farcical. \"Bunny Girl Senpai\" stays pretty much in the realm of emotional drama whereas \"Bakemonogatari\" ventures much closer to horror territory, with some scenes portraying blood and graphic violence. The nature of the supernatural/paranormal phenomena differs between the two. \"Bakemonogatari\" has themes of vampirism, and the phenomena are portrayed as demonic curses of some sort, whereas there's nothing of the sort in \"Bunny Girl Senpai\", where some are tied to concepts of a more scientific nature, such as Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat or Laplace's Demon. It also bears mentioning that the use of supernatural/paranormal phenomena as story elements are not unique to these two series. They are also central themes in other series such as \"Kokoro Connect\" and \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", and feature less prominently in other stories such as the series \"Clannad\" or the film \"Your Name\".\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, while \"Bunny Girl Senpai\" and \"Bakemonogatari\" have some notable similarities, they have enough differences to preclude any claims of copying. To say they are alike would be like claiming that chefs on the Food Network show \"Chopped\" made the same dish just because their dishes included the same four mystery basket ingredients.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is supposed to be a review of \"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\", I suppose it behooves me to actually review it. I came into the series thinking it was a quirky romantic comedy, which isn't very accurate, but I soon found the show enjoyable enough for what it was. The characters introduced in the first story arc were engaging and likable, making me want to see how that situation played out. There were a couple of moments, especially one in episode 3, that were so over the top that I briefly toyed with dropping the series, but I'm glad I didn't, as the characters and situations explored in later episodes proved to be just as engaging as those we meet early on. The art and visuals were well done, as was the audio and the musical score. All in all, it's a well done and highly enjoyable series. It covers the first five volumes of the associated light novels; I shall be looking forward to the forthcoming film that covers the next two volumes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I also recommend \"Bakemonogatari\".",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that i did enjoy the series  before i start jabbing at it. just because i jab at it doesn't mean i don't like it. and most of you don't seem to know what a review is but boy do you know how to rant. Am i good at it? No, (at least i'm probably not) but you can at least try to not cry about it, write the damn \"review\" and move on!\r\nanyway.\r\n Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai AKA Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai \r\nAAKA Bunny Girl Senpai (becauseshorter titles are just easier for for our wee little brains to comprehend) \\n\r\nis your stereotypical mushy love story interjected with dry and sometimes sarcastic  comedy that  may go  unnoticed or unappreciated and honestly a lot of the time i found this to be true. Yeah it got a good chuckle out of me a time or two but it wasn't the typical japanese slapstick that i'm used to when i see an anime with the \"comedy\" tag but it felt like that was just there for show, to see how long we'd watch before realizing that it's not your run of the mill comedy that most of us are probably use to by this point, though i applaud it for trying. *insert sarcastic single clap here*\\n\\n\r\n The story seemed a bit repetitive to say the least, puberty syndrome (aka middle school syndrome and about a hundred other names for this) problem is presented, our main hero boy questions what's going on, comes to a conclusion with his little science friend and *insert witty, mildly philosophical speech here* and YAY! problem solved! rinse  and repeat until about episode 10 or 11 and you got yourself a show! All that being said the art, and animation was pretty good over all, i mean it didn't wow me or anything, it was the typical big eye, small mouths and rosy cheeks that artists have  been using for years now, nothing really stood out as particularity eye catching. same for the sound design , i mean yeah there was a pop song in the middle of the series and that spiced things up for a moment but, again, not something i was super impressed by. The characters on the other hand! ... weren't impressive either they all kinda of stayed the same in the end, yeah they had their moments but at the end of the day they go back to their average life in high school, not being all that changed the next time around, yeah,  i assume they learned their lesson(s) but they go back to acting almost the same afterwords more or less. Sakutais is your favorite stoic, witty, slightly philosophical, mild douche bag with a dry sense of humor(which is why he's my favorite character) Mai is your stereotypical cold and distant \"hot girl\" that turns out to be (not so) surprisingly warm hearted when you take the time to get to know her  with a slightly sensible head on her shoulders,  then you you have the seemingly stoic no nonsense cute brainy girl that'll throw a joke in the mix that'll probably zip past if you aren't paying attention. not to mention the \"best friend\" that is hardly there and the little sister that that just wants to bed her brother but he ain't having any of it.\\n\\n\r\n Even after of that being said, i did find myself enjoying it in the end. \"but why!\" you may be wondering after typing up the worlds longest paragraph throwing jabs at it. Well you see the answer is fairly simple, it had an odd charm about it that i found amusing that compiled me to keep watch it even after noticing that it was a \"rinse and repeat\" kind of anime. \"oh no! i soled the sheets! oh that's fine, we'll just plop this in the wash and they'll be good as new!\" seemed to be the general idea of the show, even so, i kept coming back to see how papa Sakuta was going to clean up the mess this time. I found it somewhat enjoyable waiting to see how everything played out knowing in the end it would end with some life advise and hugging it out. Though i wish that it didn't pull as many punches in the feels department but then again maybe i'm just  a masochist. \\n\\n\r\n Long story short , not knowing what \"puberty syndrome\" shenanigans was going to happen next and how they were gong to fix it kept me coming back. That and maybe the fact that i'm a hopeless romantic and loved seeing how that mushy shit played out is why i liked it in the end. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Bunny Girl Senpai is a mushy romance story with a dry sense of humor that may or may not give you diabetes depending on how sweet you like your anime.So if this sounds like your cup of tea then enjoy, if not then sod off, if you're not sure then the first couple of episodes sets the tone pretty well for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a solid BUNNY/GIRL. now if you'll excuse me, i have a bottle of lotion to help me \"review\" some other bunny girl material.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: Ignore the negative reviews that include \"the girls have no character\", \"the protagonist cares about nothing\", and \"it's a Monogatari rip-off.\" What they anticipated was a confirmation bias and refused to give it any sort of room to do its own thing. \r\nNow, onto the review...\r\nIf I said \"toothbrush scene\", most people would be able to respond with \"oh, that scene in Monogatari that, even in-context, makes zero sense?\". Now, if I said \"Monogatari is good, but dialogue-heavy and full of PLOT\", most people would be turned-off from the series. I could understand that, too, since it's hard to marathon that series on itsown. The dialogue-heavy aspect is a bit of a \"pleb filter\" to weed out the people who have severe attention issues, and those that enjoy good characterization and easily some of the most enjoyable dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, \"enjoyable\" doesn't always translate into \"Believable\". \\n\\n\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is (hereon referred to as \"Bunny-girl Senpai\") has some of the most believable dialogue in the genre to date. Its characters feel fresh, yet predictable in how they emulate real-world behaviours. Granted, the phrase \"fiction is not reality\" is still applicable, but that means so little when the cast is so endearing. The main character, Sakuta, has a \"go against the grain\" personality that you could believe someone would possess as a result of a trauma from earlier in his life. His eagerness to help others after a mysterious girl inspired him to do so is perhaps the most uninspired, yet believable motivation coming out of a series like this. \\n\\n\r\nBunny-girl Senpai also rejects the standard tropes of the genre. In an arc where a \"beach episode\" is inevitable and the standard PLOT trope is almost expected, the series does its best to subvert by giving the obviously underage character a more modest bathing suit. The \"tsundere love interest\" doesn't have a one-day crush, but her feelings legitimately develop over an extended period of time. When the protagonist is inclined to ruin himself for her, it's played straight and as further legitimization of both their feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the gist of the series, as well. Protagonist encounters strange occurrence with a \"member\" of his \"harem\", has to resolve it, and they're thankful, but don't fall in love as if he's the first male to ever do anything for them ever. Heck, only two characters actively fall for him, one of which resolves to simply be his friend because it's better than the alternative of either never seeing him again, or testing his tolerance. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit the series opening and ending themes are perhaps some of the most catchy tunes you'll hear this season, but the rest of the show doesn't have tons in terms of ambient music that you'll recall, which is fine. A series ought to stand on its own merits in terms of writing and characterization rather than factoring in ost's. As well, the absence of \"fun chibi\" animation is refreshing, though some might also feel a bit disappointed as a result. I will say the art and animation are well-done and the models are really good. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, even if it never gets a second season or the author is content with what he's written, I would still highly recommend it. Whether as a \"jumping off\" point for Monogatari or on its own merits, I would honestly suggest you go watch this and judge for yourself!",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\r\nWow, that is quite a mouthful, but Bunny Girl Senpai works fine too as an abbreviation. This anime is great, but I`ll firstly address its shortcomings. It is Monogatari/Oregairu knockoff, but not really. Less of a knockoff of Oregairu and more of a similarity in characters, but practically a script out of the Monogatari series- Guy helps out girls that have supernatural problems. I am a big fan of the Monogatari series, but I will defend Bunny Girl Senpai because of the maturity of the themes incorporated into its arcs. A lot of people lovethe MC, Sakuta Azusagawa, but just as many people dislike his qualities as the main character. I can understand the hate, but I like him as a character. The girls are unrealistic. Oh, get over it. It\u2019s an anime, the whole premise of anime is to subvert reality. However, this show does it well, and I`ll explain why that is the case. Okay, now it's time to go over the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: Puberty Syndrome is real, and it is an effect of adolescence that occurs due to specific social circumstances. They mostly have to do with an abrupt change in one\u2019s daily life, such as switching bodies or getting stuck in a time loop. Our main character, Sakuta has an encounter with adolescence syndrome when he notices a third year senpai from his school walk around dressed in a revealing bunny girl outfit, with no one paying attention to her. Her name is Mai, and she is a popular and rising actress, which further contradicts the fact that she\u2019s being completely ignored by others. Sakuta confronts her, and after talking to her for a few days, they come to the realization that she is slowly fading out of human perception, because she had wished to \u201cgo to a world where no one could see her.\u201d The reason for this was because her mother had attempted to exploit her as an actress in order to make money. It is revealed that Sakuta has had a previous encounter with adolescence syndrome, when unexplained physical wounds plagued him and his sister after his sister was bullied online, which is why he acknowledges the existence and validity of this phenomenon. It\u2019s concluded that certain social circumstances or a certain mindset must be present to cause this adolescence syndrome. Back to the main story. Sakuta\u2019s friend, Futaba Rio, diagnoses her with \u201cSchrodinger\u2019s Cat\u201d, a quantum physics experiment that explains her situation: Mai is fading out of existence because she isn\u2019t being observed. Eventually, Sakuta brings Mai back into existence by confessing his love to her in front of the school, and having the entire school observe her existence at once. As the school year progresses, Sakuta deals with case after case of adolescence syndrome, each girl bringing a new problem to solve. I\u2019m missing a bunch of romantic details here with this summary, but this is the gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nWriting and Characters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe writing is fantastic. It has this whimsical and mysterious feel that balances lighthearted romance and comedy elements with serious social problems, with a touch of the supernatural. Sakuta and the gang make excellent banter, with conversations that feel natural and funny, and not forced. While there is a decent list of relevant characters, I\u2019ve chosen to write about the three most important ones. \\n\r\nSakuta Azusagawa has a habit of sexual harassment that is enough to turn a conversation into an amusing one, but not enough to make him a hateable pervert character like Mineta from Hero Academia. He has that antisocial persona that most MCs do, but is deep down a really good person who will come through for you, especially if you happen to be a girl with adolescence syndrome. His conversations with Mai are cute and romantic, not enough to make you disgusted at them being lovey dovey, but just the right amount you can enjoy. \\n\r\nMai Sakurajima is another solid character, being the top love interest and the \u201cmain heroine\u201d of the anime. She\u2019s an adorable tsundere that doesn\u2019t go as over the top as they all do in other anime, and she\u2019s a perfect match for our cynical but likeable  Sakuta. She\u2019s understanding, reliable, and kind, with kind of a big sister aura surrounding her, and she grows a lot as a person when her problem is resolved, because of her relationship with Sakuta. \\n\r\nKaede Azusagawa. At first glance she seems like the normal brocon little sister, but she definitely is an interesting and unique character. (Spoiler ahead.) Before she was an adorable Onii Chan loving girl, she was a normal middle schooler, but since the bullying incident and physical scarring that followed, she lost all of her memories and became a shut in, only relying on her older brother. This makes a great deal of sense, given that she has no experiences with anyone else after the incident, and it would be difficult to re assimilate her into society. She also makes an attempt at doing so by going to school independently, which is a fantastic display of character development on her part.\\n\r\nCharacter development is the name of the game in this anime. Same as Monogatari but this time, there is a specific focus of social circumstances like bullying, which is rather mature, with no offense to the Monogatari series. It is pretty rare that realistic themes like this appear in anime, but when done right make for a fantastic show. And it has done right. One of the ideas that makes anime good is its blend between reality and fiction. This is what really props up the genre of isekai, the idea that a guy grounded in reality suddenly is thrust into a fantasy world. \\n\r\nIn Bunny Girl Senpai, the balance of reality and fiction is done extremely well, with enough fiction to explain puberty syndrome but enough realistic drama to cause puberty syndrome. The idea of adolescence syndrome is handled creatively, mixing in real life ideas such as Schrodinger's cat and Laplace\u2019s Demon as the cases of adolescence. The drama is handled quite in a believable way, such as Kaede\u2019s unique symptoms tearing Sakuta\u2019s family apart, and Mai and her little sister being jealous and angry at each other growing up because they were compared to each other by their mothers. The dialogue is done right as well, with a good mix of natural everyday conversation and serious and dramatic matters. There\u2019s a running gag or two, but it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the flow of the anime, which is really good, because any dialogue that gets in the way of an anime\u2019s flow is bad dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 7.5/10 \\n\r\nMediocre, nothing that stands head and shoulders over other anime like Violet Evergarden does, and nothing too bad like a certain airing little sister show I`m not gonna mention. The animation in certain scenes is nice and fluid, such as the running animation of the opening, and the beach walking scenes of the ending. The character visuals are okay, no gorgeous, over the topic character designs to gush over for a long time, but memorable enough to recall in discussion. If the really emotional scenes of this anime were animated with extreme care for quality, it would really bring out the beauty of this anime more, but even that not being the case, it stands alone as a great anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic (Soundtracks and Opening/Ending): 9/10\\n\r\nUnexpectedly, this is where the show really takes the cake. Music, like art, is subjective to opinions, but for the sake of review I`ll talk about it anyway. \\n\r\nKimi no Sei (It\u2019s Your Fault) by the Peggies is an upbeat song that introduces every character in a quirky, slideshow like manner, which is the complete opposite of its accompanying ending song, Fukashigi No Carte (An Incomprehensible Record). The effects of the opening are reminiscent of screensavers of Macintosh computers which may seem lazy, but do not take away from the presentation of every girl, for example: the mysterious character of Shoko Makinohara, which is a very good addition, given her equally mysterious nature in the actual anime, as well as the increased screen time in the sequence of Mai Sakurajima, the Bunny Girl of the anime. Fukashigi No Carte, sung by the individual voice actresses of the main heroines, is an unique and extremely methodical ending sequence. The song itself is whimsical and gives off a mysterious and supernatural feel, and each arc has a different girl singing the song and walking towards something different. In Mai\u2019s bunny girl arc, she is seen walking towards Sakuta, her lover, and in Futaba\u2019s arc, Futaba is walking towards her friends, Sakuta and Kunimi. In Kaede\u2019s arc, rather than wearing her usual panda pajamas, she is wearing her school outfit, which she has never put on after being bullied. There is a great deal of symbolism packed into the endings, which is easily overlooked. A lot of people may not care almost at all about anime openings and especially anime endings, but Bunny Girl Senpai has some extremely well thought out and symbolic sequences for both, with fitting song choices to boot. \\n\r\nIn terms of soundtrack, the original compositions are really good. Three emotionally impactful scenes really come to mind when I think about this anime\u2019s original soundtrack. The first one is when (BIG SPOILERS AHEAD) Toga stops lying and gathers the courage to confess to Sakuta, the second one is when Mai and her little sister are arguing because each sister thought she had it worse in her home growing up, and the third, arguably the most impactful scene in the anime, is when Kaede tries to grow up from being a shut in. This particular scene really steals my heart because of the music that plays when Kaede says that she wants to go to school, a place that she has no good memories of, because she no longer wants to be a burden. The emotional impact of this particular scene had me in tears, due in no small part to the accompanying soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 8.8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is great. I honestly cannot understand or justify why people decide that the writing is bad or that the dialogue is unnecessary, or develop a firm hatred of its characters. The fact of the matter is that this is an extremely well thought out anime, from the elements of puberty syndrome to the well crafted design and role of each heroine, to the cinematography of the opening and ending songs. This is as well written as it gets when it comes to interesting anime. \\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t quite a masterpiece because it isn\u2019t a god tier piece of animation, but it is undoubtedly a good anime. The only real shortcoming is that it looks like some strange fetish anime on the cover (Mai\u2019s revealing bunny girl outfit) as well as the title. This anime stands out among the otherwise mediocre anime season, and is my clear and justified pick for anime of the season. \\n",

Development is usually few and far between characters relationships as shows only tend to make the couple \"get together\" at the very last few episodes or when the plot calls for it, butI am glad Bunny Girl Senpai tries something different. Instead of trying to focus on the \"grand world narrative\", it is nice to see a show being heavily character centric, we see the world according to the eyes of our protagonist, and we see how the characters grow alongside our protagonist, in this case, it is Sakuta.\\n\\n\r\nJust some short thoughts for this show as i doubt many people will read this anyways. Most people are probably on the love it camp. but if you don't like it, at least give it a fair rating instead of creating 20 spam accounts to give it the score of 1 and upscore JoJo's to 10.

From the start to the end of the first episode my interest was piqued, there was not a dull moment in the first episode. This is one of the most interesting animes this season.\r\nSo we all have seen your typical romance genre anime, most romance nowadays try to spice things up by adding a supernatural factor in their romance and some have succeeded but most just fall flat. But this anime did it right, the air of mystery is present all through out the first few episodes and after the end ofeach episode I had more question than answers. Yet I want more of it. The romance factor is also really good a really good blend of romance, supernatural and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are, well you guessed it, Interesting each character has their own backstory slowly being set up for later parts in the anime. Another factor that I cannot ignore is how many times I have grinned on how good the chemistry between the MCs. Their romance is something fresh and something that I haven't seen in a while in recent romance animes. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things this anime gets right is the pacing if there was a rating for pacing it would easily score a 10. Each part of the episode added more story but also added more questions. The soundtrack was beautiful and voice acting was on point. I also have to point out that they change the ending song for every character arc they are on and it makes it watching all the more worth while. Also these ending songs are sung by the voice actress of the current character in the arc.\\n\\n\r\nWith an interesting title and premise this anime has a lot to offer. And I cant wait for the next episode!",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wa Minai went under the radar for many anime watchers due to the hype for shows such as Goblin Slayer and Sword Art Online: Alicization, but it is undoubtedly one of the best shows currently airing.\r\nRomantic comedies are rarely known for having good plots or characters, especially in anime where we are commonly given a dense main protagonist and a harem to back him up. Development is almost non-existence  and the only thing that is possibly keeping the watcher going is the cute character designs.\r\nSo what makes this show different from the rest? Granted thisshow is not exactly unique in any way but it definitely is very different, and I\u2019ll explain why.\\n\\n\r\nStory: In this show we are given a main protagonist, Sakuta Azusagawa, who helps people that are suffering from what\u2019s known as \u201cAdolescence Syndrome\u201d. Adolescence Syndrome, as stated by the name, occurs in those in their adolescent stage of life and are inflicted when they experience great stress, instability, and turmoil. The show uses the Adolescence Syndrome as a way to address common problems faced by many high school students, many that you may consider relatable. But in reality, many choose to hide their problems rather than express them to others in order to solve them. In this show, those who suffer from great stress are inflicted with physical damage, in which the character is in a way forced to understand how they must solve their problems, otherwise they are unable to face society again. \\n\r\nThis sort of plot is definitely a leg up from many other cliche stories. Although only 4 episodes have released, it can be predicted Sakuta will be helping out different characters overtime, curing them of Adolescence Syndrome while developing himself as he learns about the problems many of his peers face. This is a very similar style of plot to Oregairu, TWOGK, and Kokoro Connect. But just like those shows, this show may become a repetitive repeat in which Sakuta finds someone with Adolescence Syndrome and cures them of it, unless it tries to gradually increase the severity of this disease.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Unarguably this show is highly focused on the characters that are being introduced. These characters are unique, as each one depicts a specific problem commonly faced throughout high school. Sakuta will learn of each problem and help each character out, while slowly developing himself. This is very similar to the characters of the shows aforementioned. But although the first 4 episodes of this show were quite good as well as the development of the characters, this show can easily fall and never be able to rise back to the top. As a show that is highly focused on the character, each time an arc ends, Sakuta and every new character introduced as well as the old ones must have a proper development. If only Sakuta gains development throughout the series, the other characters will become completely useless and we will be forced into an infinite story loop that will eventually cause the audience to lose interest. If, however, this loop does not occur, then get ready for one of the best romantic comedies to ever release in the anime universe.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: If you have seen my previous reviews, I do not take art as an important factor that determines how good a show is. Rather, I focus on the plot and characters, as I see art as a benefit rather than a requirement. However, this show\u2019s art is still great. The designs of the characters are quite simple, and you can feel as if you yourself are in the high school experience. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to Romantic Comedies, music isn\u2019t exactly a popular factor. The music is quite good though, especially the ending in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Rating: Overall this show has some of the greatest potential in this season. It is nice to see something different for a change, a drama that is well executed and a romantic comedy that does not focus on a dense main character, harem cast, and a selective comedic stance as well as large amounts of ecchi. However, this plot is nothing new, as we have commonly seen it in the past, especially from Oregairu, which has similar characters and a similar style of plot. If the next episodes are done well, we can have a great anime that addresses multiple and common challenges faced by high schoolers in reality, relatable and entertaining characters, and an almost unforgettable story. But if the character development fails, then this show will end up as a repetitive collection if predictable stories that is only entertaining at the beginning and progressively bores the audience into dropping the show. I have high hopes for this show\u2019s success. \\n\r\nStory:8 Art:8 Sound:8 Characters:8 Enjoyment:9 Overall:8\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I went into this anime with low expectations. I didn't think the show would take itself seriously, but my mind was immediately changed with one of the most engaging first episodes I have ever seen. The characters are developed quickly and surprisingly appear realistic. In case you live under a rock, there is an ongoing debate about who is the \"best girl\" but it's impossible to decide because there are so many! \r\nIf you enjoy moments that cut to the heart, this anime is for you. Each and every second of every scene has a purpose and it warms you more thanit probably should. The show burns through arcs at a steady pace, constantly keeping you on the edge of your seat, but somehow manages to tie everything together. There is just the right amount of tension to keep it interesting without becoming unsettling. My only critique is the so-called \"pseudoscience\" that it likes to play around with but, unless you are a psychology major, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Even with that minor flaw, the show is truly intelligent.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai wonderful, however, is the wit. The entire cast is filled with a clever vocabulary and is just waiting to use it. Every conversation makes you laugh, groan, or shed a tear, and in the end, there's nothing more I could ask for. \\n\\n\r\n~Jackun",

            "content": "Bunny Girl Senpai had a pretty interesting start in terms of reception. It feels like many people dismissed it as yet another trashy ecchi/harem LN adaptation thanks to the name and rather erotic cover art. Yet, as more people got to see it, many were quick to point out how the poor Bunny Girl was misrepresented and how it\u2019s not a generic ecchi show but actually a very thoughtful anime about problems people face during adolescence.\r\nAt first I bought that myself but after actually watching the show I have to disagree. BGS is hardly different from a run of the mill romcom. We follow Sakuta,a character that\u2019s supposed to be your normal relatable outcast with nothing special about him but shows his \u201camazing\u201d qualities when he turns out to be the only one capable of saving the girl in every new arc. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the only real gimmick of BGS comes in, the Puberty Syndrome. That\u2019s what this anime calls a mental illness brought about by unstable and stressful life of a teenager but in reality is so vague there\u2019s no point to see it as anything more than \u201cdumb thing that tried to justify more dumb shit happening\u201d. Think of it as oddities in Monogatari but if they were done extremely poorly, more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nWhole show can be broken down into arcs, each revolving around a particular girl with their own problem. Not a lot of stuff carries over though and when one girl is \u201csolved\u201d they become more or less irrelevant and stop playing a meaningful role in the story. Even the titular Bunny Girl, Mai Sakurajima, eventually starts feeling like a background decoration that only serves as an excuse to shove in more perverted jokes or romance so basic and plain it makes Naruto seem like Anna Karenina.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s get into more detail. I think for this show to be at the very least more than passable it needs to have either of two things: interesting characters that get fleshed out or developed over the course of the story or a strong gimmick with interesting mechanics that would serve as an excuse for some high concept scenarios that combine psychology and physics. \\n\\n\r\nBGS has neither of those. Main characters alone are a good example, especially considering that they\u2019re supposed to get the most attention. \\n\\n\r\nSakuta, our protagonist, is less interesting than a box with \u201cdon\u2019t put fingers inside\u201d written on it. At least with that box I wonder what\u2019s inside and with Sakuta the answer is obvious from the start, nothing. He feels more like a self-insert for chuunis and other nerds rather than a real person. A lot, if not most of his dialogue revolves around perverted, low brow jokes that also make up 90% of comedy in the show. Telling a girl how his imagination is much more perverted than she thinks he is, how he\u2019s gonna enjoy the sound of a showering girl or how he\u2019s delighted to have a cute girl step on him. These remarks never lead to anything and girls just brush them off after providing some cliche \u201cmoooou yada ;///;\u201d tier response cause he\u2019s just such a charmer. There\u2019s even an older lady reporter that just seems to want to fuck him for some reason, it\u2019s less egregious in the anime but very heavy handed in LN. \\n\r\nWhen Sakuta is not a braindead pervert he\u2019s somehow a warrior or justice. Telling off someone taking a photo of Mai without her knowing, beating up an athlete for spreading lewd rumors about Koga, threatening to call the cops on random pervert messaging Rio\u2019s twitter account and in general going above an beyond to help out any woman he sees. This is all explained by him having empathy for people who are put in a situation where others can\u2019t empathize with them, which just so happened to apply to every damsel he saves. \\n\r\nIn the end, I think his characterization as both some selfless messiah going against flow and a horny worthless teenagers is a very incoherent combination, which is part of makes him feel like a self-insert. Characters like that are often flawed but those flaws are never acknowledged and more often made to seem as something charming. It\u2019s a fantasy of being special without actually being special in any way, that\u2019s Sakuta.\\n\\n\r\nHis girlfriend, Mai, will take much less words to describe because despite being the second most important character she has fucking nothing. Her whole issue was that she\u2019s a super popular mega star and she wants to get away from that, wishing that nobody knew her. Because of this, people start forgetting her and become unable to see her. Some pseudo-science bullshit later she\u2019s completely fine again and we get to know her for who she really is, a mild tsundere. She fires off your typical \u201cI don\u2019t like this but I actually like this\u201d trite and constantly teases Sakuta. Maybe two or three times she shows some other emotions, hinting at some drama spicing up their relationship but every time it either doesn\u2019t actually matter, or in case of the ending stops mattering after Sakuta accomplishes an amazing feat of going from point A to point B using public transportation, truly nothing is impossible when you\u2019re in love.\\n\\n\r\nGoing over side characters makes things seem a lot more sad. Kunimi, Sakuta biggest friend is just there, he\u2019s a nice guy who shows up a few times to do nothing. \\n\r\nAt least his other friend, Rio, gets a few episodes but there\u2019s the same problem of bad execution. We get a few scenes showing she\u2019s loves Kunimi even though he already has a girlfriend and that causes her frustration and then show fucking jumps to \u201cI took lewd pics of myself cause I wanted attention\u201d which gets solved by Sakuta just hanging out with her and Kunimi riding a bicycle to her place after Sakuta calls him in the middle of the night. \\n\r\nKoga appears about as suddenly as she vanishes, she\u2019s a village girl who changed herself to fit in with the city crowds and worries about doing something that would hurt her reputation, that\u2019s it.\\n\r\nNodoka admires her sister, Mai, but at the same time suffers from her mother expecting her to achieve the same success.\\n\r\nMakinohara Shouko is not really a character. Apparently LNs do something with her later on but as far as anime goes she\u2019s just some entity that shows up to motivate Sakuta.\\n\r\nKaede, Sakuta\u2019s sister is terrible too but there\u2019s also another problem associated with her and a few spoilers so that\u2019s for later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the second issue. The pseudo-science or bullshit known as Puberty Syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nAs dumb as it is  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely without merit. If this part was actually developed I think the show would at least be able to invoke some curiosity simply by making you wonder what it will do next.\\n\\n\r\nBSG as is fails to do that cause of all the supernatural things that happen, none of them get any clever use. I won\u2019t even mention the mechanics of Puberty Syndrome in general cause those aren\u2019t a thing. There\u2019s no consistency to how it works or how effects manifest outside of all victims being teenagers with some frustrations or insecurities. Not like the show sticks to its own premise of Puberty Syndrome being a psychological issue because they try to explain everything with some of the dumbest faux-physics I\u2019ve seen in a while. \\n\r\nPeople can\u2019t see you? That\u2019s because Observer effect, you know? It\u2019s like with Schroedinger\u2019s Cat you know? None of those things fucking fit the situation but author will throw out those concepts regardless, seemingly just to make it seem like the work is way more complex than it actually is cause he sure as hell doesn\u2019t demonstrate any sort of understanding of the concepts he mentions. That is further cemented by the show usually forgetting it said anything about physics after initial explanation and going for a more supernatural take on things. With Sakurajima for example, this went from Schroedinger\u2019s Cat and Observer theory to \u201cshe ignored everyone at school, not wanting to avoid the attention and that made other students become unable to see her and forget memories they had of her\u201d. Sakuta at one points asks a fair question, if this is a problem with how she acts a school, why did it spread over seemingly entire country? To which the reply is something among the lines of people unconsciously carrying this \u201catmosphere\u201d with them similarly to how there\u2019s some social standards and norms that people might adhere to without realizing. A terrible explanation but at least it\u2019s not as pretentious as trying to explain it with science.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Mai fading out of existence, next story concerns what is by all means a time loop but wait, that\u2019s too simple for BGS. This ain\u2019t a time loop dude, it\u2019s LAPLACE\u2019S DEMON. Time isn\u2019t actually looping, you\u2019re just living in a simulation launched by a school girl who wants to reject a boy without making it seem like he\u2019s trash, cause her friend likes the guy. Why does a simulation loop by the day instead of only repeating relevant window of time? Why is Sakuta in it? We actually get an attempt at answering the second question, apparently it\u2019s because of quantum entanglement, just smash my head in this is dumb. \\n\\n\r\nOther cases of PS aren\u2019t nearly as severe. We get a body swap caused by jealousy/adoration, doppelganger cause by dissociating. This all feeds into the problem of these problems not only of the gimmick being rather tame but also them not being used well.\\n\\n\r\nWhen people stop to see Mai the most she tries is wearing a bunny girl outfit to make sure someone will notice her but not only does she drop that after the first time you see it but she also seems to stop any real attempts to make people notice her until convinced to do so by Sakuta. Despite people not seeing or remembering her, they can still feel her physically. While it\u2019s not a surefire way to make people remember her, it\u2019s weird how they never even tried to convince people that she exists by having her move objects in front of them, pushing and pulling people or imprinting her palm or face on something. In the end it feels like author didn\u2019t know what to do with it himself cause this is all literally solved through the power of love, somehow, Sakuta yelling about how he loves Mai gives people a reason why she would exist. \\n\\n\r\nThe apex of missed opportunities are the time loop episodes. Time loops are an excellent way to explore characters and everything resetting the next day is a really good excuse to mess with things. Look no further than Groundhog\u2019s Day for an example of how much potential this premise has. So what does BGS do with time loops? Pretty much nothing. First episode only has things repeat a few times with Sakuta at most using it to change a few conversations and not by experimenting what response his words would get but using the conclusion of the original conversation to reach it faster. Then a classic misunderstanding happens and a guy Koga was trying to avoid thinks she\u2019s dating Sakuta so the time loop breaks. After an episode of fake dating to keep the pretenses she falls in love for real and time loops again in hopes he will respond to her feelings. How does it go? Well, he just goes along with it and keeps doing the same shit until telling her \u201cstop, I won\u2019t change my mind\u201d and tells her to be herself.\\n\\n\r\nDoppelganger due to dissociating? Just be yourself. Don\u2019t feel like going back to making movies? Just be yourself. Scared to do something wrong? Just be yourself. Jealous of your successful sister you can\u2019t live up to? Just be yourself. \\n\\n\r\nNo experimentation, no depth, no creativity. If not for the two elements I talked about already, maybe in its intention to solve common insecurities of teenagers, BGS would get some points for a sincere attempt to explore these issues, but no. Psychological element of BGS is an anime equivalent of a facebook motivational pictures that recite shallow quotes of unknown, kitchen philosophers in fancy font on top of a pretty background or twitter posts that tell people that drinking water and working out will cure their depression so depressed people have no reason to whine about it. None of the issues present are shown with any sort of nuance. It\u2019s almost insulting how casually author used real things that can actually fuck people up for cheap tearjerkers while pretending that there\u2019s something more to it.\\n\\n\r\nThis peaks in final episodes relating to Sakuta\u2019s sister and I\u2019d consider what follows a spoiler if it had any impact behind it. Kaede was bullied online for not leaving a reply from her group of friends on \u201cread\u201d and not replying. I know, sounds dumb but we\u2019re talking about dumb teenagers so it wasn\u2019t too hard to accept that something like this was traumatic for her. Either way, the trauma of it makes her faint and lose all prior memories which takes a toll on her mother who straight up goes insane. Don\u2019t worry, BGS doesn\u2019t actually show the parents perspective or explain why daughter\u2019s amnesia made her mother spill her marbles, it\u2019s just there for you to feel bad about the whole thing. Sakuta keeps his cool though and comforts Kaede, telling her not to worry about who she was and thinking only about her current self. He encourages her to keep a diary and write down her thoughts, limits her from interacting with outside to avoid trauma and brings her some books and movies to keep her entertained. Until the end of the show he does pretty much nothing to fix her problem with going outside or interacting with people which lasted for TWO years until she herself wants to fix the issue due to\u2026 Sakuta bringing a bunch of girls to their apartment. Little by little she starts to push herself. Answering the phone, going a few steps outside and gradually taking it further. This actually proves effective and after fainting again she wakes up with her old memories intact but without memories of her last two years of being a shut-in. How does Sakuta react? He tells her he needs to go take a piss and books it the hell out of the hospital, crying and yelling, acting like she literally died. Not even a trace of being happy for his sister can be seen even after he more or less gets over it. What the actual fuck is this? How is your sister remembering her formative years and all the other important memories such a gigantic tragedy? I get being somewhat sad that last two years were erased but this is too much. Go and see videos and interviews of people who lost memory at older age. They don\u2019t know who they are, who people around them are. They don\u2019t know where they live or really anything around them. They look at their own photos without a shred of nostalgia simply because they have absolutely no context for them. Imaging that all the memories you hold dear and everything that formed your identity just disappearing. That\u2019s a very tragic and traumatic thing in and of itself and Sakuta acts like his sister fucking died when she gets those memories back and then we even get a montage of his sister talking as if she died too and framing her path towards recovery as some form of suicide. It\u2019s incredibly distasteful. What makes it even worse is that in the post credits sequence all of this supposedly dramatic shit is gone cause when she reads the diary she gets the knowledge of what happens and her slightly different personality is implied to have gone back to the way she was shown before. There was nothing to stop the author from setting up her past as being something she might be best off forgetting in which case a switch from positive improvement and being happy back to painful memories would be easier to see as something troubling. Why even pull this whole \u201cI cry every tiem\u201d tier shit when you\u2019re gonna act like everything\u2019s cool the next day? That\u2019s not even me decrying morals of the show but a glaring inconsistency for the sake of having manipulative melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it\u2019s not wholly bad. I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s somewhat easy on the eyes. Not too pretty and character designs are very forgettable but there\u2019s some nice scenery here and there and a few cases of good animation. In general it\u2019s very average but at least that means it doesn\u2019t get add to the garbage fire. Voice actors deserve some praise for the work on this series. If not for their heartfelt voice acting it would be impossible for me to even remotely sympathize with these poorly written characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhile show is chock full of holes it at the very least is not another case of a terrible adaptation. I\u2019ve read the first volume before watching to make sure that it\u2019s not fault of the show of not being faithful to the source material. If anything it makes it better by cutting enough excess to fill in a few extra episodes that added nothing to the narrative. At times it becomes a bit too fast in places but that\u2019s a minor flaw in the big picture. My biggest problem with the pacing was that it often didn\u2019t give any breathing room for characters to get along and make progression of their relationship more gradual but to some extent this still applies to the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nHard to say to what extent Bunny Girl Senpai nailed what it was going for considering how many people enjoyed it for it\u2019s melodrama and bargain bin Monogatari elements but I think it failed on pretty much every front. It doesn\u2019t have a single well written character, supernatural or paranormal parts of it are tame and left unexplored, melodrama constantly shits on common sense and even comedy is gets stale. That\u2019s a hard pass. \\n",

            "content": "WARNING: This review assumes you have already viewed the series in full.\r\nWARNING 2: This review most certainly WILL BE personally insulting to those who rate this series highly.\r\nYou have been warned.\r\nAh, so I return to viewing and reviewing anime after 2 years or so.\r\nAnd this series was clearly at the top of my list, based on hype and comparisons to the Monogatari series.\r\nWhere to begin..\r\nThis anime made complete sense once I stepped back into the shoes of a teenager.\r\nAnd I don't mean that I was only able to appreciate this show's profound themes of personal growth by turning back the clock to when I, too,experienced the same struggles as the show's relatable cast.\\n\\n\r\nNo, that's something I would say about actually good shows about growing up like FLCL.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean is that, once I dumbed myself back down, it became clear to me what the source was for all of the unequivocal failings of this series, especially in comparison to many shows it is frequently compared to, if not outright draws from.  It also explained the hype and controversy over this shallow husk of a series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you look at raving reviews of this series, you will find a common thread:\\n\r\n\"Based on the title and poster, you may think show seems like a shallow ecchi harem series, but you would be mistaken if that is what you came in for.\"\\n\\n\r\nLet's run that through the \"self-important teenager speak\" translator:\\n\r\n\"I am able to enjoy shows like this thanks to my superior intellect and taste, unlike you commoners who only watch anime for mecha battles and oppai.  You just lack the superior intellect and taste to appreciate a show like this, as I.\"\\n\\n\r\nCringe Central.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the various \"offerings\" of this anime to analyze how shallow and empty it is, and how it sets the trap of appearing as an intelligent, counterculture anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the elephant in the room. The titular Bunny Girl Senpai, and no doubt the main selling point of this show, despite its fans insisting they like it for the deep dialogue about Schroedinger's Cats (we'll get there).\\n\r\nShe is basically the ideal girlfriend in the mind of someone who apparently hasn't interacted with real girls much, and bases his expectations of romance based on watching anime romance.\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai comes from a long and prestigious line of popular waifus, including the likes of Kasumigaoka Utaha, Yukino Yukinoshita, and of course, Senjougahara Hitagi herself.  Dark hair, darker wit.  An actual senpai or has that dynamic.  Sardonic and witty.  Brain and Beauty. S to the male lead's M. Skyward tsurime eyes. The disproving gaze. The potential for GAP. Ara ara ufufu\\n\r\nDespite the fans' insistence that this show is not about moe girls, the series pushes you to fall in love with Mai-senpai at every turn.  \"Check out our flagship waifu,\" the show nags, \"she is basically a moe version of Senjougahara!\"  \"And, in case you get bored of her, you might be interested in our selection of: the Science Chick, the Genki Dojikko, the Childhood Friend, the LOLi Imouto, the...\"  I could go on.\\n\\n\r\nAs an undying fan of Monogatari, and as someone who firmly believes that Senjougahara Hitagi is the most genius and game-changing anime character so far in the 21st century, Bunny Girl is really not a Senjougahara clone she was clearly attempted to be.  Not even close.\\n\r\nShe's actually more comparable to Spice and Wolf's Horo, in that she is the breakout waifu who carries the show's popularity, despite fans' vehement insistence on liking the show for being \"deep.\"  And, most notably, the show's creators freely lean on their waifu status to divert attention from poor writing.\\n\r\nShe is sharp-tongued and sharp-witted (at least to teenagers) when she needs to be in order to fulfill her duty as a Senjougahara clone and cater to that aspect of the author's fantasy.\\n\r\nThis is strategically interspersed with her being inexplicably ingenue and flustered when she needs to be that way in order to pander to her status as a waifu material in the author's fantasies.  This is a downright failure on the part of the author to realize that part of what made Senjougahara so appealing to himself and everyone was the very fact that she would never do this.  Because no well-written character does this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are certain character archetypes, especially so in female anime characters.  That is an undeniable, indeed unavoidable, fact, and not necessarily a negative thing either.\\n\r\nWhat does matter is how well and how sincerely that character is written.\\n\r\nLook at the real big ones, like Rei from NGE and Faye V. from Bebop.  They are not at all free of typical anime girl tropes, including blatant fanservice.  However, this does not at all lessen the impact and dept of their characters and their influence on subsequent works.  This is because their characters are grounded in real life people's characteristics, therefor natural and consistent.  They have various flaws that even seem annoying at times, but they are ultimately memorable because they remind us of real people, despite being presented at times as pure fanservice.\\n\r\nI mean, of course, I get that their characters would be ridiculous and unrealistic when literally transferred to reality, but if there really was a person like that in a world like that, they would be realistic and consistent, and therefore interesting people. In BG Senpai, the characters are inconsistent, the world is inconsistent, and put together they are incredibly inconsistent, if rather convenient for the titillation of the authors' (and, by extension, the viewers') fantasy. This fantasy goes something like:\\n\r\n\"Effortlessly Cool Messiah Makes All The Girls Swoon, But Lo And Behold, He is CANONICALLY MONOGAMOUS with the obvious and heavily advertised ULTIMATE WAIFU. (and that's still totally deep and intellectual because there's so little visual fanservice and everyone talks so softly EXCEPT THAT ONE SISLOLI OMG)\"\\n\r\nMai-san, or rather, Bunny Girl Senpai, is based on the author's understanding of people as portrayed by various anime waifu tropes, and not at all about how people really are.\\n\r\nWell-written characters, reflecting real people, have a central motive that consistently drives them.  It may not be obvious or specific, and it may not be 100% of what's on the character's mind at all times, but it governs their thoughts and actions, as well as their character arcs.\\n\r\nThe only \"consistent\" motive BG Senpai has throughout the series is to be a titillating girlfriend to the male lead, and by extension, the author and the viewers.  The rest of her character traits fluctuate wildly depending on whatever the author at the time fantasizes would be the most adorable and romantic situations, again, based on his favorite animes, rather than real people.  Naturally, her only real character \"arc\" or \"development\" is that she increasingly becomes a more and more ideal waifu to the male lead as the show goes on.  That's it.\\n\r\nYou would argue that her big motive is to get back to her acting career, and you would be wrong.  That wish of hers is only shallowly mentioned throughout the series, whenever it would be convenient to portray the side of her that is professional and admirable.  Her actions throughout the series do not reflect this drive consistently, as she seems to be quite content being the ideal waifu to the male lead and the school idol.\\n\r\nShe doesn't stand alone as a character, but exists solely to cater to the \"ideal girlfriend\" fantasy of the male lead, and by extension the author and readers.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of her relationship with the male lead, it is the most unbelievable and cringey \"romance,\" even considering how unrealistic romance tends to be portrayed in anime.\\n\r\nTheir relationship is nothing more than a fulfillment of a fantasy in the author's mind, and by extension, male teenage viewers.\\n\r\nShe is a renowned beauty queen and a national celebrity.  And yet, she is completely reserved for the male lead.  She is a pure virgin with little experience with boys, and apparently has a special, existential, and completely unexplained link with the male lead that all but guarantees his chance with her.\\n\r\nSeriously, did you ever have those fantasies in high school where your crush is a super popular girl and you can't even approach her, but one day an apocalyptic event occurs, only leaving you and her alive on Earth?  And, as time passed, you would come to lean on each other more and more, until... yeah.\\n\r\nThat is literally how \"deep\" their relationship is.  It's the daydream of someone who's not really met girls in real life and believes that the perfect waifu can be won over in a short conversation that showcases what a unique, edgy, and intelligent guy you are.  Then she will see how different you are from all the handsome jocks and rich moviestars around her. \"Oh, my love, you are the first one to treat me like a normal girl and tell toilette jokes in front of me.  Hold me as I swoon.\"  Please wake the F up.\\n\r\nIt's a lazy romance daydream for guys who blame their unpopularity on how they're \"too intelligent compared to peers and misunderstood.  It's that cringey fantasy about how the perfect girl will somehow be swept off her feet by the sheer display of your intellect and enlightened ways.\\n\r\nThere is no \"chemistry\" between the leads.  Senjougahara and freaking Kaiki show more chemistry in 5 seconds of the Okinawa airport scene in Koimonogatari than the entire Bunny Girl Senpai.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the male lead.  I don't even remember his name, so forgettable he was.  Continuing with a common theme in this anime, Sakuta (l just looked up his name) is apparently what the author (and, by extension, male teenage viewers) fantasizes himself as.  Laid-back and comfortable with himself, apparently a high-school student who doesn't care about what others think of him?  Yeah, that's realistic.  You just know the author also had no sense of presence back in school, but it's all okay because he's like that because he's okay with it, not, you know, because he's just thoroughly unpopular.  He's friendless by CHOICE, alright?  And, despite not possessing any notable qualities, or any significant effort to grow as a person, girls are swept off their feet by these spontaneous, grand romantic gestures he occasionally whips out.  Seriously, guys, stop daydreaming.  That is not how it works, and these big romantic gestures will completely backfire on you and just be cringey as F, at least if you do it like in this show. You are not, and you don't \"identify with\" this absolutely lazy and featureless character who gets girls to fall for him by virtue of random romantic gestures that, more often than not, actually endanger the girl physically or socially in an exceedingly selfish and reckless urge to show off.  Really, go try announcing to the whole school about your undying love for the most popular girl in your school and a national celebrity, 3 days into meeting her.  See how that works out.  If you really pull that off, and you can document the event to me, I will revise this review to say \"This is the epitome of anime, and (insert your name) is a god.\"\\n\\n\r\nEven Araragi Koyomi, even freaking Hachiman, had realistic, believable reason for being the way they were.  Hachiman's character is grudgingly likable and realistic because, after those rather unrealistic and cringey outburst of selfless social suicide by Hachiman, he is shown to be agonizing over the impulsive decision, being embarrassed to death, just like any real person would.  And despite him claiming to be a loner by choice, he is clearly seen to be struggling with loneliness and insecurity, JUST LIKE ANY REAL PERSON other than some nobody's pathetic delusion of who they really are. In stark contrast, Sakuta in Bunny Girl Senpai is some kind of Nietzschean ubermensch who doesn't care about how others think of him.  He really is a loner BY CHOICE.  He is exactly what the author (and, by extension, the teenage viewers) WANT to see themselves as: being loners due to being too intelligent, too deep, too misunderstood, not at all because they are fundamentally unlikable, self-absorbed, and honestly just not popular.\\n\\n\r\nThis would go on for pages if I listed off every example of how poorly, and LAZILY written the two main characters and their relationship are.  About how the show constantly uses TEH ULTIMATE WAIFU as a get out of jail free card for covering up bad writing.  So let's discuss some other characters.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE GIRL.  I'm pretty sure her name is Futaba, but honestly don't care.  She is the \"science\" character of someone who's never interacted with real scientists and only learned science through anime.  The scientific concepts she discusses are not real science, but \"science\" for someone who only learned science through anime.  If you really thought the bits about Schroedinger's Cat and LaPlace Demon were \"deep\" and \"intellectual,\" I feel really bad for you because you are apparently an unpopular daydreamer who ALSO has bad grades.  There is really nothing going for you, my friend.  At least unpopular nerds who are actually smart get a second chance in college and a third chance in working life.\\n\r\nAnd I say that not to be mean, but in complete faith that nobody, not even the people who like the show, would be so clueless as to find one iota of scientific, philosophical, or otherwise cognitive stimulation from the \"Science Talks with the Science Girl\" segments.\\n\\n\r\nTHE POPULAR ATHELETIC FRIEND.  I don't even vaguely remember his name, and honestly it would have made zero difference if he was introduced as \"token popular friend -kun.\"  Literally the only reason for his existence is to establish that Sakuta is indeed \"unpopular by choice.\"  He CAN easily hang out with the cool kids, if he wanted to, but he DECIDES not to because he is already at peace with his spot in the teenage social tapestry.\\n\\n\r\nNotice a trend here?  Every character and every interaction in this show exists to further facilitate the author's (and, by extension, the teenage viewers') fantasy of being this cool, suave, naturally charismatic guy, who is too intellectual and mature to play the social game, NOT, let me remind you again and again, because they simply lack the qualities that make popular people popular.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about the failings of this show, but I am surprised by how long it's already gotten just from the few examples off the top of my head.\\n\\n\r\nUgh, actually, let's do just one more, since it's a biggie:\\n\r\nKaede the \"I'm not a loli imouto\" (more like LOLimouto)\\n\r\nBros, this is NOT how you write a character arc.\\n\r\nFirst, there is no argument against the fact that her character's sole purpose is to pander to the loli little sister fantasy in the author's mind.\\n\r\nI already hear the outrage: 'But no, she has a tragic back story as the victim of the Adolescence Syndrome.\"\\n\r\nFirst of all, if you want to portray a sympathetic little girl sadly afflicted with a mental disorder, you DON'T nicely package that \"mental disorder\" in a kawaii panda outfit and market it to the siscons, with direct explicit incest tease lines thrown in.  Aww, the poor girl has cancer; let's dress her up and blow up our Instragram. For the majority of the show, Kaede is NOT portrayed as a poor trouble little girl whose childlike mannerisms are the result of a tragic incident.\\n\r\nNo, she is either a fetish bait for people who are into siscon/lolicon. And for people who are not into that, she is basically a Jar Jar Binks who speaks several times louder than every other character in an annoying and unrealistic baby girl speak, while not contributing anything to the story.\\n\r\nThere is no foreshadowing or plot-relevant mention that her Syndrome is causing her to behave in this unrealistic, annoying manner.  You are apparently supposed to just roll with it and see her as an adorable object of your sisconic love, until the very end, when oh, apparently that part of her dies, and we have a moment of silence for the passing of the imaginary 2-year old lolibait.  \\n\r\nThe only reason I found her character unsettling and disturbing was because it was actually unsettling and disturbing, NOT because the show hinted at the dark origins of her current state.  Come on, bros, this is fiction writing 101, and if you didn't notice gaping holes like this, then honestly my only expectation is that you are gullible and you fell for this show's trap hook, line, and sinker.  The lazy writers of this show shaped your thoughts with sickly sweet romance with BUNNY GIRL SENPAI and made you subconsciously forgive every bit of lazy writing that should have annoyed you.\\n\r\nKaede-chan is not a realistic, deep representation of.. whatever she was supposed to represent.  She is another convenient PROP to further gratify the author's (and, by extension, the teenage viewers') fantasy of having a cute, obedient little sister.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, this is how I see this anime happening:\\n\\n\r\n1. Author - OMG how good was Bakemonogatari.  Ima write a fanfic, except Senjougahara is going to be more moe and they will be more lovey dovey~!\\n\r\n2. Investors - Dude, I hear SHAFT execs still wipe their butt with Bakemonogatari money.  Let's do a cheap imitation of it.  Hey, look this LN's basically got the formula down.\\n\r\n3. Fans - YES pretty girl!  And she's witty, so I don't seem shallow!\\n\\n\r\nLet me hastily wrap up this review because more discussion will only go back to the same point: \\n\\n\r\nThis is a shallow anime and a shallow trap for those who mistakenly think they have better taste and that they are misunderstood by their peers, when the truth is that they are actually dismissed and ignored by their peers.  It is a 13-minute long masturbation session by the author fantasizing about winning over perfect waifus with grand romantic gestures (that require zero actual effort or growth on his part and apparently are without any consequence)  and his self-delusion of inherent maturity and depth.  The trap is constructed to fool you into thinking there is inherent maturity and depth in the show and that you, the viewer, are specially mature and deep for praising this show, when in reality, it is essentially the dirtiest ecchi only without visual nudity, and just as unrealistic harem anime as those you specifically criticize in order to assert your \"good taste\" and \"superior intellect.\"  You didn't enjoy this show because it was \"deep\" or it taught you anything meaningful about the human condition.  You praise this show because it had a pretty bunny girl senpai in it who caressed and stimulated your deepest, most unrealistic, most shameful fantasies without explicitly showing nudity and sexuality that would have made you feel guilty and shallow and hesitant about praising this anime to others.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you will excuse me, I must clear the overnight run of this mediocre series by going through Monogatari again, and reveling in how intelligent and self-aware an anime series can really be.",

            "content": "I came for the sexy bunny girl, I stayed for the intriguing mystery and drama, but in the end neither was delivered on.\r\nThere is very little sexual titillation happening here, the mystery and intrigue leads absolutely nowhere, and the drama is just stupid and makes no sense, in spite of going as far as trying to use popular pseudo science babble to pretend it's clever.\r\nThis is trash, pure and simple! The only reason I score it as high as a six, is because it did keep me watching.\r\nIt's not very rewarding to watch, but it keeps tricking you into wanting to see how it goes!There's a half dozen far better animes lying around half watched on my HD just because they didn't manage to hook me this way, and that's why I must give some credit to this manipulative trash for at least keeping me hooked until the pointless end. \\n\\n\r\nBut I felt totally empty afterwards. Nothing that happens or is said here makes a lick of sense, and there is no payoff to anything. A random person/event may hint at some grand mystery, but it is never resolved. What you think was a clever setup for a later plot reveal was just a clever setup to make you keep watching by baiting you with some random bullshit that isn't connected to anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likewise empty and senseless, but they do project an aura of seeming like they might be something more than what they seem at first. It just turns out they were actually just as empty and senseless as they seemed in the end, and the aura of potentially interesting development was once again just meticulously crafted to sucker you into watching.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in this show only makes sense if you watch it passively like a zombie without connecting any dots in your mind, because if you do you'll soon notice the dots just don't fit into a coherent whole.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, our main dude is an introverted social outcast, SO YOU CAN RELATE TO HIM, YOU FILTHY OTAKU YOU!\\n\\n\r\nBut he also has lots of friends, has great social skills, and is super relaxed around girls, and has godly self confidence, and beats up jocks with an attitude problem without breaking a sweat or losing his cool. In other words, this character makes no sense at all and cannot actually exist in the real world, because he breaks the fundamental laws of human psychology. ALL SO YOU CAN FANTASIZE ABOUT BEING COOL, YOU FILTHY OTAKU YOU!\\n\\n\r\nOur main dude's love interest is another introverted social outcast people ignore to the point where they literally can't see her, and who is at the same time admired by everyone because she is super talented in everything, and she is of course also drop dead gorgeous, and a super famous TV star. In other words, this character makes no sense at all either, and is an insult to the laws of logic. ONCE AGAIN, ALL SO THE FILTHY OTAKU VIEWER CAN FANTASIZE ABOUT GETTING THE PLAIN JANE NEXT DOOR HE'S TOO CHICKEN TO TALK TO, EXCEPT HE ALSO GETS TO PRETEND SHE'S ACTUALLY SUPER HOT.\\n\\n\r\n(It's kind of annoying when a writer projects qualities he despises on his audience, and then tries to pander to his own projection this way. But whatever, it's anime, and this pattern isn't exactly uncommon... If I took serious offense to being treated like scum I'd probably stop watching anime altogether. lol!)\\n\\n\r\nThe two leads have what seems like cool and quirky/funny banter going on when they're flirting, but it really isn't anything of the sort. It just *seems* like it is cool and quirky/funny on the surface, but if you stop and think about what they're saying for a second, none of it makes any sense. Their attitude towards each other makes no sense, and the content of their conversation is equally senseless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then they apparently \"fall in love\" and start dating, which is the cue for the girl to make herself scarce for the rest of the show, to make room for the main dude hanging around with other girls and building his harem. BECAUSE THE FILTHY OTAKU VIEWER  WANTS TO DREAM ABOUT BEING A LADY KILLER.\\n\\n\r\nExcept it's all totally innocent of course, he never has any lewd intentions with any of the harem padding girls, and he is super in love with the main girl. BECAUSE THE FILTHY OTAKU VIEWER WANTS TO SEE HIMSELF AS NOBLE AND FAITHFUL.\\n\\n\r\nThe main love interest never gives our main dude any sugar throughout the entire show by the way. She comes off as disinterested and/or mean towards him, depending on her time of the month or something. Meanwhile he manages to come off as disinterested to the entire world, her included, and yet somehow obsessed with her and totally devoted to her at the same time. When he's not busy building his 100 % platonic harem.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was clearly intended to come off as looking unique and \"deep\", while secretly pandering to the filthy Otaku the writer thinks is his audience, but it's really just a senseless and boring mess.",

            "content": "Rascal, Bunny Girl, and the Misinterpretation\r\n\r\n2018 is indeed, a strange year for anime. Stretching from the melodramatic effect from Violet Evergarden, high tension of Megalobox, and goofy comedic aspect from Hinamatsuri, it sure is a bizarre phenomenon that captures most of our heart. While entering the last 3 months of its legacy, a wild, eye-catching, and fluffy (if you want to call it so) Bunny Girl appeared with a solid promise of 13 episodes. Hyped by some but unknown by the other, Rascal Does not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (or I\u2019ll just call it \u2018Bunny Girl Senpai\u2019) seems like your typical highschool romance anime that repeats every year with the same plot all over again. Fortunately for Bunny Girl Senpai, that was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl Senpai is one of the most, let\u2019s say \u2018influential\u2019, anime of 2018. From the poster itself, resembles an ambiguous and obscure description of the series\u2019 entirety. One would probably judge the anime by its poster, and reach a conclusion that this is a harem anime. Let me convinced you that it wasn\u2019t like that, in fact, Bunny Girl Senpai doesn\u2019t even bring that subject at all. It was a bouncy ride at first, but if we zoom out our vision and understand it from a bigger scope, I believe that Bunny Girl Senpai can deliver us to a satisfying journey.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some arcs in this anime that really caught my attention, one of which is the Koga\u2019s Arc (the part that Koga and Sakuta tried to solve a problem together). From my understanding and point of view, Koga\u2019s Arc resembles problems and delusions that teenagers are facing nowadays, and they use a very good interpretation to express the following case. I was completely flattered and it reminds me of my days in high school when I did something similar to the main protagonist\u2019s doing. It was a sad moment.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of Bunny Girl\u2019s advantages is that it stays on the structure of puberty and adolescent problems. Other anime may differ to a different angle of the story after a few or more episodes, creating unbalanced and undecided move to direct the story afterwards. Although it combined supernatural (some will call this science fiction?) elements to it, I think Bunny Girl\u2019s story is still acceptable and pretty enjoyable at its core.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to my next point, some people are complaining that some arcs are not that great. For me, it was Nodoka-Mai\u2019s Arc that bored me the most. I mean, it\u2019s not a bad arc, it was decent with some pretty shaky and surprisingly good ending to it, but I think the placement of that arc is a bit misconducted. Bunny Girl only had 13 episodes and I just can\u2019t find a good excuse to put that arc in a -near end- tight spot. I understand the possibilities for season 2 and the movie in the future, but I consider that a bleak direction to make. \\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the whole series, I sat on my couch for a moment and then reflected of what just happened in the series. Like, it explicitly mentions some great issues, such as puberty or adolescent syndrome (not the real name, but you get the point) and how the people around us still haven\u2019t realized how bad it is. I don\u2019t know about you, but this series touched me in a different way from the other series. Overall, I will say that Bunny Girl a binge-worthy anime with some slight issues that are probably overlooked by its deep and emotional adventure.\\n",

The show goes downhill after that.\r\nThe dialogue while witty, comes off pretentious and doesn\u2019t sound like the type of conversations teens would say \r\nThe supernatural adolescence syndromes are poorly explained. They\u2019re plot devices that happen so Sakuta can help each girl until they conveniently fade away after they\u2019ve addressed their problems. Then afterwards his big tiddie science friend tries to link it to Quantum physics to again make it all sound smart, but is really just pseudo intellectual bullshit.\r\nThe showconstantly depicts Sakuta as this \u2018good person\u2019, but most of the time he acts like perverted, sarcastic asshole that it\u2019s hard to relate to him.",

Since then, nothing has been able to get to me in comparison, although Plastic Memories did get somewhat close. Then this show came around.\r\nAt first, I didn't know what to expect, thinking, \"This show is probably just another romance anime,\" and putting it at the bottom of my Plan-to-watch list. How I was wrong. This show is so much more than that. Every character goes through problems that many of us have gone through or are currently goingthrough, just to a more exaggerated extent for the sake of story. It is very easy to become connected to all the characters, and their development throughout the story is outstanding. You laugh with them, and you cry with them. You genuinely care about every character. Rarely can you say that about an anime anymore, and after watching this, I can say just about no other show can compare.\\n\\n\r\nThis is no Bakemonogatari clone, even if it seems to follow the same basic idea and does have some similarities.

I mean I don't come in to any anime expecting to be an accurate representation of life, but this one went a bit overboard. I believe this anime is best enjoyed if you just don't put too much thought in to it. You won't realize the absurdity of it and just enjoy the mediocre ride. \r\nYou accidentally fell in the beach? Better go to the hospital.\r\nYou ran around in the rain for like 4 minutes? Better go to the damn hospital.\r\nOh thank you 16 year old classmate with an IQof 260 accurately explaining all of my situation with quantum physics and other stuff that normal 16 year olds know.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know whether to commend the storyline or not. On one hand, it's borderline plagiarism to the Monogatari series with not as much breasts. On the other hand, it still was enjoyable. The character arcs throughout the story were really well executed, Kaede's arc even left me a bit misty eyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe character's were a bit lack luster in this show Kaede being an exception . If you weren't a Dues Ex Machina, like the literal guardian angel in the anime, or a convenient plot device like the literal kid genius who rivals Albert Einstein you were just there to accommodate the pretty lame MC. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a pretty cheeky anime and had its cheeky, heart warming moments. You really shouldn't think about too hard. I suggest watching the first 3 episodes and the last 2 episodes with more intent than the other ones.

            "content": "This is an honest, critical review of the anime. I won't draw comparisons to other animes, like so many have already done, but instead review it based on its own merits (or lack thereof). This review also contains massive spoilers.\r\nWhat does this anime boil down to? Simply put, pseudo-intellectual wish fulfilment. If you've had meaningful relationships in the past, and/or possess a background in science, prepare to have your eyes rolled and your intelligence insulted. What Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey are to the literary world, Bunny Girl Senpai is to the anime world- albeit arguably less atrocious.\r\nBunny Girl Senpai is about a socialoutcast, loser MC named Sakuta who rescues Celebrity Damsel In Distress, Sakurajima Mai. They start dating, but the wish fulfilment doesn't end there. Along with his nationally renowned celebrity girlfriend, the MC has a whole host of girls who are thinly veiled love interests/waifu baits with whom he makes blatantly sexual comments to with no social repercussions. This is fresh escapist, fanfiction material that tries to present itself as intelligent and thought provoking, but ultimately fails.\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the fourth time I've seen Schrodinger's Cat mentioned in anime alone. You'd think by now the author could just recite it from heart without having to Google it (hint: he should have Googled it). But no, he somehow manages to fuck up this morbidly elementary quantum theory with his generic science girl trope. What's worse, he continues the science babble in future episodes, and viewers soon realise that Puberty Syndrome, a cheap plot mechanic, will never be fully explained no matter how white a HS girl's lab coat is.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue, for which whatever reason receives a lot of praise, is stilted and... not actually that witty. People will tell you it's dry humour, and maybe it's not your thing, but dry humour is definitely my thing- Monty Python skits and Mad Men is dry humour; Bunny Girl Senpai's dialogue is just dry and uninspiring. At one point in the anime, the MC asks his girlfriend if she's on her period. That would be a knee slapper, had I not heard and used that line a hundred times before I ended my middle-school career. If you find the dialogue witty and nuanced, then I daresay you have the wit level of your Mother's Basement (no pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nUnfunny dialogue aside, the relationship between our apathetic edgel0rd MC and his fantasy girlfriend is an inspiration for jaw-dropping frustration. Moments of intimacy--emotional and physical--are rare and fleeting. 99% of the 'tension' is the MC making lewd or romantic advances, and Mai rejecting them. In fact, Mai is so busy being a celebrity, she hardly has time to be a girlfriend to Sakuta, much less a friend. What she does offer, however, is cartfuls of empty promises that lead the MC on, chastisement and belittlement, and guilt tripping. But that's okay, because she's a hot tsundere celebrity, right?\\n\\n\r\nYet Mai is never there for Sakuta, despite him making visible effort and sacrifice to be there for her. Then, in the one time he needs her the most, she is surprisingly... not there. Instead it's Shouko who comforts him. When Mai finds out that someone else comforted him while she was busy not giving a fuck about the MC, or noticing his scars re-opening, she gets jealous and leaves in a bitchfit, and it's somehow Sakuta who is profusely apologising. Afterwards, when they kiss and make up, she ruins the moment and doesn't actually kiss him.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of a kiss isn't the most frustrating part. That's the straw that came after the camel's back was already broken. Sakuta didn't even know her birthday, despite them dating for the better part of 6 months. That requires a laughable suspension of disbelief, but with the lack of emotional connection and intimacy shown between them, I can actually kind of believe it. If Mai was completely fugly and NOT a celebrity, would our MC, or even the audience for that matter, like her as much? My bet would be a resounding 'no!'\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of Mai. In the world of ruthless storyboard editing, the rule of thumb is this: if something can be deleted and the story comes out the same, then it should be deleted. If the anime (and LN) followed this rule, we wouldn't have a Koga, Futaba, or Toyohama arc, because ultimately, they just return to normal cardboard characters, or appear for less than 30 seconds in the rest of the entire season. But that's not how you sell dakimakura or figurines, is it?\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even more comedic than the anime itself is how much praise it receives from e-celeb AniTubers. In one analysis, the YouTuber goes as far as stating that the theme of challenging social norms is somehow new and profound, and is unique to Japan. Well, sorry, but it isn't. Every setting and situation has a general atmosphere and vibe that needs to be read, and every society has its norms and rules. But hey, rebelling against society's trends is just soooooo creative! It's almost like there should be a plethora of teenage media and literature dedicated to rebelling and discovering your own identity! OH WAIT.\\n\\n\r\nThe real story revolves around Sakuta, Kaede and Shouko, and to a lesser extent, Mai, because of her amasing first arc. But I could argue that if Mai was deleted altogether, you'd still have a compelling story about Puberty Syndrome and the mystery surrounding Shouko's true identity. Even if you kept Mai in, you'd still have plenty of time in 13 episodes to cover what's really going on with the core cast without having to resort to a movie to tie up loose ends. But that's not how you sell movie tickets to fans, is it?\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all terrible. My highlights are when grown Shouko gets some screen time, and Kaede's one episode of glory. Even though Shouko has an incredibly limited time to shine, she really, really shines. That was the first time I've ever heard anyone, fictional or otherwise, say that if she can wake up and be kinder than the day before, then that's a successful day. It's a rough paraphrase, but the sincerity and heartfelt delivery of her character won me over. If I ever met a girl like that, I would do my best to keep her and not let go. I'm sure she's bound to have flaws, but that is an amasing way to go about life.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really touched me with Kaede's arc is that she struggled to resolve her issues on her own without being spoon fed the answer from Sakuta. She made a list of goals, and one by one, she managed to push through, even when the MC told her it's all right to quit. Kaede isn't just another Waifu Damsel, and she puts forth an incredible determination to overcome her fears. Seeing her progression is one of the only times the anime impressed me.\\n\\n\r\n(Sidenote: Sakuta's magical advice more or less boils down to just telling the girl to do what she wants, and being an apathetic enabler. The most hilarious resolution was Futaba's arc where her insecurities of self-image and sexuality cause a supernatural occurrence. Instead of directly addressing the issues of exhibitionism, guilt, and shame, All-Star MC invites her to the fireworks festival, which somehow resolves multiple layers of sexual anxiety and stress that all girls go through, and even a lot of women into adulthood.)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bunny Girl Senpai falls incredibly short of the praise and hype it's received, and comes off as mostly boring- but not enough to drop... maybe. Throughout the series I kept wondering if I SHOULD drop it. It's not 100% awful, because believe me, there are some terrible titles out there; however, it teeters between mind-numbingly boring and moderately hopeful. For me, it's a lesson learned: if you're thinking about dropping an anime, drop it. It's not worth trudging through it like a chore in the hopes that a couple of favourite characters will have a chance to shine. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. But in the end, it'll likely be a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score For Loser Fantasises About Dating a Celebrity and Being a Fuckboy: 4/10",

At first, I thought of this show being meant for fedora donning weirdos because of the bunny girl theme. The depth of characters this show managed to reach in only 13 episodes, for me, was comparable to be of equivalence to Re: Zero.

            "content": "Hi MAL. Surprise! That\u2019s my reaction to watching this show, but also only my second review. I've been meaning to type more reviews, but time just slips by and I feel like it\u2019s too late sometimes.\r\nI want to preface (similar to my first/previous review, I highly suggest reading the beginning of that review so you get a feel of my background) that I do not watch a lot of anime like many users here. I tend to pick a couple shows from each season that I actually deem interesting and see if I like it. When I do a season preview with my friends, thisshow barely made it to the surface since there was quite a bit of shows that peaked my interest.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to note that most of the shows I watch with my significant other, however this one I watched by myself. I believe that watching anime with more people can affect experiences and feelings. She was not interested but I still was, and oh boy I glad I stuck with it.\\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest thing to take from this is that, when people try to explain what this show is like, a common thing is \u201cOh it\u2019s like if Bakemonogatari and Oregairu had a little baby\u201d. The thing is, I haven\u2019t watched those. Like I always say, comparing anime to others anime make reviews and discussions a crap shoot, so that\u2019s probably the last thing you\u2019d hear me talk about. Obviously, it\u2019s even tough for me to keep that factor out of my head when watching/reviewing a show. I strongly believe that watching a certain genre or style of anime for the first time captures your mind more than it would the second or third time. When I recommend an anime to someone, I ALWAYS ask what shows they like or what they have seen. Anime is not one single entity of medium/genre. So, if you go to the MAL page of this show, scroll to the bottom and see the recommended shows; if you aren\u2019t interested in those shows or haven\u2019t seen them, you probably won\u2019t enjoy the show, but that\u2019s probably. Maybe this will be the first one from that list. One last thing is that if you have seen those two shows, you will most likely enjoy this show unless you\u2019re one of the people who thoroughly believe that once you\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s unacceptable to see it again. Not everyone has seen everything. Enough about that, you can probably see what kind of reviewer I am now, let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFantastic story. It\u2019s not quite perfect, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s a 9. They leave some out to add on with an OVA/movie, but we\u2019ll get on to that later. Curiosity was the main feeling watching this show. My first reaction going into this show was a simple synopsis: a boy named Sakuta who was the only one able to see this girl, Mai, wearing a bunny suit in public. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I knew. If that doesn\u2019t peak your curiosity, I don\u2019t know what will. I was just like \u201cwhy?\u201d. I know many friends who were like \u201cwhat is this show about?\u201d. People were expecting some kind of typical harem/ecchi show, but I can definitely say it is far from that. I think they did an amazing job luring people in and making them stay. We were all in the same boat. It slowly progresses more towards why Mai has this problem and that other characters are going through the same \u2018syndrome\u2019. While Sakuta is helping them, he is trying to help himself because he too is affected by the syndrome. I won\u2019t spoil anything because it all makes sense when you watch and listen to this show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I really want to point out that the first 3 episodes of this was one of the best rides I\u2019ve been on watching an anime in a long time. That 3rd episode really solidified my thoughts on where the show was going and I\u2019m glad I was able to experience those 24 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the relationship between Sakuta and Mai. Their exchanges and feelings towards each other are enough to outshine anything else in this show to make it a perfect 10/10. Sure, the other characters pretty good, but seeing the two on the screen makes my heart happy. When it comes to like shonen shows, people like personality or physical development. Like say a character gets a new power or something. However, that could take tens of episodes or a whole arc. You think that 3 episodes would be a joke for development, but this rapid development between the two like I mentioned earlier was breathtaking. My eyes were wide open and maybe some tears even came out just from sheer joy. I have a bias when it comes to relationships since I\u2019m a sucker for romance, which this show entails. And not like little implied romance- actual boyfriend/girlfriend romance (see many of my highly rated shows). So, I have to say many of this show\u2019s ratings might be bumped up by a half to a full point just because of it. I will bring this up again later.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can really take away is that the characters fall into typical tropes but I feel like some are needed in this show. They don\u2019t make it blatant (well except one, but it makes sense in the end). Like I said, I\u2019m not going to really compare this to other stuff. They\u2019re just common trends/tropes in most anime, but it\u2019s portrayed very well and honestly doesn\u2019t affect the outcome at all. In Anime and a high school setting, some of these devices need to bet set in order to lay a good foundation. That\u2019s what this show did. They really don\u2019t throw it in your face but when you get to know a character you go \u201cOh they\u2019re this kind of character\u201d, but obviously each one has a reason for it, not just because \u2018the show needs this kind of character\u2019. Get what I\u2019m saying?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to say about the art except that it\u2019s pretty nice to look at. It doesn\u2019t awe me, but the character animations are pretty smooth and I like each character\u2019s design. Everyone feels unique or stands out which is good in this type of show. They make each character rememberable. I enjoy their school uniform design and I appreciate the attention to detail on some shots or scenery. Minor CG for crowds/background characters but it\u2019s not so bad it\u2019s distracting (I can just point it out). I mean Cloverworks (The A-1 rebranding/branch) is still pretty new, but I think they did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that stands out the most to me is that when the characters are out of uniform or in their weekend outfits, they actually have different clothes on every other time. I really appreciate when artists or the design team put work and effort into this. I think when it comes to this kind of show it makes it stunningly more relatable and feels like you\u2019re there with them. It\u2019s not an easy task to do. \\n\\n\r\nThat brings up this topic, which also related into sound, is the ending of each episode. Them changing girls or singers every couple episodes is ASTOUNDING. It\u2019s what made me want to watch each one. I adore when studios do that. Definitely brought up half a point at least for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and dialogue carry this show so hard. I usually rate my sound just on music and voice acting. As mentioned, I like the endings. The ending song is okay, not something I would want to add to my playlist of songs, but it\u2019s good enough to listen to when I watch. However, I\u2019m not a big fan of the opening. It\u2019s a little annoying besides from the memes I\u2019ve seen about the song name and how it\u2019s sung. Let\u2019s say I always skipped the intro after seeing it a couple times, but I watched every ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music forgettable. The voice acting is good, sometimes great.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the dialogue. Seriously probably the biggest and most pivotal reason on why this show is good to me. I love a good conversation. Maybe it\u2019s boring to some, since it\u2019s not a shonen or action-based show, you have to pay attention, and it rewards you. I can\u2019t get enough of Sakuta\u2019s smart ass remarks or comments, but I\u2019m always itching to see how Mai reacts. They\u2019re actually in a relationship, which I rarely see in anime, but those scenes/lines sky rocket to the top of my list if I see it. There was so much in this show that\u2019s why I like it so much. A little obsessive but you know when Dexter says \u201comelet du fromage\u201d and those girls by him just melt. That\u2019s what happens to me whenever I hear Mai talk. I\u2019m sure Sakuta felt the same way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we\u2019re here. Definitely a show I enjoyed from start to finish. Had some huge spikes of enjoyment, but that\u2019s how the episode formula works if you know what I\u2019m talking about. I had many laughs, a few tears, and a lot of smiles. That\u2019s a 10/10 for me. I wasn\u2019t disappointed in the slightest bit. I couldn\u2019t watch for each episode every week!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAdding the scores up, it comes up to about 89% which I round to a 9/10. The show itself is lacking the full story (since they made a movie/OVA with the remaining stuff), but just from it alone is enough to make an amazing anime.\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Let me know what you think, I might type more reviews.\\n",

            "content": "There is so much WOW factor in this anime and easily my top 10 for 2018. Despite the misleading title and the visual art that may put people off by thinking its another romcom series. How are we so wrong, plus the synopsis did not do justice with how amazing the series was. \r\nStory (10/10) - You cannot walk out of this show and say oh it's just another decent high-school anime. This series takes it to another level by utilising the 'puberty symptom' at its fullest to represent how each character is facing as they are in high school or growing up. It capturesthe hardship of overcoming those symptoms during our teen days, or even into adulthood. Also, like the fact that it's not just a simple fix but requires them to face it head-on and find solutions to resolve these issues. This carefully crafted story, supported with the talented director for this series, demonstrated how each episode our protagonist went out of his way to help each character to fix their adolescent issues, and increase his harem. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - Stunning I would say. Especially the well-orchestrated opening video captures the magnificent background image of this series. Not to mention the character design, well made them quite attractive to the audience eyes. Simply the time spent on character design by the team of illustrators to effectively reflect the beauty of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10) - Ahh yes, our man Sakuta becomes the man of the season. Despite his lazy, dull and straightforward personality. What I like about him is that he's willing to step out of his comfort zone, which is doing nothing, and go out of his way to support each character of different arcs. But I am more interested MAI-SENPAI! Cute, tsundere and adorable mature character just made my day and how she understands Sakuta very well and showed him the highest level of trust. Cares for him after his public confession and the blush the needs to protect. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - I enjoyed the opening music 'kimi no sei' so much that it now sticks in your head. The well-tuned music gives a lot of energy, and you never get tired of hearing it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) - Saying that I enjoyed the show is an understatement. Every episode I am just so invested in seeing whether the problems will be solved or does another barrier to it. But what I enjoyed more was the interaction between Sakuta and the girls as he loves to tease them with his shameless opinions. I love slice-of-life romance anime after all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) - IF we look back on this show, it can reflect on how we experience in our teen days, and this anime clearly showed all those symptoms we faced. Not to mention our protagonist Sakuta have to suffer as he reached the limit of his abilities. \\n\\n\r\nFor more review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-tqE9mO6Y&t=193s\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note everything bellow is my opinion. So disagree if you like, it won't change my mind\r\nAnyways, \"Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai\" in my opinion is a very good Anime, It hits a lot of marks that other anime's failed at. For example, the days repeating and the whole cycle of events replaying over and over with \"Tomoe Koga\" arc was very good, an example of an Anime that did this same sort of situation wrong was \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\". Though I do like that Anime in itself the endless eight arc was terrible. And this show really just shows howit can be done correctly. \\n\\n\r\nThis Anime did have a little bit of romance in it, in my opinion, the romance is ok. They could have gone a little farther with it and I'm sure they will in the movie. And if not that'll be disappointing but we can hope!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this Anime are also very good, with funny charismatic personalities, I love blunt characters like the main character in this show. so it was good to see a character like that, although there were a few stereotypes the show didn't suffer from that and as a whole, in the character mark it was very good\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the art, in places it was a bit badly done. Like when he was running his face looked a bit silly, but apart from the that the animation was spotless\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a great opening and closing, utilizing all of the talented voice actresses in the endings which were very nice to see!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's my review of \"Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai\". In total I'll give this a 8/10",

            "content": "In short, 8/10\r\nAnimation, soundtrack, story-line all wonderful. The only reason it's not a 10 is because of one or two annoying characters that serve their purpose well, and a conclusion that, while completely fitting and acceptable, did nothing for my bleeding heart that wanted to see a kiss at the end.\r\nBelow is a detailed review. Please watch the show and form your own opinions, but do read my review below if you have the time, I really appreciate it. No spoilers involved.\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou Wa Bunny Girl Senpai is, at first glance, what appears to be a generic psychological harem slice of life anime thatchecks off all the boxes for what it needs to become a relatively okay anime. Cute characters, a seemingly deep story, a nice soundtrack, beautiful animation and art style, and well fleshed out characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn most cases, an anime like this would be a relative \"meh\" for me, and I would generally end off the series with a thought along the lines of \"pleh\", and think: \"hey, that wasn't bad.\" But that wasn't the case at all.\\n\\n\r\nMany people who view this and don't truly understand the depth of what is being discussed here will say that it was alright, and view it like any other slice of life anime that they've seen with characters that play into a general type. Hikigaya Hachiman from Oregairu, Ayanokouji from Classroom of the elite etc. were all splendid characters that generally fit this relatively monotone character that doesn't really care about life and is fine with being alone and misunderstood.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is different. The advanced physics concepts discussed here, such as the observation theory or Schrodinger's Cat need not be fully understood to appreciate this anime. This anime tackles many social issues without conforming to the generic anime tropes of one MC who defeats all the bad guys and gets all the girls.\\n\\n\r\nBullying, amnesia, discrimination, as well as familial issues, all have been addressed through the various characters in this anime, and each in a clear and concise manner. They did not try to create magical solutions for each of these problems, and nor should they, as there is no clear cut method for dealing with things like that. A realistic viewpoint is presented here, and Sakuta realistically solves none of the overarching issues presented. He can do nothing about ostracisation, nor what people think, nor their perceptions of him and the other people involved. He simply can be there for the people he is close to and provide support as they have supported him.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of the Puberty Syndrome in the anime is a metaphorical, physical representation of the effects of the overarching issues on the people involved. Be it his sister or the female lead, or even other friends along the way, the use of the Puberty Syndrome highlights the problems that people face and the repercussions of people's beliefs and actions. I can't go into detail about this without spoiling the anime, but the slightly dramatized and personified versions of these issues the characters face help to teach a lesson not only to the watchers, but also the characters themselves as they learn and grow from the experiences they have faced, and come to terms with it and deal with it on their own. Sakuta is not the God MC that girls fall over, he is simply a friend and a close ally that has been supported through his own issues, and is now lending his hand out to those that need it.\\n\\n\r\nSakuta as a character displays not only growth and maturity of character, but also a degree of reliance on others to help him, just like a regular person. He has proven that he can help solve people's problems, but needs help to do so. He is not infallible, nor is he the one who goes out of his way to help everyone he sees and knows. He is given a proper motive for his actions, and the diversity of obstacles placed in his path was a welcome change for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are well developed, or if they were not then they accomplished their purpose in this work. The animation and soundtracks fit perfectly and were never disruptive to the experience, and in many ways have enhanced it. Good job to the studio and writers for that one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a stunning anime with maybe not the most satisfying conclusion, but definitely a fitting one that I would like to see more of, especially in the 2019 movie, and maybe even read the light novels should they ever be translated. This was an enjoyable ride, and each character has their own flaws and hubris that they will overcome themselves, with the main character being a fresh change from the stereotypical anime MCs that can solve everything. Sakuta cannot solve everything. Sometimes he cannot solve anything. In the end, the other characters saved themselves, at best he lent a helping hand.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "High school is typically embellished as the end all be all for the Japanese as the last period of time where they were able to enjoy their youth before the workforce.\u00a0 That and the fact that a lot of kids from all ages watch anime are the main contributors as to why 'high school' is such an oversaturated setting.\u00a0 But let's take a second to add a dash of realism to everything, where high school isn't as fun and everyone has problems to see where that gets us.\u00a0 And maybe a bunny girl too while we're at it.\r\nStory:\r\nAzusagawa Sakuta is a man of very fewemotions.\u00a0 His deadpan face and witty personality is a deadly combination of traits that lead him to be an antisocial person and have barely any friends.\u00a0 Partially.\u00a0 One day as he goes to a bookstore, he sees a girl parading around in a bunny suit waving in front of people's faces without getting so much as a reaction back.\u00a0 He recognizes this girl as Sakurada Mai, a child star who did dramas and commercials way back when.\u00a0 As it turns out, everyone doesn't notice Mai since she has 'Puberty Syndrome', and Sakuta, having experienced the phenomenon himself, decides to help Mai for her well-being...and maybe for himself.\\n\\n\r\nTo understand this show is to also understand 'Puberty Syndrome', described as an unexplainable myth that seemingly warps the world around an individual based on their problems.\u00a0 The show explains it way more complicated than it needed to be without a concrete explanation that isn't theoretical, but in simple terms, whenever someone has a personal issue that they can't resolve, weird shit happens to them and their wish is fulfilled at a cost.\u00a0 A monkey's paw if you will.\u00a0 While interesting, the result of this complicated phenomenon coupled with some very lengthy explanations utilizing theoretical physics makes some portions of the show interesting, but exhausting.\u00a0 It's arguably my least favorite aspect of the show because I think the author and by extension everyone else involved with this adaptation tried way too hard to put in scientific reasoning when it really could just have been handwaved by magic, despite how cool theoretical physics is.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, what Bunny Girl is ultimately about is Sakuta solving various girls' problems with their lives, first starting with Mai, gradually expanding out to several other people around him in order to effectively save them from themselves.\u00a0 It's a tired plotline, but the freshness of the concept comes from Sakuta as a character, as well as the personal conflicts that occur within the series' main girls.\u00a0 Each girl has a believable problem.\u00a0 Things like relationships and bullying are common themes for the show and are only escalated by the impact of Puberty Syndrome.\u00a0 Because of this, the internal turmoil feels genuine and the pacing and time each arc is given only makes the show better cause there feels like care, attention, and conflict with each arc.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the show also manages a relationship built on trust between its protagonists.\u00a0 Dialogue is very much the series's strong point, and just the way the characters interact with each other make everything just that much more interesting cause there's just so much subtext and emotion behind the way the characters are talking to each other before the ultimate breakdown moment at the end of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nMy only real complaint comes with the final arc, as I feel like as an ending, it had pacing issues (and explanation problems) that didn't fit as neatly as the other arcs.\u00a0 It just seemed like there was too much shoved in, and I really wanted more from it considering the person who was being tackled at the time.\u00a0 Despite that, Bunny Girl's story is very much the adolescent experience turned to eleven in order to personify and antagonize people's personal issues as the core problem for the characters, creating believable conflict in a more magical spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great pacing\\n\r\n+ Fantastic dialogue\\n\r\n+ Very believable arcs\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Last arc felt rushed by comparison\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSakuta serves as one of the many reasons why Bunny Girl is one of the best of the Fall 2018 season.\u00a0 Not only is he an active protagonist who willingly takes on the task of helping those around him by his own volition, he also possesses wit to combat much of the cast's responses no matter the situation, as well as changes over the course of the series.\u00a0 His relationship with Mai only adds to this, as the trust forged between the two create such a strong bond where they're each other's shoulder to cry on makes things that much better.\u00a0 He is very much the driving force of the show, and really things wouldn't be the same without him.\u00a0 My biggest complaint however is really his role in the ending arc, particularly the second half, cause nothing really was clear about that, and his own internal turmoil doesn't make as much sense as I think Cloverworks wanted it to.\\n\\n\r\nMai serves a lesser role to her partner, but still an important one, not only being the first of several girls to be helped by Sakuta, but also by being Sakuta's motivation for many things.\u00a0 The fun part is how Mai as a character serves separate to the relationship between the two, as what we see is a character who manages to be kind of an opposite to Sakuta himself in terms of personality, but also similar in the fact that the strain in their relationship can be resolved and is a result of both parties being at fault, leading to some very mature moments between the two that honestly end up being the best aspects of the show.\u00a0 Given the reputation romance has in the anime medium, it's rare to see such a mature relationship, between two high school students no less, blossom and stay relevant throughout the show despite some of the crazier stuff that happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the rest of the cast.\u00a0 At least in the case for the four other girls who have their cases tackled over the course of the series, their problems and overall character get fleshed out enough for the audience (and Sakuta) to care about them.\u00a0 You get a sense of personality from these girls.\u00a0 Less tropes, more mix of everything: needs, flaws, strengths, wit, all of this makes the show more rewarding cause you see positive change, enough to make the characters WANT to change rather than just \"here's my arc, I'm done\".\u00a0 Change is slow, and the show knows that, going far enough to establish the solution to the puberty syndrome, but just enough for everything to not be fully resolved since teenagers at the very least still don't have their shit together.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Every character feels real\\n\r\n+ Genuine growth at all levels\\n\r\n+ One of the realest relationships I've seen in the medium\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Cloverworks, Bunny girl has a consistent quality to it combined with a solid and kinda boring color scheme that's actually real to life.\u00a0 There's not much embellishment or color to everything cause everything's kinda drab.\u00a0 Like life.\u00a0 It's a pleasing style regardless cause everything is very simple and solid, so what you end up with is very little flooding the eyes, but just enough to give you a pleasant style with consistent quality checks.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside is the fact that the show hardly has any wild animation that would warrant intense movement.\u00a0 Characters don't really move a lot, as most of the show's content is shown through its dialogue rather than its movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI want to come up front and say that I do not like either of these tracks.\u00a0 \"Kimi no Sei\" by the peggies is a high energy rock song with a soprano singer on lyrics.\u00a0 It's a good song and definitely has its many highs given the energy during the chorus coupled by smoother lower moments.\u00a0 By contrast, \"Fukashigi no Carte\" sung by the various seiyuus of the girls in the series is a smooth, jazzy piece that accompanies each arc of the respective girl.\u00a0 Interesting, and definitely worth a listen due to really just jazzy it is.\\n\\n\r\nNow tell me, what part of any of these songs fits \"Magical Teenage Problems Drama\" the show?\u00a0 Personally because of how much they contrast the content of the show, I don't see these tracks as belonging to Bunny Girl no matter how good they are.\u00a0 It's like a culture shock almost.\u00a0 I expect to watch something energetic with the OP, only to end up watching drama, and by the end I think I'm in a bar.\u00a0 It just makes no sense to me, and for that, I don't like these songs being tacked to this show.\u00a0 Standalone however, they each have their own merits.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI remember coming across Bunny Girl when it was being adapted into a manga.\u00a0 It was such a weird concept but after a while I was like \"Huh, this is pretty good\".\u00a0 So really, I was surprised when an adaptation came to light, cause I always saw it as this underground thing.\u00a0 Turns out, it's one of the most popular shows of the season.\u00a0 Huh, who'da thunk that good writing, good characters, and overall good aesthetics could create a good show?\u00a0 Fucking blows my mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there's not much I can really say to sing more praises about the show since I've been doing that this entire review.\u00a0 While not one of my favorites, its overall quality is just so well made that this series is just objectively good from almost every standpoint.\u00a0 My only gripe is how the final arc really could've used more time.\u00a0 And a better explanation.\u00a0 It felt like a weak end by comparison cause it seemed like they were rearing up for a massive reveal after the twist, but it just never came to light.\u00a0 For that, I'm frustrated, but ultimately not really surprised given the time constraints.\\n\\n\r\nIf this isn't on your list for shows that you want to watch from Fall 2018, it probably should be.\u00a0 Bunny Girl is objectively one of the best shows of the season, managing a lot of parts and putting them together in such a way that's both believable and engaging to watch.\u00a0 Also mildly depressing considering high school is definitely not a favorite time for most people.",

            "content": "People might say it's average, it's uninspired, yet so many seem to love it. Who's right? All of them. When you look at it from one angle you could see the moe-pandering, erotic comments, factory-line melodrama. Yet, you could look at it from another angle and see the sometimes well-realized characters, sometimes more sensible humor, sometimes more interesting banter.\r\n\"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\" is a Frankenstein mixed bag of stitched-together conventions done well, and to me that is it's main problem. The anime doesn't have a strong identity and the plot takes the backseat, quickly appearing as random gimmicks that mess withsome characters. However, what pulls things together and leads the way is the characters and the dialogue. However, even with that understanding, the issue continues in how the show prioritizes itself.\\n\\n\r\nYou might hear some say the pacing of \"Bunny Girl Senpai\" is horrible, that it encapsulated too many stories in too short a time. My take, that isn't the problem. The show is directed very competently and does a fantastic job at telling stories briefly. The problem is this format naturally places too much focus on the plot, which is a vague series of mini-obstacles to an unclear resolution. This show would've done well with either being less ambitious in it's length of story-telling, or in adding a few more episodes of down-time to focus on the cast. It also could do well to have more thorough lore that makes the series of events in this feel more coherent or progressive, while now it feels completely lost and meaningless beyond the ensuing character interaction. It could've also doubled-down on it's ridiculous nature and tried to justify itself with logic less (this criticism being directed at the tedious usage specific character).\\n\\n\r\n\"Bunny Girl Senpai\" is a victim of improperly managing priorities and suffers quite a bit because of it, yet it manages to have some engaging character moments between some overdone drama. I believe the show lives up enough to the hype and succeeds in being an almost best-of summary of things you'd see in Clannad without some of the added nonsense. I understand why someone would give it an 8 out of 10 if the more extreme silliness of the show didn't phase them to the negative in some way, but there's enough grounded heartfelt dialogue that most of the time I felt an incentive to keep watching.",

            "content": "Absolutely outstanding.\r\nThis anime is probably the most unexpected rare gem of the season, thanks to the incredibly misleading synopsis that tried to push the bunny girl aspect of the anime, that doesn't actually have much to do with the series as a whole. In short, if you're looking for one of the best romance animes ever made, look no further than Bunny Girl Senpai.\r\n*Non-Spoiler Review*\r\nThe story of this anime is told through several character arcs that focus on the interaction between our main character and a girl within the series. For reference, think Bakemonogatari, and you'll have a pretty good idea of how the storyis structured. Each arc was told brilliantly. So much so, that at times, I thought I had just witnessed the series climax, only to witness an even greater climax in the next character arc. It is primarily a romance anime, however, I can assure you that it won't be like any romance anime you've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this anime is most definitely the characters. Each and every one of them gets their moment in the spotlight, but even if it isn't their character arc, they still are part of the story as a whole. I absolutely loved the dynamic between Mai and Sakuta. Both of them had very distinct personalities. It was if they were alive in some way, and not just being voiced by VA's. They've both become a part of my most favorite characters of all time, and I will most certainly remember them long after this series has passed.\\n\\n\r\nThere's something about Bunny Girl Senpai that is just so fun to watch. I can't find the words to describe it accurately, but you could say that I had fun reading dialogue, and that's only ever happened back when I was watching Bakemonogatari. Yes, this anime is similar to it, but I like to think that it's created an entirely separate genre of its own. One that I hope will continue to be explored in future anime seasons.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, watch Bunny Girl Senpai. You will not be disappointed. I can guarantee that.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review!",

That's when I was surprised. Ths show is amazing and I'll tell you why. \r\nArt: 10\r\nThis anime has gourgeous image with great animation. Animation here is smooth, refreshing and makes you value tranquility and serenity of this show.\r\nSound: 10\r\nTo be honest, i didn't noticed any kind of outstanding OST's or etc. What I noticed is proper use of silence and calm tunes. Sometimes not using any sound is better than using it.\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nNot introducing us to alot of characters is a smart move. Some  shows fall apart when they show too many side characters, that will never show up again. There're not a lot of those characters in this anime.\\n\r\n Those that do get the spotlight are getting the best out of it. Main character is great. His harem DOESN'T even feel like a harem at all. Considering he has more than 5 female friends and only one male friend. Character dynamics are established and used properly. \\n\r\nThough I have some complaints about main relationship, but this goes to spoiler category.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nSomething about this show ade my heart pound. I felt excitement whenever something good happened and thrilled when something strange or bad happened. Especially first few episodes felt amazing and heart-melting.\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nWhen i was watching the show, I noticed how paceof this story is quite different than in other anime. This pace is strange, it feels unnatural. The event that I expected to happen in the last episode, happened VERY EARLY ON. This uncomfortable feeling didn't leave, since pace also changed sometimes. Don't you feel it when in one episode covers one month, and thevery next episode shows us lesser than one day? Yeah something like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9\\n\r\nGoddamit this was an unique show. One of its kind i would say. This is the show that will help you clear your mind, thoughts and etc. Though, it will also give a ton of information.\\n\r\nNow I want a petition to rename this show, because:\\n\r\nA) IT HAS BASICALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH BUNNY GIRLS\\n\r\nB) IT\"S MORE ABOUT QUANTUM FREAKING PHYSICS THAN ABOUT BUNNY GIRLS.\\n\\n\r\nSo... Yeah",

I am a fan of the whole romance school trope and when i saw this on upcoming anime i was like oh god this is another trashy fan service school romance anime sign me up.\r\nI was to be disappointed if that was what i only liked. Bunny girl senpai had nothing really to do with fan service, bunny girls and pointless drama over a lack of communication 99% of these animes seem to have between the mcs.\r\nThis anime was a masterpiece. The relationship between the two was never the cause ofmajor drama, rather the anime showed how they got together and became closer as multiple strange things tested them as a couple and as individuals. i cannot think of any anime that comes even close to this in this department. I am sick (well i say that but still watch it so LOL) of the whole genre where the MC is a total idiot, or a total wuss or just a flustered moron whenever the girl is around. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on for well a lot longer but many of the other 10/10 reviews cover well most of my points so i'll just leave it at this. Below is something i came across that is rather annoying as it is misleading.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of this will contain spoilers\\n\\n\r\nI saw a review that mentioned incest baiting. Whist i myself prefer to have nothing to do with the topic, Bunny girl senpai was not that bad, the little sister sometimes made questionable remarks. HOWEVER the reason this anime gets a pass is \\n\\n\r\n1. Kaede has no memory of more than a couple of years. Sure they are siblings but to her she doesn't have the whole i grew up with him eww concept. in fact seeing as he is the only person she trusts/talks to as she cannot remember anyone else etc makes this somewhat acceptable. \\n\\n\r\n2. the 'incest baiting' was more about feelings than lust. That matters. refer to point 1 if you cannot understand\\n\\n\r\n3. it was never serious. more of a joke. she never got upset about sakuta getting a girlfriend, she in fact became friends once she got over her fear of well humans apart from her brother. \\n\\n\r\n4. Possibly the most important point. Sakuta never blushes or gets flustered like mcs in other animes. That reaction alone is enough to gloss over the issue.\\n\\n\r\n5. its rare. its doesnt take up more than MAYBE 1 minute of screen time across 13 episodes, 99% of their interactions are well what you'd expect from siblings where the parents are absent.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai or don't expect something the Cover shows you ;)\r\nThe Show basically is about a second-year student at a high school near Enoshima which meets several girls that are experiencing this so called \"puberty syndrome.\" For example, he meets a wild bunny girl in the library. She turns out to be an actress on hiatus, Mai Sakurajima, who is also his senior at the school. For some reason, no one else can see this girl.As Sakuta searches for answers to help Mai, they spend more time together, and he eventually learns of her hidden feelings.\r\nPlot/Story9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe Series with an unusual Cover starts of as an normal Slice of Life Show but slowly adds an supernatural theme the \"puperty syndrome\" on it.The puperty Syndrome  can either be interpreted as an supernatural entitiy that screw up others lifes but more likely its a reflection of a state in Reality  that a lot of people go through be it through mental illness,puperty or an identity crysis.\\n\\n\r\nBut back to the Story in the Anime. It is divided into Four Arcs,where in one Sakuta and Mai get to know each other, Futaba comes to terms with the fact that she fights with her inner demons which is expressed to a second Futabe that has her own needs her own personality etc , and the last arc deals mainly with sister Kaede, who is basically the most important character next to Sakuta that the story represents.\\n\\n\r\nKaede, Sakuta's Sister is the reason to his believes that he \"trys to be kinder each day\"  which he embody through the Character Shoco and this perfectly shows why the Story Writing is good.\\n\r\nBecause Besides its romantic and supernatural vibes it creates a relateable Cast that have each their own Struggles and Problems.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation / Design 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing really to complain about the Characters are moving smooth, the backgrounds are beautiful and  manage to put the characters in front so that they feel alive\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've said a lot in the Story Section that's why i review here the  Characters as a whole\\n\\n\r\nOverall you can say that each character has its own Struggles & Characteristics that resonates within them and give the anime the feel of depth.Each one of them is relateable be it  told through the Syndrome or as a character itself.\\n\\n\r\nAudio/Soundtrack 8/10\\n\\n\r\nkimi no sei / kimi no sei / kimi no sei ..eh what? \\n\\n\r\nyea that OP / the Ending is Pretty catchy and reflects very good the soul of the show\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview Conclusion 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what we can say about this Anime. Sure people can say it has not a really linear narrative and is more focused on the Characters  but that doesn't make the Show any less good. It shines through that with fleshed out characters,cute girls,smooth animation and a supernatural theme that you haven't seen in that way before which can be interpretated in different ways. \\n\\n\r\nI can recommend it to everyone who like Slice of Life but also have nothing against a little bit of Supernatural Themes =)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime is an incredibly incestuous medium. Whether that\u2019s good or bad is more up for debate, but I think it\u2019s fairly obvious to everyone that anime borrows heavily from itself. It has its own series of in-jokes and references, its own tropes that it keeps going back to and trying to subvert, its own way of cannibalizing its peers for ideas, story beats, and character archetypes. Every anime is its own thing, yet every anime also owes much of its makeup to the stories it draws from, and part of the fun of getting sucked into hardcore anime fandom is becoming acquainted with this strangenew language in how the medium references itself and uses your pre-established knowledge of its styles and tropes to influence your perception of every new iteration. All that being said, though, while I\u2019ve gotten remarkably used to anime\u2019s self-referential tendencies in my admittedly brief time as an anime fan, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever before seen an anime that so clearly screams \u201cCompare me to something you\u2019ve already seen\u201d as Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai. And unfortunately, that\u2019s not entirely to its benefit.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, it might not be entirely fair of me to tie my opinion of this show so closely to its most obvious inspiration. After all, every story deserves to be judged on its own merits, and it\u2019s how the pieces come together in the end that has far more importance than what pieces are used in the first place. But man, is it hard to pry my impressions of Bunny Girl Senpai away from the Monogatari series, because it\u2019s copying that storied franchise\u2019s playbook so obviously and directly that comparing the two feels almost inevitable. Like Monogatari, Bunny Girl Senpai takes place in a slightly skewed version of our world where people speak in a mix of obscure references, tangled wordplay, and rapid-fire snarky quips that gives every conversation the impression of a writer perhaps a little too pleased with his genius. Like Monogatari, the conflicts center around supernatural afflictions that all have some thematic purpose for the characters they afflict, though in this case it\u2019s more directly focused on the struggles of modern adolescence and based on quantum mechanics over symbolic linguistics. Like Monogatari, our protagonist Sakuta is a misanthropic loner who gets swept up in helping various girls solve their afflictions by coming to terms with some aspect of themselves that the afflictions represent, adding them to an ever-growing sort-of-but-not-quite-harem of supporting characters. Hell, even the archetypes the girls fall into feel directly cribbed from Monogatari: the tsundere-adjacent main girl who officially enters a relationship with the main guy at the end of the second arc, the abrasive loli type, the braniac who looks hot in glasses, the cute little sister, you get the idea. If there was ever a piece of media I could accuse of just copy-pasting what it\u2019s ripping off, it would be this show.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, taking obvious direction from a previous story isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing. Plenty of classic stories from across the world build on previously established ideas and themes, putting their own unique spin on familiar territory to great effect. Hell, Monogatari itself was steeped in anime culture and the tropes we\u2019ve come to expect from it. And truth be told, Bunny Girl Senpai does a fine job of capturing the ballistic wit of its parent series. Sakuta, his girlfriend Mai, and all the rest are full of no shortage of funny one-liners and creative potshots, weaving dense webs of dialogue through the most inane comments. The actual problems the girls face are very well thought-out, reflecting the struggles teenagers actually face today in terms of social pressure, the increased lack of privacy thanks to social media, trying to live up to expectations you\u2019re not sure you can fulfill, cyberbullying, and more. I also appreciate the clearheadedness of some of its narrative choices. Mai is decidedly Sakuta\u2019s girlfriend by the end of the second arc, and that is never throws into question by any of the other girls he interacts with. The little sister Kaede has a clear crush on Sakuta, but the show never pretends there\u2019s actually any sexual tension between them, or that Sakuta isn\u2019t comfortable handling her advances in a mature, non-fetishistic way. If nothing else, that\u2019s one thing Bunny Girl can wave in Monogatari\u2019s face any day of the week.\\n\\n\r\nBut therein lies the problem as well; as chaotically broken as Monogatari could be at points, it was also one of the most brazen, audacious, and all-around brave franchises I can remember. It took huge chances at pretty much every turn, and while that means its failures could be massive, its more-frequent successes remain to this day some of my favorite moments out of anime. Bunny Girl just doesn\u2019t have that same level of balls-to-the-wall bravery to set it apart in the same way. As an example, there\u2019s a scene in the first episode where Sakuta\u2019s verbally sparring with an abrasive girl, and he quips \u201care you on your period?\u201d, to which the girl descends into flustered anger and is unable to manage a proper retort before storming off. It\u2019s... honestly kind of lazy writing, and it\u2019s not the last time the show hits such easy, obvious beats in place of its more creative snark. Can you imagine how this scene would\u2019ve played out in Monogatari? Would Araragi\u2019s instense verbal fire ever cough up a hairball as lazily misogynistic as a period comment? Even if he did, would Senjougahara, Mayoi, Kanbaru, or any of the rest respond by flusteredly walking away? Or would they punch back with a flurry of emasculating puns that spiraled into a completely unhinged back-and-forth as both characters sought to conquer the other in a whirling game of words? Hell, even when Araragi admits to groping Mayoi in one of the worst running jokes ever, at least Mayoi doesn\u2019t take that shit lying down and immediately jumps up his ass with all the spitfire a bratty elementary schooler can produce. That kind of unhinged mania is why that franchise became popular and important enough that Bunny Girl was created to emulate it in the first place, and it just doesn\u2019t feel as fresh or challenging or courageous.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I am being a little unfair. Bunny Girl Senpai isn\u2019t a bad show by any means, and I enjoyed watching it a lot. But the fact is, I can\u2019t think of any aspect of this show that I don\u2019t compare negatively to its own senpai. The animation is solid and nicely fluid, but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Monogatari\u2019s bonkers vision of an art-deco dreamworld. The dialogue is quippy and enjoyable, but not nearly as much as Nisioisin\u2019s stream-of-consciousness million-thoughts-a-minute insanity. The main couple is cute, but I\u2019m always comparing them in my mind to what is still my favorite fictional romance ever. Bunny Girl Senpai\u2019s only real crime is one of not measuring up to what it asks you to measure it up against, and that is incredibly disappointing. On its own merits, though, it\u2019s a smart and swift-footed exploration of relatable teenage angst, and there are far worse ways to get your fix of overly verbose character archetypes making mincemeat of the Japanese language.",

            "content": "I've been wanting to review this anime for quite sometime now.  And finally, I can.  Here's my review on: Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai. \r\nStory: (7/10)\r\nThe story is all over the place. Yes, it follows a straight path, but you're never sticking to 1 story. The title suggest \"Bunny Girl\", however, the name is only relevant for about 2 episodes or so.  At the start you'll think that the main story is building Sakuta Azusagawa  (The MC), and Mai Sakurajima's relationship. However, that gets put on hold. I kinda like to look at this anime as a animatedvisual novel, since in visual novels, there are typically different routes you can take. In the anime you see Sakuta experience each of those routes. Each route has their own well written story, but because of the short 13 episodes, the stories never feel complete. Just when you feel like you're getting attached, they take it away from you, and move on to the next story. But that doesn't mean they're bad stories. In fact, I like them a lot, but they're squeezed into that short 13 episodes, that makes them feel incomplete. But that was kinda just my opinions on the story, so now i'll tell you what the story is really about. The story is about Sakuta Azusagawa, who encounters multiple supernatural phenomenons in his daily life. These phenomenons are caused by feelings a person has, and turns them into something much worse. Sakuta, having experienced these things before, helps the people around him get through this \"sickness\", and make them realize why its happening to them, so they can do things differently, and fix their problems. Pretty basic, but enjoyable.   \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't really like the art direction in this anime. Each character just looked really plain to me, and the settings didn't look that great either. It just looks very generic. The animation the other hand; seemed pretty choppy. I don't know much about animation, so I can't really tell if its good or not.  But I have defiantly seen A LOT better than this. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, and ending songs, are really good in my opinion. The OP gives of this energetic rush, what looks, and sounds nice. The really love the ending song. I really like how lay'ed back it sounds, and sometimes I like to listen to it when I go to sleep.   \\n\r\nPersonal preference though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are defiantly the best part of this anime. Each character has their own personality, and makes them really enjoyable to watch. My favorite being Sakuta, because I love how straight forward he is with everyone. Especially when it comes to the girls.  Like for example, if a girl says \"what are you looking at, pervert!\" , Sakuta will straight up say \"You. I'm thinking very lewd thoughts about you.\" Or something like that. Probably not the best example, but that's all I could think of.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a blast to watch. If you take everything I said before, then this anime is really a good anime. In my personal opinion, this anime is a 10 out of 10, but since this is a review, I simply can't give it that, due to its flaws. In my opinion; the characters MAKE the anime, if it wasn't for them, then it would be a generic rom com  anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime defiantly has it's flaws, but its defiantly worth a watch in the end. You'll probably end up enjoying it as much as I did. But anyways, thanks for reading my review. If you found it helpful, then let me know. And if you thought this review sucked, then please criticize it, and tell me how I can improve. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "So assuming you aren't blind and you've read through the synopsis first and you've taken a good look at the score, I want to talk about why this show is good but slightly overrated.\r\nWe all remember when the show was about to air that it was labeled as the classic fanservice anime that comes along every season. But wait, something's off... the score is above the legendary 8.00 threshold for godlike fanservice anime! What the fuck how is that even possible? You may find asking yourself. And to be quite honest, I feel the same even after finishing the show. The story itself is nothingearth shattering- this doesn't mean that it's terrible and deserves to be gutted, but instead, means exactly what I said, nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nIf you came here for the thumbnail, you might be disappointed when I tell you that our one and only bunny girl is in that outfit a grand total of 2 times. Well if that's enough for you to turn around and say goodbye to the show, that's fair enough, since I almost did the same.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an anime comes in with extremely low expectations but goes above people's expectations, people tend to start jotting it down as the \"masterpiece of the season\". This certainly is the case for this anime, since I really do think it's overrated. At the time of writing this review, Bunny Girl is at an 8.63, but I'm expecting that to go down a bit after more people start watching it. It's at the score it is right now because the majority of the viewers are complete filth such as myself who give pretty generic garbage a 7+ since we enjoy that type of shows.\\n\\n\r\nI would say if you're fine with romance and a bit of a harem tease-esque show, go for it. It's your usual harem, except it isn't... just better in every way. The mc establishes a relationship as the bunny girl's boyfriend fairly early on, but the show doesn't completely revolve around that. Instead, it revolves around some pseudo-science concept called puberty syndrome. To me, that was a big \"hehe xd\" to my face because what a bunch of bullshit that was. Anyways, if you just don't focus on what the overarching story is or if you don't look for any clues as to what puberty syndrome is, you'll 8/10 enjoy watching the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the score doesn't lie... if you came to this show for an experience similar to enlightenment, sorry but you won't find it here. Maybe a character to add to your favorites list or something along those lines, but nothing that will make you jump out of your chair screaming what a great show that was. It wasn't too memorable and the characters except for Koga and Mai don't really stick to me, but if anyone asks me how the show was, it was good enough for me to say that the show was good, and they should give it a try.",

            "content": "Just from viewing the title and poster i assumed it was a typical fan service anime, but boy was i ever wrong. Never would actually expect this anime to actually have such a deep complex meaning towards life. Going to put minimum amount of spoilers as possible on this review :)\r\nBasically the anime revolves around the life of a High school teenager Sakuta, trying to live his daily life normally, but supernatural occurrences known as \"Puberty syndrome\" is affecting the people or lets just say the girls he encounters. Whom he must try and help.\r\nCharacters 9/10\r\nWe have our two main characters Sakuta and Mai, their personalities a lot refreshing and enjoyable to watch, also it contrasts a lot with each other but when two come together they carry good quality conversations and really have a good chemistry for a romance anime. \\n\r\nThey aren't the usual cliched characters with the same generic background, behavior pattern as most of the high school characters have. So that's a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nThe main male character or lets say the \"Rascal\" Sakuta, who has a nice refreshing quiet, self-contained attitude and with a kind of a interesting dark past which slowly gets revealed during the series as story progresses.\\n\r\nBut what sets him apart from the other normal MC's is his surprisingly normal, cool yet interesting personality, his high quality conversations which most of the time are sarcasm, his humor, ability to talk to female characters at a refreshing way.even able to roast them and crack jokes at them especially with his famous semi lewd jokes which is definitely enjoyable, but also his serious nature and ability to handle problems with intellectual prowess in a sensible and calm way when the situation arises like mainly helping the girls with the puberty syndromes. \\n\r\nAlso i forgot to mention our boy has a bit of a fetish of masochism which is presented in a quite humorous way. :3\\n\\n\r\nThen we have our Female MC or lets say Sakuta's \"Bunny Girl Senpai\", Mai who is a fairly famous actress, goes to the same school as him, and the first girl he helps with the syndrome. A beautiful calm matured girl with a sense of maturity, also has a bit of a tsundere personality not too much which i find really refreshing and nice to see. \\n\r\nAlso speaking of other good traits, she cooks well,skilled at her work and studies, knows how to support Sakuta when in need, being romantic to him at times and also knows how to keep him in check giving him a little bit of physical punishment like pinching him and stepping on his foot etc. Yep Best girl qualities for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOther side characters too which i found personally interesting and likable. For example\\n\\n\r\nFutaba rio, sakuta's close school friend, who's really sensible, smart and a science student, mostly found working in the chemistry lab and whom sakuta seeks advice for the syndrome problem and is the main source of help for him.\\n\r\nAlso she likes to tease and insult sakuta in a friendly way, and every time calling him a Buta yarou (Rascal). \\n\\n\r\nKunimi his very close male friend whom he knows for a long time, A carefree, athletic,jolly guy,  together with futaba all three of them are like really good friends. \\n\\n\r\nToga , Sakuta's Junior in school, who is a little scatterbrained, and is a bit over conscious of her social life and status and  how other people look at her. \\n\\n\r\nKaede, the most adorable and cute girl in the series in my opinion,Sakuta's younger sister. who had a incident in her past due to which she confined herself at home,  loves her elder brother and panda's the most and also is timid and shy to talk to others. \\n\r\nClings to sakuta when he awakes in the morning, tries to express her sisterly love in the most adorable manner. Really is a heartwarming and lovable character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other good characters too which are interesting, not boring and good personalities too, but didn't appeal to me that much.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nAnyways coming to the main story, more than romance the plot is basically about Puberty Syndrome affecting the girls and how Sakuta tries to solve them.\\n\r\nThe syndrome's are so well presented and how their connections are explained in relevance to actual Scientific theories for example Schrodinger's cat, Laplace's demon etc.\\n\r\nBut more importantly how these syndrome occurrences are due to the emotions, the personality, and the past of the characters in the story and actual in real life problems too.\\n\r\nEach girl with syndrome is given a certain set of episodes,which is the Syndrome arc, and it goes at a good pace and good character conversations and meaningful interactions which will hook you. \\n\\n\r\nYou could say the viewers can feel the same vibes as the monogatari series (If you have watched the series that is), especially with the main characters personality and different encounters with the girls. \\n\r\nArt/Animation 8/10\\n\r\nSpeaking of Animation and art, Its really detailed, clean and well made.Color quality is good too and well balanced. Will kinda remind you of Oregairu. Cloverworks did a good job overall though.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nGoing to sound, Nothing much to talk about, Sound quality is good, especially with background music which goes well with the occuring scenario and scenes \\n\r\nThe Opening Song (Kimi no Sei) though by the Peggies is amazing, from the animation, the scenes and the visuals, how it is presented to the lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nAlso i like the ending song (Fukashigi no Carte) which is really pleasant and interesting to watch, because it has a nice melody to it,apart from the music changes with each arc,syndrome and the girl concerned and is sung by the VA of the respective girl. Good Stuff.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nLastly, i would say that  this series is really good.The supernatural element with the mysteries of \u201cpuberty syndrome\u201d, how it is presented,explained, connected and solved. \\n\r\nA good bit of romance, a bit of slice of life and comedy, roller coaster of emotions, drama and plot twists with such good refreshing MC's and other characters with good interactions, development, visuals with good pacing is really more than worth your time.\\n\r\nA really High recommended watch for sure.",

            "content": "This is the Deishuu Kaiki of anime shows - an imposter that succeeds even though it's a fake. It's a \"low\"-effort deliberately engineered masterpiece-wannabe you cannot miss, because you may end up LOVING it. That is - if you forgive its great sins. Even if you don't - you may still enjoy the ride.\r\nI usually refrain from watching new anime shows during their premiere season, but when a BILLIONAIRE recommends a new anime to another BILLIONAIRE on Twitter you cannot just pass on the opportunity to check what all the fuss is about.\r\nThis is a very enjoyable show and definitely worth watching, but it has3 glaring problems:\\n\\n\r\n1.PRETENSE. \\n\r\nIt has a vibe of a manufactured piece of work by a craftsman who, without any deeper understanding, simply copied all the tricks that worked before. A well known method in many arts - when something works just do it again. Chances are it will, indeed, work again - even if you don't understand why.\\n\r\nIt borrows heavily from deeply flawed, but in their own ways masterful and inspiring shows like Haruhi, Bakemonogatari and Oregairu. The difference is these shows knew exactly what they were trying to accomplish and succeeded at. It copies some of their tricks quite well (nothing bad in that), but it mostly fails at copying their charms and there is not much of its own, original one. It's like tracing a human form from an artwork of a genius - the character in your art will also have perfect anatomy, like in the original, but all the rest will fall flat - just like the story in this anime...\\n\\n\r\nThe world is shallow like in an average slice of life anime, which is baffling for a supernatural genre. There is seemingly a lot of mystery, but there is not a bit of a mysterious atmosphere. Nothing. Nada. It tries to hide its shallowness behind some pseudo-scientific jibberish that adds nothing to the story, but at least it can create illusion of depth that some viewers will appreciate.\\n\\n\r\n2. CYNICISM. \\n\r\nOverly witty dialogues might be impressive to some, but they are so artificial and unauthentic the characters turn into \"smartass\" types instead of the insightful, intelligent people creators most likely thought they were making.\\n\r\nPeople say that the main couple has great chemistry and to some extent I agree, but It's really hard to escape that impression of overdone dialogues that may make you roll eyes. People don't talk like that. If you want believable wittiness with intelligent flirtation that can allure you with sweet teasing then watch Spice and Wolf and see how a beautiful, romantically implied chemistry actually works.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also another overdone thing, which is actually the biggest offender in this anime:\\n\r\n3. INDIFFERENCE. \\n\r\nThe characters are so full of themselves, so smart and above all and everything they wouldn't even care if the Earth was hit by an asteroid as big as their egos. Nothing impresses them, because they are apparently too cool to be impressed by anything. This is another example of not understanding the shows it was inspired by, where wittiness and cynicism was balanced with fears, insecurities and other emotions and imperfections that made the characters extremely human. There are some flawed secondary characters there, but the MC and his closest friends are just androids saying their well written lines.\\n\\n\r\nThis review may give impression that I'm hating on this anime, which is not the case. Despite the fact it's just a \"fake smart anime\" it's also a lot of fun. I realize that and still enjoy it, so I blame myself for falling for these simple patterns this anime exploits, not the authors. \\n\r\nAfter all, this is the Deishuu Kaiki of anime shows.",

            "content": "Welcome to the low-key best anime of Fall 2018. Don't let the anime cover fool you. The anime is definitely not here to shove the image of a hot bunny babe to everyone's eyes, but do enjoy it in the short moments that they do. \r\nThe anime follows the story of Azusagawa Sakuta, the chillest and probably the best mc of the season. Sakuta is a laid-back high school loner because he \"doesn't care about the atmosphere.\" The atmosphere is an imaginary something that people especially the youth consciously or unconsciously follow so that they could fit in.  It's a bit too complex toput into words, but the plot kinda reminds me of OreGairu which is another good watch if you haven't watched it. One day, Sakuta meets the hot celebrity senpai in a bunny suit Sakurajima Mai. Turns out Mai-senpai can't be seen by most people anymore due to the Adolescence Syndrome. (Again, pretty complex thing to explain but the anime is really good at explaining it so have patience.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nStory is not very realistic, and the conflicts are centered around the phenomenons that happen to the characters. Not really problem for me. Not completely unique as well. The conflicts in the anime  reminds me of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. If you enjoyed that, chances are you will enjoy this too. You will definitely love the conversations here. Witty and provides good laughs without trying hard. Really just good script and chemistry of personalities of characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nCharacters are not ultimately special, but you'll grow fond of them, they have their uniqueness and personalities that gives interesting and witty delivery of conversations\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nArt is just so good. I normally dont complain or say anything about art. Simply it just looks stunning, and proportions of body are very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI dont ask a lot for sounds, but the OP is hella catchy while the ED is also nice and gives off that kind of sad, melancholic feeling when you finish the episode wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI wait for this the most if not Goblin Slayer. (On the other hand, Sao alicization seems not keeping up with the excitement I used to have with it)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nCant score perfect 10, feels like a biased score and I believe this isnt yet a masterpiece and season's far from over, but the anime is currently scored 8.55 overall and thats really high  \\n\\n\\n",

I was even impressed by how fast the time passes when I visualize it, although I can not say that I have a wide catalog of animes seen, if I can say: \"Wow, I'm liking it more than usual!\".\r\nI did not think of writing anything, it gives me laziness. What I encourage to write is that although it has a good overall score, the reviews that stand out are mostly negative and I wanted to contributea bit to an anime that does, it deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great and continues on a good footing but the end was not the best, I felt something hurried, but I'm satisfied. I add in turn his art that in general, although it does not have the best animation, its opening and ending (especially the ending) are fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nIts sound is very good, the opening engages and the ending falls in love, and also if they pay attention to the ending, with each change you hear a different voice (as if each character had its own voice). And yes, I know that this is not all the \"sound\" that the anime has, but in general, I did not hear anything remarkable about the background after the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI will not talk about the characters, they have to see it. The protagonist is not a prince, you see he says and does the right thing because he is like that, he is not forced. The rest of the characters must also see them, I do not want to extend this because each character has a defined personality and if I say them, I would lose the emotion of knowing them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's all, I hope you like it as I express myself when writing and that it's understandable. Thanks for reading, at least I know, or I think, that you read the beginning and the end, right? Bye :)\\n\\n\r\n=== - Versi\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol - ===\\n\\n\r\n\u00a1Me gusto mucho!\\n\\n\r\nAl empezar me enganch\u00e9 a este casi de forma inmediata. Hasta me impresionaba lo r\u00e1pido que pasa el tiempo cuando la visualizo, aunque no puedo decir que tengo un amplio cat\u00e1logo de animes vistos, si puedo decir: \"\u00a1Guau, esto me est\u00e1 gustando m\u00e1s de lo normal!\".\\n\\n\r\nNo pens\u00e9 en escribir nada, me da flojera. Lo que me animo a escribir es que aunque tiene buena puntuaci\u00f3n general las reviews que m\u00e1s destacan son mayormente negativas y quer\u00eda aportar un poco a un anime que s\u00ed, se lo merece.\\n\\n\r\nLa historia es buenisima y contin\u00faa a buen pie pero el final no fue de lo mejor, lo sent\u00ed algo apresurado, pero estoy satisfecho. Le sumo a su vez su arte que en general, aunque no tiene la mejor animaci\u00f3n, su opening y ending (sobre todo el ending) son fant\u00e1sticos.\\n\\n\r\nSu sonido es muy bueno, el opening engancha y el ending enamora, y adem\u00e1s si dan atenci\u00f3n al ending, con cada cambio se escucha una voz diferente (como si cada personaje tuviera su propia voz). Y si, se que eso no es todo el \"sonido\" que tiene el anime pero en general por mi parte no escuch\u00e9 algo destacable de fondo pasados los primeros episodios.\\n\\n\r\nNo hablar\u00e9 de los personajes, tienen que verlo. El protagonista no es un princeso, se v\u00e9 que dice y hace lo correcto porque \u00e9s as\u00ed, no es forzado. El resto de personajes tambi\u00e9n deben verlas, no me quiero extender esto ya que cada personaje tiene su personalidad definida y si las digo perder\u00eda la emoci\u00f3n por conocerlas.\\n\\n\r\nY es todo, espero que guste como me expreso al escribir y que sea entendible. Esto va para la comunidad habla hispana \u00a1que no les veo! Gracias por leer, por lo menos s\u00e9, o creo, que leiste el principio y el final \u00bfno?. Chao :)",

But after seeing how some people are treating this anime I felt like I just had to share my ideas on it too.\r\nFirst and foremost I gotta say that this anime isn't at all like others of the same genre and i'm saying this after watching almost every popular anime of the genres involved, it's most definitely one of the best these genres have to offer\r\nThe characters, specially the MC and the MaineHeroine however were definitely more interesting, endearing, rational and lovable than any other anime of the same genre I have seen before. Things that most anime tend to miss either intentionally or not are beautifully showcased here. The art, sound and story were great and the interactions between characters were masterfully done and I enjoyed every second of it.\\n\r\nLastly I wanna repeat myself and say it again that this anime has NO other like it, sure the whole setup isn't anything new but the way the story plays out and the way the characters react to situations is definitely not something you can find elsewhere.\\n\r\nI recommend this anime wholeheartedly!\\n\r\nI know me saying how good it is doesn't really make much of a difference to someone who's already decided whether this anime is any good or not but I just wanted to write the stuff I love about this great show, I thought I owed the anime and it's creators that much. \\n",

The introduction to the first arc with Mai instantly got me hooked. From the MC\u2019s interaction with his school friends to his interactions with his little sister at home, each held some weight. Each scene, episode, and arc had meaning. To some extent, each character was explored and had a separate arc or episode of their own. They were all unique in their own little way; this tedious detail left a big impression on me. The pacing of each episode wasperfect. The morals and actions of each character made sense and were followed to a fault. The ending of the anime was heartbreaking, but it was also unforgettable. It left a sense of longing. \u201cDid everything that just occurred happen for naught\u201d?",

            "content": "I actually planned to complain about the negative comments here, but I rather want to prove them wrong because it better brings my point across, that this anime is amazing. \r\nI heard many people say that Sakuta Azusagawa is a shit character, I disagree! Sure he may have said things to girls like are you on your period, but this is completely taken out of context. Sakuta was told by a girl to leave one of his best friends alone because of Sakutas bad reputation (which is also due to a false rumor, which he isn\u2019t responsible for) This girl is also the girlfriend ofhis best friend and thinks she is \u201ecaring\u201c for her boyfriend by doing so. To this Sakuta teases her with asking if she is on her period, to which the girl responds with go die. \\n\r\nSakuta is one of the kindest character I\u2019ve seen in Anime. He actually adopted the philosophy of being a nicer person everyday. It is not the typical harem anime. Sure girls have problems, and he helps them cope with them, but other than with Mai he never shows any kind of doing it so they Love him. He does it because he cares, most of the times. If he doesn\u2019t already have a deeper connection with someone he developes it by helping them. There is no goal other than to help others the same way a distinct girl helped him, but I won\u2019t talk about her to much in case you haven\u2019t watched the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what is also great about this show, the character are all human. Everyone is trying their best, but it is hard fighting alone, so the push Sakuta gives them actually isn\u2019t the reason they are happy. He is the trigger that makes people stand up for themselves and ultimately let\u2019s them choose not to follow the crowds expectations. \\n\\n\r\nI could talk about a lot more but I think nobody will read further so I am just writing one last sentence. Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, is not for everyone, but if you listen closely to the dialogue, the characters will make you root for them and will in the end make you cry.",

One of the positive criticisms from the anime was that it felt like the Monogatari Series. The only comparison that people said was that the main characters help other girls with their problems.\r\nHowever...\r\nThe art, animation, and sound design weren't critiqued or mentioned anywhere. \r\nTherefore, my only strategy going into this anime was to expect nothing more or less sinceI want to learn why people like this anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nI expected nothing from this anime... yet I was still disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nStory -- 3\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple. We have our protagonist, who is a male,  and also an average high school boy that take their free-time devoting himself to different female characters. These problems oppress them and there would be a solution for their issue. Of course, the method is specific. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of this anime uses Quantum Physics, supernatural events, atmosphere, and puberty syndrome (which is a made-up term). The atmosphere in the anime determines whether or not you want to keep out of their situation. \\n\r\nThe use of theories from Quantum Physics (Copenhagen Interpretation, Laplace Demon, etc.) is outstandingly stupid because of how it's interpreted and used to solve these supernatural events even though it has nothing to do with their \"problems.\" To use a high school explanation of Quantum Physics for the purpose giving it an excuse of adding depth to solve these \"complex issues\" proves that this was written by a pseudo-intellectual. It gets even worse when the writing, after a couple of episodes, give up on Quantum Physics explanations and idiotically write out many pointless supernatural events which had nothing to do with Quantum Physics. \\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help when the pacing is just ridiculously slow when every arc is just a beach episode for its own. There are scenes where I wished they could end quickly and move on to the meat of the anime. Whatever thoughts I received from these pointless fillers are always how miserable the supporting characters are, how boring the comedy feels, and how awful some scenes were which their only purpose was to make the character look cool. The filler is just there to add a humongous tautology. There was no foreshadowing, depth, or enjoyment whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nEvery ending is also an anticlimax, too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 3\\n\\n\r\nAzusagawa Sakuta, the male protagonist of the anime, is an ostentatious jerk who shamelessly harasses classmates while helping them in situations they somehow couldn't solve. This behavior from the main character appears constantly in almost every episode and the script wants you to laugh at it only for it to become dull over time.  His second quality as a character was his background which we didn't learn more about until the very last arc of the anime. There was no development to be noted from the main character because he's just too one-dimensional in every arc and basically does nothing cool; not even something remarkable UNTIL the very last arc. \\n\r\nTherefore, Azusagawa Sakuta is nothing more but a jerk who just helps other girls out of self-interest and the scar on his chest is nothing more but to feel bad for the main character. I can't even find any relatability or any deep meaning towards his actions. His actions are just dumb and he's not even aware of it sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nNow mentioning the main character, I should tell you that the other characters are practically dumb as well; the characters are too dumb to solve their problems which can they can be relieved from by doing one simple action. That simple action is effective for most of their cases because it just shows how the concept of the atmosphere is so boring in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nJUST! DO! IT! \\n\\n\r\nNo wonder why the anime was terrible pacing because instead of making actual complex themes and explore them or just getting it over with, the script decides it would be a great idea to prolong the end of the arc as if the script was aware that the circumstances in the anime are just too stupid and easily solvable. The pacing couldn't even give more depth to the character. \\n\r\nMai Sakurajima receives little to no character development, and the chemistry between Sakuta and her is very transparent, but I couldn't care more for her problems; although there was one part where I do feel bad slightly. Tomoe Koga is also annoying since her only problem was that the main character wasn't attracted enough to her. Understanding Futaba Rio was also annoying. Despite her being smart in Physics, she wastes three episodes just to conclude that the only way she can solve her issue was to communicate with her other self which the Quantum Physics explanations for her troubles doesn't make sense. Toyohama Nodoka is also annoying as her only problem was to be better than her accomplished opposite \\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting casts has no purpose for the story, and I've always questioned: \"why do they deserve screen time?\" \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there was only one character that stands out AND is better than the rest of these characters. Kaede's problems were more realistic than the other girls, and she solves her problems by doing something instead of relying heavily on the main character. This is also her arc where we get to see Sakuta's good qualities as a character. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, I wished the other characters would actually feel more real so that they feel more appropriate for this story. These characters are but contestants for best comic instead of best drama.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 3 \\n\\n\r\nThe art was also terrible. The backgrounds were over saturated, the objects didn't have any textures or intricate details, the character designs were boring and unappealing, and the composition looks lame and unfocused sometimes. \\n\r\nThe composition was out of place because there were many CG cars that would distract you from following the main characters. There were also facial expressions in the backgrounds that looks awkward and distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was also terrible since the character movement would also look stiff. However, in other scenes, the animation would improve but would only last for a few seconds. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are also boring to look at, too. \\n\\n\r\nSince this anime was made by \"Cloverworks,\" I could completely understand why everything looked low quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound Design -- 4 \\n\\n\r\nThere was nothing remarkable about the sound direction for the anime since the sounds were designed by Iwanami. Everything sounded generic and uninspired. However, there was one sound clip where I had to confirm that my ears weren't interpreting incorrectly. After I confirmed it, I began laughing because the sound was too horrible to defend it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was okay, I guess. I liked the ending song...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 1 \\n\\n\r\nI did marathon this with someone I know since we halted at the same episode. Although watching it completely in a single day didn't wear us out completely. \\n\\n\r\nWe had some good laughs, some confusions, and there were times when we got angry at the direction. But what this anime has proven was that seasonal anime that becomes popular by the consensus would always be terrible. \\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn't matter how many times people tried to defend this...\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this anime or even this year, that's good for you. However, it'll be hard to convince me to return to popular stuff in future seasons since 2018 had killed it for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall -- 2 \\n\\n\r\nThis review was written by a Monogatari fan. A big surprise that a concept similar to the Monogatari Series still wouldn't make me enjoy some of the trash I had to endure since it couldn't do anything well.",

            "content": "'Never judge a book by its cover' - This couldn't be more true with this anime, it is a treasure. Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (Seishun Buta Yarou Wa Bunny Girl) is a superbly crafted series surrounding a high schooler called Sakuta and mysterious cases of 'adolescence syndrome' which gravitate towards him in everyday life.\r\nIn short, adolescene syndrome is unusual and varies case by case, but astonishingly mental scaring can manifest in the physical form. Some examples include: A desire to be ignored but results in becoming non existent, replaying days (think ground-hog day) to get a more desirable outcome, and evenhaving a split personally disorder which creates a copy of said person born from desires (notice me senpai?).\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, this disease is the integral theme running through the show, all of which draws the protagonist Sakuta. The anime is also enchanting from Sakuta's developing relationship with Mai, an actress on hiatus. From the first episode its explained that Mai is suffering from adolescence syndrome impacting her visibility in life. Here enters the bunny girl outfit.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Sakuta and Mai is complicated at times, but along with the shows theme the anime does not become tedious and is in fact quite thought provoking for a show with bunny girl in it's title. The series explores struggles which may well hit home to some, including cases of online abuse, social anxiety and the desire for acceptance in the modern age.\\n\\n\r\nEach character with adolescence syndrome is given time to express their individual personalities and you can't help but feel for their own unique hardships. I think the most heartbraking of them all is Sakuta's little sister, but you'll have to wait until the series climaxes to understand.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the show via Crunchyroll Premium subbed and the story, art style and VAs are top notch! I must also give salute to the infectious opening Kimi No Sei by The Peggies. This tune perfectly suits the show, it's one of my favourite tunes from anime out in 2018. The lyrics are genius to pair with the relationship between Sakuta and Mai.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult for me to praise this anime much more without going into spoilers, but as I refrain from doing so in my reviews, what I will say is this... Give this anime a watch, cast aside any initial conceptions (you could easily overlook it) and get to the golden episode, for me that was episode three. At this stage you will truly start to understand why this series is worth persuing and sticking with.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was one of my absolute favourite's of the entire of 2018 - so I really do feel passionate in my attempts to persuade you to watch it! I honestly feel you will not be disappointed, especially if you (like me) enjoy slice of life anime with a dash of romantic comedy, but also want a show that stays with you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you need one thing to rope you in, check out the opening tune Kimi No Sei by The Peggies (It's so catchy!) \\n\\n\r\nI rate this anime 10/10 - Story pace, art style, VA, audio - it's the perfect package and I wish the series didn't end after 13 episodes. @RayeRayeChan\\n\\n\r\nYou can watch this show on Crunchyroll \\n\\n\r\nThe trailer is available via AniplexUS\\n\\n\r\nNote the images I have used are copyright of AniplexUSA / Cloverworks and the creators, I do not own any to rights to this anime.

It attempts to make some analogies with quantum physics and existentialism on the plot development but fails completely, to the point everything seems extremely forced and unconvincing. The core of the plot, which is the \"adolescence syndrome\" is in fact an interesting concept, as it depicts how society perceives you and how you perceive yourself. The problem is that this isn't explored at all throughout the series, as it lefts everything poorly explained, and it gets worse after the first half of the anime, as the plot feels very disconnected from its original idea. Maincharacters don't have enough carisma, and secondary ones have even less, yet the anime dedicates entire episodes to them, it's hard to understand. \\n\r\nWell, at least you could say the ending theme is nice.",

And this is a very interesting idea. For example, a famous actor is nearly forgotten, evoking this unreal sense of loneliness. However, this sense of emotion is constantly being belittled by an attempt to create a 'mystery' within this anime, accompanied by extremely odd scientific analogies. It seems like the writers were unsure what this anime was meant to be.\r\nAswell, the main character is insufferable. While having many interesting traits, such his lack of a phone which gives this sense of willful isolation, his character contributes little except for a constant juvenile sarcasm. His remarks constantly ruined the mood throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this shown has many interesting ideas and emotions, but the execution is just poor. So, if you are willing to ignore that, I recommend it.",

While I did get a little bit of that (not as much as I expected), I definitely am not disappointed - this is a standout show. A great watch that was heartwarming, entertaining and relatable at times.\r\nWhat actually makes this show great is that it is relatable - growing up we've all experienced certain things, the fear of being left out, not being part of the 'cool' people and being mocked; at times feeling we are lesser than others and wishing we could be them.Even though they did add some magical/sci-fi twists to it, the base of it all is realistic enough and is definitely something many of us can identify ourselves as having been there before.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are amazingly written. They managed to flesh out and develop each character really well in a short span of time - usually 2 or 3 episodes per arc. The dialogue and interactions between characters was refreshing and entertaining - I loved the banter between our 2 MCs and basically Sakuta with anybody - speaking exactly what he thinks. The animation was decent - nothing exactly outstanding but it was good enough to complement the great story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound - I have to point out arguably the catchiest opening of the year. I literally sang along every episode like a fanboy - who wouldn't when you hear the unmistakable 'KIMI NO SEI KIMI NO SEI'. The ED was also great.\\n\\n\r\nA really entertaining watch - yes, while it does have that Monogatari - Oregairu vibes and some accuse it of being a plain copy, they are actually pretty different and I appreciate that. 9/10 for me.",

HELL YEAH.\\n\r\nAm i particularly excited for it?kind of.\\n",

I not am against people having a negative opinion on the show, but it is clear when people deliberately attack it, in the hope of dropping down its score. \r\nSo, what does \"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\" have to offer? What we have here is a quality high school drama, with a touch of the supernatural, disguised as quantum science.\r\nRascal Senpai has the viewer experience the high school life of the ensemble characters, surrounding the MP,as they struggle through everything from romantic hardships to social ostracization. These real life issues then manifest in physical form, like someone living two lives forming an actual clone of themselves. This allows those viewing to see, in a way, the struggles that people face within their own psyche in a more tangible sense.\\n\\n\r\nFor the lead we have Sakuta, a self described rascal. Rather he is a straight laced guy with a calm demeanor. Often he can come off a bit one note, but can be seen throughout the show as being multilayered, having moments of strong emotion for those he cares about.\\n\\n\r\nWhat for most will be a draw-in for the show is the comedic and witty banter between the two leads, Sakuta and Mai, the romantic duo. Though there becomes less and less of this overall as the show progresses, the character writing remains strong throughout. The first three episodes on their own could be a self contained film and are arguably the strongest point in the 13 episode run time.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the positives; great characters, a few phenomenal character arcs, strong writing throughout, one of the more grounded romances in anime, consistently funny, and a real heart-string puller.\\n\\n\r\nFor negatives; A dip in animation quality here and there, a few anime tropes, an inconclusive ending, and no real overarching narrative.\\n\\n\r\nNone the less, these few negatives do not detract from the overall enjoyment, in my opinion. If you at all enjoy romance/drama, this is not one to miss. 9/10",

I'll try keeping this short since I know you don't like reading a college paper on an ANIME review.\r\nI like this show (A LOT), and now am dealing with the rare instance of feeling like an arrow just pierced through my soul. Out of the however many shows that came out this season, this was the only onethat I was able to watch all the way through, and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people have been comparing this show to the likes of Monogatari and Oregairu, and I can definitely see where they're coming from. However, just because there are similar archetypes between the shows doesn't make Bunny Girl Senpai a direct copycat. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, I became extremely intrigued to learn more about the characters and world. The witty dialogue was able to keep my attention throughout the episodes, and with me who isn't very interested slice of life shows, the show gets immense credit.\\n\\n\r\nMost protagonists are cardboard cutouts of each other, and having one in a slice of life show where a great deal of the genre revolves around the characters, the show is inevitably hindered back. I'm happy to say however that Bunny Girl Senpai's MC, Sakuta, is a very intriguing character who says whatever's on his mind, creating many memorable and unique conversations.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance aspect of this show is something I'm extremely fond of, as unlike many harem-esk shows, Sakuta actually stays romantically committed to one girl, opposed to getting in the pants of every girl he stumbles across. Before I end this review I just need to put it out there that Mai is the best waifu of 2018.",

Some people might consider this a con, but I recommend watching this either way.\r\nPros:\r\n-The characters have actual chemistry and their relationships are actually believable. Don't let first impressions fool you, it's not a harem-y show, It has alot of powerful messages and refreshing character interactions. (very reminiscent of Monogatari)\\n\\n\r\n-The music is great. Some people might find the OP a little jarring, but personally, I found myself singing along to it. The ED is especially beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n-The story is touching and somehow relatable. It's like daily life meets supernatural phenomena. Cliche at first but all the scenarios are well done.\\n\\n\r\nI say watch this show without overhyping yourself. I find that a lot of people end up disliking shows because they were expecting a masterpiece. Create your own opinion first.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I haven't really done a formal review on this site before; usually I just include some brief comments on the tags of each entry in my anime list, but I just finished this show today, and I have some thoughts on it, so I figured this was a good time to start writing reviews :D\r\nAnyway, I'm not going to bother delving into each sub-category, since I know that some people may just want an earnest reflection instead of a fragmented review (which is what I prefer in reading them)\r\nBunny-girl Senpai is not a show I originally intended to watch this season, as the title andposter made me believe it was a harem of some sorts, and that genre isn't something I typically jump at without reason to. But after seeing how well it was doing I checked it out, and ended up loving it. I don't know how many people would agree with this remark, but the show screamed \"Monogatari\"....Like....a stoic and detached protagonist helps one tsundere girl get rid of her paranormal problem brought upon her by her mental and emotional distress, then ends up dating her afterwards, then helping other girls with similar problems.....it literally sounds just like Monogatari's synopsis. I think that similarity is the primary reason why this anime has done so well....However it's lackluster in comparison to the great Monogatari. For one, while I love stoic protagonists, I feel that Azusagawa became less and less interesting as the show went on....one of the major things that killed him is how his demeanor did nothing to match his personality. To take Araragi as an example: Araragi started his series heavily detached, and stoic, but as his relationships and experiences grew it was apparent that his demeanor was loosening. He became more social, and outgoing, and wise as a result of his exploits. Azusagawa on the other hand, goes through similar experiences but doesn't really change as a result. The only changes we see are in his freakouts which are super uncharacteristic to the point that they just weirded me out, because Azusagawa really just went from one extreme to another, rather than slowly getting more emotional as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOne strong point that this series has (and everyone seems to acknowledge) is the realistic and charming nature of the relationship between Azusagawa and Mai. This however, is also a bootleg version of Araragi and Senjougahara's relationship from Monogatari.....as in the dynamic is LITERALLY the same, only that, yet again, there is no growth outside the start of their relationship. Their interactions are enjoyable, but the sad part is that the relationship doesn't really deepen at all, which loses it a lot of points.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Futaba, your bootleg Tsubasa (aka large chested, glasses wearing science girl who acts as the main protag's guide of sorts in dealing with numerous situations) also from Monogatari :D Only that yet again......you can guess the rest at this point :\\\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, to sum it all up, this show had an extremely strong start, which is why I was so into it during the 1st 8 episodes or so (I even considered a 10 rating), but then the show's hard weakness set in: its lack of development. And I know I compared this show to Monogatari a lot, but that's because Bunny-girl is literally the same show only shallower and sub-par by comparison. My end verdict: If this show interests you and you haven't watched all of the Monogatari series yet: Watch the Monogatari series. It is far, far lengthier, but it is well worth it. Otherwise, for those who have watched Monogatari: watch it if you really feel like it, but be warned that this show becomes more lackluster as it goes on, ESPECIALLY if you start to become aware of the Monogatari similarities, as they'll make you appreciate the show less. However, if you watch the show all in one sitting, I think that the momentum from the 1st half of the show should carry over to the other half. I watched this show as it was coming out, so I didn't really get that option :( \\n\\n\r\nI really don't think that this show deserves the 8.67 it has as of me writing this review :\\ If I could give decimal ratings, I would rate this show more of a 7.7. I think there are plenty of shows this season that deserve that score instead.....*cough**cough* SSSS Gridman *cough**cough* Run with the Wind *hack*",

            "content": "Pros:\r\n- Interesting concept, even if many of the story arcs and phenomena occurring are highly derivative of other (in my opinion, superior) anime.  There's enough of a unique twist to keep it from feeling like just a rehash of other series\r\n- Characters are all likable and easy to connect with in some way or another.  The phenomena that occur throughout creates a great sense of drama and character development throughout making the story that much more interesting\r\n- Satisfying conclusion\r\n- Artwork looks amazing throughout.  There are some very rich uses of colors and some interesting \"camera\" angles throughout\r\n- Probably the funniest anime allseason (even though I wouldn't call it a comedy necessarily).  The deadpan delivery of some of the more ridiculous lines makes it even better.\\n\\n\r\n- I really like the OP to this.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- As mentioned previously, some of the derivative elements from other series stick out like a sore thumb.  In some cases its almost an entire reenactment of events but with different characters.  This problem gets resolved after the first three episodes.\\n\\n\r\n- Deceptive title and summary could turn people off to an otherwise great show.\\n\\n\r\n- Too many bath scenes.  Not really a major con, per se, mostly just an observance.  When I look back on this show, I'll most likely think of people taking baths.  Just saying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nAside from one other show (that I have yet to find out the conclusion of) this is probably the best series of the Fall 2018 season.  Its a shame the promotion of this was so crappy, because it really does give perspectives to the psychological experience during adolescence and early adulthood in a very creative way.  While it does take a few episodes for the plot to really get interesting, I still recommend this if you enjoy romantic comedies with some drama and psychological twists as I do.",

And to add more the gimmick of all time in anime if something can't be realistically portrayed, we have 'Quantum mechanics'. Why is time not moving forward? 'Quantum mechanics', oh, there are two exactly same character,' Quantum mechanics', incest? ' Quantum mechanics'. But honestly speaking this anime was worth while, with puberty and adolescence as the go to main theme here, theanime tries to tackle it in the most interesting way, bring in girls cause that's what appeals this market. With each character 'problem' arc being around 2 or more episodes, I think this anime brings out issues like bullying, your first love, rejection, identity crisis and more. And that ties well with the theme of puberty and how everyone is not exactly perfect during this times with doing stupid stuffs like there is no tomorrow but if you have never experienced any of the above, you're an absolute chad. Now moving on the cause this is suppose to be a structured review, the art or the look of the anime is kinda bonkers, could've been better, I mean look at our protagonist, the BG character looks way better, maybe the budget was for the waifus after all. And then the characters itself, where the usual suspect at, where the dere's at? And finally the sound \"Kimi no Sei=kanashii ureshii\". So is it a watch, up to you honestly, It's anime man, just watch it. Some may like it, some have 'Quantum mechanic' IQ and may not enjoy, who am I to judge?",

            "content": "Finally got to watch the show after waiting for all the episodes to air so I can binge watch it (glad I did because some of the cliffhangers would have felt like torture). I was suprised to find that the show lived up to my expectations it was fantastic and I found myself flying through every episode. I was planning on taking a break from anime because I am feeling a little burnt out but this show was so good I can't help but want to search for more like it.\r\nI enjoyed every episode, all the episodes had something to offer whether it be humour,the interactions between everyone or advancing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC was brilliant he actually made me laugh a lot and was a likeable character who wasn't wimpy or afraid of girls like most anime MC's are in rom com's. Mai was a great female lead, not sure what she is classed as but she didn't seem to be a tsundere she actually felt less like a character type and more realistic. She didn't hit the MC or belittle him; she just teased him - although it usually backfired. Honestly both of the leads of this show are some of my favourite anime leads ever and if it wern't for them the show wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is. I also liked his three friends and sister. I was glad Kunimi was actually useful and not a joke character like the MC's guy friends usually are in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo those who kept saying it was like Monogatari and Oregairu. I can kind of see that although I think only the first 2 episodes felt like Oregairu the rest not so much, the structure and characters did remind me of Monogatari though (if Monogatari was a bit more normal). The stucture of a new supernatural arc every few episodes, Kaede and Tomoe's stories felt kind of like Nadeko's being split into two. Mai also reminded me somewhat of Senjougahara and Sakuta is pervy and helpful like Araragi. But again this show is more normal compared to Monogatari (don't mean that in a bad way - their different but similar).\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I was worried about was that there would be too much fan-service because the MC is meant to be a bit pervy and the whole Bunny Girl aspect. In the end I was pleasantly suprised and found like no fan-service I am so happy about that because I hate fan-service in animes. Even Oregairu had too much fan-service and weird camera angles in my opinion, really not a fan of that.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show ends here and doesn't get a season 2 I would be okay with that, the ending felt somewhat satisfying and I hear there will be a movie covering the Shoko story. However, I would still like a season 2 but currently there doesn't seem to be enough content to make a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nNow I am going to go look for more anime like this.",

            "content": "From the first episode, Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai was not what anyone expected at first glance. I for one came to see a cute girl in a bunny outfit and I am pretty sure that goes for most of us who decided to watch the show. I expected a harem, ecchi story but instead received a well-written, interesting story. The harem setup is there but the show is not a harem at all. Bunny Girl Senpai is entertaining, fun and at the same time tackles mature and realistic situations. \r\n\u201cPuberty syndrome- abnormal experiences rumored on the internet to be causedby sensitivity and instability during adolescence\u201d. This is what the story in Bunny Girl revolves around. Just teens going through the hardships of adolescence. But abnormal things occur to them. For some reason I decided to check if it was an actual illness after seeing the first episode so I can assure you it is not an actual illness. Just something made up for the plot of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student who one day sees a bunny girl at the library, appear in front of him. That girl is Mai Sakurajima, Sakuta\u2019s upperclassman and popular celebrity actress on hiatus. She is experiencing puberty syndrome and is invisible to most people around her. Sakuta is on a mission to help her overcome the problem that is causing this phenomenon. Mai is not the only one experiencing this though. Throughout the story, other girls start appearing with puberty syndrome and Sakuta is the one who helps them. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the attractive girls in the show, the concept of puberty syndrome is what kept me watching the show every week. As stated earlier, the characters in the show are going through the hardships of adolescence but abnormal things are happening to them. For example, Mai\u2019s effect from puberty syndrome is that she is invisible to nearly everyone around her and forgotten by them as well. This is because she is overwhelmed by the show biz and hates that her mother forced her to do things and unconsciously wishes to not be known at all. Tomoe Koga has this effect of repeating the current day she is in and living a simulated future. This is because she is unhappy with how situations turn out for her. She wants things to go her way, wants to be liked and accepted by everyone and does not want to have a bad reputation. We have all gone through something similar that the characters are going through. Adolescence is one of the most significant points in our lives. We are developing not only physically but psychologically as well. We have a lot going on during this period and I believe the show captures it appropriately. I guess that is why I found it appealing. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to Mai being my favorite character, I really enjoyed Sakuta as well. He is cheeky and a smug character and makes sarcastic remarks most of the time. He has all these girls around him but isn\u2019t all googly eye for them like other MC in other animes. There are rumors about him going around school, sort of giving him a bad rep but he is pretty much careless. Besides all this, Sakuta is a person who sincerely cares about others. Before the events of the story, Sakuta and his sister, Kaede, go through puberty syndrome themselves. Seeing his sister in a bad state makes Sakuta feel terrible. At his lowest point, he meets Shoko Makinohara, his first love if I am correct. She is there for Sakuta when he needs support and helps him get through his situation. Shoko is the one who sort of shapes Sakuta into who he is in the present. He understands what it feels like to be in a situation where you feel almost incapable of doing anything. Just like Shoko was there for him in his time of need, Sakuta wants to be there for his friends who are emotionally feeling unstable. I believe this is what makes Sakuta a great character and that is why I like him as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST for this anime was nice and the animation was well done as well. I really liked the character designs for all the girls and I\u2019d like to say that it is also what kept me watching the show as well. The dialogue is nothing special but it is really intriguing. Of course, my favorite interaction is between Sakuta and Mai. The dialogue between them is great. It feels authentic. The romance between them is good too. It is not over the top. It feels natural. I\u2019d like to say that it is a pretty good representation of how relationships actually are. Apart from the fact that Sakuta is with a new girl every other week and Mai does her best to not be bothered by it. Do that in real life and you are getting dumped pretty quickly\u2026Unless you have someone as loyal and understanding as Mai, in which that case, you are one lucky person and I envy you for finding true love. \\n\\n\r\nI have seen people have trouble with the explanations given by Futaba about the abnormal situations the characters are facing due to puberty syndrome. They say it is nonsense and vague. To those people, I would like to say: IT IS AN ANIME. I mean if you really expect a in depth explanation to each phenomenon happening then you really have high standards and probably did not enjoy this anime as much as others. Just go with what they give you. I don\u2019t think the exposition is what you should be focusing on in this show. The main focus should be on the characters, their emotions and situation. That is what the anime is about. Adolescence. The explanation as to why it is occurring is secondary and not as important. \\n\\n\r\nI have to end with some criticism I believe. I would have liked the story more if the characters didn\u2019t just seem to disappear after their stories ended. I kind of completely forgot Koga existed a few episodes after her arc ended. If Futaba had not been important to the story then I would have forgotten about her to. Each character did have their time to shine and it was done well so it is not that big of a deal. Also, the ending did feel sort of open ended and rushed. It felt jammed and I feel like an extra episode or two could have made it better. Apparently, a movie is coming out sometime in the future so it might answer some questions that were left unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime more than I should have and I am guessing that is because of the lack luster summer season. This is probably my favorite anime of the fall season. If you are looking to watch a cute girl wander around in a bunny outfit for 13 episodes straight then this is not the show for you. Believe me, I was also disappointed at the lack of appearance made by my bunny girl waifu. If you are looking for an entertaining show with a good story and a great cast of characters, then yes I do recommend that you watch Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai.",

Basically the plot revolves around a central character named Sakuta Azusagawa whose everyday life was interrupted  by a girl wearing a playboy bunny suit  who walks around the library where the MC is , in order to attract attention cu'z she wants to know  if she is truly invisible or just being ignored, from there the guy's peaceful and boring life changes as he deals with each of the girls whom were curse by an unknown force called \" Puberty Syndrome\" which was another one of those misused term that them Japs used that doesn't makes sense, in fact to add such mysterious term should have been fitted to a horror genre or mystery genre and not with a romance genre, since the guy is dealing with girls that have such curse and yes I did call it a curse since them girls each experiences such phenomenon on a variety of levels you have Mai Sakurajima whose puberty syndrome involves her being invisible or disappearing after deciding to go on hiatus from making shows or movies,  Koga Tomoe whose syndrome is being able to turn back time cu'z she want's to fit in or is having some insecurities about her own well being, Rio Futaba, whose syndrome for crying out loud is about her having a doppelganger that was very much like her in every way, where it violates the laws of probability. Nodoka Toyohama whose syndrome  has her changing bodies with her big sister Mai.....and Kaede whose syndrome was pretty much in touch with a real kind of situation where we can say that her bad experiences were tuck away in a from of amnesia, where a new personality emerges and we have the mysterious Shouko Makinohara whom somehow serves as Sakuta's guardian angel whom appears in her grow up form when someone in need like Sakuta needs it, and it was quite unfortunate that we don't even know her background or who she really was. On the character category, I did mention that everything revolves around a central character Sakuta and his quest to solve the puberty syndromes that were plaguing the girls, now contradictory to the anime's title where he was classified as a rascal, he was anything but a rascal so why was he call such term???? The only thing he was , was a boy who has no qualms to speak his mind were he can be classified as just being  direct without the BS, Mai Sakurajima was a dichotomy at one point she accepts Sakuta's love, but in the next she teases him, Rio Futaba, being a sciences geek was a good fit for her character when she has to be the Guy's go to girl for some advice on the so called \" Puberty Syndrome\", cu'z the syndrome itself doesn't jive well with science, it would have been probably be better if she is into the occult or anything that has to do with black magic and stuffs. Koga Tomoe, would have been a better fit for the guy since she was basically wife material , and too bad that she was let go, Nodoka Toyohama, imao should have better been the bad bitch, and Kaede , to me, well she did fit well as a sister with a brocon. So if I were to ask as to how good this is, I'd say it was very good, but............, that anime/manga's title was too dodgy , since Mai only sported the bunny suit in two episodes, and the guy , Sakuta , wasn't dreaming about Mai in a bunny suit, in fact he never dreamed of her being in one, since his meeting with her was purely by chance, in fact the title itself was more like something to sell sex, so how do I find this anime???? Here's how:\\n\\n\r\nStory- Decent 4: At one point the anime/manga's title was more like a teaser  the the original creator,  Kamoshida, Hajime concocted in order to sell, lucky for him despite of the dogie title it did sell.  \\n\\n\r\nArt-Mediocre 5: Since there isn't any of that panchira thing and the swimsuit service with Koga was just too lame, but then again that anime has that usual risque school uniform thing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Very Good 8: In most situation the main character was always perceive to be someone who is all mighty and that he doesn't need anybody else , but here we see the main character Sakuta showing his vulnerable  side where he himself needs help from a very mysterious girl Shoko, whom he met way back when he was down with depression, besides it wasn't always that we get to see a main character's vulnerable side where as he/she helps others, he/ she  is also crying for help. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Very  Good 8: It was just something that at one point you'll be annoyed of the syndrome that were happening to the characters, but then again how the guy helps them girls with their predicament was something else, also this was the only anime that has a harem, but it is not a harem since the guy know who he likes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Very good 8: Ok so the title maybe dodgy , but the anime as a whole is ok in my book. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHappy New Year, in advance.",

            "content": "This is another season where the popularity of the most watched show is unwarranted. But then again, that is basically every season. When we take a look about what people have been saying about Bunny Girl Senpai, the results are totally polarized. There are folks who will call this show garbage and give it a rating ranging from 1-4 and another group who will rate it 9-10 and discuss how it provokes meaningful thoughts on the nature of its themes, how great an experience it was during this season of anime.\r\nSpoiler Alert: I belong in the first group!\r\nBunny Girl Senpai was a lot of funwhen first going in. The animation is decent, although CGI crept in at some horrifying intervals and those proved bigger jump scares than anything Goblin Slayer had to throw at me. The theme song was a little catchy, but the ending not so much. It was a bit of a surprise for most and you can see the subversion of expectations as everyone applauds it so much now, and I suspect for the reason that I am alluding to. With such a ridiculous title, everyone was expecting another uninspired light novel adaptation and to receive something that even dares to scratch at mediocrity was manifested tenfold in quality to these people who need only a little bit of nudging in their pleasure spots to have them raving about its merits. \\n\\n\r\nSakuta is the protagonist and he doesn\u2019t really care about many things, except being a good older brother although you don\u2019t really see that side to him too much until later on when it starts becoming more prevalent in the plot. He\u2019s a witty smartass who also happens to help everyone in his harem\u2019s problems. It\u2019s really sweet actually. To counterbalance that witty smartass demeanor, we have Mai who is quite as cynical and matching in verbosity throughout the series. Their dynamic serves as a focal point for the series\u2019 narrative to unravel in multiple directions without straying too far. Many herald their relationship as the best couple of the year and I am not sure what to say to those people except that their relationship is a little strange. We have two characters that are more archetypal high school characters than actual individuals and while they may have quick banter and back and forth, that does not equate with any semblance of profundity in their relationship. Sometimes directors have their characters come across with the appearance of snappy dialogue to obscure the fact that there\u2019s nothing actually special or clever going on underneath the surface. Anything in Bunny Girl Senpai is done extraordinary more impressively in something like OreGairu.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go on and make that passage any more long than it needs to be, I should actually address the premise of the show. By that, I mean the concept of \u201cPuberty Syndrome\u201d. Look, it makes sense to have a ridiculously titled show have a ridiculous made-up pseudoscientific disease to go along with it. Even better, they have the audacity to tie actual scientific concepts such as \u201cSchrodinger\u2019s cat\u201d and use it to explain away literally anything that has to do with \u201cPuberty Syndrome\u201d, especially early on in the show when the viewer has the most questions pertaining to first what it is and second why the hell it should be in the show to begin with as a plot device. Many of the decisions they go with concerning the syndrome are consistently insulting to the viewer. I have seen complicated scientific ideas play out in a fictional sphere and more often than not, they are used quite terribly. However, there have been some phenomenal cases where I have witnessed with my own two humanoid eyes there to have been success. The Zero Escape video games for example, in their entire trilogy, have consistently confronted the most obtuse ideas in their already complicated narrative. Virtue\u2019s Last Reward tackles Schrodinger\u2019s cat and String theory for a bloody example! Here we have puberty syndrome, which we understand is supposed to be a manifestation of the latent complexities and hardships of being an adolescent. I\u2019m young too, not young enough to be in high school anymore, but young enough to remember how terrible that entire ordeal is. But I don\u2019t need people out there to be presented with such a cheap imitation of that process.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, what kind of flawed protagonist did we need to have take us through this series? I understand Sakuta has some brilliant if not over the top sections in the final episodes with Kaede, but these female characters are introduced and dealt away with so quickly that it is impossible to question how they are not one-dimensional plot device in themselves. Sure, there are 13 episodes, but these are light novels so while the responsibility does not lie entirely with the direction of the anime director, the original author has to be called out for having such a lazy format and unfocused structure to their narrative. I am tired of arcs centered around one character for two or three episodes and they are discarded with. It is immature to play with one\u2019s toys and dismiss them once they are tired of them. By the time the final episode had ended, I was left with nothing to ponder about when it came to all these arcs that the author had presented. We are supposed to walk away with a message besides the overtly repeated scientific diatribes of Puberty Syndrome or the difficulties of growing up as a modern teenager.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, the most interesting concept that Bunny Girl interweaves into its plot is the role that social media plays in modern society. Every single character interacts in some manner with the online digital space. Interestingly enough, Sakuta is the single character whose minimal interaction with social platforms allows him to be the harbinger in solving everyone\u2019s problems. I wonder if there is a message there! Mai is an actress whose presence is exemplified throughout the media to a large degree, especially as a press conference in Episode 11 or 12 expands upon. Kaede is a result of the bullying and hostile behavior a teenager can confront in high school, becoming a reclusive and a victim of the vitriol young people can do to one another. Japan is most of all guilty in these charges. Social media has such an influence on people\u2019s lives that it is fascinating to observe how being so connected has made it so lonely. Sakuta\u2019s intelligent female friend whose name I don\u2019t care enough to remember has an online personality very different to the one she expresses personally to Sakuta to the point that another \u201cclone\u201d version of her is created to emphasize on the disparity of their behavior and the self-perception of that individual. Mai becomes invisible to the world even though she is regularly shown on advertisements and television. SOCIAL MEDIA IS A BIG DEAL IN THE MODERN AGE IS A THEME HERE.\\n\\n\r\nBut instead let\u2019s focus on Sakuta\u2019s remarks on whether or not you\u2019re on your period half the time instead of properly pacing the show to confront these thematic ideas of great intricacy. \\n\\n\r\nI prefer to speak about what the show is about and teases than what it actually has to say.\\n\\n\r\nThis review was taken from my original blog post posted here: https://www.fictionalfreak.com/anime/2018/12/26/i-dont-really-take-bunny-girl-senpai-seriously\\n\\n\r\nFictional Freak is a new blog of mine where I talk about anime and gaming, later when I feel more comfortable literature. I want to use it as a platform to talk about art in a more meaningful way than most people do, in the format and depth of something in the vein of what the youtubers MatthewMatosis or Joseph Anderson do regularly but in text form with posts being more frequent depending on the degree of depth. Additionally, I want to use it to improve my writing over time.",

            "content": "This anime was so close to a perfect score. It's such a strong anime, especially given the number of genres it's able to pull off well.\r\nLet's start with why this anime didn't get a perfect score. The story was very segmented. In some cases, that type of style can work, but I think the story ended up a bit too choppy. It was book-ended by an important beginning plot and an important ending plot, but the things in the middle were just side stories, if that makes sense. Kind of how cult classic shows will have a monster-of-the-week styles where every episode is a completelydifferent story without much continuing plot. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, every element of this anime was fun to watch, regardless of the choppiness. The humor is so well done and unique thanks to the main character that's leading the story. Sakuta getting to play off of Mai's humor was great as well since they're very similar characters. They've both made it onto my favorite characters list, in fact. \\n\\n\r\nActually, the characters are the best part of this stellar anime. Talking about Sakuta again, he was written with A LOT of depth and a good history as well as a good potential for development. You get to see everything from his dry humor to his darkest breakdowns. There isn't a moment spared when it comes to Sakuta's development as a main character. Also, as an aside, I enjoyed the fact that Sakuta wasn't your typical protagonist when it came to the mystery-solving element of this anime. He picked up on things quickly so he wasn't the stereotypical clueless character that you see often with these types of anime. \\n\\n\r\nEverything else was great about this anime. The opening was awesome, the art was slightly different (and dare I say, better) from your standard anime, and the enjoyment factor was sky high. \\n\\n\r\n100% would recommend this anime to... anyone. The quality is there, the characters are there, the plot is there, the humor is there, the drama is there, the romance is there. It's all amazingly done. Nothing was sacrificed to make room for anything else, and that's why this anime is so good. Watch it, watch it, watch it.",

Shigashi, I didn't know whether it was a good show.\r\n It could either be: \r\n1. A boring ass, fake show with dumb male main character and slut-like harem. \r\n2. A decent anime. \r\nHowever, it turned out to not be any of the options above. This anime is extraordinary. As I predicted, the female protagonist is a waifu for sure - my best waifu.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is amazing and the male main character is intelligent. \\n\r\nHowever, I must say that some scenes made me pissed off as fuck, but it did it on purpose, so I will let it pass. \\n\\n\r\nIn case you don't know, what made me pissed off was a dumb female character who trapped the MC.",

Seriously, once you get past the gimmick, their isn't much else here. \r\nThe anime has strongly written dialogue but that strength is used poorly, covering up the major holes of lack-luster plot, uninteresting or poorly utilized characters and themes which rely sourly on the interesting concepts.\r\nHonestly, if you want something similar, I recommend something like Hyouka, sure the dialogue isn't well written but the story and characters are much more engaging. Another, to a lesser extent, Kokoro Connect, good premise(s), engaging characters in a somewhatclear and comprehensive plot.",

He tried his hardest to help everyone, now the story of puberty syndrome flying around at first to me was stupid but the anime unravels rather beautifully then you find yourself loving the stories, cos it's definitely not centered on Mai but more on Sakuta.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely not near perfect, but decent of course it could have been better but nothing much to say here\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally the OP theme was meh, the ending theme was better, through out the series the soundtrack was decent. nothing much to say here either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe person that made this anime beautiful to watch is Sakuta, doesn't care what people think about him, isn't afraid to embarrass himself in public, can go to any length helping a friend even if it puts his reputation on the line somewhat like the protagonist in Oregairu.\\n\r\nMai, koga, futaba and kaede all fall in place with their character development it begins to feel like you've know them for a while but you find out so much has been done in just 6 episodes. also thhe chemistry between Mai and Sakuta is hilarious but sincere.

            "content": "--------THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS--------\r\nStory (3/10):\r\nSo far, the story divided into two individual stories. The first one is about Mai Sakurajima, one of the main characters, and the second about Tomoe Koga.\r\nEach one of those girls suffers from an abnormal problem (Puberty syndrome) that Sakuta Azusagawa, another main character (though he should be the only main), help to solve.\r\nepisodes 1-3, The bunny girl:\r\nThe bunny girl, Mai Sakurajima, became invisible because of the \"Puberty syndrome\". Sakuta, as the only person who can see her, trying to help her and on the way found that her problem is similar to the idea of \"Schrodinger's cat\" experiment. The storyitself sounds interesting, but in general, it doesn't make sense.\\n\r\nFor example, how they connected \"Schrodinger's cat\" to the story? As long as you don't open the box, there's 50/50 chance of the cat being alive or dead, so as long as the box is closed, the cat is dead and alive at the same time. Well, how Mai Sakurajima's case connected to this? As long as she doesn't act/model, there's 50/50 chance that it never happened? When you put a cat inside a box, you know about its existence, you just question the result. When Mai Sakurajima became famous many people knew about her existence, including her mother, and that it, there's no expectation for a result, it's not questionable. \\n\r\nSo what's the connection? Why the people have to completely delete her from existence? If they forgot about the existence of her career, then she became a regular, random, person you meet on the street and not a ghost.\\n\r\nAnd how her mother connected to it? Even if everyone forgot about her career, how her mother forgot about someone she gave birth to? Mai needs to sew her umbilical cord back to her mother, to prove it actually happened and she actually exists? What?\\n\\n\r\nThen, after Sakuta, with the help of the school genius Rio Futaba, finds out about the problem and that if fall asleep he will forget Mai (What?), he makes a very \"romantic\" move by trying not to sleep. Mai, that for some reason understood what's all about, mixing his drink with sleeping pills, and Sakuta can't resist the pills and fall asleep. \\n\r\nThen, Sakuta wakes up, he forgot about Mai. Sakuta looks at his hand, see Mai name, and he remembered about Mai... oh, wait, it's from \"Your name\", but it's pretty much what happens there. Anyway, our character ran out and for some reason screamed that he loves her, how it's event connected? \\n\\n\r\nepisodes 4-5, Tomoe Koga:\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, there's a problem that caused by the puberty syndrome, and the series keep throwing scientific theories without a connection to the problem our poor girls suffer from.\\n\\n\r\nTomoe, a 1st-year student, experiencing the same day again and again, as she never satisfied with the result. Sakuta, who get effected from Tomoe's time-jumps, deciding to help her as she reminds him about his incel sister, and somehow with the help of Rio, they determined that Tome's puberty syndrome has something to do with \"Laplace's demon\" - It doesn't -  There's no connecting between \"Laplace's demon\" and her time-travel.\\n\r\nSo Sakuta tells Tomoe a couple of good words, hit a guy, and that's it - happy end.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nIt's a pretty good animation. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song is nice. Other than that, nothing remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nSo far, and I don't see how you can get out of this, the characters lack developing. Yes, it's a pretty short anime, but it's not an excuse. The characters can't make such decisions only after 2 episodes. Where the love came from? I'm supposed to be sad without giving any reason to care for the characters? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nSo far, it's not the worst Anime out there, and the jokes, aren't too bad. \\n\r\nIt's definitely something to watch between Anime's, if you're bored, or just want to expand your watch-list.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nSo far, it's a pretty bad Anime from the story perspective and character developing. The character developing problem appeared mostly because of the lack of episodes, but the story itself is bad from the beginning.\\n\r\nTo be honest, after watching \"Your name\" and \"Owarimonogatari\", it feels like this Anime tried to copy some of their aspects, it didn't go very well in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nObviously, there are more episodes to watch, but there's no hope left in me.",

After this you won't get another chance to see Mai-senpai in her bunny girl outfit (actually there is, but only for a split second but I won't spoil on what moment).\r\nStory:\r\nIf I have to describe this show, I'dsay that \"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\" is a combination of Oregairu, Bakemonogatari and Suzumiya Haruhi (based on these 7 episodes) and actually I can add 1 more title/reference because I already got spoiled from my facebook timeline, but I rather not.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say this show have a resemblance of Oregairu, it's the MC and Heroine, but don't worry, this show doesn't have slowwww pace like Oregairu and of course the MC and Heroine are even better than that from Oregairu. (Oregairu fans please don't be mad at me)\\n\r\nI'd say the MC & Heroine on this show is an upgrade version of Oregairu's.\\n\r\nNuff said.\\n\\n\r\nHow about Bakemonogatari reference? This show also have odd cases (it's called Adolescence Syndrome in this show) and need a proper way to solve them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for Suzumiya Haruhi's reference, remember the \"Endless Eight\"? This show also have it, but only took 1 episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Character:\\n\r\nHow about my experience after these 7 episodes?\\n\r\nUsually, when you see Comedy, Romance, School, Supernatural genre, you'll met a cliche show, a tsundere heroine, dense MC or even a show that have no real story.\\n\\n\r\nBut how about \"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\"?\\n\r\nWell, I still can't believe myself after 7 episodes I still don't have a single complain.\\n\r\nWhy? because this show:\\n\r\n- Have no unnecessary drama\\n\r\n- Have no dense MC & Heroine like any other generic SoL/RomCom\\n\r\n- The pace is well maintained and not rushed\\n\r\n- The character development is noticeable, especially between the MC and Heroine\\n\\n\r\nI dare to say it's the best show for this season\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED, especially the ED, it have a dedicated for its arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's all good, similar to Oregairu season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10/10 for me as for now\\n\\n\r\nYes I gave it 10/10 because I generaly love SoL genre and this show did exceeeeeed my expectation.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show and you won't regret it.",

Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (shortened down to Bunny Girl senpai) is, in my opinion, a contender for anime of the year in 2018. A year where we've had incredible anime such as: A Place Further than the Universe; My Hero Academia Season 3; and Yuru Camp (just to name a few). The sheer essence of this show brings hope to my heart for the future of anime and writing. Thisshow is a gift we don't deserve. Everything about this was impeccable, the OST was atmospheric and really added a great tone to every scene; the visuals were beautiful and a charm to look at; the voice acting was spot on and every character felt like a real person; and the writing was simply incredibly, with some intensely emotional scenes. I loved the creative ideas executed in this show, they really captured the themes and topics they were tackling in a beautiful, yet, moving way. I can only dream that we get another show like this one. I'm also incredibly exited for the upcoming movie which will be showing in Japan in the early summer of 2019. I'd like to conclude this by thanking the writer of Bunny girl senpai (\u300eHajime Kamoshida\u300f\u9d28\u5fd7\u7530\u4e00) and the studio CloverWorks for their hard work and for giving life to this dream of a series which many anime in the future should learn from.",

            "content": "(Pardon my poor english throughout the entirety of this review and I might have excluded some aspects.)\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai or \"A rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai\" as its relative name, had a massive wave of hype back when its release date was announced up till the first episode to only be met by massive disappointment by the masses. \"It did not live up to expectations\" is what I'd initially felt upon watching the first episode, but that was but a stepping stone in efforts to reveal a bigger picture.\r\n(The rest of the reviewcontains spoilers for the entire anime.)\\n\\n\r\nWatching the first episode baffled the majority/ (if not) the entire audience. From the outer shell it does make it seem like some classic run off the mill romance, high school comedy anime, classic anime tropes etc etc. Your \"typical anime waifu\" being portrayed as one of the main characters became all too convenient to be called a clich\u00e9. This was all but a distraction from the main point of the series.\\n\\n\r\n\"the adolescence syndrome\" given as a name to describe the supernatural events that has been recurring to Sakuta Azusagawa and crew. Each girl that Sakuta encounters during his journey attempting to cure each one from the syndrome had their own individual problems regarding the matter and I will go through each one to explain the deeper message that the director was trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\n(Tomoe Koga):\\n\\n\r\nTomoe is your typical anime loli character that the storyboard writers put to cross off from the \"high school romance anime plot\" checklist. But to counteract the negative side of what the character brings to the story, there has to be a balance, thus her problem was brought forward. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, she has feelings towards the main character Sakuta and is unable to suppress that feeling on her own. She attempted so by pretending to be his girlfriend, but that had quite the opposite effect, the same day has been set to loop since she could not confront her own feelings for Sakuta. That is when Sakuta gave Tomoe a chance to confess her true feelings after days of observation, this has undoubtedly, ended the never ending cycle of Tomoe's torment and she was finally able to move on. \\n\\n\r\nThis particular case addresses stowed feelings for another and holding back the regret of not confessing at ideal moments. The message here might appear empty in its value for now, but it will all be explained in the end.\\n\\n\r\n(Rio Futaba): \\n\\n\r\nFutaba has stumbled into quite a troubling predicament whereas a doppelganger has phased into existence out of thin air. Confusing it may be, both of them similarly resemble yin and yang, a lighter and darker side to the same person to maintain balance. The original Futaba portrays her lighter side of herself whilst the doppelganger portray the latter. \\n\\n\r\nThe background of the situation centralizes on her feelings for Kunimi, who already has a girlfriend. Futaba's inability to accept her own feelings for Kunimi has caused an anomaly, her doppelganger displays what she would do in order to attract and seduce Kunimi, even obscene acts she dared not perform: taking seductive pictures and posting on social media. Sakuta knew that to tackle the issue at hand, he has to bring the key component that Futaba has to confront. Sakuta calls over Kunimi to talk with Futaba so that she can come into terms with her own feelings. Surely enough, Kunimi rejects her, which puts Futaba at ease and thus the doppelganger disappears as a result of her efforts. \\n\\n\r\nThe case here is similar to Tomoe's but it brings out what extents adolescents can go to in order to achieve their goal, even acts that the host itself restricts. (I have difficulty explaining but hope you can catch the point)\\n\\n\r\n(Mai Sakurajima & Nodoka Toyohama):\\n\\n\r\nNodoka Toyohama, the younger sister of Mai Sakurajima attempts to follow her footsteps to fame. But how life was never that straightforward in the first place and has placed Nodoka lower than Mai's worth, where Nodoka currently is a growing pop idol whereas in comparison to her older sibling, Mai was a national celebrity. \\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural phenomenon here plays by the idea of \"stepping in another's shoes\" and the issue at hand was the both of them switched bodies. And thus the daily ups and downs of the other's life begins, Mai easily handles Nodoka's pop idol routine whilst Nodoka struggles to keep up Mai's busy schedule and even screwing up in the process. \\n\\n\r\nIt has been said by their parents that Mai was the better sibling of the two and she holds up true to the title she has been bestowed with, coping with both academic studies and her celebrity career, she excels at both fields without issues. But Nadoka was out of her league, she struggles in desperation with both studies and her own pop idol career/schedule in hopes that she will be on par with her older sister. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the situation was still playing around the idea of being in the shoes of another. But all in all jealousy, pressure from comparison and the idea of stepping on the same stage as someone you admire was the key message behind it.\\n\\n\r\n(Kaede Azusagawa):\\n\\n\r\nLast but certainly not least, the sister of the main protagonist herself, Kaede azusagawa. Her case is really simple, social anxiety disorder intertwined with multiple personality disorder. Social anxiety is the difficulty in performing basic social interactions such as interacting with another person.\\n\\n\r\nKaede's social anxiety has been caused by trauma from being bullied throughout her middle school days. This has caused her to purposely lose all her memories, even to an extent that she forgot who she was. She lived out her days living with her brother while their parents moved to other places because their mother could not accept what she became. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the whole anime, each girl that Sakuta encountered, Kaede has trouble making friends at first but it helped that every one of them was friendly towards her, this was the effects of social anxiety in ploy.\\n\\n\r\nAs Kaede attempts to break free from the shackles of social anxiety, she felt determined to break free, one step at a time. But to no avail, it was not as simple as what Kaede has wished for, but it can be done through sheer perseverance and willpower. Her efforts finally bear fruit and she was finally able to make it to her school grounds, but that is when things turn out unexpectedly for Sakuta. She has regained memories of her formal self, her self before she got bullied. However on the other hand, she has no memories of what happened after she lost her memories the first time round until the point where she regained it.\\n\\n\r\nThis was the transition from her other personality(having social anxiety) and her original self. (Frankly this scene was pretty tear jerking)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the adolescence syndrome encompasses problems that children/teenagers face during their adolescent stages of their lives, where each scenario addresses some issues that they deal with during the process. The message was well conveyed and definitely not brought clear in the first few episodes, but I assure you the entire series is worth a watch so that the audience going through the same phase can relate to this well scripted anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended\\n",

The way the characters fall in love is absolutely amazing and just so heart-warming. The main character Sakuta is a wonderful protaganist and I long to be like him. But i just can't get over the fact that Sakuta and Mai-san never end up kissing. How can they be in love and get so close to kissing but then at the end they end up trolling us. I was very upset with then end but lookingback on it I loved the show. Overall I would give this a 9/10.",

            "content": "It seems like most of the reviews for this anime are either \"It's the best thing that happened to humanity\" or \"It's worse than Hitler\". Now - I'm not on either of sides, but I cannot for the life of me understand WHY this anime has such a high score.\r\nWhen I watch anime I want the story to be coherent. Now that doesn't mean the story has to be realistic, it doesn't have to be backed by scientific studies, it doesn't have to make sense in our world (I do like fantasy xd), but I expect the anime to at least know how to handleit's own story and world. And this anime doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not beat around the bush: this anime has glaring similiarities to the Monogatari series. A sarcastic highschooler helping girls with their paranormal problems. And my opinion Seishun Buta Yarou is just a worse version of Monogatari. But how is it worse? Its problem lies in the way it handles it's own story, it' own world.\\n\\n\r\nIn Monogatari the paranormal phenomena our cast of characters experience are tied to yokai, ghosts, gods and japanese mythology in general. Does it make sense in our world and do they try to convince us it makes sense? No, it's mythology. In the anime's world it makes sense. In Bunny Girl Senpai on the other hand the phenomena are tied to quantum mechanics. Not only are the quantum mechanics very real, the anime uses real experiments, laws and theories to explain what's going on. Some of the explanations are illogical (ok the time loop might be the work of Laplace's Demon, but how in the fuck did the characters jump to that very roundabout conclusion), some of the experiments they cite don't make any sense (everyone around me was like \"you have to watch this, they say things about the Schroedinger's Cat\" and I watched it and I was very disappointed to notice how everyone failed to understand what that experiment was trying to convey), etc. It's painfully obvious the creator just read a \"Quantum Mechanics for Dummies\" kind of book and went with it.\\n\\n\r\nNow - that doesn't mean it was a bad show. The animation is pretty, there isn't anything wrong with sound design, I even enjoyed the last story arc (mainly because of the lack of quantum mechanics xd), the characters and interactions between them aren't the worst (though in a lot of places they seem like dumbed down Monogatari)... At the end of the day 7 isn't a bad score. I could criticize it further for following generic anime tropes or whatever, but it's not like I didn't enjoy it, it just REALLY pissed me off in A LOT of places, so I don't want to give it a totally shitty review. But I don't understand how it has a 8.5 average, and I sure as hell don't understand how people can give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nGo watch (or better yet read) Monogatari instead. Xd\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: If an anime uses real concepts to explain it's narrative I expect it to understand what it's saying and doing. This anime doesn't and it pisses me off. Other than that it's cool.\\n\\n\r\nPS. I'm a Nisioisin fanboy. lol",

            "content": "I believe that the story was mediocre (5/10), because Puberty Syndrome is not just super natural. I believe that it is rather dumb and uninteresting. To be honest when I was looking at the wallpapers, the promotional videos and the tags, I was hoping for something else. I had high expectations for the next big thing in and I was thinking 5 - 10 different plots in my head with a colorful anime that plots around a bunny girl showbiz star. After watching the story I was thoroughly disappointed. I got the showbiz star but nowhere near how I was picturing it in my head.\r\nTheArt is good, not fantastic but good enough. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound is the same as the Art pretty much, have seen better but also have seen much worse. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design. Boy oh Boy...One of the most unique anime protagonists paired with his little sister Kaede which I believe was the worst thing in the whole anime by far. She had a character that I disliked a lot, the main protagonist Sakuta was doing everything in his power to help her but nothing was ever enough [the drama was unbearable at times (PS. Which I didn't sign up for) ].\\n\\n\r\nFutaba is like a character with bipolar disorder, her character contradicts herself too many times and she went from the smart and intelligent and shy girl that loves one hell of a guy at school, to a person that doesn't understand her own feelings and sweeps part of her insecurities under the rug. Now that wouldn't so bad if her character wasn't LITERALLY a relationship problem solving specialist. \\n\\n\r\nMai on the other hand... She has some weird character traits that slightly contradict her personality at times but at least she has some unique characteristics that really make her shine for a girlfriend in a romance title. \\n\\n\r\nNodoka. Not bad but not great either. Her character has some nice traits that mix with Mai (as it should) but she didn't have enough influence I believe in the story someone could literally remove her and not have much of a change at all. By the way when she fought with Mai and they swapped bodies, the way the story progressed was from curiosity to find that box with the letters which could have been executed so much better. Instead of Mai blatantly pointing the way for him which is bland and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nShouko is like the God inside Sakuta head, shining bright when he needs help getting through struggles. It's a shame she shit on so bad in the anime and they made her a ghostly figure that appears and disappears and barely changing reality. Who thought of making her \"real life\" counter part a middle schooler that lacks any kind of character and is dead inside.   \\n\\n\r\nSakuta and Kunimi I believe had a pretty much flawless character design for one as a male protagonist and the other as the male support character. (thumbs up for that)\\n\\n\r\nComplete opinion result -> Character = 6/10 Fair.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, peaked at the start but after 5 or 6 episodes it went downhill, episode 11 and 12 was mental suicide for me. So it is a good 7/10 (If it wasn't for the first 5 episodes it would be a 5/10 mediocre).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6. Not worth a rewatch. (For me anything I believe deserves 8 and above has premium rewatch value which means I would rewatch at least once) (PS. There are some very rare exceptions obviously).",

            "content": "I don't think the show does itself any favours by being named as it is, using the cover art that it did. It miss sells itself massively. I didn't pick up this show for months because i was under the impression it was yet another brainless service show, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\r\nWhilst the show's worst trope offences comprise an apparent harem setup and a girl who could only be described as bordering on mentally ill since she talks about herself in third person and has a brother complex, this is executed as an actual genuine mental disorder that gets played outtowards the end of the show. Plus the harem isn't a real harem, he just happens to meet a lot of girls (all be it only too conveniently) who then become regular friends (though there is a second romance involved half way through).\\n\\n\r\nThe show plays out in many respects similar to the award winning anime movie title \"Your Name\", by Mikoto Shinkai. A seemingly supernatural phenomenon explained using scientific concepts like quantum physics causes strange happenstances which provide obstacles for the characters to overcome. The way the protagonist meets a childhood friend of his who academically proficient, particularly in scientific theory, reminds me of Steins;Gate somewhat in how they approach their strange problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe bunny suit itself plays a minor role in the over arching story, making only momentary appearances at the beginning and doesn't drive the story at all except to provide a quirky introduction. The characters are all written to be, as a story should, real believable people and not cookie cutter tropes designed for an easy ride. IE It has actually good writing that provides stimulus with its own merits rather than tried and true tropes that so often get abused these days. To summarise, the characters act and feel like how real people would react, nothing is too convenient.\\n\\n\r\nI could analyse it further. but i think the most important points have been made. The story is an actual decent piece of writing with believable, relatable characters that go through real life emotions, if not in fantastical scenarios. The art is nothing short of great both in animation and background, the sound is acceptable and the overall enjoyment really just comes from the story telling.",

            "content": "At a glance, Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai may have you assume it is some sort of fan-service comedy title with its promotional art depicting series female lead Mai Sakuragawa in a bunny-girl outfit. However, the series falls more in line with titles like Bakemonogatari and My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU that offer snarky lead characters and exploring supernatural issues effecting its major characters. In the case of Bunny Girl Senpai, the series explores male lead Sakuta helping out several girls afflicted with paranormal problems related to everyday stresses experienced by teenagers, otherwise known as Adolescence Syndrome within the world of theseries.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, Bunny Girl Senpai is divided up into several story arcs that explore Sakuta helping out one of several teenage girls dealing with some sort of personal crisis that leads to a case of Adolescence Syndrome affecting them. Each arc devotes enough time to explore each character's individual personal problems and Sakuta doing what he can to figure out the source of them. This does make the series fall into a sort of storytelling formula as Sakuta will seek consulting from classmate Rio about the cause of a specific crisis and his classmates often wind up getting involved in the situation to some degree. But there is still enough fleshing out of each character's particular situation to make their dilemma relatable to audiences as Sakuta aids each girl in overcoming their personal crisis. The final arc of the series involving Sakuta's sister, Kaede, made for perhaps the more emotionally powerful arc of the series with the vulnerability that Sakuta shows in caring for and expressing concern for his sister's personal issues.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of its main storytelling element, perhaps the more entertaining element to Bunny Girl Senpai is the chemistry between Sakuta and Mai. Some may draw parallels of their relationship being similar to Bakemonogatari's Araragi and Senjougohara, as both feature girls the male lead helped overcome a personal crisis, eventually start a relationship together, and the female lead snarking at her love interest at points throughout their shows. While I can see where these parallels would come into play with Sakuta also showing signs of having somewhat of a perverted streak he shows with his quotes in his attraction toward Mai, Sakuta has more of a snarky personality than Araragi and gets joy out of the snarky teasing that he and Mai give one another. In spite of this, both are shown to gradually develop a genuine relationship with one another and show varying degrees of concern for the problems both face throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I really have with Bunny Girl Senpai is that there is a story element revealed later in the series concerning the addition of another character that doesn't get proper focus within the series. While related to the problems that Sakuta has while caring for Kaede, the character in question doesn't get properly explored and it looks like there will be a movie sequel released later in the year that will explore Sakuta's connection with her.\\n\\n\r\nSetting this minor gripe aside, Bunny Girl Senpai still offered a great amount of psychological drama delving into the various supernatural afflictions effecting the girls that Sakuta interacts with. For anyone craving anime dramas like it, I'd strongly recommend checking it out at least once.\\n",

            "content": "This show got really popular in the last fall season, it is appealing for a certain part of the comunity that really do like these type of series in which we can fantasize as to what is the root of the arcs presented in the story and it gives us the name of the cause of every problem that will be presented through each arc and it is: Puberty Syndrome. \r\nPS(puberty syndrome) is a distortion of reality in which the individual person sees himself in a situation that goes beyond what can really happen in real life, thus making it fantasy since the playground ofthe development of the syndrome is the head and mind of the characters and they create the problems unintentionally and go through them searching for a way to defy their limitations and make the way out of all the inconveniences possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself centers around a high school guy called Sakuta and his experiences with different kinds of representations of the puberty syndrome through his friends or acquaintances because every time a character has a realization of the syndrome Sakuta is right there for any number reasons going from helping them go through it or trying to find the solution to the problem. Mai sakurajima is a girl that can't be seen by people and seeing that begins using a Bunny girl outfit in order to know if someone can see her, Sakuta is able to see her and that way begins their relationship because being him the only person that can see her makes Mai see him as her only reliable and confident person. The relationship between Mai and Sakuta is well developed in the first arc of the story reaching it's climax in the finale of the arc, after that they behave more like a couple even if they aren't able to be always together because of responsabilities(work mainly) but they still are capable of having valuable time together. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters isn't lackluster either since they have their own problems and realizations of the syndrome. Kaede is Sakuta's sister and a panda loving girl that cares for her brother and had a turnaround because of some events that happened in her school, Futaba is a girl that goes to the same school as sakuta and always gives him explanations supossedly based in analyticis with nonexistent proof, Nodoka is the younger sister of Mai and see her as an example eventhough she despise her because she always saw her as better than erself, Koga is a girl that wants to change the outcome of a certain event that happens in her school and Makinohara Shouko is the first person sakuta had romantic feelings for and seems to always appear in his moments of utmost needs. \\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is passable, it isn't good but it functions for the kind of show that this is. The opening is a good song and the ending along with the ending sequence can be entertaining for a couple of times but it isn't anything worth of praise.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had some flaws that kept it from perfection but those didn't really affected the final product all that much, some of these flaws are the lackluster reasons behind the puberty syndrome realizations, the lack of interaction between supporting characters and the nonsensical analytical explanations that Futaba gives everytime Puberty syndrome is mentioned, at the end this anime was a pretty good show with it's own message and did it really well. \\n\\n\r\nRascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai is an excellent adaptation of a succesfull light novel series that gained a lot of popularity on it's own and made a part of the anime comunity questions what is it's appealing and i will give one reason and one reason only: Bunny girl senpai.",

This anime is presented in a very UNIQUE way that is much different from the other school romance animes. The most amazing part of this anime is the supernatural world that they are living in and how the surrounding problems are solved through love, perseverance, optimistic, patience, courage and so on. \r\nFor people who just started watching this anime, I have to agree with you guys that it might be a bit baffling to understand what\u2019s going on. However,it\u2019s okay, you will definitely understand the whole story until the end if you went through it fastidiously without skippings. Many people might think that why this anime is named in such uncanny way \u201cRascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai\u201d???? I believe it\u2019s most probably just a clickbait because there is nothing really to do with it. However, don\u2019t ever get twisted by this fact, the story will still set you dumbfounded. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a marvelous masterpiece that should be watched by everyone. This anime shows the future of the new anime development like srsly dudes. You all must watch it or else you all gonna be regret AF for missing such brilliant masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, It is for the people who have finished watching this anime. I\u2019m looking forward to s2 and I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s gonna be a s2 or maybe an OVA about Shoko\u2019s case which still remains a mystery. I CAN\u201dT WAIT ACTUALLY, ANY IDEA WHEN IS IT COMING OUT??",

Im not going to lie now at first I was skeptical about watching this, I thought it was going to like some harem or ecchi anime about a girl in a bunny costume, btw she only wore it for like one episode weird, but that aside that thisshow makes it possible to create boring little concept really intriguing. ohh and I also liked the mc a a lot\\n\\n\r\nBtw i rate sound and art a 10/10 always because that really does not matter to considering all the work the creator and the studio had to put into this and you know they all have their own styles so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOhh and I don't put story details ,and shit like that i just put my honest review ,and try not to include spoilers so people can read a quick review and go check it out if they like.And don't really care about grammar shit in my reviews so yeah.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't planning on watching this, well, ever. But then after it finished airing I saw a lot of buzz about it so I started in on a whim and then spent a day watching it instead of studying. Totally worth it.\r\nStory 10/10: I guess its overall plot is just the main character helping different people suffering from this fictional Puberty Syndrome. The entire concept of this can be off-putting but honestly, there was enough explanation and pseudo-science for it to sound logical within the context of the anime, so I had no problem with the premise. This Syndrome manifests itself very differently in thecase of different people, due to which the anime is able to masterfully tackle some very mature themes, that you wouldn't expect to see in such an anime. It's generally a pretty smart show, and it has its fair share of plot twists, so I cannot complain about the story element.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art was one of the reasons I actually decided to watch this, I was drawn to the character designs from still images alone, and then seeing it all in motion just made it better. It always looks very smooth and shiny, and the backgrounds are breathtaking at times, so it's definitely a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I would dock off half a point at least because I absolutely hate the opening theme, but I cannot give this section less than 10 due to how much I adore the ending theme, and the incredible voice acting that made me wonder how such talented people exist. As for the ost, I didn't really pay attention to it, but it never stood out as being bad, so it's probably great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: This is definitely a character-driven show, as there is less emphasis on the plot itself, as opposed to the characters' thoughts and feelings and reactions. Basically the entire point of this show is the characters. And it somehow manages to introduce quite a few characters, while also giving each of them a different personality and story and enough screen-time for the audience to grow to love them. But my most favorite thing about the characters in this show is just how human they feel. None of them are annoying, none of them are terribly childish or oblivious to the world around them; because there is such an emphasis on the characters' emotions, it makes them feel very mature and relatable. The relationships between the characters were also incredibly well-done, the protagonist behaved differently with different people, which is why I never got the feeling of a harem from it. And the romance. Oh god the romance. I have no words to describe it. I'll just settle for saying that it might take over Toradora! as my favorite romcom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I was drawn in within the first few minutes, and I just couldn't stop watching until I finished. There wasn't a single moment when it felt boring or slow, even though there is a lot of dialogue, and I also somehow grew attached to all of the characters, even though I tend to struggle when new characters are introduced at a fast rate. I'm really glad I didn't watch it as it was airing though, because it's probably better to binge-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Now, this is definitely not for everyone, as, like I said, it is very slow and character focused, but everyone who likes such shows should watch it, especially if you like well-developed, mature characters. Now I just have to wait for the second season, while praying that, if it ever happens, it'll be at least half as good as this.",

            "content": "I heard some pretty good things about this anime before watching, so i figured that I'd watch it sometime. Once I finally did, I was left a bit... meh. Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai (Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai) is an overall good show, but not without some things that made it meh.\r\nStory: 8\r\nProbably like many others, this seemed to be another harem kind of show. Luckily, it isn't. Instead, it is an anime that tackles the struggles of adolescence. The idea of having a \"puberty syndrome\" to display the problems is nice. It is relatableto growing adolescence and adults who were adolescents themselves. The only part that was displeasing is the ending. The show ends with a resolution from a great problem, a very weird problem that occurs and will occur in this one episode, and a drawn out resolution to said weird problem. It made the series end pretty meh. It really wasn't a great ending personally. The Story Grade gets an 8 for the rest of the anime. Ending knocks it down 2 pegs as well as a problem that is in the Character Grade.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIt's pretty. It's nice. Nothing really pops out though. It isn't very big or flashy, which is fine. It's a 7 because it is good, it isn't terrible, but it doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSound is just like the Art Grade. It is good, it isn't terrible, but it doesn't really stand out. Personally, the OP is not that big of a banger. It's meh. It doesn't really make me feel more in any kind of way. It's just there. It doesn't ruin the experience, though. On the bright side, voice acting is pretty good though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8:\\n\r\nEach character has something special to them. Aside from the \"puberty syndrome,\" this show isn't a flat piece of garbage. Each character had a good bit of dialogue here and there. There is still a lingering problem though: the supporting cast gets some development, and then nothing. Plus, three characters (that I won't give names to) don't really change at all. It's problems like this that leaves a bit of a meh taste. I wish that they were still part of the big story. But because they are side characters, it doesn't show it. This problem occurs in many other anime. But still, the arcs each character gets is great, but what happens to them afterwards just feels disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThe show is a fun time. With an okay OP to get you excited, each arc is always interesting with its new puberty syndrome kind of problem. There isn't a major problem that occurred while watching the show. It is just what happens after. The silly witty dialogue is great and will give some a bit of a chuckle. It's pleasant and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\"Bunny Girl Senpai\" is an overall good show. With its great character arcs and interesting topic of adolescent problems expressed through its \"puberty syndrome,\" this show is solid. I recommend you watch it for yourself for an overall fun time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

Did the anime make you happy? It did make me happy. I thought that everything about this show was wonderful, except that it ended after only 13 episodes. If indeed there are other shows out there that were stolen from to make Bunny Girl Senpai, well that is awesome to hear. It will be other chances to be happy once more. If you love romance, if you love... love... be it romantic or family, then Seishun ButaYarou we Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is totally worth your time. What in this world is original? Not much... all that matters to me is that at the end of it, I am happy. Stop tearing down this show for what it lacks and cheer it for what it has... this show has a lot.",

            "content": "This anime is getting a lot of love, and for good reason. It's kind of a twilight zone for teen drama. In this anime, a rather socially apathetic protagonist (Sakuta) helps five girls deal with some difficult buried emotions that thanks to a phenomenon called puberty syndrome, manifest themselves in extreme supernatural ways.  For example, a girl is being bullied online, and all the sudden cuts just start magically appearing on her body. \r\nLet's get the problems with the anime out of the way. The attempt to explain why these incidents are happening is so horrid, it would have been way better not toeven trying explaining it. The fact that only girls seem to need the protagonist's help is rather groan worthy only saved by the fact that only two of them have any romantic interest in the Sakuta, and Sakuta himself is insanely loyal to his hard earned girlfriend. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to appreciate this show, I think it's important to understand this statement. This show is not really about Sakuta, it's about the five girls. Any and all plot in this anime is centered around a girl, not Sakuta. Sakuta ceratainly helps every girl get through the issues they are dealing with, but ultimately, the girls all have to deal with their issues. (except maybe Mai) These girls save themselves. Each journey is a worthwhile one. \\n\\n\r\nThe advantage of the puberty syndrome gimmick is it's extreme nature makes characterization a breeze. Each girl gets basically three episodes, yet in such a short time, you get a satisfying full story arc, and the character feels fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nA fun aspect is Sakuta's aloof personality bouncing off everyone he encounters. In particular, every conversation with Mai is pure gold. Those two together is always a joy to watch. In fact all the character chemistry is really good throughout the show.  Everything feels natural despite the crazy things going on around them. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end I have to admit I really enjoyed this anime. If you go into knowing you're not really get one big story for Sakuta, but five completely contained tales about the girls themselves, I think you'll enjoy it a lot more. Its not perfect, but a strong recommendation from me.",

            "content": "This is not a very controversial opinion, but I think that this show has been fantastic so far.\r\nNot because it's something that I have never seen before or because it made me cry. Simply because it created a beautiful and warm story that I enjoy thoroughly.\r\nFrom what I've noticed from other people's reviews the biggest complaint is that the writing is the same as they have seen in countless other live novels. Of course I can't say for sure, but that might be a problem with the perspective they have on it. I think it's one of Rascals biggest strengths that it takes tropes thatwe are familiar with and kind of looks at it differently.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw an Idol in the opening I couldn't help but sigh. No matter how great the other characters are, I was sure that she was going to annoy me. What this show then did was to make her a very human character, with some annoying personality traits but also some good ones and I couldn't really dislike her. Which might just be me, but I tend to dislike characters that are a bit too much to handle. Must sound strange since I'm an anime fan, but a bit too much really has to be a lot. Like a character that keeps switching between being an asshole and an adorable girl every two seconds without any consequences (no offense Hanebado, but full offense). The concept of taking tropes and changing them up is a fairly simple one, but I still respect them a lot because they're not always easy to actually do. It has a simple premise and writes its story accordingly, but in a charming and well set up way.\\n\\n\r\nOf course a show like that can only work when the characters work as well, which I explained worked very well for me. I am aware that opinions are split on this, with people hating and liking some characters or hating the entire cast. Personally I really like every character that has been presented so far. I mean this show made me like the perverted protagonist type and that's pretty amazing, cause god I've had it with these harem protagonists. But this one is calm, honest, but also a nice guy when it counts and, a thing that I probably like about every character in this show, he's honest with himself. He knows his personality isn't great, but also doesn't shove that in everyones face. Because there's a difference between being a bad person and quietly accepting that and walking around telling everyone what your opinion about them is. Which is most likely not a good one. Now to the bigger part of the cast, the girls. I love girls. I love boys. Would have loved more boys. But the girls in this are fantastic. Adorable, strong, weak, mysterious and charming. No I'm honestly impressed look at these girls with personalities this is a treat. Honestly I feel like I'd start spoiling things when I talk about them more so let's leave it at that, but they managed to make me absolutely fall in love with the big brother obsessed little sister character. A miracle.\\n\\n\r\nI think that's all I wanted to say. Except please watch this show, it's good for your heart and soul. Especially if you're in a similar situation as the character, though I don't think you have to be to relate to them. Watching someone just not care about the opinions other students throw at him is nice, watching someone else care way too much is nice, watching someone like the way they change instead of their real self is nice, this show is just nice! It's pleasant and fun, so please give it a go.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead, beware\r\nTypically, an anime under the genres of romance and school tends to come and go. Admittedly, I've watched an extreme amount of romance anime, way more than any other genre that I've watched. However, the thing about school romance anime is that most of them just don't stand out. I'd say about 80% of the school romance anime that I've watched were nice while was watching, but then I completely forget about them after two weeks once they finish. That's exactly what I expected from Bunny Girl coming into it. Actually, to be honest, I thought I'd thoroughly dislike Bunny Girl, because itsounds like an anime that follows typical romantic anime tropes, and frankly I was getting sick of them.\\n\\n\r\nI was wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThrough out watching Bunny Girl, I was greeted with a perspective of widely different situations that might have happened during high school years. I witnessed the true love that grew on Sakuta as he eventually fell in love with Mai. i witnessed Mai's constant struggle of figuring out who she was and what she wanted to do, albeit briefly. I witnessed Futaba's struggle in realizing that she loves one of her best friends, and the acceptance she has when she realizes that they would stay best friends, and there was nothing wrong with that. I witnessed Toga's realization that she would never date the boy she likes because he was already in love with someone else, and the way she just put it aside for the sake of the boy instead of hanging on for the sake of her. I witnessed the struggle of Mai's little sister, as she realizes that she is constantly under the shadow of Mai, who was better in every way. However, she still loves Mai because Mai was her sister.  I witnessed the growth of Kaede, who only decided to grow only for the sake of her brother, who was the only one who seemed to understand. Then, Sakuta's devastation as he sees with his own eyes that Kaede's growth and struggle was all in vain. \\n\\n\r\nBunny Girl showed to me that romance school anime could still be good, and that they could still blow my expectations away. It was a beauty that I had witnessed with my own two eyes, and I am proud of that.",

K-King's Game?\\n\\n\r\nPhew. There's Rio Futaba, whose first name reminds me of the Rio scale, which made me think there are aliens behind all of the phenomena, to explain everything for the average layman who knows nothing about science. She explains using Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, which made me remember and from there, EVERYTHING makes sense... because she'll explain everything else as more cases of puberty syndrome arise.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist, Sakuta-tan, goes against the whole world to protect his loved one, Sakurajima-san, who doesn't really ever wear that bunny outfit, much to my and ALL others' disappointments (right? yeah, I'm only hearing what I want to hear). She's a celebrity that does photoshoots, so having lots of clothes and not wearing them after one use is to be expected. Wait, people do that in general?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance anime that's more fictional and not so much slice-of-life, but not as supernatural as Musaigen no Phantom World and ridicules you for not having a boyfriend or girlfriend, this is the anime for you! \"I'm a virgin!\" I don't know why he smelled his hand...

I found the story great. While I'm almost no longer going to be a teenager soon, it depicts reality distorted interpretations of quantum physics just \"great.\" The pressure that comes with fame. The expectations for siblings to be great like their older siblings. How the Internet is used as a tool to harm and destroy. How people are affected by close ones not being who they once (or twice) were. Families separated. I could list a few more listed by periods. See for yourself. Great for procrastinating.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nArt is in the eye of the beholder. After learning how to develop a website from scratch, I now can look at a website and judge it differently.

Well, they're puppets.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 9+8+9+10=36, won't divide the sum by the number of addends. 36.\\n\r\n\u2746\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2744(DIY)\u2744\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2746\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas.

The way each character interacts with the MC felt so refreshing and real, in a way it deviates from the typical character tropes in anime. And not to mention the banter, it felt so realistic, something real friends would argue about. \\n\\n\r\nOn top that, each character is dynamic and was well fleshed out. Props to the producer for managing each character correctly despite the 13 episode limit. Each character had enough screen time to properly engage with the audience and make them relate to the situation. Perhaps what I liked about the anime was that, even though the base premise of it revolved around the absurdity of the situations, at the core of those situations were all problems every adolescent can relate to. It explores these problems by exaggerating them, using hyperboles to better explain how the character feels towards each problem. It reaches out to the audience and gives them something to relate to. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music of the anime was the icing on the cake. The upbeat tunes and sunny melodies give life to the show, while the soft piano and slow pangs make each problem all the more heart wrenching and each resolution all the more satisfying. It gives you a nice down-to-earth feeling of youth and overall makes each scene more vibrant and more immersive.\\n\\n\r\nIts that type of anime that gives you a warm fuzzy feeling after you watch it, and well, I for one can't wait to go back to school and live out the rest of my youth.\\n",

            "content": "Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai,  what can I say? The name alone for some reason seems really off putting as I try to recommend this soon to be anime classic to my peers.  I believe there is some kind of stigma going around where \"sexy\" workings in anime that aren't blatant fan service set off some kind of virtue alarm.   Well turn off the white knight fears of association and buckle up,  for this is an unexpectedly amazing anime.Bunny Girl, is a fantastic story.  It focuses around a seemingly typical protagonist until he gets introduced to a series of amazing characters. Yet the basic tropes of Anime are bypassed as its not so much the individual,  but their situation that matters.  I really like how this show presents the seemingly everyday then with excellent care and poise wraps it in some bizarre circumstance.   Many shows have attempted this same effect,  but very few get good marks, and almost none get it as perfect as bunny girl.  It made me laugh, it made me cry,  its a fantastic experience.\\n\\n\r\n               While not the most amazing show visually to be released in fall 2018, it did put up a good fight.  Its a bit isolationist with  the scenarios having about 8 locations  revisited a little too often,  but the diversity of the story and lighting choices,  hide the repetitiveness well.  A job very well done,  but I do feel some expense was spared.\\n\\n\r\n              \"KIMI NO SEI KIMI NO SEI\", haha.   From the opening theme song to the ending credits, your ears will be just as happy as your eyes.   This team put on a lot of consideration into their final effects,  and I have no complaints about their song and sound effect choices.  The voice acting was was very well done.  I not once tried to figure out who was whom as they were the character more so than the voice of.  It's truly wonderful to me when I get that sold on a performance. \\n\\n\r\n        This particular program makes it very hard to discuss characters without tapping into the realm of spoilers.  So I will just say I adored them all.   From the main character to the supporting roles around him and the random passerby in the world he lives in,  they really sell the this universe as being a complete product.    Very well written, so much it's difficult to even pick favorites out of the lot.\\n\\n\\n\r\n             At the end of the day I enjoyed waiting each week for bunny girl senpai,  never knowing if I was going to laugh or cry.   Grizzziff Kingsbeard gives this lovely program a slightly gratuitous 10/10.   I definitely recommend the experience.",

            "content": "Review No : 1\r\nTL;DR : a mediocre story that stem from a good problem/topic with good characters and a sprinkle of supernatural phenomenon that spice up and help with the pacing of the anime.\r\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai or rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai might put you off after looking at its cover art and synopsis. At the start of the season there are two kind of people, some like me, who upon first reading about it in the seasonal anime chart chooses to avoid it because of its fan service nature and others thattry to watch it expecting a very mediocre fan service anime. At the end of the season though only one type of people remain, those that realize that it is not a good fan service anime, in fact it is nowhere close of what one would consider a fan service anime. So if you who are reading this is trying to find an anime to watch, consider trying this anime because it is different than what you first will expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUpon finishing this anime I have come to realize that this anime might have one of the strongest opening episodes or the strongest opening arc. Usually most anime and some great anime have quite a weak opening episodes. But rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai have such a great opening episodes and pace it self very well at the start. This strong opening and pace is very rare in anime and it is one the plus of this anime, a great strong opening arc. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a great opening arc though, some of the subsequent arcs have the same problem, the main problem of this anime, and it is the pacing, despite the good pace in the beginning, the pace seem to crumble because the anime try to adapt and fit in too many arcs or too many light novel books into 13 episodes. Most of the negatives in this anime stem from the decision to cramp in too many arcs into 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow after the main culprit has been revealed lets talk about the other aspect of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime tackles on problem that adolescences usually faces, such as the inability to read the mood, unrequited love, different sides of one self, and many other one. At first, it might seem there is nothing special about it, and certainly some other anime have also done it, but nonetheless this types of topics work perfectly with the characters and the other aspect of this anime. The story can certainly makes you reflect upon yourselves or make you remember about your past.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories also incorporated supernatural aspect known as the adolescences syndrome, the supernatural syndrome stem from the adolescences  problems that the many characters faces and manifest itself physically. The syndrome at first might seem something to just spice up the problem but I believe that it is necessary because it heighten the stakes of the syndrome and fasten the pace of the story, without it there would probably only two or three arcs and the many arcs would not fit because the pacing would be really slow and would not fit into 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also some quantum physic terms thrown around in the explanation of the syndrome that might seem to be completely bullshit, even though it is largely bullshit, it actually helps in understanding and visualizing the syndrome for our characters and the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the problem of the story, problems arises within the story because of the many arcs in 13 episodes. Some arcs receive three episodes while other receive two episodes, for me  a three episodes arcs is a very fast paced arcs, considering the nature of the problem the characters faces which involve emotion, a very fast paced arcs would not work well with problems that involves emotions, the slow burn effect that are needed would not be present. That is why on some of the two and three episodes arcs I wasn't able to stay interested.  And despite how beautiful and deep it could have been, one arc in particular feels shallow. This of course could have been avoided if they had decided just to adapt three fourth of what this anime adapted, or even better make a 23 episodes adaption of all the arcs that they had adapted.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story is a decent story, and the supernatural physical manifestation is necessary  to helps heighten the stake and fasten the story, but with all the pacing help that the supernatural provided it is still not enough because there is just too many story in a short amount  of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in bunny girl senpai overall is a well written characters. The two main protagonist have an interesting interaction with each other that keep the viewer stay invested and engaged. Their witty dialog, banter and actions keep the viewer interest in them. This reason alone for me make this anime worth the watch. The characters  are also not shallow, they can be understanding when tackling a problem. Become compassionate and shows empathy for others. Have certain level of thrust and jealousy. Are not so pure and can be honestly blunt. Overall they are not a one dimensional characters.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the side characters, keeping mind the length of this anime the side characters  have a good balance between all of them in terms of their screen time. The sides characters it self are not shallow and you can definitely see some character development within them selves, whether it is moving on, finding new friends, becoming true to your self, being more mature and many other thing, the characters certainly changed and develop over the course of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the actual usage of the characters, what good is a great characters if it is not properly use, and this improper use of characters usually what differentiate a good anime and a great anime. I always dislike one aspect that happen to most anime, pushing a side a well develop character after their main purpose is done. \\n\\n\r\nKeeping mind this is a 13 episodes anime, and the many characters that it introduces. The use of the characters is decent because most characters are still there and does not disappear. \\n\\n\r\nA very particular use of character that I see and very much like in this anime is that every action always have some connections and meaning, whether it is to introduce characters, for comedic or for romantic purpose there is always a fresh way to use the characters. This is something commendable about the anime and i would say it is the pluses of the anime. Such example are butt kicking that might seem irrelevant and will completely be forgotten but actually become a comedic tools of some sort.  \\n\\n\r\nThat being said I still believe that it would have been a better usage of characters if there is not so many of them, the problem that stem from the decision of cramming too many arcs into a 13 episode anime, hamper the slow and steady development of a character in a show that involves emotions like this and also makes the viewer not able to stay invested on one character because another character is introduced to close to each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the technical sides of the anime, the background sounds, the opening song, the ending song, and the art or the animation, it is decent and serviceable. Though the Japanese voice actor fits perfectly well with the characters. The voice of the characters helps build in the mood in the scenes. It also able to perfectly conveys the characters during romantic, comedic, sad, happy, or serious moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is very enjoyable especially during scenes between the two main protagonist, I wish the focus was more towards them because their interactions are some of the most enjoyable i have seen between two mains characters. I have always been a fan of spice and wolf because of the enjoyable interactions between the two main characters. The regret of having finished watching spice and wolf is of course the realization that no two main characters in other anime will have this much enjoyable interaction between the two of them. I have search long and hard to find an anime that have as enjoyable interactions as the main characters in spice and wolf and to be honest, I could not find one, rare case like the monogatari series do have an enjoyable interaction between the main protagonist, but because of the screen time issue, i would not put the interaction of the two main monogatari protagonist on the similar level of those in spice and wolf. \\n\\n\r\nOf course the long search is finally done because with the airing of bunny girl senpai, I am happy to say that another anime have finally reach the level of enjoyable interaction between the two main protagonist, something which spice and wolf have already achieved. I also believe that the standard of interaction, interesting and not shallow interaction, between the two main protagonist that bunny girl senpai and spice and wolf have shown us should be the standard in all anime, and I wish that every new anime can and will achieve this level of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall and enjoyment wise I have to rate this anime and 8/10, the enjoyment I feel when watching the two main characters of course plays a big factor in this rating. Also the adolescence problems are something that I can relate to. And seeing what bullshit explanation of quantum mechanics they will says for a particular syndrome are very interesting and funny. This anime is an example of the sums is greater than its parts, because if you were to take a parts this anime, and separate its many aspect it would certainly seem underwhelming on its own, together though its many aspect creates a very enjoyable anime and I certainly can not wait for the movie.",

            "content": "And so the review wars begin. Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is one of the few anime I've finished in recent years, and it's for a good reason that I feel many MAL users and reviewers have missed. \r\nSpoilers. Duh.\r\nOn the surface, this show is a sort of mix of OreGairu and the Monogatari series, borrowing a number of aspects from both. Some seem to make these similarities out as a problem, which I find utterly ridiculous. All art is derivative, and Bunny Girl is nowhere near similar enough to another series to be considered a rip-off. \r\nBunny Girlis a layered, and surprisingly nuanced experience, which is NOT to be taken at face value. Many of the complaints I've seen about the show claim that it doesn't make any sense, or that its \"supernatural\" elements aren't realistic enough. I think the most important thing to understand about Bunny Girl is that it doesn't take place in the real world, and it's not trying to be a complicated, believable work of science fiction. The supernatural elements don't need to make sense, as they aren't meant to. The majority of the show's plot elements are symbolic and combine to create a much more cohesive thematic work. I'd like to begin by speaking about the so-called supernatural plot, and the way Futaba is used in its context.\\n\\n\r\nThe afflictions that various characters suffer from are not real. They are rather visualizations of the characters' mental states and difficulties and are visible to the other characters because they are involved in their plights. No, Mai is not actually a goddamn invisible superhero. It's because of her exit from the modeling limelight, which has caused a sort of dissociation and resulted in her FEELING invisible to those around her. The show exaggerates this for dramatic effect because there isn't much of a story without it, but regardless, the idea is sound, and this extends to the other characters. There are some exceptions, of course, as it can be assumed that Kaede actually does suffer from a dissociative disorder of sorts, which isn't unexpected given her circumstances. The cuts all over her body, however, can absolutely be called symbolic, metaphorical, or whatever other pretentious label you want. The point is, the show's got depth. Not absolutely everything needs to be taken entirely at face value, as I've seen so many do on the reviews for this show. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to Futaba, as I've seen many criticize her various musings about the potential causes of characters' afflictions. Just about everything she says is complete, unfettered bullshit, and it's 100% intentional. The suffering of the characters can't just be boiled down to random philosophical concepts. Hell, sometimes the things Futaba says are so absurd and unrelated she could be considered comic relief. The audience is not supposed to take her explanations as gospel. The intent is for the audience to see through her pseudo-scientific crap and understand the teenagers' problems for what they really are: real, modern, and human struggles that can't be pinned down by a 19th century thought experiment. \\n\\n\r\nI think the protagonist, Sakuta, is also worth mentioning, as though he is something of a trope, I believe he is executed pretty well. He is quite similar to characters like Hikigaya Hachiman or Araragi, but I don't really think there's much of a problem with it. He fits perfectly well into the story, and his unending self-sacrificial tendencies are expressed physically in a giant fucking wound on his chest, that bleeds when he can't help others. Additionally, he isn't just the white knight that many make him out to be, as he undergrows a great deal of growth and maturation throughout the show. I'll admit I was genuinely surprised that instead of trying to restore Kaede to her braindead self, he accepted that she needed to be her own person and left it alone. Additionally, the character of Makinohara is essentially the physical manifestation of Sakuta's maturity, changing in age and providing him goals and insight into himself and the world around him. She's there when he needs to grow, and disappears once he fully comes into his own. I suppose you could call her a Deus Ex Machina, but I think her sole existence as a metaphor justifies her inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you that have trashed on the show, dropped it, or whatever else, I highly encourage you to give it another try keeping in mind some of the things I've said here. It's exceedingly rare that an anime with this amount of heart and nuance comes out, particularly in the Rom Com genre, and I really do believe it deserves a fair chance. And for those of you who haven't seen it, give it a watch. It's not perfect, but it has quickly become a personal favorite, and not only did I thoroughly enjoy it, but I genuinely took things away from it, and that's the absolute best effect a work of art can have.",

It approaches with delicacy and ingenuity the problems teens face, which it metaphorises by exposing them as a supernatural phenomena. This approach gives a less rough and oppressive side to the problems encountered, without necessarily denaturing or softening them.\r\nArt : 8/10\r\nNothing very transcendent but it is very pleasant to watch. The chara-design is quite common but remains endearing, as are the sets and animation in general.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nLike the art direction, the soundtrack does not mark but does its job perfectly and is rather pretty, although discreet. I like the opening though!\r\nCharacters : 10/10\r\nTheother highlight of the series: the characters are extremely endearing.\\n\r\nOf course, Sakuta and Mai shine for their atypical personality.\\n\r\nOne would think that Mai is the typical tsundere as one sees everywhere in the animes, but that nay! If she has a strong tsundere character, she adapts it in her own way and it makes her a very endearing and relaxing character.\\n\r\nSakuta, the MC, is brilliant in his attitude. He is detached and calm (without being cringe, edgy or boring) and above all, his remarks are delicious. He shows a certain humor that I have not found in any other anime, or even series or film elsewhere.\\n\r\nThe other characters are not left out, and they all have a little something that makes them endearing. The anime managed to very well build them in just 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall appreciation : 9/10\\n\r\nI waited eagerly for each new episode, and it was worth it!\\n\r\nThe themes I touched touched me, just like the characters and their story\\n\r\nMy only regret may have been the last episode, which I find a bit too condensed. The anime would have won to have 14 episodes, even a little more in order to develop even more characters and their stories. Well, it may be just gluttony to want more: p\\n\\n\\n\r\nTotal : 9/10\\n\r\nA fresh anime and pleasant to watch\\n\r\nNot necessarily to everyone's taste, and not to look at the very first degree on pain of seeing an anime harem with psychology and romance in it\\n\r\nThere is not really any action, let alone fights, but what a pleasure to watch!\\n\r\nCertainly one of the hidden gem and discovery of the year 2018, I do not regret trying it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[French version]\\n\\n\\n\r\nHistoire : 10/10\\n\r\nL'histoire est simple mais elle me touche beaucoup. Elle aborde avec d\u00e9licatesse et ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes auxquels les adolescents font face, qu'elle m\u00e9taphorise en les exposant comme des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes surnaturels. Cette approche donne un c\u00f4t\u00e9 moins rude et opprimant aux probl\u00e8mes rencontr\u00e9s, sans forc\u00e9ment les d\u00e9naturer ou les adoucir.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nRien de bien transcendant mais cela reste tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able \u00e0 regarder. Le chara-design est assez commun mais reste attachant, tout comme les d\u00e9cors et l'animation en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\\n\\n\r\nSon : 8/10\\n\r\nTout comme la direction artistique, la bande-son ne marque pas mais fait parfaitement son travail et est plut\u00f4t jolie, bien que discr\u00e8te. J'aime bien l'opening cependant !\\n\\n\r\nPersonnages : 10/10\\n\r\nL'autre point fort de la s\u00e9rie : les personnages sont extr\u00eamement attachants.\\n\r\nBien s\u00fbr, Sakuta et Mai brillent de par leur personnalit\u00e9 atypique.\\n\r\nOn pourrait penser que Mai est la tsundere typique telle qu'on en voit partout dans les animes, mais que nenni ! Si elle a un fort caract\u00e8re tsundere, elle l'adapte \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on et \u00e7a fait d'elle un personnage tr\u00e8s attachant et reposant.\\n\r\nSakuta, le MC, est brillant de par son attitude. Il est d\u00e9tach\u00e9 et calme (sans \u00eatre cringe, edgy ou ennuyeux) et surtout, ses remarques sont d\u00e9licieuses. Il fait preuve d'un certain humour que je n'ai retrouv\u00e9 dans aucun autre anime, ou m\u00eame s\u00e9rie ou film d'ailleurs.\\n\r\nLes autres personnages ne sont pas en reste, et ils ont tous un petit quelque chose qui les rend attachants. L'anime a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 tr\u00e8s bien les construire en seulement 13 \u00e9pisodes.\\n\\n\r\nAppr\u00e9ciation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale : 9/10\\n\r\nJ'attendais chaque nouvel \u00e9pisode avec impatience, et cela valait le coup !\\n\r\nLes th\u00e8mes abord\u00e9s m'ont touch\u00e9, tout comme les personnages et leur histoire\\n\r\nMon seul regret aura peut \u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 le dernier \u00e9pisode, que je trouve un peu trop condens\u00e9. L'anime aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 faire 14 \u00e9pisodes, voire un peu plus histoire de d\u00e9velopper encore plus les personnages et leurs histoires. Enfin, c'est peut \u00eatre juste de la gourmandise que d'en vouloir plus :p\\n\\n\\n\r\nTotal : 9/10\\n\r\nUn anime frais et agr\u00e9able \u00e0 regarder\\n\r\nPas forc\u00e9ment au go\u00fbt de tout le monde, et \u00e0 ne pas regarder au tout premier degr\u00e9 sous peine de n'y voir qu'un anime harem avec de la psychologie et de la romance dedans\\n\r\nIl n'y a pas vraiment d'action, encore moins de combats, mais quel bonheur \u00e0 regarder !\\n\r\nCertainement l'une des perle et d\u00e9couverte de l'ann\u00e9e 2018, je ne regrette pas de m'y \u00eatre essay\u00e9.",

            "content": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai or Bunny Girl Senpai in short is one of the most popular anime in this fall 2018 season. This anime is often compared to others like the Monogatari Series and Oregairu. Is it able to live up to the hype though and is it able to make a name for itself compared the anime it is compared to?\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story of Bunny Girl Senpai is relatively simple, several teenagers have the 'puberty syndrome', a syndrome where all kind of supernatural things can happen like switching bodies, becoming invisible or being stuck in a timeloop. The protagonist Sakuta Azusugawa helps different girls to face their respective problems regarding the puberty syndrome. The problems I have with this story are that it is not original and the puberty syndrome is never clearly explained. The premise of the story for example sounds very much like the premise of Bakemonogatari. The show also reminds me of Kokoro Connect with several supernatural events like body switching happening. The second problem I have with the story is that the puberty syndrome is not explained very well, just very vaguely with several concepts of the quantum mechanics. The connection between the several syndromes and quantum mechanics is not very well used though, as it seems like the writer seems to not fully understand the several quantum concepts used. This makes for a weak connection between the puberty syndrome and its respective quantum explanation. The rest of the story seems fine as it makes for an interesting premise (seen with shows like Bakemonogatari).\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of this anime are pretty well done. The background characters are pretty well animated (which is not done often), although sometimes with CGI, making them look somewhat worse. CGI is also used for several moving objects like cars and trains making them look a bit worse, but not by much. The main characters are also pretty well animated. The overall art looks good as well, although it does seem a bit basic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime is pretty good. The several music themes used fit pretty well with their respective scenes (although the several themes did not really stand out to me) and the voice actors also did a pretty good job voicing the emotions of the characters. The opening theme was pretty good as well.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe main character, Sakuta Azusagawa, seems pretty interesting as he has the stereotypical attitude to help several girls with their problems, but has a sarcastic attitude as well, combined with being very straightforward about certain situations. Other characters seem somewhat less interesting, Mai Sakurajima is a child actress and the typical tsundere and Rio Futuba is pretty typical in being interested in science and quantum mechanics. Every character gets a bit of development throughout their respective arcs, although it is only glimpsed over in the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment in the first few episodes of the anime was very good, following a premise like other very good shows and making me pretty interested in the characters. However, after the first two of the five arcs my enjoyment decreased a lot being less interested in the current character's arc and the writing seeming less well done. I also began to compare it more to other shows which executed a similar very well like Monogatari and Kokoro Connect, which caused my enjoyment to drop more because I felt like those shows executed a similar idea way better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (6,4/10)\\n\r\nSo did the show live up to the hype and was it able to make a name for itself compared to other shows following a similar story? Well I don't really think so, the story is weaker compared to shows like Monogatari and the characters do not really get developed throughout the anime. The animation and sound are pretty good though. It might make more of a name for itself in its sequel movie, but we will have to wait and see.",

A very charming anime, it exceeded my expectations in almost every category.\r\nStory: The story revolves around our main man Sakuta meeting and helping girls with a weird condition called Adolescence syndrome.  Unique to each of the girls, he does his best to help everyone who has it for him and his sister have gone through it as well.  It reminds me a lot of the Monogatari series which is one of my favorite anime series.\r\nArt:  The art is good. Nothing too special, all the characters look good whichI think is important for a series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Sound was good!  The opening song and ending song were both really catchy.  The characters sounded good as well.  They had some real emotion in their voices so props to the voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  We have some really awesome characters in this series with the standout being our main Sakuta.  He is a funny dude who just doesn't give a shit what people think of him.  He is a nice guy to the people he cares about was definitely fun to watch every week.  Mai was awesome too.  She kinda was like Sakuta in a lot of ways.  She didn't give a shit about what people thought of her but was really nice to the people she cared about.  She was funny as well and also a really cute character who was fun to see get flustered by Sakuta.  All the other characters were fun to watch as well.  There was no one that I didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Overall:  Overall it was a really great series that I highly recommend to people who want a funny, supernatural slice of life anime with sweet romance:)",

            "content": "Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (Bunny Girl) surprised me in a good way. I was expecting something fanservice focused on how the poster looks and the show's title. Thankfully it eschews from that genre altogether to produce one of the best and most heartfelt anime of the fall season. \r\nWe open this story with the main lead, Sakuta Azusagawa waking up and coming by what to him is a confusing entry into his diary. From this point, I can only assume we are taken back to the beginning of those events. While he is reading a book in the library, he spotsa girl in a bunny suit walking around wholly unnoticed by everyone else around her; something that would be considered unusual due to the showy nature of the outfit. It's here we are introduced to the show's supernatural aspect.\\n\\n\r\nIn  Bunny Girl's world there exists an affliction known as adolescence syndrome (aka Chuunibyou). Although unlike how it has been typically portrayed in shows like Siaki K or Love, Chuinibyou and other Delusions it does not take the form of eccentric flips of character associated with it, the syndrome here is more of an amplifier for problems these adolescents are struggling with and makes it manifest in a physical way.  This could be in the form of cuts appearing randomly on a person's body, or no one being able to see a person. It all ties to insecurities or worries that the afflicted is dealing with.  A lot of these worries are things that many may have struggled with around that age or still might be affected by so they come off as very relatable.\\n\\n\r\n It's an understatement to say how good a chemistry the two main leads Sukuta and Mai share.  The banter between the two is entertaining and cute. Often there were times I found myself chuckling at the barbs the two traded amongst each other.  Heck, the first three episodes that center on them could have been it, and I would have been satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Sakuta a lot mainly because of how unabashedly straightforward he is about his feelings, sexual attraction to Mai, or how he interacts with his fellow students.  For the most part, you can see he knows what the social norms are but willfully chooses to ignore them this makes him seem like someone to aspire to.  In addition,  he a very kind person he himself has suffered through the syndrome and therefore is empathetic towards those who are going through it. The show also does an excellent job of showing this through his actions rather than the usual anime tropes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMai is witty, cute, industrious there is just something magnetic about her that draws me into every scene she is in. Her initial conflict is dealt with very well, and once that is done her character develops more.  She is very driven and knows what she wants, and the way she handles herself is very admirable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMany reviewers including myself when I started watching drew comparisons between this show and the Monogatari series which while still apt are not entirely warranted. These comparisons are made because after helping out Mia Sakuta goes on to help other girls who develop the syndrome, but Bunny Girl manages to carve out its own identity as it is able to differentiate itself in crucial ways. Namely that Bunny Girl uses the Adolescence syndrome to explore its characters worries or issues whereas the Monogatari series girls were portrayed as familiar archetypes which the show subverts and the aberrations were a way of exploring that. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I have nothing to say. It was about par for what I usually expect. Nothing fantastic stood out to me neither was there anything phenomenally bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise it pretty good again nothing that stood out to me though. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked Bunny Girl  and would wholeheartedly recommend giving it a watch\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE!\r\nSummary: This show was greatly enjoyable, but lacked in a few areas, primarily the plot. Overall, give it a watch if you're a fan of the Romance/Slice of Life/Supernatural stuff.\r\nThe story was enjoyable. It is a very simple (and surprisingly enjoyable) premise, Sakuta (the male lead) finds himself in the middle of the troubles of those around him, and does what he can to help them. It never felt monotonous or boring to watch, and the resolution of each character's arc was satisfying. This being said, my biggest gripe about this show was the story. The scientific explanations of Puberty/Adolescence Syndrome from Futaba felt plainstupid to me. I felt like the real world's science should not have been stretched as it was in order to explain the mechanism of Puberty/Adolescence Syndrome, although it was better than having nothing at all. More importantly, I felt as though this anime could have benefited from a 24-episode season, in order to really flesh things out, plot wise and character-development wise. The pacing was still good for 13 episodes, nothing felt too rushed, but I personally enjoy when a story has the chance to fully develop.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good, consistently. Not once resorting to 3D/CG crowds or environments, it was plain to see that work and passion was put into making each episode. The character designs were very faithful to the source material, and never looked blatantly bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was above average, in my opinion. The voice acting was superb, especially for Sakurajima, Futaba, and Sakuta. Not to mention, this show had my favorite ending song of the Fall 2018 season, and the OST placed throughout the episodes added to the atmosphere of the show very well. However, I was not as impressed by the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, character development suffered due to the episode count, but even so, each member of the cast can be relatable and lovable in their own way. This anime does a great job in developing these characters in the time frame it is given to work with, but if you're a fan of really digging deep into motives, backgrounds, behaviors, etc. of characters, then you really don't get much outside of Sakuta and Mai. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes, I haven't watched an anime that commanded my attention more than this one since Steins;Gate or 3-Gatsu no Lion. It had a great balance of likeable, relatable characters and an intriguing plot for each arc, causing me to binge several episodes without the urge to switch shows. I don't believe this will be the case with everybody, because the show can be a bit dialogue-heavy (hence why Steins;Gate and 3-Gatsu no Lion commanded my attention), but if you're a fan of that kind of thing, you may enjoy it also.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if this show had been longer and had the time it needed to go deeper into the minds/backstories of its characters, it may have been one of my favorite shows I'd seen. However, check this out if you like dialogue-heavy, character-driven shows, and be sure to check the movie out if you enjoy the show!",

            "content": "Bunnygirl is another light novel show with a very long irrelevant title. The only difference is that Bunnygirl attempts to be meaningful though ultimately fails to resonate. \r\n[If you've watched some of the show then skip this part]\r\nThe show follows Sakuta, a High School student who's been the victim of a mysterious paranormal illness known as \"Puberty Syndrome.\" He get's past his affliction with the help of a mysterious girl. Later he meets Mai Sakurajima, a teen actress who's anxiety's of fading from the public eye cause her to gradually become invisible to most people. Sakuta helps cure Mai of her puberty syndrome and thetwo become a couple. The show basically is a puberty syndrome of the week sort of deal, where Sakuta helps anime girls get past their problems. \\n\\n\r\nPuberty syndrome is really the main gimmick of the series. It acts a metaphor for the characters problems and their personalities. This isn't necessarily a problem, nothing is wrong with having a gimmick or crux if you work well around it. Anyone watching this show will recognize the Monogatari influence, cause let's be honest these two shows have very similar formats.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there is a clear difference between what Monogatari gets right and what this show gets wrong however. And that's characters, Monogatari had people populating it's story this show has set pieces. Let's look at Mai as she is the closest this show comes to having a well written character. She is hard working, kind, sarcastic, no-nonsense, and somewhat poor at communicating her emotions. That's it she has almost no flaws, and a very normal past despite an unhealthy relationship with her mom. Compare that to Monogatari's love interest, Senjougahara. Senjougahara, is abrasive, unsociable, sarcastic, but also very sweet and protecting. Senjougahara has legitimate trust issues due to almost being raped by a cult leader that her mom was a part of. Shes was afflicted for years with weightlessness and hid it until the protagonist Araragi find out and tries to help. Senjougahara violently refuses and tries to scare Araragi away but he still tries to help her. He eventually cures her and they begin dating shortly after and we get a similar format to Bunnygirl.\\n\\n\r\nIt's here and what comes after is were we can draw a line of quality between Bunnygirl and Monogatari. Even after they date and Senjo is cured, she doesn't magically become perfect. She is still cruel at times, harsh towards others, difficult to read, and very sarcastic. But the fact that Araragi went the extra mile for her, when for years she pushed people means she deeply cherishes him. She understands she is flawed but she works to be better for him, it also culminates in a hilarious jealousy towards other girls. I spent 8 or more sentences describing the complexity of this character, where I could barely describe Mai with one. \\n\\n\r\nMonogatari works because those characters have depth and are fun to watch, I could analyze every other girl Monogatari like I did Senjo. Bunnygirl fails because why would I care about the problems of such flat one dimensional characters.\\n\\n\r\n\"Okay but Monogatari was never really about the paranormal stuff it was always about the waifus where as Bunnygirl is about personal issues.\" So maybe you could argue Bunnygirl has different goals but it still fails in most departments. Bunnygirl is apparently about tackling deep issues like depression, social anxiety, isolation, and relationships. I'm someone who has experiences with these issues and has consumed A LOT of media that tackles them. And I have to say this show fails at conveying these problems with any sense of profundity or depth. If anything I would say It puts more BAD ideas forwards than good.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how Senjo even after being cured didn't just become the perfect girlfriend, she continued to be flawed but worked on it. In this show, characters have identity defining crises and Mr. Perfect Sakuta comes along and poof their goes your problems. There are characters like Futaba who have severe, SEVERE issues that just get fixed over a small arc. This is an awful portrayal of something like depression, because it tells us that their is a simple fix to being happy. When in reality you have to live your whole life working hard to be a better and happier person like in Senjo's case. Another annoying thing is how Sakuta is seemingly able to provide help and support to every person he runs into. I'm reminded of a scene in Haruhi where Suzumiya tells a crushing story from her childhood to Kyon, and hes just dumbfounded he wants to comfort her but doesn't know how (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jZbeGjoeiU). You will never ever see a scene like this in Bunnygirl. Sakuta despite never having experienced what most of these girls go through just knows exactly what to say cause hes perfect I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThis show might come off meaningful if you've never experienced these feelings, or if you just have consumed shows that do it better or if you're 12. But ultimately there are shows that tackle these themes and issues with far greater depth, intrigue, understanding, and resonance. Everything this shows brings to the table is painfully mediocre and I am not one to accept mediocrity as I consider it a grave sin especially in this current era of sub par anime.",

            "content": "Ever just get the feeling of skipping an anime due to its alluring thumbnail where a girl dresses quite lewdly to be frank? Well, this should be one of those cases and it's a complete letdown for those whom were interested in what was bound to happen in anime thumbnails like these.. BUT, this anime is far from what you would perceive it as from just the thumbnail. Not only does it contrast your given thoughts, the anime itself, is great as well. The story seems to be eloquently narrated throughout, although i haven't checked the manga, so I can't give you a full coverageon that which might clash with skipping arcs etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe story sets around a boy called Sakuta, and in the first few episodes, the first build-up of the series start to enfold. the weird phenomenon is called \"the adolescence syndrome\",(although inexplicable in reality, but that's what makes anime great at given times) and who would have thought, it seems to occur around the main female protagonist called Sakurajima Mai and the only one who would be able to help her would be the MC. it might not appeal at first, but it's a really interesting implication to what could happen to one due to psychological distortions and . As the anime gets further into the story, the main narrative sort of remains with focusing around developing the adolescence syndrome rather than appealing to something new, although new concepts are applied with the syndrome e.g, Laplace's demon, Schrodinger's cat and so on. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art/Animation, I'd say that the animation is done quite well, although the eyes of Mai don't really seem to appeal to me, but that's subjective to one's own. Other than that, I can say confidently that there are no ostentatious flaws for the majority, if you're not really focusing TOO much on the details.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Music and VA, I think that the songs are relatively \"alright\", although not necessarily appealing to me, but maybe to you. One other thing that people often leave out of their reviews is the voice acting, and in this anime it's quite spot on. The implications of emotions, the mood and tone perceived from the characters alone make this show way more intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, where do I start. Overall, I do think that the characters have attained development to a high extend where every character, not just the main characters, but ALSO the \"side\" characters other than the childhood crush but there will be an anime movie of the series which will literally make the picture perfect and that'll probably the cherry on top of this series. I really do like their personalities to be quite bold. Sakuta's somewhat perverse responses to Mai's rather questionable questions, and the fact that she goes along with it makes Mai a less generic female character, and Sakuta a less bland male protagonist in a somewhat rom-com environment, and that's the things people would LIKE to see.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Enjoyment, I regarded this as the best anime of the season by a mile, and this will probably rank pretty high in my list as well. I thank you for reading my review and am hoping you might have a different/better outlook on the anime as you've looked through it.",

            "content": "As a filthy degenerate weeb here's my take on this show, but first a story:\r\nI feel that every weeb eventually hits this stage in their weeaboo life.\r\nThe stage after the initial weeb honeymoon, where there were initially seemingly endless top tier anime to watch, where everything was once fresh, exciting and new. Now to fuel your consumption of chinese cartoons you begin to start watching season to season, and eventually there will come a time after doing this where you will start to lose that spark in being a fan - you will feel that you are running dry, that you have plucked many ifnot most of the golden nuggets that the industry has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll then start wonder if you're burnt out on anime, as by now you will come to have seen the same shit over and over again, the same recycled ideas that were done a couple times well in the beginning be cloned in every single anime season a million times (fucking isekai), you'll start to see every sort of anime stereotype and cliche be beat to death in an endless sea of uninspired, mediocre pieces of nothing more but consumption material. \\n\\n\r\nAnd you'll continue to do this, if you haven't given up and moved on already, all in hopes to find the few sparks of modern brilliance that made you fall in love with this publicly deplorable medium in the first place. \\n\r\nYou will start to wonder more and more if you should, like many others before you, grow up and move on from anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, and discovering others like it, are to me the weeb equivalent of finding water whilst stranded in a desert.\\n\\n\r\nI have yet to type a word about this anime so far, in the interests of not having another one of my reviews be deleted I guess we should begin. \\n\\n\r\nThis highschool romcom/mystery anime can be summarised by familiar, but different. Whether it be story writing, characters, character interactions or plot progression, on the outset it is everything you have come to expect from modern teenage romance-driven anime, but the difference is here although you have the classic anime lineup and plot, it is presented in a clever, fresh and engaging way. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime can still be very much considered typical weeb bait (its literally a bunny girl as its poster and a virtually all female cast outside the protagonist, wow I wonder if I've seen this premise before!), it treats its audience like mature adults instead of just the usual filthy trash weeaboos that we very much are, and it's amazing in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the whole story premise being around supernatural elements, the character interactions and story play out in a more believable way than many in its genre, even when compared to the best, and I truly am enjoying being along for the ride in a way that I haven't felt for a long, long time.\\n\\n\r\nMan I really did not intend to write this much initially.......god I wish I could change my username so that I can nerd out like this, and write really long, overly serious reviews that no one really cares about on being passionate over 2d grills without the threat of some jerk searching my name and finding all of it through google............ alas woe is me.",

The characters are excellent, the story is engrossing, and overall if you are looking for a slightly off-beat anime, this is the one for you.\r\nFirstly, each character has a deep backstory. In each ark, the MC explores the reasons behind the strange supernatural occurrences that happen to each character and tries to resolve them. The attention to detail is also very good. Like that scene where Mai gets a phone call while in Sakuta's house and Kaede suddenly starts getting uneasy, referencing her past with the puberty syndrome.\r\nI didn't like the music so much,but the story and the characters make up for it. That is why I am giving it a 9.",

Being a cynical reviewer of shows that wear the same type of socks like Monogatari and Steins;Gate, I was fairly blown away by how much I truly enjoyed Bunny Girl.\r\nThis show really panders to what I enjoy in terms of characters and character development, to the point where I feel like I'm overindulging sometimes when watching this, like eating too much cake. The interactions between characters and their individual personalities are so sweet and completely enjoyable I can almost feel my teeth hurt and find myself smiling more often than not, each new face they introduce adding something completely differentto the formula to where it never feels bland or recycled.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the only half-gripe I have about this one is the central plot mechanic, being Puberty Syndrome (or Adolescence Syndrome, depending) goes generally unexplained up to this point in the show and likely will to the end, acting as more of an invisible springboard for amazing character interactions than a real visceral plot point, but honestly it's pretty easy to overlook as I imagine hedging all their bets on trying to erase this unknown ailment would throw a wrench into the generally fluffy mood of the show, the original light novel having been written by the same LN author that wrote the equally fluffy and wonderful Pet Girl of Sakurasou, much of the same delightful pastel style of story-writing appears in this title as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty wonderful, coming from a studio that only very recently been tasked with work on serious projects like this and the re-up of Fairy Tail. Very clean and pleasing to they eyeballs.\\n\\n\r\nAudio is great, nothing to note really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a refreshing pool of enjoyment this season and one you should absolutely be dipping your toes into. Give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\n(A final note, when watching this show I'd make it a point to find really good subtitles. I wouldn't call any animated show 'advanced' but Bunny Girl has a decent amount of humor based around Japanese history and language among other things that might fall totally flat if the translation isn't very good.)",

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I'm enjoying this anime.\r\nAt first the bored-sounding, monotone character voices bothered me, but I've since changed my mind. I think it's brilliant. They bury earnest desires for fears of pain and social expulsion. They retreat into a shell of generalized apathy to cope with this; however, this in turn perpetuates the atmosphere.\r\nThe \"atmosphere\" is a clever way of describing the status quo.\r\nWhen kids graduate from middle school and go into high school, they fantasize about how much they'll change and how much their lives will improve. When they do getinto high school, they feel a bit let down--I know I was. The question hangs in the air, \"Is this it?\" They go about their days, dissatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nThis show shines when the characters do fight against the atmosphere, when they detach from their detachment. For better or worse, their suppressed desires and  frustrations find release when they whisper quiet vulnerabilities and when they shout at the top of their lungs. \\n\\n\r\nIt makes me want to root for them.\\n\r\nAnd it makes me want to root for this show, hoping that you'll enjoy it as much as me.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait to see the rest of the season.",
