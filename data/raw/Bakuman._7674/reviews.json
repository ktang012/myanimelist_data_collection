            "content": "'Bakuman.'\r\nThe true meaning of the title was never revealed, but most speculators believe it's short for 'BAKUchi MANga.' (Gambling Manga). It is a simple tale of two middle school guys setting out to become professional manga artists. The story progresses like any other sports or music anime, where ordinary guys aim for the top, facing many challenges and rivals on the way. However, I consider this to be the greatest shounen/seishun (coming of age) genre anime I have ever encountered, because it analyzes what makes a manga good in a coherent way, and more importantly, it practices what it preaches.\r\nThis is a review by EIGHTHSin,and contains many spoilers. Read it at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are SEVEN major steps to manga creation - Name, under-sketch, inking, filling, effects, screen tone, and whiteout. I'm no expert in manga drawing, but with this series being a manga about manga (which actually got serialized), I have no doubt this is correct. Of course, this anime alone is not nearly enough to teach you about how to draw manga, but it is quite enough to entertain a casual viewer like me. The show also emphasizes the difficulty of the process, that one cannot hope to succeed half-heartedly.\\n\r\nAs the character mentioned in the first episode, \"Manga is the Japanese cultural heritage popular across the globe.\"\\n\r\nThis NHK series is extremely educational not only in introducing the process of manga creation, it also debates many other aspects of mang such as: how things work in a weekly manga publisher; the selection process; how artist stay serialized; the importance of target demographics; and argues how things ought to be in the industry. In addition, famous classic and current manga series and their authors are mentioned throughout this series without alteration of any sort, which functions as a masterpiece suggestion for new manga readers. It even directly quotes them, re-enacts DBZ \"fusion\", and uses quirks like Naruto's \"-dattebayo\". I take this to be a stamp of approval from those authors, and also to pressure themselves to create a masterpiece worthy of mentioning those names. The show uses real-life examples as case studies to explain its theories.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are SIX key elements to a successful shounen manga - A world that pulls the readers in, clear reason why protagonists are fighting, battles where it's easy to tell what's happening, equally or even more intriguing antagonist, a cute heroine, and some laughs or tears.\\n\r\nThe first episode had an extremely strong pull - The tested and tried \"average joe whose life changed by a trigger event\", in this case, Takagi's request to be a partner. The turn of events leads to a promise of marriage upon realization of dreams, which serves as the clear reason why the protagonist wants to get his manga serialized, which is the first step to getting an anime series.\\n\r\nThe story then goes on to show them making manga, meeting their 'opponents' in manga contests, and their manga are actually shown... even with a clear ranking measurements to determine a winner - easy to tell what's happening in the battle.\\n\r\nThen, there is Niizuma Eiji, the prodigy archrival of the protagonists, who is extremely intriguing, and happens to follow the \"Introduce an enemy character, he's even stronger than protagonists, but turns out to be an ally\" as mentioned during the 'CROW' production.\\n\r\nThere's the cute heroine in Azuki, and the show has many comedy and tear-jerker moments to keep the audience interested throughout the series.\\n\r\nI find it interesting that the shows makes many observations that we probably don't consciously realize when casually reading manga, and even more interesting that if we pay close attention, almost EVERY observations of a successful manga made in this series are actually reflected in the series itself. In fact, it was also mentioned that most shounen protagonists wield swords, and if you think about it, the protagonists in this show brandish their pens in \"battle\".\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists make FIVE manga series in the first anime series - 'The Two Earths', 'A Millionth of', 'The World Runs on Money and Wits', 'Angel Days', and 'Quasi-Detective TRAP'.\\n\r\n'The Two Earths' is their very first manga. It serves as introduction to the manga creation process.\\n\r\n'A Millionth of' shows the difficulty of getting a prize in manga contests, and introduction of various styles of manga.\\n\r\n'The World Runs on Money and Wits' functions as their confidence booster, as well as their gateway to future successes.\\n\r\n'Angel Days' is used to show the qualities of typical shounen manga, and the importance of choosing manga that fits each author style.\\n\r\nFinally, 'Quasi-Detective TRAP' is their success of the series, and its production process emphasizes the bond and friendship between the two main characters.\\n\r\nThe story follows the standard shounen format with many seishun elements. The good guys work hard to realize their dreams while encountering one obstacle after another. After clearing each obstacle, they \"level up\" by becoming better artists and attain better understanding of themselves. Like all seishun sports or music anime, there are consistent themes of awkward youth love, challenges of being a student, and the importance of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists set FOUR years as their goal for their anime debut. This is the prime reason why Mashiro is always in such a rush to make manga, and frequently shows his impatience.\\n\r\nThe main characters in this series are extremely human, and they act according to their own desires to make their dreams come true.\\n\r\nTakagi has the ambition of becoming rich and famous, and he gave up the \"mainstream\" path of elites (get good grades to get into a prestigious university) for his love of manga and became a true \"gambler\".\\n\r\nAzuki follows her dream of becoming a seiyuu and moves to Tokyo, while stubbornly limits interaction with Mashiro to motivate both herself and Mashiro.\\n\r\nMiyoshi truly acts on her desires, and can't help but reveal secrets of others and butting into their business.\\n\r\nNiizuma also acting on his desires, but in a different way, drawing what he pleases and doesn't care what others think about him.\\n\r\nHattori sees promise in Ashirogi, and does everything, even some \"dirty adult tricks\" to make them succeed.\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to get at, is that the characters are interesting, and they \"move on their own\" according to their desires. I have to say, they are *too* human at times, and causes their actions and motivations to detach from reality, but as a fantasy and dreams shounen series, this is totally acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are THREE requirements for a successful mangaka - Conceit (Confidence), Effort, and Luck.\\n\r\nOne of the major themes in the series is to have \"Confidence\" in yourself to follow your dream.\\n\r\nTo follow that dream, the protagonists put a lot of \"Effort\" into manga, sacrificing sleep, school, and even time for girls in order to become successful.\\n\r\nFurther more, \"Luck\" is prevalent in this series. However, it remains realistic due to many setbacks they face, just as they would in the harsh reality. The protagonists consists of a relative of a mangaka and a guy who's getting the best grades in school yet interested in manga. Right off the bat, they have been dealt pocket aces as \"gamblers\". Still, they don't become an overnight success. It took a lot of sacrifices and effort, and after 5 manga series, they finally made it to an authentic weekly magazine.\\n\r\nThis series isn't just a fairy tale. It successfully shows the difficulty of making a living with manga, and shows the harsh reality that only the most talented *and* hardworking succeed. They were dealt another lucky card in getting Hattori as the editor, who truly cares about the authors and preciously \"raises\" them as mangaka.\\n\r\nAs a shounen manga, a convenient setting is actually preferred. The key is how realistic the story develops given the fantasy-filled premise.\\n\r\nI especially loved a subtle snippet of reality in Mashiro's family. Where the breadwinner and the eldest of the family call the shots in home, like when father and grandpa straight up shut off the mother in roundabout ways, with the \"Decision-making process\" in his home and \"Please get me seconds (refill my bowl)\" by grandpa. It's outdated and somewhat sexist, but the harsh reality in Japanese culture.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are TWO types of successful mangaka - \"The Genius-Type\", and \"The Calculating-Type\".\\n\r\nThe anonymous author of this series is the same as that of 'Death Note' series, and it is also clear in this series that the storyteller is the \"Calculating-Type\" just like the protagonists. In other words, he \"calculates the laughs and tears in a way that doesn't seem to be calculated, through calculation.\" Obviously, this is not going to work on everyone, so we will all have different opinion, but the story is extremely well-constructed, and the anime direction presented the plot in very interesting ways. It's easy to sympathize with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI believe the ONE single most important theme in 'Bakuman.' is the love for manga. Both protagonist and antagonists in this series really have passion for manga. It really shows how much love the author has for this series, and manga in general.\\n\r\nThe series points out flaws in Shounen Jump (\"Shounen Jack\" in series), the only real-life title altered in the anime. The show communicates to producers in the real life through its characters.\\n\r\nFor example, there shouldn't be any politics in manga selection, like rejecting student submission or favoring popular authors - \"Anything interesting will be published.\"\\n\r\nThe potential incompetence of editors, in their heavy reliance of survey to determine which series gets cut off - \"Manga written for votes rather than true quality.\"\\n\r\nThe need for manga to have a strong pull early due to selection process of using names of first three weeks and the threat of cancellation due to votes - \"The lack of series that slowly draws the audience in, and consequently series being approved without long-term prospects.\"\\n\r\nManga published in order of popularity - \"Creates unfairness for new and aspring authors.\"\\n\r\nHow audience like stereotypical stuff that stifles creativity - \"All popular series have swords\"\\n\r\nThe young mangaka depicted in this series have hinted how they wanted to change Shounen Jack when they get popular. Perhaps the author of 'Bakuman.' wanted to do the same with this show as well.\\n\\n\r\n'Bakuman.' is the \"mainstream among mainstreams\" in terms of shounen anime, but has the dreams, the inspiration, the depth, the entertainment value, and of course, the laughs and tears unmatched by any other. It also has the uniqueness in being a manga about manga and an anime about anime. In terms of contribution to the industry, this easily ranks among the most significant series to be aired in this century so far, and I have enjoyed every minute of it.",

            "content": "This is my review for the whole bakuman series. I mean all the three seasons of bakuman which sums up to a total of 75 episodes.\r\nOK so first things first. This was an anime with high ratings here in MAL but don't expect too much about this show if you are new to anime. This wasn't your typical action packed anime, this was an anime about the anime/manga industry. So that's the reason why many loved it(including me). Of course many anime lovers want to know more about manga/anime, how it works on its motherland -- JAPAN.\r\nSo we've seen some anime/manga characters that are mangaka(mangaartist) or some that talked about it, like on To Love Ru, Ef a Tale of Memories,Aoi Bungaku,Mangaka-san to assistant-san to,Hyouka,Doujin Work etc.. But none of those really explained the industry as BAKUMAN does.I can describe this show(BAKUMAN) as some sort of an encyclopedia(coz of the info) which tells deep explanation about manga/anime industry while following the lives of the two protagonist, with the added spice of romance,school life,hardwork, and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this show you will know the reasons/answers for the following questions(if you ever thought about it, but i know you do thought of some of these)\\n\r\n- why does the creator(manga artist) of your favorite manga/anime only have 1 or 2 anime?\\n\r\n- how much do they earn from their work?\\n\r\n- why did a certain anime didn't continued?\\n\r\n- why did they omit and edit stories of some manga when it was animated?\\n\r\n- why did a certain manga didn't got an anime adaptation even though its story was really good? And why do some manga got a live action adaptation instead of anime?\\n\\n\r\nFor me its a perfect 10, A masterpiece. I know I'm kinda biased coz i really loved this show. But still I listed some of the reasons for rating it like that...below were the reasons \\n\\n\r\n1. To reach your dreams, you just need talent,hardwork and determination. Something like that was always said as we grow. But this anime proved that wrong. In reality it not as simple as how they put it on words, that's not enough, especially in the entertainment industry. But still there's the exception of those so called one in a million GENIUS that defies every fact that we believed.\\n\r\n2. I saw myself somehow in this show. Like on my childhood,elementary and early highschool days, back then, if you looked at the back pages of my notebook it has a lot drawings of anime characters from Yuyu hakusho,dragon ball,slam dunk,trigun,hunter x hunter,rurouni kenshin etc etc. and some characters that I just made up. But I can't guarantee you that you can identify them... hahaha\\n\r\n3. For me, based on my own evaluation its a well written story. From the plot, story progression, and characters. And I want to point out the characters. They say that the characters here were based on real persons from JACK(manga magazine), they resemble their traits. The character introduction and character development was also great. Characters(from mangakas to editors) got their own unique traits that gives them their individuality, characters are not just someone like a friend of the protagonist or some acquaintance of someone. And even at this time, I mean now, I still can remember most of the names of the characters from the mangakas to the editors. Imagine that.. Several months had passed since the 3rd season was aired but I still remember the names of the characters, that's really something, cause I easily forgot japanese names.\\n\r\n4. The story setting. I mean its an anime about anime/manga. Almost everything happened inside their rooms. And this show has a lot of dialogues(ofc its not an action anime). Their battles/competition/rivalries were all about drawings. But it really delivered well. It didn't bored me, and it even gave me the thrill.  \\n\r\n5. An anime with that genre to have 75 episodes all in all. I can say that there was really something in this anime that I can't explain here in words. Just try to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by the way if you want to know the meaning of the title here's a little spoiler. I think its a combination from BAKUchiuchi and MANgaka. Since the protagonist always viewed mangaka(manga artist) as bakuchiuchi(gamblers). If you have a little knowledge in Nihongo you might hear the term BAKUCHIUCHI a lot on the early episodes of the first season. \"Tada na bakuchiuchi\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's it.\\n\r\nthank you for reading my review.",

            "content": "The definition of Bakuman comes from the two words, Bakuchi Manga, meaning Gambling Manga. However to me, it means something a bit different. When I think of Bakuman I think of: hubris, effort and luck. These are the 3 principles by which the story\u2019s two protagonists live by. Bakuman is a story about hard work and reaching your dreams as well as overcoming the barriers and obstacles you\u2019re faced with in order to succeed.  This is my review.\r\nNOTE: This review covers all 75 episodes of Bakuman.\r\nContains Minor Spoilers \r\nStory\r\nIf I could describe the story of Bakuman in one sentence it would be something likethis: Bakuman is a tale about two best friends, Mashiro Moritaka and Tagaki Akito who want to become Japan\u2019s greatest mangakas.  Their journey is long and filled with laughter, cheers, tears, courage and romance. The personal lives of our mangakas contain a lot of twists and drama which makes the story more engaging than one would expect. The story is engrossing and so well written that I wish some of the stories and ideas that the characters come up with for their manga were real. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nOne word, beautiful. Obata Takeshi is an extremely talented artist. His art matches perfectly with the uplifting story and bright atmosphere of Bakuman. Character designs are drawn very realistically however from time to time designs are exaggerated for slapstick purposes, and it actually manages to be extremely funny. The backgrounds are extremely detailed, from the art pens and work desks to the manga posters spread throughout the series. You can even see Mashiro's writer's bump callus from drawing so much.  It\u2019s amazing how Obata manages to come up with different art styles for the different manga in the series. Whether it\u2019s dark, gloomy and serious or bubbly and flashy, the art always manages to be entertaining and eye catching.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI enjoyed every single song used in the show, particularly \u201cBlue Bird\u201d by Kobukuro and \u201cMoshimo no Hashi\u201d by nano.RIPE. The voice acting was top notch. All the seiyuus did a fantastic job, especially Morita Masakazu and Okamoto Nobuhiko, who were hilarious and constantly had me rolling on the floor. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nBakuman\u2019s greatest strength lies not in its story, but in its characters. Mashiro and Takagi are fantastic leads that fit the theme of the story perfectly because through them we see the struggles mangakas go through in order to get serialized and the constant battle to keep on being serialized.  Both of them care for one another deeply and through ups and downs, together they always keep pushing forward.  The supporting cast is one of the most likeable and funniest I\u2019ve ever seen. From the fellow mangakas to the editors everyone felt like they had a purpose and helped contribute to the story. I loved every single character however I felt Niizuma Eiji and Hiramaru Kazuya stood out above the rest. They were eccentric, funny and just plain damn fun to watch.  And like I said previously, Morita Masakazu and Okamoto Nobuhiko portrayed the characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nBakuman is one my all time favourite anime. It\u2019s not philosophical, cynical, depressing or about the downfall of humanity. It\u2019s not the anime to end all anime. I just love it because it was so fun to watch. I forgot about my problems for 75 episodes and that\u2019s why I watch anime, to have fun. A great story, beautiful art, a catchy soundtrack and a well developed cast of characters, please give this one a try.\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "They are young.  They are passionate.  They are on the verge of launching out onto their own lives.   \"Bakuman\" fits that niche for viewers like me who are transitioning in their lives from teens to adults.  And it's also interesting since it deals with a subject that you usually don't see in manga/anime: the lives of mangakas themselves!\r\nMashiro's uncle had been a mangaka (manga writer).  Since he was only middling successful, and died fairly young, Mashiro never considered being one himself.  He was going to go to that good university, and get that good job, so he canget his good paycheck, and go live out his lukewarm life.  At least, that was the plan until fellow student Takagi notices that Mashiro's artwork is quite good.  Takagi is one of the top students at the school; someone he has never talked to before.  And Takagi has a proposition: The two of them become a mangaka team.  He will write the manga stories, and Mashiro will draw the art.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a while for the enthusiastic Takagi to sell Mashiro on the idea.  But once he does, Mashiro has to face his next hurdle: telling his parents!\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is a slice of life, but it's not anemic.  It brings to it a lot of passion for life, and hopes and dreams.  These young men realize it's an exciting time in their lives, a time when they can make a name for themselves.  The whole world is before them.  And Takagi does what he can to encourage Mashiro's romantic relationship with a girl he has a crush on.\\n\\n\r\nBut there's a lot that's down-to-earth, and everyday.  Mashiro faces the awkwardness of still being dependent on his parents, but having to make decisions that will affect the rest of his life. Because of uncle's \"failure,\" he was the pitied member of the family.  Mashiro is afraid of being disowned by his parents when they hear of his plans.  He knows the procedure in his family: ask mom.  If mom says no, that's the end of it.  If mom says maybe, she'll discuss it with dad, and then tell him.  He never speaks with his father directly.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much comedy, but there's lots of humor.  (One recent funny incident was when they contemplate whether or not to read his uncle's \"love letters.\")  Takagi is very enthusiastic about everything, and is always pushing Mashiro to do things he doesn't want to.  Eventually, Mashiro loosens up.  They seem to run on the same wavelength. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good.  It's got lots of nice, bright color, without being too unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nIf you absolutely hate slice-of-life, you might find it boring.  If you have a young heart that hopes for the future, and are thinking of all the dreams you have yet to fulfill, I think you might enjoy it.  \\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga.  So I don't know where the story goes from here.  But I'm looking forward to seeing this series play out.",

            "content": "[Reviewed based off all three seasons] \r\nI was recommended to check out this show, and it really was worth every second -- it even made it into my top 5 list. I enjoyed it so much, and I don't know where to begin. \r\nSo we follow Mashiro and Takagi as they chase the dream to become the greatest Mangakas of Japan, and boy is it a treat. Never thought I would enjoy it this much nor did I think that I could watch 75 episodes without getting bored. Now for a guy who doesn't read Manga at all you can probably understand that I waskind of skeptical at first. However I finished all episodes in one week, and would\u2019ve finished it earlier if I didn\u2019t have other obligations. \\n\\n\r\nNow going back to what I said above about me not really reading any Manga. Bakuman was not only enjoyable but also very enlightening or informative -- it'll give you a tour into the world of Manga, and you will learn a lot. The story is so well written, and it feels so real. It really felt like the writer was portraying their own lives and world in front of my eyes, and that's probably why it was so good. A story they can easily relate to?\\n\\n\r\nSo for some specifics that I liked;\\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic story, and progression. \\n\r\n+ Some of the greatest characters I\u2019ve seen in a while namely Niizuma Eiji. Hysterical! \\n\r\n+ There was so many great moments were I even felt like standing up in my bed screaming \"YOU CAN DO THIS GUYS!\" (IRL) \\n\r\n+ Great character development.\\n\r\n+ Romance was satisfying. \\n\r\n+ Sound and music was also good, and most noteworthy -- S1 & S3 ending and S2 OP! \\n\\n\r\nWhat also surprised me was the fact that we got to immerse into specific stories and manga chapters, and they were even voice acted. This was really well done, and some of the ideas and stories they made were like \"oh I actually wanna read/see this!\". I mentioned that it was very informative and it really was. You\u2019ll get to learn about; how they draw, how they make storyboards, editors and what role they have in this, endings, adaptions and so on. There are so many things, but they're all explained in a simple manner - I mean even I understood most of it. You'll see how stories and art are affected by things like stress, schedules and willpower. How it's not always up to the author or artist to decide everything -- and that the editors hold great power. An example of this would be not being able to end a Manga when they want and/or creating the perfect ending.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all a really great Anime, and I feel like I have to start reading Manga now so that I can appreciate the original work.",

            "content": "Anime Review #2 - Bakuman\r\nLet me start by clarifying that this review is only for the anime series of Bakuman and although it may mention some references to the manga, I will try my best to focus on what is shown in the anime.\r\n\u201cMoritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi are pretty much foils of each other. Mashiro, an average 9th grade student but talented artist, and Takagi, an overall advanced 9th grader and aspiring writer. After great convincing, Takagi convinces Mashiro to join him in becoming the greatest mangakas Japan has ever seen. Takagi, with his gift of writing, hopes to become a successful mangaka, andMashiro, with his gift of art, hopes to marry the girl of his dreams, Azuki Miho.\u201d \u2013 MAL/ANN\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe plot of the story focuses on Mashiro and Takagi working hard on manga to make their dreams come true. The genre of the story is a hybrid of slice of life with some romance with themes revolving around friendship, teamwork, dreams and competition which are mostly seen in shounen animes. Throughout the anime, the narrative concentrates on the duos road to serialization in Shounen Jack (Shounen Jump in the manga), starting with one-shot mangas and entering competitions to work their way up as an author with other mangakas attempting to block their path. Although the anime resembles other romance animes, the conventions are broken from the start when Mashiro and Azuki, the female protagonist, decide to get married after the team have an anime.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode will make you want to watch the next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWe have a range of characters, the main protagonists of the anime here are Moritaka Mashiro, a character who is determined to do well and spends a lot of his time trying to improve his art, he illustrates the art. He is the conventional character seen in most animes who is shy when he is around the girl he loves. Takagi Akito, is the central character who attracts Mashiro into becoming a mangaka. He is an intelligent character who gets the highest grades but because he has the passion for manga, he decides to perceive that as his career and writes the stories for the manga. We then have the two female character, Azuki Miho who has mutual feelings with Mashiro and wants to become a seiyuu (voice actress), she is a shy character but also has the determination to take on the obstacles blocking her from what she wants to do. There is also Miyoshi Kaya, Azuki\u2019s best friend, who is a violent character and is sometimes displayed as stupid. She also becomes Takagi\u2019s girlfriend with in the anime and motivates the two mangakas to advance in their work. \\n\\n\r\nTo provide a bit of movement in the theme of romance, there is also Kawaguchi Taro, Mashiro\u2019s uncle who taught Mashiro everything about manga and has a similar story to Mashiro\u2019s when the anime starts.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the antagonists such as Niizuma Eiji, who is only a year older than the main protagonists but is considered a genius after becoming serialized at the age of 15, sparking a fire within Mashiro and Takagi, making them desperate to get serialized as soon as they can. There is also Fukuda, Aoki, Nakai and Koogy who compete with the duo and attempt to obtain serialization.\\n\\n\r\nThe last set of characters is the editors who provide constructive criticism and advise the mangakas on their work. For the duo there is Hattori, who becomes a character the team can trust and although he is a bit unsure whether the two should be serialized at a young age, he decides that they can pull it off. There is also Yujiro, Fukuda and Eiji\u2019s editor who seems to be a rival to Hattori, possibly because Eiji and Ashirogi Muto (the 2 characters pen name) consider each other as rivals as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is expected to be good as the mangaka for this manga is that of Death Note, which shocked me at first. The anime\u2019s art shows a great amount of detail yet still maintaining that slice of life environment in the anime. Something which intrigued me the most, in terms of the art, was the displaying of the stories each mangaka made. By animating the storyline and having a narrator explaining the information in the manga, improved the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSoundtrack resembling that of stuff like Honey and Clover, a very slow and mellow opening and the the first ending is similar to the opening, the second ending is a bit more heavier but still maintaining the romantic element of the anime, a bit like Toradora! Etc. There is narration when each one-shot or idea for a manga is displayed, explaining the story and dialogue in the manga. This anime isn\u2019t really the type where you have to follow the dialogue completely like Gungrave or Death Note but still it helps understand the story, so I suggest you watch the anime properly without having to skip bits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThere is probably a lot more I can say about this anime in this review but then everyone would be bored of reading this, if you aren\u2019t already. I really enjoyed the anime and can\u2019t wait for it\u2019s sequel which has already been announced. I do recommend it, but I also recommend the audience reading the manga as it\u2019s pretty awesome. In whatever order is upto you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "This series was not one of the series I originally planned on covering this fall, but after reading many positive comments about it, I decided I'd write about it, since I'd be watching it anyway. \r\nBakuman as an anime, is unique, because it's a manga adaptation, with the manga about manga artists. Doesn't make sense? Well, I assure you it's actually quite an interesting idea. And as with all J.C. Staff series I've seen, I whole-heartedly believe Bakuman will make it to into my all-time favourite anime list\r\nThis first episode begins with an alternate/fake OP (Super Hero Legends!), it was a little confusing at first,because I didn't think this would actually be the OP for Bakuman. I must admit however, it's quite the OP, bringing back memories of old-school anime. Right after the amazing pseudo-OP ended, the real OP began, and as with the Super Hero Legends! awesome-sauce, this one also managed to get my attention. The carefree easygoing beat with male vocals is a pleasant departure from your usual high-bpm high-pitched orgasmic music.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode begins with the main protagonist being introduced, Moritaka Mashiro, and having himself describe his current outlook to life using an internal monologue style. He gives the impression of a generic guy through his story. He seems unsure of what he wants, saying he needs an office job to support a family, but there's no point in trying hard. All he says to do is just keep his grades up. Then he's seen sketching Azuki Miho, his crush, and describing how meaningless it is to be in love with her, and how those dreams will never come true. Forgive me if I'm making the entire series sound generic, but this is how the episode begins, a main character, a generic storyline, however, it works well and I instantly got hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much more I can say without spoiling anything, which is the last thing I want to do for such a promising series. Long story short, Mashiro realizes he forgot his math notebook at school while he gets home, and makes his way back to class, only to find Akito Takagi, fellow student, pardon me, top student of the class, with his math notebook in his hand. Akito explains how, due to his seating position in the class (at the very back), he can see everything everyone is doing, and he is aware of Mashiro's crush for Miho. Suddenly, Akito asks Mashiro to draw manga with him, to create a manga. At first, Mashiro rejects him on the spot, but tells him he'll consider it when he gets home. He gets a phone call from Akito while he's at home, telling him he's going to confess to Miho, and that's where the story gets interesting...\\n\\n\r\nEven though Bakuman is by J.C. Staff, there's no need to compare it with the others in terms of animation. It's main strength is not going to be it's animation, rather the little details are what will make it shine. It's the character interactions, speech, expressions and the overall quality of the storyline that will bring out this series.\\n\\n\r\nAs with almost all of the series I will be covering this fall, I have high hopes for Bakuman. The series has a great start, if not a little generic, but it paved the way for a really great story. Bakuman definitely has potential, and this will definitely be a series I will be covering.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, happy watching, mina!",

            "content": "I was looking through MAL and noticed a surprising amount of positive reviews for this anime. It was being praised left, right and centre without tackling the problems that this anime has. This reviews purpose is not to say that those reviews are wrong, but to just give people a second opinion on this anime and to show that no anime is that perfect.\r\nI'll start by giving credit where credit is due. This anime is an AMAZING look into the manga industry and the lives of mangaka. By the end of the show, I felt like I knew how to create a manga of myvery own and it told me how I too could get it published in a weekly magazine. It also told me why I wouldn't ever want do that in a million years. Being a mangaka is hard, and Bakuman shows us that in spades. It cleverly uses Ashirogi Muto's emotions to give a clear understanding of how they're feeling and what they're thinking. That's certainly where this anime shines the most. So, what's wrong with it? Well...\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Bakuman uses Ashirogi Muto well in some cases, it completely fails at making them likable in the slightest. Mashiro is an arrogant love struck teenager who has a crush on some girl he's barely ever made any interactions with, and Takagi is just the plain boring smart yet doesn't act smart kind of character. I'm sorry if I'm being a little harsh, but in an anime that tries to show a realistic representation of the challenges in the manga industry, making the main characters get away with absolutely everything that would probably get them fired just from the power of pure arrogance and a tad bit of plot-armour just doesn't sit well with me. And that's not even talking about the most forced romance in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro decides his entire future based off of a promise he made to girl he had a slight crush on. That's would be pretty fine, if not still a bit stupid, if it weren't for the fact that they drag out this completely uninteresting romance for the ENTIRE SERIES. And they only ever talk directly about 3 times. 3 times! The show rubs it off as being their own way of expressing love or some shit like that, but it was just painful to watch from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNot all the characters are bad. Whilst most of the best ones don't really show up that much till season 2, Niizuma Eiji is by far the best character in this show. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that he's fun to watch every time he shows up on screen and his passion for manga makes you route for him all the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can see the appeal of this anime. I really can. But the characters and story were just so uninteresting for the most part that I cant bring myself to like this anime. If what I just told you puts you off watching this in anyway, then stay clear. There's much better anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nYou're still probably going to end up watching it after reading the other reviews anyway, aren't you?\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the music isn't that memorable. I forgot that part.",

            "content": "-----------------------------[THIS IS A 1ST SEASON ONLY REVIEW]---------------------------\r\nBakuman is the story of two boys who just met and one of them (Akito) that had a particular interest for manga saw the other one (Moritaka) drawing and understood that he had a good talent for drawing and then after convincing Moritaka both of them chose the mangaka life .. At first I found this sypnosis a bit ugh .. And well I was somewhat wrong.. There were alot of stuff they\u00b4ve done right and other that werent badly done but left alot to think .. Of course all the questions of the 1st season were answered inthe 2nd but since this is a review about the 1st season and not the all franchise I am going to say what felt wrong and what was good.\\n\\n\r\nTo me the story wasn\u00b4t anything outstanding .. if anything it was quite simple with a slow paced start that from 19 on turned out really fast and started to be amazingly enjoyable but to get there you need to get trough the ughh and zzz stuff if you know what I mean .. This however was a good decision by the creators since this is a shounen and its normal that its going to have a really weak start.. While I took 4 months to watch the first 19 eps I took 1 and a half week to watch eps 19-25 the 2nd season and the first 4 eps of the 3rd season.. crazy isnt it? .. Well I was sort of expecting something like this .. The direction was good .. the drama and the comedic moments are really well balanced I was amazed by the perfect execution and it made it one of its best parts of the show.. The art for this show is very simplistic, comparable to Danshin Kokousei no nichijou or Gintama, the animation (character movements) were done well and the expressions were really funny.. The sound was particulary good with very fitting soundtrack wich brought the scenes to life, the Openings arent anything special but one of the endings is especially good, the 2nd Ending by Takahashi yuu I have it in my Mp3 .. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the weakest link .. Since this was the introduction they focused more in the story than in the characters.. some of the relationships seemed very forced especially Akito and Miyoshi who looked like they were dating because they were best friends with Moritaka and Miho respectively .. The relationship between Moritaka and Miho was over the top awkward and with a big level of social retardation that made it cute somehow, the only character who jumped to my eyes was Niizuma wich was at first just a goof but he is also very calculative and serious wich makes this contrast very appealing to me.. Hattori looked like one of those characters who usually turn into assholes midway trough but thankfully not..\\n\\n\r\nHas I was saying the first 19 episodes were really hard to get trough so it kind of turned me off however the last 6 eps were really entertaining and they were the key to the 2nd season wich was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G .. I can give this ALL franchise a SUPER HIGH PRIORITY since its really amazing.. The 1st season only flaw was its slow paced who might turn off some people, the incossistent and forced relationships, and the lack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they present the life of a mangaka and how the manga is made is very good and they know how to expand the information field without giving away any questions nor plot holes..\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was also quite flaired and boring wich together with the slow paced story was quite unbearable .. But altogether Bakuman. is a worth watching franchise",

Then he sets a goal of getting the manga serialised and get an anime done by the time he is 18, just so he can marry the girl.  \\n\r\nNow you must think they must really like each other and have a long relationship between them,  nah,  our MC and his love interest have only talked to each other two times, by two times I mean they have only spoken two lines to each other,  their only form of communication is mail. They come of as penpals rather than a couple. Now this wouldn't have been a huge problem if the story hadn't focused on them like it does. \\n\\n\r\nThe show could have been a lot better if it had focused on the hard ships faced by a mangaka realistically,  the stakes never seemed to be high. \\n\\n\r\nBakuman could have been a really great show if it had been a seinin instead of a shounen. It seems that the creators compromised on the original idea just to expand its demographic. \\n\\n",

Rather, i\u2019ll just put down my thoughts and feelings about this anime and hope this works for you.\r\nAs I watched the very last episode of Bakuman, i realised that this piece of art, that i had watched in a matter of only a couple of weeks for 75 episodes, had made its way to my most favorite animes of all time. But what differenciates a great anime from an unforgettable one?\r\nIts exceptional art, its powerful message and moral and it\u2019soriginal setting and story are major decisive conditions for me.\\n\\n\r\nIt won\u2019t be rare for it, in a single episode, to make me go through a whole range of emotions. From tears of frusteration, to tears of joy, to sudden burst of laughter, to tears of shared pain, to anger, to surprise, to awe, and to tears of joy again.\\n\\n\r\nIt will make me think/rethink the way i see certain things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd coincidentally, it will have a long-lasting impact on my life.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is all of that. It had me rooting for the protagonists like i had never done before. It is a tale of perceverance and hard work. It\u2019s about never giving up on a dream. And it\u2019s also about a healthy rivalry and friendship. Although they are going against each other as mangaka, they are all friends who help each other in times of need. It\u2019s a rivalry where, instead of getting down and holding grudges when they lose, they get fired up and more motivated than ever to always do better. It's a friendship for which they will always give their complete trust and support. The morals of this story are pure in their innocent outlook on life and will quickly become something to look up to and live by as the epiodes fly by.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is why Bakuman is now one of my favorite animes of all time and should be given a shot by anyone in search of something more than \u201cjust an other anime to watch\u201d.",

            "content": "Bakuman is one of the most exceptional shounen titles I have watched. I didn't know that the author had written Death Note, and neither would I have cared any more for it. It has been an attempted theme in numerous shows and manga, but Bakuman is the first to truly make an exciting and capturing story based off the creation of manga.\r\nFollowing two high school students who form an artist writer combo, we get to watch as the two grow from new mangaka to their competition for serialization. Takagi is the smartest in the class and wants to be in a career that he findsfulfilling rather than get a high end office job. Mashiro is the nephew of a one hit wonder who wrote a comedy manga. Convinced that he worked till his death he is reluctant to draw manga despite drawing all the time. However, due to Takagi's persuasion, Mashiro manages to set a deal with his high school sweet heart. This all happens in episode one.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the pace of the show is fast, considering they are creating a work and then submitting it in a span of a quarter or half a year. If you have no idea how manga is created, well they don't skimp out on the process much. While a double edged sword, your educated to the point where you will be able to understand everything about it. At the same time something like this can preoccupy a whole episode with little content. While leaving me asking for something else, there is one thing that this show manages to do; make things suspenseful.\\n\\n\r\nOur duo Ashirogimuto enters a contest with a piece of work and is waiting for the call to tell them if it passed or not. Well, our leads have a plot shield don't they? Well, this isn't action. The thing is you never can really predict the results yourself. It becomes a guessing game of whether they can come out on top or not. The maturation is slow, so it isn't like they overcome a hurdle and become number one in shounen jump. Take a guess how far they can get and cut that progress in half. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this show is cut. Praise the heavens for a shounen romance that doesn't turn into some sort of harem or love triangle. Takagi does get a love interest and makes up for the pace of the other couple. No, Miho and Mashiro are the cutest couple I have seen. They are both shy and also avoid seeing each other as much as possible to complete their life goals. As pure hearted as this seems in any other show it just works for Bakuman. Sorry drama is pretty limited if non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in Bakuman is pretty good too. Well, these guys spend half the episode sitting in a room or an office they have to break the ice somehow. You will find laughs spaced out through the episode, and while Takagi is funny someone like Eiji who is a loveable nutcase mangaka or Kaya who acts as the duo's helper provide a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are focused on a lot. Since the story is simple and revolves around their job as mangaka, it then turns to the ability to show depth in the characters and Bakuman easily does that. There are plenty of rivals that appear later on in the series, and it allows us to watch the stories of multiple people competing for the same deadline.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is a great show. In fact, while I kept recording my episode scores for everything else, it just said \"screw it, this is going to be one of my favorites.\" It is, every week it just got me all worked up and I loved every minute of it. Obviously I am a fan, I will admit, so I encourage you to both watch this show or read a more negative review to balance out my optimism. \\n",

            "content": "The mangaka Tsugumi Ohba (story) and Takeshi Obata (art) did it again. They made an insane good shounen story that doesn\u2019t had any (real) fights. They\u2019ve really expanded the shounen genre! To those who don\u2019t know, they wrote Death Note too. Since Death Note is the most watched anime here and has lots of points in common. I think it is appropriate that I am going to refer to that to let you understand some things better. But don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t seen it. I will try to explain as clear as possible, so everybody can understand it.\r\nSo let\u2019s start the review already. Thestory is about 2 boys that want to become mangaka, no gamblers. They find the \u201cmangakas\u201d that cannot make a living out of there work, are just gamblers (Btw that is where the name comes from. It comes from \u201cbakuchi\u201d and \u201cmanga\u201d what means \u201cgambling manga\u201d. It symbolizes what I just said and that manga is just a gamble. You can try to predict what will be a hit but the real hits cannot be predicted. If you try to calculate what is popular to make a hit it will never be a hit. You need to make it without thinking about that and if it is or isn\u2019t a hit is just like a gamble). But what the story really is about is following your dreams. In Japanese the word \u201cyume\u201d means that much more as the translation dream here. Lots of series use that subject because it is one of the most telling and beautiful words in their culture. If you then see how Bakuman used it. I cannot imagine that something can surpass or even come close to it, if it goes about following your dreams. They teach you that it is good to have dreams, especially the part of trying to accomplish them. You will see that there is only one way to make your dreams into a reality and that is working hard for it. If you read the subs of the opening of their second season you will perfectly understand what I mean. I just got goosebumps every time I hear that song. The fact that you see how hard it is to become a professional mangaka is really good. The secrets of making manga will be revealed, so it is quite interesting to see if you are already a big manga/anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story on its own is quite different with Death Note but it has some similarities. The fact that they\u2019re both trying to accomplish their dream (it is more an ideal in Death Note though) is a little thing they have in common. another is the very start of the story. It both starts with their view on life. In Bakuman it is more about the future while it was about how rotten this world is in Death Note. It really gives a weird feeling because they both see themself as someone successful in the future but still see the life as \u201ca pain in the ass\u201d. The way you hear them thinking that while they are just walking to school is really superb.\\n\r\nFor the rest is the stories are completely different from each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen the characters. They basically aren\u2019t that special except for the protagonists and the antagonist.The way how they try so hard to accomplish their dreams is just so beautiful to see. And just like in Death Note I actually like the antagonist more. L is surely someone special. Well I don\u2019t think that Niizuma Eiji should yield to L. They\u2019re both special in there own way. Just like I like L with his special habits and the way he thinks do I like Niizuma Eiji with his special habits and especially the way he draws. He is so lively when he draws. The way he empathize with the characters while drawing and reading manga. It is so funny to see him read/draw manga! The way he is always correct with anything about manga is just superb. The fact that you like the rival even more than the protagonist(s) (While you still like the protagonist that much) is really a special way to experience a serie. Guess those who have seen Death Note know the feeling. Though they are the greatest rivals they are friends to, that is just so beautiful to see! The way the mangaka understands that a good antagonist is even more important than a good protagonist. Is something what separates the mangaka from other shounen writers.\\n\\n\r\nThe drawings fits the story perfectly. It is fascinating to see people draw manga/anime in a manga/anime serie and those drawing fits their story to. All this is done so well and though it is the same drawer as Death note the art-style is completely different and easy to separate from each other. The ost is again so good. I don\u2019t know why but I cannot tell anything bad about Bakuman and to be honest it is the same with Death Note. But I was talking about the ost. As I said it is good, especially the motivating \u201clets go for it parts\u201d and the more sad/happy music. I know it sounds weird, just to be clear I am talking about the parts where they are happy but the music is kinda sad not really sad but actually more like something happy but written in a sad-style. This gives an extra special touch that is so difficult to explain.\\n\\n\r\nThen last but surely not least, the enjoyment. This where I criticize most of the series. There are a lot series that just doesn\u2019t excite me. But Bakuman is something different! Just like Death Note I loved it that much from the first to the last episode. Though (Just like Death Note) it was a bit less in the middle. The way they make everything exciting with no battles, Just with story and dialogues is unbelievable!! The Death Note fans know what I mean for sure. I rarely was that excited than from those 2. But there is one big difference with Death Note. This one motivated me to try out manga pages. Actually drawing in common. But not only that, it motivated me to go 100% for everything that I do. That whole \u201cfollowing your dreams\u201d part is really motivating to follow or even get dreams. While after I saw Death Note, it wasn\u2019t like I was motivated to change the world or something.\\n",

            "content": "*This Review Is For All 3 Seasons (75 episodes)*\r\nWhat does it take to get me to watch a 75 episode anime twice in a six month period? A very good anime. A slice-of-life show based on the manga of the same name 'Bakuman' will entertain any fan of Japanese culture who wants to know more about the process of creating manga.\r\nThe Bakuman anime was originally licensed by Media Blasters, but that company has since gone under. Only the first 7 episodes were released on US DVD, and to my knowledge the license hasn't been reacquired and no legal streams exist. While I will always counselmy readers to only read or watch legal releases, in a scenario where no legal release exists I cannot condemn the use of fansubs (That's how I watched it, so condemnation would be hypocritical in this case anyway).\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot is pretty simple and mostly just an excuse to create a context for lessons about the manga industry. Yes, the romance between Mashiro and Azuki isn't exactly deep and largely serves as a final goal the audience hopes will be achieved, rather than a truly convincing love story (although other characters in the series also acknowledge that their highly idealized relationship is far from normal). Mashiro and Tagaki set out to accomplish their goal, challenges and obstacles are encountered, they deal with them and press on. The highlight of the story is definitely its fascinating looks into the inner workings of the manga industry (when a group of middle-aged men sitting at a table discussing manga submissions actually results in a tense scene, you're doing something right). That being said, without these manga lessons the story would quickly fall to mediocrity, the other elements are just too basic otherwise to stand out. The first season is a bit padded out, the second season is the strongest overall, the third season suffers from a weak opening arc but then races towards the finish line with a feeling of momentum.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nAs a slice of life anime there's a limit to what you can expect (or need) from the animation. Quality is fine, and given the relatively limited movement of the the series ( no 'Attack On Titan' airborne battles here) there aren't that many chances to mess up. There are only a few settings and backgrounds, but given that our characters spend the vast majority of their lives in their studio, at the editorial department, or in school the lack of variety makes sense. Character designs are the strong point of the art, since the cast is large each cast member needs to be immediately recognizable- which this anime achieves. Even if a character only gets a small portion of the screen time you'll be able to remember who they are and how they're important (although characters never seem to age, even though the story takes place over several years). Lots of bright primary colors in the palette, which fits with the upbeat tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nNo major problems with the English dub, but given that it only covers 10% of the series it's hardly worth mentioning. Japanese actors fit their characters well, but not being a Japanese speaker I can't comment on more than that with any authority. The music is generally modern and upbeat but stays out the way, preferring to simply set the mood. While you will definitely recognize several of the tracks by the later episodes the OST never gets annoying. Much like art, the production values are as high as they need to be and not much more.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nA series this long simply couldn't remain entertaining if the characters were boring. While character development is relatively simple ( nobody is going to confuse the cast of Bakuman with the cast of Vinland Saga) they do their jobs and keep the viewer watching. The most memorable character is the bombastic Eiji Nizuma, the wildly eccentric genius who serves as the main rival of our dynamic duo. Although he would make a poor main character (he's simply too talented for inspiring artistic struggle and too isolated from the rest of the cast for much meaningful interaction) when he appears his off-the-wall personality is sure to entertain. While some secondary characters seem to exist largely to express a certain view on some facet of the manga industry, they usually have enough personality escape being cardboard cutouts. The cast is entertaining, capable of pulling off enough humor and drama to keep Bakuman interesting.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nHere's where I need to state my biases up front. As a man hoping to one day be a published cartoonist, this series is right up my alley, practically tailor-made for my enjoyment, with a couple weak arcs being the only thing that keep me from loving each episode As a result of this, I'm predisposed to rate  Bakuman more highly than it might objectively deserve. While I have to concede that a lot of ThatAnimeSnob's plot and character criticisms have merit, from a standpoint of \"Do I like to watch Bakuman or not?\" I still answer: yes, very much so.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series for anime and manga fans, no question. Although modestly entertaining on its own, it relies heavily on the \"look inside the industry\" segments that a non-manga fan might only find educational rather than fascinating. For people who are fascinated by the process of making Japanese comics, however, it will be very entertaining (although I also suspect it's a highly optimistic view of the industry). It probably won't change your worldview or teach you deep truths, but it you will be amused.",

When I happened to find the manga of it by accident when looking for something to read I got completely sucked up in the story, so I decided to give the anime a shot!\r\nStory (9/10): It's straightforward and kept interesting with plot-twists at the right places. While it's no more than a simple slice of life story it progresses at an satisfying pace and doesn't really have any shortcomings. The most wonderful thing with Bakuman is how interesting it is despite lack of action - I was really suprised!\r\nArt (9/10):It's pretty detailed for being a slice of life anime and there's plenty of variety. I also liked how the anime presented the mangakas work in such a dramatic way. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): I didn't notice any shortcomings, but it was always spot on for the comic, drama and plot-twist scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The character development is amazing, I really started rooting for the mains Mashiro and Takagi. I think that's because they're easy to identify yourself with and their struggles for their dream is something most people can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): I strongly recommend this if your anything into slice of life anime. It has alot of strong points and isn't just some clich\u00e8d life-lesson learned story. Watch it already!",

What do I have to say about the anime adaption? It's great. From what I have seen, it is much better than the Death Note adaption, and, it is pretty close to the greatness of the original manga. The characters are all very interesting, and, their voices are very fitting. They have some really original characters, like Eiji and Hiramaru, who both have original personalities and designs. The anime copies Obata's artstyle amazingly well, and, the animation quality itself is verygood. The opening and ending themes are very catchy and enjoyable. This really is an amazing anime, and I hope you start watching it soon. Even though it's shounen, if you don't normally like shounen, you should try it anyways because it doesn't really feel like a normal shounen, especially seeing as it isn't a battle manga.

            "content": "After reading around 100 chapters of the manga and then not touching it for a few months, seeing Bakuman in anime form was rather refreshing.\r\nThe first season covers their beginnings and startup and progresses to a (spoiler?) major achievement. Within that span, a main driving force of the show (and characters) that bothered me was the \"promise\" made between Mashiro and Asuki. It seems cute and acts as a good progression device, but was so over-used I felt that I was just getting beat over the head with it. I get it, move on. Following the team's ups and downs was certainly enjoyable, and thetiming was good. However, the pacing, especially during the \"summer of assisting\", seemed very slow. Also, can we get Miyoshi to do something OTHER THAN cook? Thanks.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation has a classic style and feel to it, and is solidly done.\\n\\n\r\nWatched in sub, and I enjoyed the voice acting. OP is alright, found myself skipping it right away, though. ED 1 was great, but ED 2 took some getting used to.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the characters: My main gripe with this season. While some like Hatorri and Niizuma stand out as great, well-rounded developments, the \"antagonists\" of this season seem more like playful puppies. For 25 episodes, we really don't get a whole lot of back-story besides Takuro, and his main point is just how old he is. Hoping to see more development as the pace picks up in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed seeing Bakuman in anime form. It's nice to get a flowing feel for the story, but I really hope things improve -- especially in the development department.",

            "content": "This is my review for all 3 seasons (75 episodes) of Bakuman.\r\nAt face value, this anime that was based on a manga about making manga seemed like something I might not be interested in. I'm glad I checked it out because I was looking for something that was relatively current but could actually measure up to retro series in terms of story telling and character design/development.\r\nAfter watching the entire 3 seasons, I deject my earlier opinion on it as something I might not enjoy. This anime depicts the manga publishing business and the personalities in it quite well. That being said, I would have tosay the part of this anime that stood out most to me was the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching it, you might think that the characters are poorly designed and they're weak; that may be the case if you only watch one season but if you watch all 3 you'll notice that there was indeed a lot of character growth from the point when a character is introduced to the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good show that depicts the \"behind the scenes\" look at making manga and pursuing your dreams. Add in personal relationships with other people into it and you get a somewhat \"true to life\" depiction of life in the dog-eat-dog adult world.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily it's not straight drama and you're provided with two characters(Hiramaru and Niizuma) for comedic relief. They both do an awesome job at it and whenever you see them on the screen you might even be tempted to watch that scene twice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend it to someone if they were looking for something new to watch and haven't seen it yet.",

            "content": "Story: 6/10. In my opinion, I think the romance parts of Bakuman hold it back from being a genuinely interesting show. When Bakuman focuses on the mangakas and their development process, the story is a solid 8/10. However, when we get to the romance aspects of the show, I find myself begrudgingly hanging by a thread as I'm bored to death by the same conflicts and problems.\r\n\"Azuki and Saiko don't want to talk to each other! Let's remind you of this every episode, pretend we're gonna do something to advance it, but then end up at square 1 again!\"\r\nHonestly, I think the biggest gripe Ihave with the romance is that I simply do not care. It's not necessary, and it feels out of place and is given too much screen-time when the show could instead focus on its strength of being a tale of two kids trying to make it as mangakas. Literally, the basis of Azuki and Saiko's relationship is formed on a whim in episode 1: both have superficial crushes on each other and say they're gonna get married, and that becomes Saiko's final push to wanting to become a successful mangaka. It's such a contrived reason and feels forced. Saiko already has a good reason; the show could've just went with him following his uncle's dream. Done. You don't need two motivations for your main character, especially when one of them is genuinely good and well-done and the other is contrived, bland and underdeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi and Mitsuyo's relationship is somewhat better, but Mitsuyo herself is a pretty annoying character that really doesn't contribute anything on her own; she's just there to remind us that Azuki and Saiko don't talk to each other. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, when the show turns its focus to romance, I can barely consider it a 4/10. When it turns to the manga portions, it's a good 8/10; so I guess averaged out, the story comes out to a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. The artwork and animation is consistent, but I felt there was no charm or depth to it either. Everything is colorful and nice, but also bland and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. Great opening and ending, but unmemorable OSTs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Bakuman is truly an oddity, in that the characters range from being horrible 1/10s (like Azuki) to genuinely great 10/10s (like Takagi and Nizuma). So I guess I could meet halfway and give this a 5/10, but we do see more of characters like Takagi and Niizuma towards the latter half of the show, so I'm fine with giving this an extra point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. I did binge this show, so I don't think it's necessarily bad. It just wasn't fantastic, which is a darn shame because it really could've been. When Takagi and Saiko are in the process of coming up with ideas, writing names and manuscripts, getting put down but rising back up, etc, the story is fun to watch and you really want to see what idea they'll come up with next. It's also really instructional to watch how one goes about getting their manga published into something like Shounen Jump, and the struggles and hurdles they have to overcome both on the personal level and business level: just for this knowledge, I think Bakuman is a truly special show. But the amount of times I had to force myself through a pretty boring episode or part to get to that stuff made it painful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. Bakuman could've been an outstanding show, but instead it's one that has great moments and an equal amount of bland moments. I'm really upset because this show could've been an easy 9 or even 10/10 if it didn't botch its characters and their relationships, and tried going all out focusing on its strengths. The show really should've canned its romance, kept it to a minimum or actually have tried to write interesting relationships (especially with the main romance); since this romance is the centerpiece of the show, it really detracts from the experience when you're not invested in the character's motivations and just want to see the process of making manga and climbing up to success.\\n\\n\r\nI would've given the show a 6/10, but at around episode 17 or so the show starts moving away from the Azuki+Saiko moments and starts getting into some interesting manga stuff with Niizuma, and an interesting separation occurs between Takagi and Saiko. That made me want to keep watching to see how things resolved. I'll probably watch the second season, and I'm hoping the show decides to put way more attention on the mangakas and competition. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Now that it's been a few days after watching the show, looking back I decided to lower my score back to a 6. I don't think this series was worth the time investment, especially when I think of the imbalance of romance and stagnant characters to the actual writing of manga. Also, I didn't mention this prior, but I realize Mashiro is a pretty bland protagonist in his own right, and Takagi was really the only spark of life in their duo. \\n\\n\r\nI'm really conflicted between giving the show a 6 or a 7, so I guess my final verdict would be something like a 6.5/10, but rounded down because I don't think I'd recommend the show to anyone really. Romance lovers would probably hate the ingenuine main romance, and people who come to see the manga parts of the show will begrudgingly trek through the romance bits to get a sliver of good content. All in all, I don't really know who the show appeals to; if it focused on one area specifically and did it well (all romance, or all manga), I'd definitely give it a 7 (or even an 8,9 or 10 since it could've done much better). But as it stands, I consider the show a 6/10.",

            "content": "This is going to be my review of the 3 seasons combined as I feel the same about all of them.\r\nGreatness is to be expected of this since it's made by the same duo who made Death Note\r\n(Story: Tsugumi Ohba, Art: Takeshi Obata) although it's completely different their previous work.\r\nSpoilers : sorry guidelines... I am trying my best not to write any spoilers but it can't be helped (T_T).\r\nThe story revolves around Mashiro Moritaka and Takagi Akito or as how they refer to each other ''Saikou'' and ''Shuujin'' on their road to become well-known mangaka and get their manga to become into an anime becauseof a promise they made that with Azuki Miho, a girl who aspires to be a voice actress and has a crush on Mashiro (The same goes for Mashiro towards her though, it's not one-sided).\\n\r\nMashiro is the artist and Takagi is the author. \\n\\n\r\nThe initial dream was supposed to be that their manga becomes an anime and she voices the lead heroine but during their talk about this Mashiro thinking about what his uncle told him about how he was working so hard as a mangaka because there was a girl he wanted to marry but felt that he is not yet deserving of that as he wanted to marry her when he becomes a real mangaka who can actually make constant good works and make a living of drawing manga, he didn't want to be a gambler, someone that created hit or miss manga and would not be able to make a living out of manga easily, thinking about that Mashiro accidentally yelled out : ''If our dream becomes true please, marry me!''\\n\r\nShe of course was happy about that and she too wanted to marry him when their dreams become true.\\n\r\nThey promised to not meet each other until their dreams come true and to just encourage each other via e-mails.\\n\r\nAlthough this doesn't last long as they meet up several times and every time mentioning how they don't really keep their promise about not meeting each other.\\n\r\nBoth of them take their meetings as an encouragement to achieve their dreams faster so they can always be together like this.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the course of this 3 season series you will see many rivals and friends to the two main characters, many hardships and sweet success from time to time.\\n\r\nThe series can give you a big idea of what actually happens in a mangaka's life from how hard it actually is to how it isn't giving authors as much freedom as we think they have because if their series get popular it will get dragged on until it loses popularity and authors are forced to end it quickly.\\n\\n\r\nYou will learn how hard drawing manga actually is, from mastering the G-pen to inking it and drawing everyday, pulling all-nighters and fighting deadlines.\\n\\n\r\nThe series have a great supporting cast with characters like :\\n\\n\r\nNizuuma Eiji, who serves as the main rival to Ashirogi Mutou (Mashiro and Takagi's pen name) but also as their main motivation and as a friend.\\n\\n\r\nFukuda (a young adult who is the very epitome of manliness and his manga works compliment that. It's either violent manga with that has panty shots like KYOSHI Knight or a manly motor racing manga like Road Racer Giri).\\n\\n\r\nHiramaru, Aoki and so forth. All you need to know is that every supporting character is great.\\n\\n\r\nThey basically have a friend/rival relationship with almost everyone in the series except with people like KOOGY and Nanamine who serve as more of antagonists. But Bakuman is keeping it as realistic as possible while adding shounen elements like dreams and such so they don't really hate themselves or are sworn enemies or something and this is something I really like.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman does not revolve only around the two protagonists' career as manga authors but around their personal life as well.\\n\r\nFrom how Mashiro contacts with Azuki via texts, and how sometimes he says the wrong things and has to fix whatever he has said.\\n\r\nHow Azuki also struggles with her dream from time to time and he is there to help her.\\n\\n\r\nWhen something revolves around Takagi's personal life it's drama with his girlfriend misunderstanding that he cheats on her to how the stories he wrote for one of their mangas made a criminal rob a bank and blame it on the manga which struck him mentally.\\n\\n\r\nFrom time to time we also get Azuki's point of view and how she works towards her dream as well.",

            "content": "'Bakuman.'\r\nThe true meaning of the title was never revealed, but most speculators believe it's short for 'BAKUchi MANga.' (Gambling Manga). It is a simple tale of two middle school guys setting out to become professional manga artists. The story progresses like any other sports or music anime, where ordinary guys aim for the top, facing many challenges and rivals on the way. However, I consider this to be the greatest shounen/seishun (coming of age) genre anime I have ever encountered, because it analyzes what makes a manga good in a coherent way, and more importantly, it practices what it preaches.\r\nThis is a review by EIGHTHSin,and contains many spoilers. Read it at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are SEVEN major steps to manga creation - Name, under-sketch, inking, filling, effects, screen tone, and whiteout. I'm no expert in manga drawing, but with this series being a manga about manga (which actually got serialized), I have no doubt this is correct. Of course, this anime alone is not nearly enough to teach you about how to draw manga, but it is quite enough to entertain a casual viewer like me. The show also emphasizes the difficulty of the process, that one cannot hope to succeed half-heartedly.\\n\r\nAs the character mentioned in the first episode, \"Manga is the Japanese cultural heritage popular across the globe.\"\\n\r\nThis NHK series is extremely educational not only in introducing the process of manga creation, it also debates many other aspects of mang such as: how things work in a weekly manga publisher; the selection process; how artist stay serialized; the importance of target demographics; and argues how things ought to be in the industry. In addition, famous classic and current manga series and their authors are mentioned throughout this series without alteration of any sort, which functions as a masterpiece suggestion for new manga readers. It even directly quotes them, re-enacts DBZ \"fusion\", and uses quirks like Naruto's \"-dattebayo\". I take this to be a stamp of approval from those authors, and also to pressure themselves to create a masterpiece worthy of mentioning those names. The show uses real-life examples as case studies to explain its theories.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are SIX key elements to a successful shounen manga - A world that pulls the readers in, clear reason why protagonists are fighting, battles where it's easy to tell what's happening, equally or even more intriguing antagonist, a cute heroine, and some laughs or tears.\\n\r\nThe first episode had an extremely strong pull - The tested and tried \"average joe whose life changed by a trigger event\", in this case, Takagi's request to be a partner. The turn of events leads to a promise of marriage upon realization of dreams, which serves as the clear reason why the protagonist wants to get his manga serialized, which is the first step to getting an anime series.\\n\r\nThe story then goes on to show them making manga, meeting their 'opponents' in manga contests, and their manga are actually shown... even with a clear ranking measurements to determine a winner - easy to tell what's happening in the battle.\\n\r\nThen, there is Niizuma Eiji, the prodigy archrival of the protagonists, who is extremely intriguing, and happens to follow the \"Introduce an enemy character, he's even stronger than protagonists, but turns out to be an ally\" as mentioned during the 'CROW' production.\\n\r\nThere's the cute heroine in Azuki, and the show has many comedy and tear-jerker moments to keep the audience interested throughout the series.\\n\r\nI find it interesting that the shows makes many observations that we probably don't consciously realize when casually reading manga, and even more interesting that if we pay close attention, almost EVERY observations of a successful manga made in this series are actually reflected in the series itself. In fact, it was also mentioned that most shounen protagonists wield swords, and if you think about it, the protagonists in this show brandish their pens in \"battle\".\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists make FIVE manga series in the first anime series - 'The Two Earths', 'A Millionth of', 'The World Runs on Money and Wits', 'Angel Days', and 'Quasi-Detective TRAP'.\\n\r\n'The Two Earths' is their very first manga. It serves as introduction to the manga creation process.\\n\r\n'A Millionth of' shows the difficulty of getting a prize in manga contests, and introduction of various styles of manga.\\n\r\n'The World Runs on Money and Wits' functions as their confidence booster, as well as their gateway to future successes.\\n\r\n'Angel Days' is used to show the qualities of typical shounen manga, and the importance of choosing manga that fits each author style.\\n\r\nFinally, 'Quasi-Detective TRAP' is their success of the series, and its production process emphasizes the bond and friendship between the two main characters.\\n\r\nThe story follows the standard shounen format with many seishun elements. The good guys work hard to realize their dreams while encountering one obstacle after another. After clearing each obstacle, they \"level up\" by becoming better artists and attain better understanding of themselves. Like all seishun sports or music anime, there are consistent themes of awkward youth love, challenges of being a student, and the importance of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists set FOUR years as their goal for their anime debut. This is the prime reason why Mashiro is always in such a rush to make manga, and frequently shows his impatience.\\n\r\nThe main characters in this series are extremely human, and they act according to their own desires to make their dreams come true.\\n\r\nTakagi has the ambition of becoming rich and famous, and he gave up the \"mainstream\" path of elites (get good grades to get into a prestigious university) for his love of manga and became a true \"gambler\".\\n\r\nAzuki follows her dream of becoming a seiyuu and moves to Tokyo, while stubbornly limits interaction with Mashiro to motivate both herself and Mashiro.\\n\r\nMiyoshi truly acts on her desires, and can't help but reveal secrets of others and butting into their business.\\n\r\nNiizuma also acting on his desires, but in a different way, drawing what he pleases and doesn't care what others think about him.\\n\r\nHattori sees promise in Ashirogi, and does everything, even some \"dirty adult tricks\" to make them succeed.\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to get at, is that the characters are interesting, and they \"move on their own\" according to their desires. I have to say, they are *too* human at times, and causes their actions and motivations to detach from reality, but as a fantasy and dreams shounen series, this is totally acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are THREE requirements for a successful mangaka - Conceit (Confidence), Effort, and Luck.\\n\r\nOne of the major themes in the series is to have \"Confidence\" in yourself to follow your dream.\\n\r\nTo follow that dream, the protagonists put a lot of \"Effort\" into manga, sacrificing sleep, school, and even time for girls in order to become successful.\\n\r\nFurther more, \"Luck\" is prevalent in this series. However, it remains realistic due to many setbacks they face, just as they would in the harsh reality. The protagonists consists of a relative of a mangaka and a guy who's getting the best grades in school yet interested in manga. Right off the bat, they have been dealt pocket aces as \"gamblers\". Still, they don't become an overnight success. It took a lot of sacrifices and effort, and after 5 manga series, they finally made it to an authentic weekly magazine.\\n\r\nThis series isn't just a fairy tale. It successfully shows the difficulty of making a living with manga, and shows the harsh reality that only the most talented *and* hardworking succeed. They were dealt another lucky card in getting Hattori as the editor, who truly cares about the authors and preciously \"raises\" them as mangaka.\\n\r\nAs a shounen manga, a convenient setting is actually preferred. The key is how realistic the story develops given the fantasy-filled premise.\\n\r\nI especially loved a subtle snippet of reality in Mashiro's family. Where the breadwinner and the eldest of the family call the shots in home, like when father and grandpa straight up shut off the mother in roundabout ways, with the \"Decision-making process\" in his home and \"Please get me seconds (refill my bowl)\" by grandpa. It's outdated and somewhat sexist, but the harsh reality in Japanese culture.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to 'Bakuman.', there are TWO types of successful mangaka - \"The Genius-Type\", and \"The Calculating-Type\".\\n\r\nThe anonymous author of this series is the same as that of 'Death Note' series, and it is also clear in this series that the storyteller is the \"Calculating-Type\" just like the protagonists. In other words, he \"calculates the laughs and tears in a way that doesn't seem to be calculated, through calculation.\" Obviously, this is not going to work on everyone, so we will all have different opinion, but the story is extremely well-constructed, and the anime direction presented the plot in very interesting ways. It's easy to sympathize with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI believe the ONE single most important theme in 'Bakuman.' is the love for manga. Both protagonist and antagonists in this series really have passion for manga. It really shows how much love the author has for this series, and manga in general.\\n\r\nThe series points out flaws in Shounen Jump (\"Shounen Jack\" in series), the only real-life title altered in the anime. The show communicates to producers in the real life through its characters.\\n\r\nFor example, there shouldn't be any politics in manga selection, like rejecting student submission or favoring popular authors - \"Anything interesting will be published.\"\\n\r\nThe potential incompetence of editors, in their heavy reliance of survey to determine which series gets cut off - \"Manga written for votes rather than true quality.\"\\n\r\nThe need for manga to have a strong pull early due to selection process of using names of first three weeks and the threat of cancellation due to votes - \"The lack of series that slowly draws the audience in, and consequently series being approved without long-term prospects.\"\\n\r\nManga published in order of popularity - \"Creates unfairness for new and aspring authors.\"\\n\r\nHow audience like stereotypical stuff that stifles creativity - \"All popular series have swords\"\\n\r\nThe young mangaka depicted in this series have hinted how they wanted to change Shounen Jack when they get popular. Perhaps the author of 'Bakuman.' wanted to do the same with this show as well.\\n\\n\r\n'Bakuman.' is the \"mainstream among mainstreams\" in terms of shounen anime, but has the dreams, the inspiration, the depth, the entertainment value, and of course, the laughs and tears unmatched by any other. It also has the uniqueness in being a manga about manga and an anime about anime. In terms of contribution to the industry, this easily ranks among the most significant series to be aired in this century so far, and I have enjoyed every minute of it.",

            "content": "This is my review for the whole bakuman series. I mean all the three seasons of bakuman which sums up to a total of 75 episodes.\r\nOK so first things first. This was an anime with high ratings here in MAL but don't expect too much about this show if you are new to anime. This wasn't your typical action packed anime, this was an anime about the anime/manga industry. So that's the reason why many loved it(including me). Of course many anime lovers want to know more about manga/anime, how it works on its motherland -- JAPAN.\r\nSo we've seen some anime/manga characters that are mangaka(mangaartist) or some that talked about it, like on To Love Ru, Ef a Tale of Memories,Aoi Bungaku,Mangaka-san to assistant-san to,Hyouka,Doujin Work etc.. But none of those really explained the industry as BAKUMAN does.I can describe this show(BAKUMAN) as some sort of an encyclopedia(coz of the info) which tells deep explanation about manga/anime industry while following the lives of the two protagonist, with the added spice of romance,school life,hardwork, and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this show you will know the reasons/answers for the following questions(if you ever thought about it, but i know you do thought of some of these)\\n\r\n- why does the creator(manga artist) of your favorite manga/anime only have 1 or 2 anime?\\n\r\n- how much do they earn from their work?\\n\r\n- why did a certain anime didn't continued?\\n\r\n- why did they omit and edit stories of some manga when it was animated?\\n\r\n- why did a certain manga didn't got an anime adaptation even though its story was really good? And why do some manga got a live action adaptation instead of anime?\\n\\n\r\nFor me its a perfect 10, A masterpiece. I know I'm kinda biased coz i really loved this show. But still I listed some of the reasons for rating it like that...below were the reasons \\n\\n\r\n1. To reach your dreams, you just need talent,hardwork and determination. Something like that was always said as we grow. But this anime proved that wrong. In reality it not as simple as how they put it on words, that's not enough, especially in the entertainment industry. But still there's the exception of those so called one in a million GENIUS that defies every fact that we believed.\\n\r\n2. I saw myself somehow in this show. Like on my childhood,elementary and early highschool days, back then, if you looked at the back pages of my notebook it has a lot drawings of anime characters from Yuyu hakusho,dragon ball,slam dunk,trigun,hunter x hunter,rurouni kenshin etc etc. and some characters that I just made up. But I can't guarantee you that you can identify them... hahaha\\n\r\n3. For me, based on my own evaluation its a well written story. From the plot, story progression, and characters. And I want to point out the characters. They say that the characters here were based on real persons from JACK(manga magazine), they resemble their traits. The character introduction and character development was also great. Characters(from mangakas to editors) got their own unique traits that gives them their individuality, characters are not just someone like a friend of the protagonist or some acquaintance of someone. And even at this time, I mean now, I still can remember most of the names of the characters from the mangakas to the editors. Imagine that.. Several months had passed since the 3rd season was aired but I still remember the names of the characters, that's really something, cause I easily forgot japanese names.\\n\r\n4. The story setting. I mean its an anime about anime/manga. Almost everything happened inside their rooms. And this show has a lot of dialogues(ofc its not an action anime). Their battles/competition/rivalries were all about drawings. But it really delivered well. It didn't bored me, and it even gave me the thrill.  \\n\r\n5. An anime with that genre to have 75 episodes all in all. I can say that there was really something in this anime that I can't explain here in words. Just try to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by the way if you want to know the meaning of the title here's a little spoiler. I think its a combination from BAKUchiuchi and MANgaka. Since the protagonist always viewed mangaka(manga artist) as bakuchiuchi(gamblers). If you have a little knowledge in Nihongo you might hear the term BAKUCHIUCHI a lot on the early episodes of the first season. \"Tada na bakuchiuchi\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's it.\\n\r\nthank you for reading my review.",

            "content": "The definition of Bakuman comes from the two words, Bakuchi Manga, meaning Gambling Manga. However to me, it means something a bit different. When I think of Bakuman I think of: hubris, effort and luck. These are the 3 principles by which the story\u2019s two protagonists live by. Bakuman is a story about hard work and reaching your dreams as well as overcoming the barriers and obstacles you\u2019re faced with in order to succeed.  This is my review.\r\nNOTE: This review covers all 75 episodes of Bakuman.\r\nContains Minor Spoilers \r\nStory\r\nIf I could describe the story of Bakuman in one sentence it would be something likethis: Bakuman is a tale about two best friends, Mashiro Moritaka and Tagaki Akito who want to become Japan\u2019s greatest mangakas.  Their journey is long and filled with laughter, cheers, tears, courage and romance. The personal lives of our mangakas contain a lot of twists and drama which makes the story more engaging than one would expect. The story is engrossing and so well written that I wish some of the stories and ideas that the characters come up with for their manga were real. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nOne word, beautiful. Obata Takeshi is an extremely talented artist. His art matches perfectly with the uplifting story and bright atmosphere of Bakuman. Character designs are drawn very realistically however from time to time designs are exaggerated for slapstick purposes, and it actually manages to be extremely funny. The backgrounds are extremely detailed, from the art pens and work desks to the manga posters spread throughout the series. You can even see Mashiro's writer's bump callus from drawing so much.  It\u2019s amazing how Obata manages to come up with different art styles for the different manga in the series. Whether it\u2019s dark, gloomy and serious or bubbly and flashy, the art always manages to be entertaining and eye catching.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI enjoyed every single song used in the show, particularly \u201cBlue Bird\u201d by Kobukuro and \u201cMoshimo no Hashi\u201d by nano.RIPE. The voice acting was top notch. All the seiyuus did a fantastic job, especially Morita Masakazu and Okamoto Nobuhiko, who were hilarious and constantly had me rolling on the floor. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nBakuman\u2019s greatest strength lies not in its story, but in its characters. Mashiro and Takagi are fantastic leads that fit the theme of the story perfectly because through them we see the struggles mangakas go through in order to get serialized and the constant battle to keep on being serialized.  Both of them care for one another deeply and through ups and downs, together they always keep pushing forward.  The supporting cast is one of the most likeable and funniest I\u2019ve ever seen. From the fellow mangakas to the editors everyone felt like they had a purpose and helped contribute to the story. I loved every single character however I felt Niizuma Eiji and Hiramaru Kazuya stood out above the rest. They were eccentric, funny and just plain damn fun to watch.  And like I said previously, Morita Masakazu and Okamoto Nobuhiko portrayed the characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nBakuman is one my all time favourite anime. It\u2019s not philosophical, cynical, depressing or about the downfall of humanity. It\u2019s not the anime to end all anime. I just love it because it was so fun to watch. I forgot about my problems for 75 episodes and that\u2019s why I watch anime, to have fun. A great story, beautiful art, a catchy soundtrack and a well developed cast of characters, please give this one a try.\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "They are young.  They are passionate.  They are on the verge of launching out onto their own lives.   \"Bakuman\" fits that niche for viewers like me who are transitioning in their lives from teens to adults.  And it's also interesting since it deals with a subject that you usually don't see in manga/anime: the lives of mangakas themselves!\r\nMashiro's uncle had been a mangaka (manga writer).  Since he was only middling successful, and died fairly young, Mashiro never considered being one himself.  He was going to go to that good university, and get that good job, so he canget his good paycheck, and go live out his lukewarm life.  At least, that was the plan until fellow student Takagi notices that Mashiro's artwork is quite good.  Takagi is one of the top students at the school; someone he has never talked to before.  And Takagi has a proposition: The two of them become a mangaka team.  He will write the manga stories, and Mashiro will draw the art.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a while for the enthusiastic Takagi to sell Mashiro on the idea.  But once he does, Mashiro has to face his next hurdle: telling his parents!\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is a slice of life, but it's not anemic.  It brings to it a lot of passion for life, and hopes and dreams.  These young men realize it's an exciting time in their lives, a time when they can make a name for themselves.  The whole world is before them.  And Takagi does what he can to encourage Mashiro's romantic relationship with a girl he has a crush on.\\n\\n\r\nBut there's a lot that's down-to-earth, and everyday.  Mashiro faces the awkwardness of still being dependent on his parents, but having to make decisions that will affect the rest of his life. Because of uncle's \"failure,\" he was the pitied member of the family.  Mashiro is afraid of being disowned by his parents when they hear of his plans.  He knows the procedure in his family: ask mom.  If mom says no, that's the end of it.  If mom says maybe, she'll discuss it with dad, and then tell him.  He never speaks with his father directly.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much comedy, but there's lots of humor.  (One recent funny incident was when they contemplate whether or not to read his uncle's \"love letters.\")  Takagi is very enthusiastic about everything, and is always pushing Mashiro to do things he doesn't want to.  Eventually, Mashiro loosens up.  They seem to run on the same wavelength. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good.  It's got lots of nice, bright color, without being too unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nIf you absolutely hate slice-of-life, you might find it boring.  If you have a young heart that hopes for the future, and are thinking of all the dreams you have yet to fulfill, I think you might enjoy it.  \\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga.  So I don't know where the story goes from here.  But I'm looking forward to seeing this series play out.",

            "content": "[Reviewed based off all three seasons] \r\nI was recommended to check out this show, and it really was worth every second -- it even made it into my top 5 list. I enjoyed it so much, and I don't know where to begin. \r\nSo we follow Mashiro and Takagi as they chase the dream to become the greatest Mangakas of Japan, and boy is it a treat. Never thought I would enjoy it this much nor did I think that I could watch 75 episodes without getting bored. Now for a guy who doesn't read Manga at all you can probably understand that I waskind of skeptical at first. However I finished all episodes in one week, and would\u2019ve finished it earlier if I didn\u2019t have other obligations. \\n\\n\r\nNow going back to what I said above about me not really reading any Manga. Bakuman was not only enjoyable but also very enlightening or informative -- it'll give you a tour into the world of Manga, and you will learn a lot. The story is so well written, and it feels so real. It really felt like the writer was portraying their own lives and world in front of my eyes, and that's probably why it was so good. A story they can easily relate to?\\n\\n\r\nSo for some specifics that I liked;\\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic story, and progression. \\n\r\n+ Some of the greatest characters I\u2019ve seen in a while namely Niizuma Eiji. Hysterical! \\n\r\n+ There was so many great moments were I even felt like standing up in my bed screaming \"YOU CAN DO THIS GUYS!\" (IRL) \\n\r\n+ Great character development.\\n\r\n+ Romance was satisfying. \\n\r\n+ Sound and music was also good, and most noteworthy -- S1 & S3 ending and S2 OP! \\n\\n\r\nWhat also surprised me was the fact that we got to immerse into specific stories and manga chapters, and they were even voice acted. This was really well done, and some of the ideas and stories they made were like \"oh I actually wanna read/see this!\". I mentioned that it was very informative and it really was. You\u2019ll get to learn about; how they draw, how they make storyboards, editors and what role they have in this, endings, adaptions and so on. There are so many things, but they're all explained in a simple manner - I mean even I understood most of it. You'll see how stories and art are affected by things like stress, schedules and willpower. How it's not always up to the author or artist to decide everything -- and that the editors hold great power. An example of this would be not being able to end a Manga when they want and/or creating the perfect ending.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all a really great Anime, and I feel like I have to start reading Manga now so that I can appreciate the original work.",

            "content": "Anime Review #2 - Bakuman\r\nLet me start by clarifying that this review is only for the anime series of Bakuman and although it may mention some references to the manga, I will try my best to focus on what is shown in the anime.\r\n\u201cMoritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi are pretty much foils of each other. Mashiro, an average 9th grade student but talented artist, and Takagi, an overall advanced 9th grader and aspiring writer. After great convincing, Takagi convinces Mashiro to join him in becoming the greatest mangakas Japan has ever seen. Takagi, with his gift of writing, hopes to become a successful mangaka, andMashiro, with his gift of art, hopes to marry the girl of his dreams, Azuki Miho.\u201d \u2013 MAL/ANN\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe plot of the story focuses on Mashiro and Takagi working hard on manga to make their dreams come true. The genre of the story is a hybrid of slice of life with some romance with themes revolving around friendship, teamwork, dreams and competition which are mostly seen in shounen animes. Throughout the anime, the narrative concentrates on the duos road to serialization in Shounen Jack (Shounen Jump in the manga), starting with one-shot mangas and entering competitions to work their way up as an author with other mangakas attempting to block their path. Although the anime resembles other romance animes, the conventions are broken from the start when Mashiro and Azuki, the female protagonist, decide to get married after the team have an anime.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode will make you want to watch the next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWe have a range of characters, the main protagonists of the anime here are Moritaka Mashiro, a character who is determined to do well and spends a lot of his time trying to improve his art, he illustrates the art. He is the conventional character seen in most animes who is shy when he is around the girl he loves. Takagi Akito, is the central character who attracts Mashiro into becoming a mangaka. He is an intelligent character who gets the highest grades but because he has the passion for manga, he decides to perceive that as his career and writes the stories for the manga. We then have the two female character, Azuki Miho who has mutual feelings with Mashiro and wants to become a seiyuu (voice actress), she is a shy character but also has the determination to take on the obstacles blocking her from what she wants to do. There is also Miyoshi Kaya, Azuki\u2019s best friend, who is a violent character and is sometimes displayed as stupid. She also becomes Takagi\u2019s girlfriend with in the anime and motivates the two mangakas to advance in their work. \\n\\n\r\nTo provide a bit of movement in the theme of romance, there is also Kawaguchi Taro, Mashiro\u2019s uncle who taught Mashiro everything about manga and has a similar story to Mashiro\u2019s when the anime starts.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the antagonists such as Niizuma Eiji, who is only a year older than the main protagonists but is considered a genius after becoming serialized at the age of 15, sparking a fire within Mashiro and Takagi, making them desperate to get serialized as soon as they can. There is also Fukuda, Aoki, Nakai and Koogy who compete with the duo and attempt to obtain serialization.\\n\\n\r\nThe last set of characters is the editors who provide constructive criticism and advise the mangakas on their work. For the duo there is Hattori, who becomes a character the team can trust and although he is a bit unsure whether the two should be serialized at a young age, he decides that they can pull it off. There is also Yujiro, Fukuda and Eiji\u2019s editor who seems to be a rival to Hattori, possibly because Eiji and Ashirogi Muto (the 2 characters pen name) consider each other as rivals as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is expected to be good as the mangaka for this manga is that of Death Note, which shocked me at first. The anime\u2019s art shows a great amount of detail yet still maintaining that slice of life environment in the anime. Something which intrigued me the most, in terms of the art, was the displaying of the stories each mangaka made. By animating the storyline and having a narrator explaining the information in the manga, improved the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSoundtrack resembling that of stuff like Honey and Clover, a very slow and mellow opening and the the first ending is similar to the opening, the second ending is a bit more heavier but still maintaining the romantic element of the anime, a bit like Toradora! Etc. There is narration when each one-shot or idea for a manga is displayed, explaining the story and dialogue in the manga. This anime isn\u2019t really the type where you have to follow the dialogue completely like Gungrave or Death Note but still it helps understand the story, so I suggest you watch the anime properly without having to skip bits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThere is probably a lot more I can say about this anime in this review but then everyone would be bored of reading this, if you aren\u2019t already. I really enjoyed the anime and can\u2019t wait for it\u2019s sequel which has already been announced. I do recommend it, but I also recommend the audience reading the manga as it\u2019s pretty awesome. In whatever order is upto you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "This series was not one of the series I originally planned on covering this fall, but after reading many positive comments about it, I decided I'd write about it, since I'd be watching it anyway. \r\nBakuman as an anime, is unique, because it's a manga adaptation, with the manga about manga artists. Doesn't make sense? Well, I assure you it's actually quite an interesting idea. And as with all J.C. Staff series I've seen, I whole-heartedly believe Bakuman will make it to into my all-time favourite anime list\r\nThis first episode begins with an alternate/fake OP (Super Hero Legends!), it was a little confusing at first,because I didn't think this would actually be the OP for Bakuman. I must admit however, it's quite the OP, bringing back memories of old-school anime. Right after the amazing pseudo-OP ended, the real OP began, and as with the Super Hero Legends! awesome-sauce, this one also managed to get my attention. The carefree easygoing beat with male vocals is a pleasant departure from your usual high-bpm high-pitched orgasmic music.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode begins with the main protagonist being introduced, Moritaka Mashiro, and having himself describe his current outlook to life using an internal monologue style. He gives the impression of a generic guy through his story. He seems unsure of what he wants, saying he needs an office job to support a family, but there's no point in trying hard. All he says to do is just keep his grades up. Then he's seen sketching Azuki Miho, his crush, and describing how meaningless it is to be in love with her, and how those dreams will never come true. Forgive me if I'm making the entire series sound generic, but this is how the episode begins, a main character, a generic storyline, however, it works well and I instantly got hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much more I can say without spoiling anything, which is the last thing I want to do for such a promising series. Long story short, Mashiro realizes he forgot his math notebook at school while he gets home, and makes his way back to class, only to find Akito Takagi, fellow student, pardon me, top student of the class, with his math notebook in his hand. Akito explains how, due to his seating position in the class (at the very back), he can see everything everyone is doing, and he is aware of Mashiro's crush for Miho. Suddenly, Akito asks Mashiro to draw manga with him, to create a manga. At first, Mashiro rejects him on the spot, but tells him he'll consider it when he gets home. He gets a phone call from Akito while he's at home, telling him he's going to confess to Miho, and that's where the story gets interesting...\\n\\n\r\nEven though Bakuman is by J.C. Staff, there's no need to compare it with the others in terms of animation. It's main strength is not going to be it's animation, rather the little details are what will make it shine. It's the character interactions, speech, expressions and the overall quality of the storyline that will bring out this series.\\n\\n\r\nAs with almost all of the series I will be covering this fall, I have high hopes for Bakuman. The series has a great start, if not a little generic, but it paved the way for a really great story. Bakuman definitely has potential, and this will definitely be a series I will be covering.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, happy watching, mina!",

            "content": "I was looking through MAL and noticed a surprising amount of positive reviews for this anime. It was being praised left, right and centre without tackling the problems that this anime has. This reviews purpose is not to say that those reviews are wrong, but to just give people a second opinion on this anime and to show that no anime is that perfect.\r\nI'll start by giving credit where credit is due. This anime is an AMAZING look into the manga industry and the lives of mangaka. By the end of the show, I felt like I knew how to create a manga of myvery own and it told me how I too could get it published in a weekly magazine. It also told me why I wouldn't ever want do that in a million years. Being a mangaka is hard, and Bakuman shows us that in spades. It cleverly uses Ashirogi Muto's emotions to give a clear understanding of how they're feeling and what they're thinking. That's certainly where this anime shines the most. So, what's wrong with it? Well...\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Bakuman uses Ashirogi Muto well in some cases, it completely fails at making them likable in the slightest. Mashiro is an arrogant love struck teenager who has a crush on some girl he's barely ever made any interactions with, and Takagi is just the plain boring smart yet doesn't act smart kind of character. I'm sorry if I'm being a little harsh, but in an anime that tries to show a realistic representation of the challenges in the manga industry, making the main characters get away with absolutely everything that would probably get them fired just from the power of pure arrogance and a tad bit of plot-armour just doesn't sit well with me. And that's not even talking about the most forced romance in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro decides his entire future based off of a promise he made to girl he had a slight crush on. That's would be pretty fine, if not still a bit stupid, if it weren't for the fact that they drag out this completely uninteresting romance for the ENTIRE SERIES. And they only ever talk directly about 3 times. 3 times! The show rubs it off as being their own way of expressing love or some shit like that, but it was just painful to watch from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNot all the characters are bad. Whilst most of the best ones don't really show up that much till season 2, Niizuma Eiji is by far the best character in this show. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that he's fun to watch every time he shows up on screen and his passion for manga makes you route for him all the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can see the appeal of this anime. I really can. But the characters and story were just so uninteresting for the most part that I cant bring myself to like this anime. If what I just told you puts you off watching this in anyway, then stay clear. There's much better anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nYou're still probably going to end up watching it after reading the other reviews anyway, aren't you?\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the music isn't that memorable. I forgot that part.",

            "content": "-----------------------------[THIS IS A 1ST SEASON ONLY REVIEW]---------------------------\r\nBakuman is the story of two boys who just met and one of them (Akito) that had a particular interest for manga saw the other one (Moritaka) drawing and understood that he had a good talent for drawing and then after convincing Moritaka both of them chose the mangaka life .. At first I found this sypnosis a bit ugh .. And well I was somewhat wrong.. There were alot of stuff they\u00b4ve done right and other that werent badly done but left alot to think .. Of course all the questions of the 1st season were answered inthe 2nd but since this is a review about the 1st season and not the all franchise I am going to say what felt wrong and what was good.\\n\\n\r\nTo me the story wasn\u00b4t anything outstanding .. if anything it was quite simple with a slow paced start that from 19 on turned out really fast and started to be amazingly enjoyable but to get there you need to get trough the ughh and zzz stuff if you know what I mean .. This however was a good decision by the creators since this is a shounen and its normal that its going to have a really weak start.. While I took 4 months to watch the first 19 eps I took 1 and a half week to watch eps 19-25 the 2nd season and the first 4 eps of the 3rd season.. crazy isnt it? .. Well I was sort of expecting something like this .. The direction was good .. the drama and the comedic moments are really well balanced I was amazed by the perfect execution and it made it one of its best parts of the show.. The art for this show is very simplistic, comparable to Danshin Kokousei no nichijou or Gintama, the animation (character movements) were done well and the expressions were really funny.. The sound was particulary good with very fitting soundtrack wich brought the scenes to life, the Openings arent anything special but one of the endings is especially good, the 2nd Ending by Takahashi yuu I have it in my Mp3 .. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the weakest link .. Since this was the introduction they focused more in the story than in the characters.. some of the relationships seemed very forced especially Akito and Miyoshi who looked like they were dating because they were best friends with Moritaka and Miho respectively .. The relationship between Moritaka and Miho was over the top awkward and with a big level of social retardation that made it cute somehow, the only character who jumped to my eyes was Niizuma wich was at first just a goof but he is also very calculative and serious wich makes this contrast very appealing to me.. Hattori looked like one of those characters who usually turn into assholes midway trough but thankfully not..\\n\\n\r\nHas I was saying the first 19 episodes were really hard to get trough so it kind of turned me off however the last 6 eps were really entertaining and they were the key to the 2nd season wich was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G .. I can give this ALL franchise a SUPER HIGH PRIORITY since its really amazing.. The 1st season only flaw was its slow paced who might turn off some people, the incossistent and forced relationships, and the lack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they present the life of a mangaka and how the manga is made is very good and they know how to expand the information field without giving away any questions nor plot holes..\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was also quite flaired and boring wich together with the slow paced story was quite unbearable .. But altogether Bakuman. is a worth watching franchise",

            "content": "Bakuman is one of the most disappointing shows I have seen in a long time. \r\nBakuman started with a great premise but unfortunately dilutes itself with the god awful romantic sub-plot and poor character development. \r\nThe show tried way to hard to be mainstream,  just like the protagonist who tries to create a mainstream manga,  which I think is its biggest downfall. \r\nOur protagonist who at first gave up on the idea of becoming a mangaka and rejected his friends offer on working together with him,  quickly changes his decision when he finds out that his crush wants to become avoice actress. Then he sets a goal of getting the manga serialised and get an anime done by the time he is 18, just so he can marry the girl.  \\n\r\nNow you must think they must really like each other and have a long relationship between them,  nah,  our MC and his love interest have only talked to each other two times, by two times I mean they have only spoken two lines to each other,  their only form of communication is mail. They come of as penpals rather than a couple. Now this wouldn't have been a huge problem if the story hadn't focused on them like it does. \\n\\n\r\nThe show could have been a lot better if it had focused on the hard ships faced by a mangaka realistically,  the stakes never seemed to be high. \\n\\n\r\nBakuman could have been a really great show if it had been a seinin instead of a shounen. It seems that the creators compromised on the original idea just to expand its demographic. \\n\\n",

Rather, i\u2019ll just put down my thoughts and feelings about this anime and hope this works for you.\r\nAs I watched the very last episode of Bakuman, i realised that this piece of art, that i had watched in a matter of only a couple of weeks for 75 episodes, had made its way to my most favorite animes of all time. But what differenciates a great anime from an unforgettable one?\r\nIts exceptional art, its powerful message and moral and it\u2019soriginal setting and story are major decisive conditions for me.\\n\\n\r\nIt won\u2019t be rare for it, in a single episode, to make me go through a whole range of emotions. From tears of frusteration, to tears of joy, to sudden burst of laughter, to tears of shared pain, to anger, to surprise, to awe, and to tears of joy again.\\n\\n\r\nIt will make me think/rethink the way i see certain things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd coincidentally, it will have a long-lasting impact on my life.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is all of that. It had me rooting for the protagonists like i had never done before. It is a tale of perceverance and hard work. It\u2019s about never giving up on a dream. And it\u2019s also about a healthy rivalry and friendship. Although they are going against each other as mangaka, they are all friends who help each other in times of need. It\u2019s a rivalry where, instead of getting down and holding grudges when they lose, they get fired up and more motivated than ever to always do better. It's a friendship for which they will always give their complete trust and support. The morals of this story are pure in their innocent outlook on life and will quickly become something to look up to and live by as the epiodes fly by.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is why Bakuman is now one of my favorite animes of all time and should be given a shot by anyone in search of something more than \u201cjust an other anime to watch\u201d.",

            "content": "Bakuman is one of the most exceptional shounen titles I have watched. I didn't know that the author had written Death Note, and neither would I have cared any more for it. It has been an attempted theme in numerous shows and manga, but Bakuman is the first to truly make an exciting and capturing story based off the creation of manga.\r\nFollowing two high school students who form an artist writer combo, we get to watch as the two grow from new mangaka to their competition for serialization. Takagi is the smartest in the class and wants to be in a career that he findsfulfilling rather than get a high end office job. Mashiro is the nephew of a one hit wonder who wrote a comedy manga. Convinced that he worked till his death he is reluctant to draw manga despite drawing all the time. However, due to Takagi's persuasion, Mashiro manages to set a deal with his high school sweet heart. This all happens in episode one.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the pace of the show is fast, considering they are creating a work and then submitting it in a span of a quarter or half a year. If you have no idea how manga is created, well they don't skimp out on the process much. While a double edged sword, your educated to the point where you will be able to understand everything about it. At the same time something like this can preoccupy a whole episode with little content. While leaving me asking for something else, there is one thing that this show manages to do; make things suspenseful.\\n\\n\r\nOur duo Ashirogimuto enters a contest with a piece of work and is waiting for the call to tell them if it passed or not. Well, our leads have a plot shield don't they? Well, this isn't action. The thing is you never can really predict the results yourself. It becomes a guessing game of whether they can come out on top or not. The maturation is slow, so it isn't like they overcome a hurdle and become number one in shounen jump. Take a guess how far they can get and cut that progress in half. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this show is cut. Praise the heavens for a shounen romance that doesn't turn into some sort of harem or love triangle. Takagi does get a love interest and makes up for the pace of the other couple. No, Miho and Mashiro are the cutest couple I have seen. They are both shy and also avoid seeing each other as much as possible to complete their life goals. As pure hearted as this seems in any other show it just works for Bakuman. Sorry drama is pretty limited if non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in Bakuman is pretty good too. Well, these guys spend half the episode sitting in a room or an office they have to break the ice somehow. You will find laughs spaced out through the episode, and while Takagi is funny someone like Eiji who is a loveable nutcase mangaka or Kaya who acts as the duo's helper provide a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are focused on a lot. Since the story is simple and revolves around their job as mangaka, it then turns to the ability to show depth in the characters and Bakuman easily does that. There are plenty of rivals that appear later on in the series, and it allows us to watch the stories of multiple people competing for the same deadline.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is a great show. In fact, while I kept recording my episode scores for everything else, it just said \"screw it, this is going to be one of my favorites.\" It is, every week it just got me all worked up and I loved every minute of it. Obviously I am a fan, I will admit, so I encourage you to both watch this show or read a more negative review to balance out my optimism. \\n",

            "content": "The mangaka Tsugumi Ohba (story) and Takeshi Obata (art) did it again. They made an insane good shounen story that doesn\u2019t had any (real) fights. They\u2019ve really expanded the shounen genre! To those who don\u2019t know, they wrote Death Note too. Since Death Note is the most watched anime here and has lots of points in common. I think it is appropriate that I am going to refer to that to let you understand some things better. But don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t seen it. I will try to explain as clear as possible, so everybody can understand it.\r\nSo let\u2019s start the review already. Thestory is about 2 boys that want to become mangaka, no gamblers. They find the \u201cmangakas\u201d that cannot make a living out of there work, are just gamblers (Btw that is where the name comes from. It comes from \u201cbakuchi\u201d and \u201cmanga\u201d what means \u201cgambling manga\u201d. It symbolizes what I just said and that manga is just a gamble. You can try to predict what will be a hit but the real hits cannot be predicted. If you try to calculate what is popular to make a hit it will never be a hit. You need to make it without thinking about that and if it is or isn\u2019t a hit is just like a gamble). But what the story really is about is following your dreams. In Japanese the word \u201cyume\u201d means that much more as the translation dream here. Lots of series use that subject because it is one of the most telling and beautiful words in their culture. If you then see how Bakuman used it. I cannot imagine that something can surpass or even come close to it, if it goes about following your dreams. They teach you that it is good to have dreams, especially the part of trying to accomplish them. You will see that there is only one way to make your dreams into a reality and that is working hard for it. If you read the subs of the opening of their second season you will perfectly understand what I mean. I just got goosebumps every time I hear that song. The fact that you see how hard it is to become a professional mangaka is really good. The secrets of making manga will be revealed, so it is quite interesting to see if you are already a big manga/anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story on its own is quite different with Death Note but it has some similarities. The fact that they\u2019re both trying to accomplish their dream (it is more an ideal in Death Note though) is a little thing they have in common. another is the very start of the story. It both starts with their view on life. In Bakuman it is more about the future while it was about how rotten this world is in Death Note. It really gives a weird feeling because they both see themself as someone successful in the future but still see the life as \u201ca pain in the ass\u201d. The way you hear them thinking that while they are just walking to school is really superb.\\n\r\nFor the rest is the stories are completely different from each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen the characters. They basically aren\u2019t that special except for the protagonists and the antagonist.The way how they try so hard to accomplish their dreams is just so beautiful to see. And just like in Death Note I actually like the antagonist more. L is surely someone special. Well I don\u2019t think that Niizuma Eiji should yield to L. They\u2019re both special in there own way. Just like I like L with his special habits and the way he thinks do I like Niizuma Eiji with his special habits and especially the way he draws. He is so lively when he draws. The way he empathize with the characters while drawing and reading manga. It is so funny to see him read/draw manga! The way he is always correct with anything about manga is just superb. The fact that you like the rival even more than the protagonist(s) (While you still like the protagonist that much) is really a special way to experience a serie. Guess those who have seen Death Note know the feeling. Though they are the greatest rivals they are friends to, that is just so beautiful to see! The way the mangaka understands that a good antagonist is even more important than a good protagonist. Is something what separates the mangaka from other shounen writers.\\n\\n\r\nThe drawings fits the story perfectly. It is fascinating to see people draw manga/anime in a manga/anime serie and those drawing fits their story to. All this is done so well and though it is the same drawer as Death note the art-style is completely different and easy to separate from each other. The ost is again so good. I don\u2019t know why but I cannot tell anything bad about Bakuman and to be honest it is the same with Death Note. But I was talking about the ost. As I said it is good, especially the motivating \u201clets go for it parts\u201d and the more sad/happy music. I know it sounds weird, just to be clear I am talking about the parts where they are happy but the music is kinda sad not really sad but actually more like something happy but written in a sad-style. This gives an extra special touch that is so difficult to explain.\\n\\n\r\nThen last but surely not least, the enjoyment. This where I criticize most of the series. There are a lot series that just doesn\u2019t excite me. But Bakuman is something different! Just like Death Note I loved it that much from the first to the last episode. Though (Just like Death Note) it was a bit less in the middle. The way they make everything exciting with no battles, Just with story and dialogues is unbelievable!! The Death Note fans know what I mean for sure. I rarely was that excited than from those 2. But there is one big difference with Death Note. This one motivated me to try out manga pages. Actually drawing in common. But not only that, it motivated me to go 100% for everything that I do. That whole \u201cfollowing your dreams\u201d part is really motivating to follow or even get dreams. While after I saw Death Note, it wasn\u2019t like I was motivated to change the world or something.\\n",

            "content": "*This Review Is For All 3 Seasons (75 episodes)*\r\nWhat does it take to get me to watch a 75 episode anime twice in a six month period? A very good anime. A slice-of-life show based on the manga of the same name 'Bakuman' will entertain any fan of Japanese culture who wants to know more about the process of creating manga.\r\nThe Bakuman anime was originally licensed by Media Blasters, but that company has since gone under. Only the first 7 episodes were released on US DVD, and to my knowledge the license hasn't been reacquired and no legal streams exist. While I will always counselmy readers to only read or watch legal releases, in a scenario where no legal release exists I cannot condemn the use of fansubs (That's how I watched it, so condemnation would be hypocritical in this case anyway).\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot is pretty simple and mostly just an excuse to create a context for lessons about the manga industry. Yes, the romance between Mashiro and Azuki isn't exactly deep and largely serves as a final goal the audience hopes will be achieved, rather than a truly convincing love story (although other characters in the series also acknowledge that their highly idealized relationship is far from normal). Mashiro and Tagaki set out to accomplish their goal, challenges and obstacles are encountered, they deal with them and press on. The highlight of the story is definitely its fascinating looks into the inner workings of the manga industry (when a group of middle-aged men sitting at a table discussing manga submissions actually results in a tense scene, you're doing something right). That being said, without these manga lessons the story would quickly fall to mediocrity, the other elements are just too basic otherwise to stand out. The first season is a bit padded out, the second season is the strongest overall, the third season suffers from a weak opening arc but then races towards the finish line with a feeling of momentum.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nAs a slice of life anime there's a limit to what you can expect (or need) from the animation. Quality is fine, and given the relatively limited movement of the the series ( no 'Attack On Titan' airborne battles here) there aren't that many chances to mess up. There are only a few settings and backgrounds, but given that our characters spend the vast majority of their lives in their studio, at the editorial department, or in school the lack of variety makes sense. Character designs are the strong point of the art, since the cast is large each cast member needs to be immediately recognizable- which this anime achieves. Even if a character only gets a small portion of the screen time you'll be able to remember who they are and how they're important (although characters never seem to age, even though the story takes place over several years). Lots of bright primary colors in the palette, which fits with the upbeat tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nNo major problems with the English dub, but given that it only covers 10% of the series it's hardly worth mentioning. Japanese actors fit their characters well, but not being a Japanese speaker I can't comment on more than that with any authority. The music is generally modern and upbeat but stays out the way, preferring to simply set the mood. While you will definitely recognize several of the tracks by the later episodes the OST never gets annoying. Much like art, the production values are as high as they need to be and not much more.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nA series this long simply couldn't remain entertaining if the characters were boring. While character development is relatively simple ( nobody is going to confuse the cast of Bakuman with the cast of Vinland Saga) they do their jobs and keep the viewer watching. The most memorable character is the bombastic Eiji Nizuma, the wildly eccentric genius who serves as the main rival of our dynamic duo. Although he would make a poor main character (he's simply too talented for inspiring artistic struggle and too isolated from the rest of the cast for much meaningful interaction) when he appears his off-the-wall personality is sure to entertain. While some secondary characters seem to exist largely to express a certain view on some facet of the manga industry, they usually have enough personality escape being cardboard cutouts. The cast is entertaining, capable of pulling off enough humor and drama to keep Bakuman interesting.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nHere's where I need to state my biases up front. As a man hoping to one day be a published cartoonist, this series is right up my alley, practically tailor-made for my enjoyment, with a couple weak arcs being the only thing that keep me from loving each episode As a result of this, I'm predisposed to rate  Bakuman more highly than it might objectively deserve. While I have to concede that a lot of ThatAnimeSnob's plot and character criticisms have merit, from a standpoint of \"Do I like to watch Bakuman or not?\" I still answer: yes, very much so.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series for anime and manga fans, no question. Although modestly entertaining on its own, it relies heavily on the \"look inside the industry\" segments that a non-manga fan might only find educational rather than fascinating. For people who are fascinated by the process of making Japanese comics, however, it will be very entertaining (although I also suspect it's a highly optimistic view of the industry). It probably won't change your worldview or teach you deep truths, but it you will be amused.",

When I happened to find the manga of it by accident when looking for something to read I got completely sucked up in the story, so I decided to give the anime a shot!\r\nStory (9/10): It's straightforward and kept interesting with plot-twists at the right places. While it's no more than a simple slice of life story it progresses at an satisfying pace and doesn't really have any shortcomings. The most wonderful thing with Bakuman is how interesting it is despite lack of action - I was really suprised!\r\nArt (9/10):It's pretty detailed for being a slice of life anime and there's plenty of variety. I also liked how the anime presented the mangakas work in such a dramatic way. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): I didn't notice any shortcomings, but it was always spot on for the comic, drama and plot-twist scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The character development is amazing, I really started rooting for the mains Mashiro and Takagi. I think that's because they're easy to identify yourself with and their struggles for their dream is something most people can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): I strongly recommend this if your anything into slice of life anime. It has alot of strong points and isn't just some clich\u00e8d life-lesson learned story. Watch it already!",

What do I have to say about the anime adaption? It's great. From what I have seen, it is much better than the Death Note adaption, and, it is pretty close to the greatness of the original manga. The characters are all very interesting, and, their voices are very fitting. They have some really original characters, like Eiji and Hiramaru, who both have original personalities and designs. The anime copies Obata's artstyle amazingly well, and, the animation quality itself is verygood. The opening and ending themes are very catchy and enjoyable. This really is an amazing anime, and I hope you start watching it soon. Even though it's shounen, if you don't normally like shounen, you should try it anyways because it doesn't really feel like a normal shounen, especially seeing as it isn't a battle manga.

            "content": "After reading around 100 chapters of the manga and then not touching it for a few months, seeing Bakuman in anime form was rather refreshing.\r\nThe first season covers their beginnings and startup and progresses to a (spoiler?) major achievement. Within that span, a main driving force of the show (and characters) that bothered me was the \"promise\" made between Mashiro and Asuki. It seems cute and acts as a good progression device, but was so over-used I felt that I was just getting beat over the head with it. I get it, move on. Following the team's ups and downs was certainly enjoyable, and thetiming was good. However, the pacing, especially during the \"summer of assisting\", seemed very slow. Also, can we get Miyoshi to do something OTHER THAN cook? Thanks.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation has a classic style and feel to it, and is solidly done.\\n\\n\r\nWatched in sub, and I enjoyed the voice acting. OP is alright, found myself skipping it right away, though. ED 1 was great, but ED 2 took some getting used to.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the characters: My main gripe with this season. While some like Hatorri and Niizuma stand out as great, well-rounded developments, the \"antagonists\" of this season seem more like playful puppies. For 25 episodes, we really don't get a whole lot of back-story besides Takuro, and his main point is just how old he is. Hoping to see more development as the pace picks up in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed seeing Bakuman in anime form. It's nice to get a flowing feel for the story, but I really hope things improve -- especially in the development department.",

            "content": "This is my review for all 3 seasons (75 episodes) of Bakuman.\r\nAt face value, this anime that was based on a manga about making manga seemed like something I might not be interested in. I'm glad I checked it out because I was looking for something that was relatively current but could actually measure up to retro series in terms of story telling and character design/development.\r\nAfter watching the entire 3 seasons, I deject my earlier opinion on it as something I might not enjoy. This anime depicts the manga publishing business and the personalities in it quite well. That being said, I would have tosay the part of this anime that stood out most to me was the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching it, you might think that the characters are poorly designed and they're weak; that may be the case if you only watch one season but if you watch all 3 you'll notice that there was indeed a lot of character growth from the point when a character is introduced to the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good show that depicts the \"behind the scenes\" look at making manga and pursuing your dreams. Add in personal relationships with other people into it and you get a somewhat \"true to life\" depiction of life in the dog-eat-dog adult world.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily it's not straight drama and you're provided with two characters(Hiramaru and Niizuma) for comedic relief. They both do an awesome job at it and whenever you see them on the screen you might even be tempted to watch that scene twice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend it to someone if they were looking for something new to watch and haven't seen it yet.",

            "content": "Story: 6/10. In my opinion, I think the romance parts of Bakuman hold it back from being a genuinely interesting show. When Bakuman focuses on the mangakas and their development process, the story is a solid 8/10. However, when we get to the romance aspects of the show, I find myself begrudgingly hanging by a thread as I'm bored to death by the same conflicts and problems.\r\n\"Azuki and Saiko don't want to talk to each other! Let's remind you of this every episode, pretend we're gonna do something to advance it, but then end up at square 1 again!\"\r\nHonestly, I think the biggest gripe Ihave with the romance is that I simply do not care. It's not necessary, and it feels out of place and is given too much screen-time when the show could instead focus on its strength of being a tale of two kids trying to make it as mangakas. Literally, the basis of Azuki and Saiko's relationship is formed on a whim in episode 1: both have superficial crushes on each other and say they're gonna get married, and that becomes Saiko's final push to wanting to become a successful mangaka. It's such a contrived reason and feels forced. Saiko already has a good reason; the show could've just went with him following his uncle's dream. Done. You don't need two motivations for your main character, especially when one of them is genuinely good and well-done and the other is contrived, bland and underdeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi and Mitsuyo's relationship is somewhat better, but Mitsuyo herself is a pretty annoying character that really doesn't contribute anything on her own; she's just there to remind us that Azuki and Saiko don't talk to each other. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, when the show turns its focus to romance, I can barely consider it a 4/10. When it turns to the manga portions, it's a good 8/10; so I guess averaged out, the story comes out to a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. The artwork and animation is consistent, but I felt there was no charm or depth to it either. Everything is colorful and nice, but also bland and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. Great opening and ending, but unmemorable OSTs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Bakuman is truly an oddity, in that the characters range from being horrible 1/10s (like Azuki) to genuinely great 10/10s (like Takagi and Nizuma). So I guess I could meet halfway and give this a 5/10, but we do see more of characters like Takagi and Niizuma towards the latter half of the show, so I'm fine with giving this an extra point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. I did binge this show, so I don't think it's necessarily bad. It just wasn't fantastic, which is a darn shame because it really could've been. When Takagi and Saiko are in the process of coming up with ideas, writing names and manuscripts, getting put down but rising back up, etc, the story is fun to watch and you really want to see what idea they'll come up with next. It's also really instructional to watch how one goes about getting their manga published into something like Shounen Jump, and the struggles and hurdles they have to overcome both on the personal level and business level: just for this knowledge, I think Bakuman is a truly special show. But the amount of times I had to force myself through a pretty boring episode or part to get to that stuff made it painful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. Bakuman could've been an outstanding show, but instead it's one that has great moments and an equal amount of bland moments. I'm really upset because this show could've been an easy 9 or even 10/10 if it didn't botch its characters and their relationships, and tried going all out focusing on its strengths. The show really should've canned its romance, kept it to a minimum or actually have tried to write interesting relationships (especially with the main romance); since this romance is the centerpiece of the show, it really detracts from the experience when you're not invested in the character's motivations and just want to see the process of making manga and climbing up to success.\\n\\n\r\nI would've given the show a 6/10, but at around episode 17 or so the show starts moving away from the Azuki+Saiko moments and starts getting into some interesting manga stuff with Niizuma, and an interesting separation occurs between Takagi and Saiko. That made me want to keep watching to see how things resolved. I'll probably watch the second season, and I'm hoping the show decides to put way more attention on the mangakas and competition. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Now that it's been a few days after watching the show, looking back I decided to lower my score back to a 6. I don't think this series was worth the time investment, especially when I think of the imbalance of romance and stagnant characters to the actual writing of manga. Also, I didn't mention this prior, but I realize Mashiro is a pretty bland protagonist in his own right, and Takagi was really the only spark of life in their duo. \\n\\n\r\nI'm really conflicted between giving the show a 6 or a 7, so I guess my final verdict would be something like a 6.5/10, but rounded down because I don't think I'd recommend the show to anyone really. Romance lovers would probably hate the ingenuine main romance, and people who come to see the manga parts of the show will begrudgingly trek through the romance bits to get a sliver of good content. All in all, I don't really know who the show appeals to; if it focused on one area specifically and did it well (all romance, or all manga), I'd definitely give it a 7 (or even an 8,9 or 10 since it could've done much better). But as it stands, I consider the show a 6/10.",

I am trying my best not to write any spoilers but it can't be helped (T_T).\r\nThe story revolves around Mashiro Moritaka and Takagi Akito or as how they refer to each other ''Saikou'' and ''Shuujin'' on their road to become well-known mangaka and get their manga to become into an anime becauseof a promise they made that with Azuki Miho, a girl who aspires to be a voice actress and has a crush on Mashiro (The same goes for Mashiro towards her though, it's not one-sided).\\n\r\nMashiro is the artist and Takagi is the author. \\n\\n\r\nThe initial dream was supposed to be that their manga becomes an anime and she voices the lead heroine but during their talk about this Mashiro thinking about what his uncle told him about how he was working so hard as a mangaka because there was a girl he wanted to marry but felt that he is not yet deserving of that as he wanted to marry her when he becomes a real mangaka who can actually make constant good works and make a living of drawing manga, he didn't want to be a gambler, someone that created hit or miss manga and would not be able to make a living out of manga easily, thinking about that Mashiro accidentally yelled out : ''If our dream becomes true please, marry me!''\\n\r\nShe of course was happy about that and she too wanted to marry him when their dreams become true.\\n\r\nThey promised to not meet each other until their dreams come true and to just encourage each other via e-mails.\\n\r\nAlthough this doesn't last long as they meet up several times and every time mentioning how they don't really keep their promise about not meeting each other.\\n\r\nBoth of them take their meetings as an encouragement to achieve their dreams faster so they can always be together like this.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the course of this 3 season series you will see many rivals and friends to the two main characters, many hardships and sweet success from time to time.\\n\r\nThe series can give you a big idea of what actually happens in a mangaka's life from how hard it actually is to how it isn't giving authors as much freedom as we think they have because if their series get popular it will get dragged on until it loses popularity and authors are forced to end it quickly.\\n\\n\r\nYou will learn how hard drawing manga actually is, from mastering the G-pen to inking it and drawing everyday, pulling all-nighters and fighting deadlines.\\n\\n\r\nThe series have a great supporting cast with characters like :\\n\\n\r\nNizuuma Eiji, who serves as the main rival to Ashirogi Mutou (Mashiro and Takagi's pen name) but also as their main motivation and as a friend.\\n\\n\r\nFukuda (a young adult who is the very epitome of manliness and his manga works compliment that. It's either violent manga with that has panty shots like KYOSHI Knight or a manly motor racing manga like Road Racer Giri).\\n\\n\r\nHiramaru, Aoki and so forth. All you need to know is that every supporting character is great.\\n\\n\r\nThey basically have a friend/rival relationship with almost everyone in the series except with people like KOOGY and Nanamine who serve as more of antagonists. But Bakuman is keeping it as realistic as possible while adding shounen elements like dreams and such so they don't really hate themselves or are sworn enemies or something and this is something I really like.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman does not revolve only around the two protagonists' career as manga authors but around their personal life as well.\\n\r\nFrom how Mashiro contacts with Azuki via texts, and how sometimes he says the wrong things and has to fix whatever he has said.\\n\r\nHow Azuki also struggles with her dream from time to time and he is there to help her.\\n\\n\r\nWhen something revolves around Takagi's personal life it's drama with his girlfriend misunderstanding that he cheats on her to how the stories he wrote for one of their mangas made a criminal rob a bank and blame it on the manga which struck him mentally.\\n\\n\r\nFrom time to time we also get Azuki's point of view and how she works towards her dream as well.",

            "content": "Well, guess I might as well write my first review here on MAL. Since reviewing here on this site is highly risky especially in controversial anime due to haters and lovers raging at each other's opinions and tearing apart your criticism I figured to start with a pretty obvious one(at least for me): 'Bakuman'.\r\nMy review will deal with all of the three seasons of the anime, covering 75 episodes of anime in total. I will start with how I got to watch this anime in the first place before I get to the content. When I first heard of the name 'Bakuman' I looked upthe synopsis and...well, I was a little sceptical if the anime could entertain me. No action, no explosions, no stunning world. If you're not into this, you might as well think it is not that much fun. And so did I. Several times I thought 'Nah, let's watch this later.'. But that was a mistake. When I finally got around to watch this, I was glued to my computer. Let's get into the why now:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nWhile there is no stunning mind-blowing storyline with a lot of explosions or stuff and the story as is does not seem that spectacular, the given story of two guys dreaming of becoming famous mangaka is executed nearly perfectly. Because the road from creating the first storybook up to getting an anime adaption is very long. More than often the protagonist trip on their journey, have to deal with strange fellow mangaka or with their personal life in general. Each and every chapter of the journey of Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi made me want to watch the next episode. The anime shows how hard it is to be successful in life. Just because you have ambitions, it does not mean you are able to achieve them. There are people who have more talent and if you are not careful, they might as well leave you behind. Such is the real life. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore I learned a lot about making a manga in general. If you just read the stuff they print in Shonen Jump you might not imagine how much sweat, blood and energy an author needs just to publish a single chapter. I don't even want to imagine the amount of time in total necessary for even one issue. After watching 'Bakuman' I can only offer my deepest respect for all the mangaka, editors and so on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, I can't say much about this. Some friends argued the kinda unique style did not please them. While I can relate to their opinon, I did not mind it in the least. While it was no graphical masterpiece, the animations were fluid and the coloring fit the general mood of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe BGM of the anime is pretty good as well. Most of the tracks underlined the atmosphere of the anime pretty well without catching too much attention as to distract from the dialogues of the characters. Which brings me to the Seiyuu. I think each and every participating character did an outstanding job of performing their specific character. More than once they made me laugh out loud while watching just because they did so well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is without doubt the strongest point of this anime. When you go around and watch like 200+ anime you start to recognize a lot of character patterns. Thus people, me including, tend to get bored of a cast pretty damn quick. That's exactly why Bakuman is so great. Every character is written with so much detail and uniqueness, I don't know if you cannot like them. Especially the kinda weird ones are pretty awesome. Most of the cast develops while the story progresses. Particularly the two male main characters and to a degree the female counterpart Azuki. They start off as somewhat naive lads with a dream, gaining fame and getting more important as the show goes on. I somehow found myself relating to them several times, thinking for some moments I was them, having a dream, want to make it a reality. I got pumped, wanted to do something. This is the kind of feeling I got while watching this anime. There are not that many anime outside who amazed me to that degree.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWell, this comes as no surprise. My enjoyment is the sum of all the aspects mentioned above. Thus I will not go into detail this time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI want to be honest. I am pretty biased towards this show. In my mind, it is one of the best anime I have ever watched. A masterpiece, if you want to call it that. In a time where Tsundere, Jiggle-Boob-Fanservice-Anime and other pathetic shows are on a run, it is quite rare to find a single ray of light like this one here. While there obviously will be people who will not like this show after watching it, I would at least ask you to give this one a chance. You won't regret it.",

Once I had seen most of the first season of Bakuman i was really into it and that was all I would watch because it made you want to know what happened next.\r\nOverall I extremely enjoyedBakuman and i think it should get more recognition.",

            "content": "If I had to describe this series in one word, it'd have to be ambition. It's something that's fairly prevalent in this kind of story, and gives you that nice inspirational feeling throughout the entire watch that makes you want to ask for more. Now, the premise for Bakuman is fairly simple: it's a humble artist who teams up with a classmate to write one of the greatest Shonen manga hits of all time, all while fighting the desire to meet with the girl he loves. Even with this fairly simple setup, this anime manages to not only be interesting, but also fun to watchbecause it doesn't just remain on the whole writing manga idea. You also get to see how the two MCs' relationships with other people change and differ over time, which adds some contrast and refreshes your mind. As for the characters, Nizuma Eiji has to be my favorite. His crazy eccentricity really makes it a worthwhile watch and grasps your interest. As for Aishirogi Muto (the MCs' nom de plume) the two aren't particularly attention grabbing characters but they're adequate. The show's music isn't the worst I've heard but it doesn't particularly stand out either. For the first season of a show I didn't expect to be much good at all, I found myself enjoying Bakuman a lot for the most part. It has its flaws, undoubtedly, but as Nobuhiro Mashiro said, \"All a manga really has to be is interesting.\"",

            "content": "This review is for the whole Bakuman Series. From Season 1 - 3 'cause why not?\r\nAt first, I had thoughts about watching Bakuman. I really thought it would be like Gekkan Shoujo or Mangaka to Assistant-kun which their main point is about Manga and Comedy. \r\nBut what makes Bakuman so special is their dedication to the certain plot, which is Manga. You'd see from other Manga-related anime that they do not give much attention to Manga, but this, it's just so different, not unique but very different.\r\nI thought it would be all gags and no seriousness. But I was wrong. You'd see from the mainprotagonist eyes, their dedication and perserverance.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode was worth it. Every episode felt so important that I think I'd lost a part of the show if I didn't watch it. It wasn't great just because of the manga, but because of the Romance which was so weak in communication yet so strong in the protagonist eyes. \\n\\n\r\nIt was so beautiful, how they tried to make their dreams come true before swearing forever to each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMashiro- He's the typical type boy in the anime community and I think resembles a lot to Okimura Rin from Blue Exorcist. But what makes him so great isn't his Appearance. It was his attitude and Personality towards manga and the girl he loves. I've never seen him goof off a day without drawing manga. His perseverance has drawn me into him.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi- There are times when I treat him as a much more Protagonist than Mashiro. I actually even wished he'd be Main-Main (?) (if that makes sense to you) in the Series. I really love Takagi's Character and devotion. He is the main reason why their manga is doing great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also great. Outstanding even. Every character serves a purpose and I love how they motivate Ashirogi Mutou to do more than they ever could. As they say \" It's written as friends but read as rivals \".\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal favorite character in this anime is actually Hiramaru. He's just so damn funny and he's personality fits with mine. I actually root for him and Aoki. ^__^\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat's a plus in this anime is the OP and ED both are wonderful.",

            "content": "I had been putting off this anime for a long time, simply because it did not seem like it would have interested me. Then after buying Hulu, I decided to binge the entire series because why not. It started off as simply something I had playing in the background on my second monitor while I played games but then it became a piece that I simply could not ignore at all. This show is amazing and is one of the few anime that I have seen that I can, without a doubt, feel good about giving a 10/10.\r\nLets start with characters 10/10:\r\nThere are 2 maincharacters and around 3 or so important supporting characters. However, every character goes through their own development as the story progresses, the supporting characters aren't just thrown in the mix to make the main characters seem better, no, the supporting characters actually mean something in this and I loved it. The characters are all kids, with the main starting the story in middle school, so as kids are, immaturity is present but as the show goes on you get to see them mature and grow, not just as people but also as manga creators which the creators of this show did such a good job at.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this show are well done and are easy to get behind, even the \"villain\" characters and unlikable characters grow and develop and aren't just used as pebbles thrown in the path, if you know what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis story is trippy in a sense but amazing. You're watching an anime based on a manga about people creating manga. I have no idea how creating a manga or an anime goes but even so, without that, if you told me that the process that the characters in this show go through is the real deal, I would believe you. The story of this show is incredible, it is well done and realistic. The main characters don't get their way every time and things aren't just handed to them; they are constantly having to work hard and produce results, and like life, they don't always succeed. But that is what makes this show so great in that aspect. With the ever encroaching approach of having main characters who have things constantly handed to them without effort, Bakuman is a refreshing glass of cold water to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to put in exact words how this story is, it's just so well done that you just want to constantly root for the main characters, support them, and you can feel what they are feeling and understand what they have to go through. Even some of the fake manga created is so good that you would wish it was real.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to combine art and sound in to one for this anime because to me, this anime is art. The animations and designs are beautiful, while some characters designs are pretty goofy such as one character having large perfectly circular lips, it does not subtract from the art of this show. The animators did such a good job, everything is so fluid from the movements of the eye to the pens drawing on paper. Even the art within the anime is good, for example, the art of the manga that appear in the show are some of the best art I have seen in manga, it's crazy. Though the characters designs are pretty basic in what you would see in (non-shounen) main characters, I would still give it an overall 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack, I can say that I did thoroughly enjoy each opening and ending of this show to the fullest. As one who is not big on the openings unless they really stand out like Tokyo Ghoul season 1, Cowboy Bebop, or Dororo (2019), I did not skip the openings of this show but rather let it play out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend watching this anime. It is one of the best ones I have seen. Even being a mostly action fan, this anime is, in my opinion, top tier. The characters and the story is amazing, the music will make you not want to skip, and the art is, for the most part, something to marvel at. I would recommend this series for binging.",

            "content": "I watch anime to see fascinating people do fascinating things. Normal, everyday stories don't entertain me as much. With that bias, I didn't expect to enjoy Bakuman as much as I have. I loved it, absolutely loved it.\r\nBakuman offers a perspective on manga, that as anime viewers or readers of the west, we rarely get a glimpse of, but that is not the selling point of Bakuman. What's truly at the heart of this story is the two main characters, young, charismatic and extremely hard-working individuals that want to accomplish their goal of becoming the best manga artists in Japan. \r\nBakuman's story is fast-paced, justlike the two main characters, it doesn't waste time diddle-dawdling on the unimportant stuff. The introduction of new characters and development of the old ones are timed perfectly so there's never an interruption to it's pacing. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is a character driven story, as if the characters had no motivation of their own to work then the story wouldn't go anywhere. So characters are extremely important and good news my friends, they are all likeable. The complete lack of archetypes in this series is extremely refreshing and all characters offer different perspectives on the manga business and what it means to never give up on the dream. They all have goals, they all have hurdles to over come, and they are all the type of people that would like to take to the cafe and have a glass of ouzo with. Maybe it's the anime I watch, but I'd like to see this type of character development more often.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both good, I don't really have much to say about that. The opening track isn't my kind of music, and I normally watch OPs but this time I just skipped ahead, same with the ED. The background tracks had nothing that stood out to me, but nothing seemed out of place or bad. Voice acting I can't really comment on since I haven't developed an ear yet for the nuances of the Japanese language. However, there was a lack of whiny high pitched female voices so that's a plus in my books. \\n\\n\r\nMy only concern for Bakuman is that it might go the same way as Death Note. The same author-artist team are responsible for both and I found the second half of Death Note extremely disappointing. At the time of me writing this, the second season is airing and the third season is on it's way, so hopefully it will stay as good as it is (no comment on the manga, I haven't read it).",

Please.\r\nI'll leave this review on a positive note by saying what I don't like first. The opening song feels so... old. Like a anime romance from before 1995. It's 2010. It's a good song, but it's just not right these days. It's a huge turnoff for first-timers, they won't see how good the story is!\r\nThe story is amazing because it's about growth, having dreams,reaching for your dreams, and dealing with shit that happens along the way. And hey, this is a show where the characters actually have a goal... not some \"hey watch this show, it's about the daily life of...\"\\n\\n\r\nI like when the show ends because of the ending song, it's just so full of positive energy. I say THAT song should be the opening.\\n\\n\r\nI have high hopes for this show.",

It follows the lives of two young boys, Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi, as they start their journey to become the best manga artists Japan (if not the world) has ever seen.\r\nMy summary might not do the show any justice, but it's onlydue to my fear of revealing any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing and so realistic. Only a slight difference when used for comedic effect (slapstick/ gag) but it's so well executed I doubt anyone would complain.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI loved all the songs used in the show, except the first OP (way too cheesy in my opinion). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with all the characters as none of them were annoying or boring. Though our leading men stole the show, it just wouldn't be as successful without the supporting cast. The respect and love the characters have for one another really is something to admire, especially how Mashiro and Takagi's \"rivals\" motivate the two to give each project they start their all.\\n\\n\r\nThe intensity I felt when watching these 75 episodes made me forget that I was watching an animated show and not some live action drama!\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend  this show to any fan of the slice of life genre. No, scratch that. I recommend this show to EVERY anime fan out there. If you're looking for a great story with likeable characters, you can't go wrong with this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I seriously had to fight myself to not give this series a 10. To be blunt: I fricking love Bakuman.\r\nFrom the creative team behind Death Note (Which I'll stop procrastinating and get to one of these days) comes this compelling tale of two crazy kids with a dream. Moritaka \"Saiko\" Mashiro, and Takagi, aka \"Shujin\" are two young boys who want to become famous manga artists. We quickly find out that they aren't BS-ing as they race toward achieving that dream. With reluctant-artist Mashiro drawing and offbeat student Takagi writing it, the two try to make it big, bonding and becoming close friends along theway.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the key factor behind this series' grandeur is how deep and realistic the characters are. Our two leads are both interesting and relatable in some way. Saiko's uncle had success as a mangaka, which inadvertently lead to his death, which leaves Saiko with the will to fulfill his dreams and also fear of failure. Shujin, on the other hand, is a high-grading student with the path of a normal life and career set out for him, but he has always had the secret dream of being a writer for the manga he loved so much. Their paths intertwine, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say this: The two put everything on the line and give it their all! They have such passion and drive that their pursuit is truly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is more than just an anime. It's a timeless story about chasing dreams and looking to the future. I felt completely invested with the characters through their ups and downs. The story is so realistic and chance-filled that there's no guessing what will happen next. It's not a fairy-tale where all dreams come true, it's real life, where all we can do is hope for the best.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at this I have to break my heart by being fair and bringing attention to the negatives of this series. First and foremost, the start is kind of just meh...If not for generally curiosity I wouldn't have watched past the first episode (Which would've been a huge mistake on my part). Secondly, some of the other characters are less effective the art/animation isn't always spectacular. And lastly, the theme song for the anime kind of sucks. I see what they were going for and why they chose that direction, but the song is just generally dull and not memorable at all. And this would be less annoying if it weren't for the fact that the show's soundtrack is filled with other songs that would've made a way better opening (including the ending).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this series should be seen by everyone who ever had a dream, or who ever wanted to go out and do something when the odds were against them. It'll have you laughing, crying, and dreaming on.",

            "content": "Bakuman is a very well balanced series that introduces powerful elements of romance, suspense, and comedy. It's an anim\u00e9 adaption of a manga about manga, written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata; the same dynamic duo that brought the world Death Note. Surprisingly, outside of its clever story telling elements, Bakuman is -nothing- like Death Note when you compare the two settings and characters. It just goes to show how amazing that these two mangaka are when it comes to variation. \r\nI think the story is wonderfully presented, the key to success for this series lies with the execution of the plot ratherthan the plot itself. It's well paced and has elements of everything. Not only will this series teach you a little about the manga industry, but it goes into great detail with a very strong and not quite as unique an idea as it is well presented under lining romance plot keeping the series going ahead. Aside from this, it also has the same elements of a non-mainstream 'battle' manga, in the form of authors competing against each other. It becomes really fired up as the two protagonists of this series work their fingers to the bone to come up with the best stories and characters they possibly can.\\n\\n\r\nQuite a fair few of the episodes leave an air of suspense, an excitement for the next episode. There's not so much of this in the first series since it's setting the scene for the next two seasons of the show, but it really does let you get to grips with the primary characters, that are easy to relate to, you can really emphasize with them. If that doesn't float your boat, there are loads of anim\u00e9 and manga references too, that're used in a serious context. \\n\\n\r\nI love the art for this series, the character designs are brilliant and bring back some of that Death Note nostalgia; you can really see some similarities when it comes to how expressive the characters are, or the weird ways in which some of the more eccentric cast move. I think the backgrounds are well designed and match the series perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nI think the OST for this series is good; fitting and at times astonishing when it comes to the wide range of situations that you'll see in this series, setting the tone for the suspenseful scenes, the dramatic scenes and the passionate scenes. Bakuman really knows how to nurture the nostalgia lobe of the brain with its good selection. I'm not sure what to think of the opening and ending for season one, the opening comes across as more romantic than anything else, which I didn't really like since the romance plot is only one part of the story. I wanted something a little more upbeat, a little less serious. \\n\\n\r\nOne other thing to comment on is the voice acting. When I read a manga first, I always wonder what the voices for the characters are going to be like in the anim\u00e9. I'm usually disappointed by the choices but I couldn't find a single thing to complain about in Bakuman. All of the voices match the characters perfectly, the cast is spectacular and none of them bore me to tears. They're so emotional and real; they give the characters a lot more personality. \\n\\n\r\nYou can always trust the writer of this series to know how to write characters with personality. Sure, there's the occasional one that pales in comparison to the rest but what you'll find in Bakuman is a cast of characters that you can actually care about. All of the authors are unique, some of them more eccentric than others, and the anim\u00e9 pays a close amount of attention to all of them. It's not just the authors either! The editors themselves slam their heads together, always trying to better themselves and their authors. There's so much tension between the editing department and the authors at times, it's enough to make you grind your teeth together.Just wonderful and excellent characterization. I admire how interesting is when this series throws together two completely contrasting characters, the dialogue is intense and the amount of serious humor is incredible. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a very enjoyable series with 'good' everything, good enough to make you enjoy the entire product to a very high degree. In all honesty, I preferred the manga for this series but the anim\u00e9 doesn't lose out on anything. I think it helps if you pace yourself while watching it, because the suspense in each chapter or episode really paid off a lot more back when it was being released chapter by chapter or episode by episode. It had a strong effect on me, and made me want to see the next part so much more. \\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest this to anyone who liked Death Note, even if it's not within the same genre. I wonder what these two will come out with next; I think anything they make will be decent. If there's one thing you can expect out of this series, it's consistency. \\n\\n",

            "content": "No, it isn't anything to do with the capital of Azerbaijan...\r\nI came into Bakuman. on the back of \"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun\", and I expected something similar - light comedy revolving around manga. Bakuman. isn't like that at all. Instead, it's an uplifting tale about the pursuit of ambitions and dreams, and compelling enough that you should be hooked from the first episode. If you read the synopsis and liked the idea, go and watch it now - you won't be disappointed.\r\nBakuman.'s story isn't ground-breaking, but it is extremely well executed. The relentless pacing of the anime is excellent in creating the idea of progress towardsthe character's goals, especially during the start of the show. The show isn't afraid to show the character's hardships either, which makes the successes ever sweeter, and hooks the viewer into the cycle of ups and downs that is making manga. Bakuman.'s story is a very, very enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story would be nothing without memorable characters to act it out, and Bakuman. has these in spades. The central duo, Mashiro and Takagi, are extremely likeable, with infectious enthusiasm and energy throughout, and although I can't say much without giving away some sort of plot detail, the show's supporting cast are equally brilliant. Bakuman.'s characters are possibly its greatest strength - you sympathise with them, and invest yourself in their various struggles. No matter what sort of character you identify with in anime, someone in Bakuman. is guaranteed to strike a chord.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are good enough. The OP, \"Blue Bird\" is catchy enough, and fits the mood down to the ground. Bakuman.'s music becomes familiar, and gets an almost pavlovian response once you've heard it enough. Art is consistent too, though I personally think that it improves in the later series. I'm not qualified enough to say whether it's a beautifully drawn masterpiece or just serviceable, but it looks good to me.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Bakuman. is a great anime. Its characters are well-written, its story is well-executed, and the fabulous pacing makes its message inspirational. Maybe it just struck a chord with me, but watching the characters sweat to make their dreams happen made me want to do the same - it really is that good. I pulled all-nighters to watch Bakuman., and I can't think of a better recommendation than that.\\n\\n",

It's no easy task, there's always a trial and error to attract readers.  I learned what mangakas go through before we, as readers, get to see their work.  It's a tough job! A name must be interesting first before it gets finalize in inking.\r\nIt's a slice-of-life anime, especially if you can relate to Mashiro and Takagi of being an aspiring mangaka.  You get to see thatit's possible to balance school work and striving for your dream.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, there are parts where you already expect what might happen but because of being curious of how these two go  through the challenges, you can't stop watching.

How their ideas sync together to make a name that will truly earn them being  serialized.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are also a few details what mangakas do, especially what tools they use which is interesting.

People who live in a fantasy world and has no issues in there life other than going to school, probably won't like this and it'll seem boring. But, the people who are living their lives, who have dreams, who works hard everyday to reach those dreams, can really appreciate this anime.\r\nStory: The plot of this anime is probably the most basic plot that an anime can have. Two high school teens trying to reach their dreams with a little romance in between. Seems pretty ordinary right? But it'snot! The complexity of the story and how detailed each part it, makes it seem real. While watching this anime, i starting thinking throughout that everything said in the anime was real. But the ability to take a simple story, and make it interesting is true ary.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was pretty basic, reminded me a lot like durarara!! The outfits, and color schemes were the best throughout. It's not like most animes where the character are always wearing the same thing, which is a nice variety. The best part about the art was the vividness. I hate when an anime has barely any contrast or colors. It was original art, with great colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was amazing, just by following along the story, everytime you here the theme song, it's like a blast of optimist-ism. Not great music, but great for the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are what truly drives the story. They are easily liked, and inspirational. All the characters in the show are amazing, i can't say there's one character that i hate. except mr. miura, but we haven't really met him in the anime, so maybe i might come to like him in the anime IDK.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: PERFECT, just what i need, especially going into college",

The only thing I didn't enjoy was the main characters' hard work and determination always resulting in failure up until the very end, when things finally came together for them. It was saddening as I watched through the show but at the end, looking back, it wasn't as bad as it seemed at that time. Once you reach the end everything is so climactic that most bad things from the past are forgotten. And I gotta say that when Miho finally gained the courage to callMashiro, at the end made me tear up a bit, and it takes a powerful anime to do that to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nSimple yet sweet, the art of Bakuman is nothing to write home about, but it is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nI really like the OP/EDs and themes. Not the best but good! Koji's song is by far my favorite though!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nThe characters of this show are a little weird to me. The relationship between Miho and Mashiro being the most strange. The way they are in love with each other but are too scared to talk to each other over a 2 year time span is crazy. Just something I cannot fathom, but maybe it's more of a Japanese thing. Overall though, the characters are very enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nJust sit back, relax, and have some snacks ready. I'd highly recommend watching this show in bulk because the faster you reach the end the more i think you'll enjoy the show. I didn't and I found it hard to get through for a while but around the end I just finally dug into it and loved it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nThis show will always be loved and remembered by me. I really hope this show paves the way for other similar animes in the future! It's a great show! Watch it!",

I know very much nothing about the world as manga as the only manga I've ever read was about this owl and his weird adventures in woodlands or some shit. ANYway, it explains stuff very clear, and it always left you wanting more!\r\nArt: Art is excellent. plus those manga scenes are delicious, like a giant freaking crepe thing that they sell and yet the Japanese are confused by American portionsof food. \\n\\n\r\nSound: first of all, a dude sing the theme song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: here's where it just makes me insanely mad. What's his name, saiko and his girlfriend yet not girlfriend are SO FUCKING ANNOYING LIKE WHO THE HELL WAITS FOR THEIR IMPOSSIBLE (YES, THEIR DREAMS ARE FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE) TO not just date, cuz they can't even talk to eachother cuz \"oh look at me, i'm shy and innocent and bashful and pure so that's \"KAWAII DESU\". We get it ANIME, you just LOOOOVVVEEE bashful types. But they're such losers in the love department. Is this why the Japanese youth are terrible at dating? ONCE A FUCKING AGAIN, anime proves it's TRASH at the core. But props for no annoying panty shots/ nude scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. besides Saiko's terrible dating instincts (that marriage would realistically go in the trash) it's by far one of the best mangas i mean animes i mean near homoerotic stories I've ever seen. I mean, I'd let Takagi bone me. And I'm not even into blondes!!! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: if you like bro stories with crappy romance arcs, but just amazing insight into the world of manga, then I'd advise it for your weirdly specific tastes. OR if you just like to see kids fresh out of middle school have amazing success which will subsequently make you consider committing seppukku cuz let's be real... you spend all your time watching this crap.\\n\\n\r\nme too bro,\\n\r\nme too\\n",

To make me care about their success as if it were my own.\r\nI can't speak for every anime or manga fan when I say this, but I know that I've always dreamed about drawing my own manga and writing my own anime. Bakuman has allowed me to live out at least a little of those dreams.\r\nDepicting the struggles, hardwork, and perseverance, that goes into creating manga. Bakuman is a fantastic, light hearted anime, about a couple of mangaka just trying to make their dreams a reality. Throughits colourful cast of characters, good artwork, and overall strong story, Bakuman truly succeeded at making me care about the success of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe main duo, do a good job of representing the youthful optimism of middleschoolers. These two had me very invested in their story, making me feel almost as many emotions as they did, throughout the highs and lows of their aspiring careers as mangaka. However what truly elevates this story for me, are the myriad of other interesting and fleshed out side characters, that our main duo interact with during their journey. These characters range from young mad geniuses overflowing with talent, to older artists who still have yet to lose their passion for chasing their dreams. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give some criticism to this anime (which I do, this is in fact the point of a review) it would be that, this story could have benefited from being slightly more serious. Despite our cheerful and determined main characters, the show actually started with a rather bleak outlook, one which I would have liked to see stay. Honestly, despite showing lots of the hardwork that mangaka really have to do to survive, let alone standout within their field. The show actually holds back on some of the more serious aspects of the industry. I know part of the decision is because of the young age of our main characters, but still I can't help but wish they had been made maybe a little older, so that we could see some of the darker parts of being a mangaka.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime an 8/10. A solid and engaging story from start to finish. It truly had me on the edge of my seat at times and laughing my ass off at others. I would recommend this anime to anyone looking for a little bit of motivation in their lives and those who would simply like some good fun.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you want more context for my scores out of 10, please visit my profile.",

            "content": "How anyone could give this anime above a 6 is beyond me. My review is primarily based upon the first season, as I have dropped it mid-way through season 2. I also have not read the manga.\r\nI don't write reviews often, but this is the first time I've felt so betrayed by the scoring this anime has gotten on MAL. Now, I wasn't expecting an action packed shounen. I read the description, and I thought it was a unique and original approach to the genre. Watching the adventures of two boys striving to become famous mangaka was, for me, both realistic and inspiring.\r\nNeedless to say,I was sorely disappointed in the execution of the story. The pacing was agonizing slow, and there seemed to be no real progression. Although I understand shounen requires buildup, this was atrocious. It was nauseating to have to sit through each episode, hoping that the next would be better. I kept telling myself to just wait it out... just wait it out.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I understand the characters endeavors contain setbacks, they were very linear. There were no suggestions for an alternative route (really, you can't think of any other place or company to start other than Shonen Jump?). There was nothing refreshing after their failures... you just grit your teeth as they try the same thing again. Bring in a school event, or take them to an art exhibit in Tokyo... ANY change of scenery for pete's sake.\\n\\n\r\n If there was anything worse than the story execution, it was the character dynamics. The main character is an unappealing narcissist with literally no redeeming qualities. Luckily Takagi and Miyoshi provide something light and refreshing with their quirky natures. Miho makes me want to jab my eyes out with how two-dimensional she is as the main characters love interest. How is this anime fit to be called a romance, when there's more romance between the side characters than the main one.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the art was mediocre for its age, and the animation was far from amazing. The sound and music isn't anything significant to make notice, as it leaves little to no impression on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nI have never been so disappointed about a shounen/romance anime with a rating above 8 before.

            "content": "Bakuman is overall one of the most well-rounded best anime i've ever seen. Throughout the anime we see Mashiro and Takagi go through the trials of becoming mangaka. Mashiro being the illustrator of their manga while Takagi the author. In my opinion, Mashiro comes off as the imperfect/shy protagonist while his counterpart Takagi becomes the genius/handsome one. From season 1 to season 3 we see Mashiro work towards a dream he and Miho Azuki made in middle school that one day Miho would voice in one of Mashiro's anime, then get married. Also coincidentally, Mashiro's late uncle Nobuhiro was a \"gambling\" mangaka with the exactsame dream as Mashiro with Miho's mother.\\n\\n\r\nIt is honestly hard for me to point out the cons of this anime.. but here you go. The only time I was not completely interested in this anime while watching it was during the beginning/middle of season 3. During this time the story felt slightly stale in my opinion. I believe the reason for this was the story became far less focused on Miho as she slowly drifts away until towards the end of the anime. While she was away the story felt 100% focused on their creation of manga and became slightly repetitive. This being the only reason I had not to rate this a 10/10 and come to a conclusion that I found the perfect anime.\\n\\n\r\nI fully recommend this anime for everyone to watch! Also, I would like to say that Takeshi and Tsugumi are two genius mf's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating 9/10",

First off i will give a small synopsis and then go into how important this show really means too the anime/ manga community. Bakuman is a story of two school boys who both have dreams to have a successful manga to be serialized in Jack.So both come together to form a team with  Moritaka Mashiro being the artist and Akito Takagi being the author. The two also have there own goals with the main one being an anime adaptation of there manga so Moritaka can Mary his love interest Azuki who wants to be apopular voice actor. The story follows Mashiro's and Akito struggles and successes right from them being in middle school until they are adults. With comedy, romance and a feel good story, Bakuman will be all that you can watch. I highly rate this show especially to Veteran anime watchers. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I highly regard Bakuman is that it gives an in depth look at how difficult the lives of manga authors and artists are. I think Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata who wrote and illustrated Bakuman provide an in depth look behind the difficulties of Manga artists/authors, demonstrating how its not a job but a love or obsession. To be honest the manga and anime are both superb to create feelings for the character and actually want to cheer you on. With new characters and rivals being introduced this will always be a unique and sensational anime.",

            "content": "An anime about making manga, with all the gamble, dreams and effort that goes into it, this is Bakuman.\r\nBakuman is definitely one of the earliest \"working anime\" anime LA heard of before Shirobako for anime about anime and Sora ga Seiyuu! for anime about voice acting. Bakuman is about the struggles and dreams of Akito Takagi voiced by Satoshi Hino and Moritaka Mashiro voiced by Atsushi Abe wanting to become mangaka, more specifically Shounen Jump ohh LA means Shounen Jack. They face and work with their rivals, strict editorials \"missions\" and deadlines, hard work into their manga's as well as the process of even makingdifferent kinds of manga in the process. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Takagi's dream is just to be a mangaka  (more on the writers side of things) by working together with Mashiro and getting rich with it, Mashiro (the illustrator) has another goal of wanting a manga to be serialized as a promise for him and his love interest Miho Azuki voiced by Saori Hayami to be the lead heroine and then get married after. Sure it adds in the romance element into this anime but it works for a huge degree for Mashiro's ambitions to be the best in Shounen Jack and his goal striving for him to do be number 1#.\\n\\n\r\nNow you'd think this anime is nothing but the intricacies of making manga, how Shounen Jack handles their manga and whatnot and it does but it also greatly develop their core cast and rivals as well. Some of the biggest surprises for LA for characters would go to Takagi and Kaya Miyoshi voiced by Sayuri Yahagi as they actually get together quite early on and with Kaya wanting to full out support Takagi and Mashiro venture into the strict and volatile world of shounen manga (this and because Kaya is best friends with Miho). Next would be Takagi and Mashiro's rivals more specifically Eijii Nizuma voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto and Shinta Fukuda voiced by Junichi Sawabe. Eijii for being Takagi and Mashiro's primary rival in the early episodes as Eijii is a genius yet hyperactively unfocused mangaka but becoming a sorta frienemy mentor to them later on and Takagi and Mashiro striving to be better than Eijii. Fukuda is more in line the actual rival to Takagi and Mashiro as he's alot more serious in wanting to be serialized like Takagi and Mashiro's goal for this season. Really in essences this anime season really doesn't have the typical rival scthick where the rival is the \"bad guy\" while making Takagi and Mashiro look better, each of their rivals had their quirks and styles of manga even making their rivals have more than the one dimensional personality of a rival making them to be memorable in a ways (well the exception is Koogy voiced by Shoutarou Morikubo but he never directly confronted Takagi and Mashiro in saying their his rival or his ethnics in making manga was the wrong way to do it etc.) \\n\\n\r\nThe other surprising notion is that both of Takagi and Mashiro's respective love interests aren't just one-dimensional cheerleaders. Again there's Kaya and how she supports their ventures into manga but she has personality outside being one of their cheerleader for them (by that, she your typical brutish tsundere but definitely more on the dere side and her even wanting to be a writer like Takagi) and even sometimes causes rifts between Takagi and Mashiro through Takagi wanting to take his relationship with Kaya more seriously while not concentrating on manga. Miho on the other hand, although in this season she's IS a sideline cheerleader love interest for Mashiro, Miho has her own ambitions of being a voice actor so she can be the lead heroine of Mashiro's serialized manga turn anime and she too faces adversity and fears by being an \"amateur voice actor\" albeit not in great detail to Mashiro's journey to be serialized.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, LA would like to point out that even the editors of Shounen Jack develops along with their respective mangaka but the best focused ones goes to Takagi and Mashiro's editor Akira Hattori and Yuujirou Hattori, Eijii Nizuma and Shinta Fukuda's editor and Hisashi Sasaki voiced by Kenyuu Horiuchi the Editor-in-Chief of Shounen Jack gets some focus (mainly business-supportive-wise NOT personally of course). What else can LA say but the obvious for Bakuman, character development is excellently done even for this HUGE cast of mangaka's, editors, love interests and rivals of the sort get the subtle detail treatment and LA loves it!.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by JC Staff is greatly done in almost every front, from the slick character designs to the manga's that many of the mangaka's gives out are in superb quality, better yet are many of the scenes where people are reading the manga (and voice acted out in people's heads) and the manga is shown to great detail as well. JC Staff really outdid themselves with the animation and manga aesthetics with this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice work was also pretty great with no grating annoying voices in sight. Highlights would go to Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino of course, but the craziest voice actor easily goes to Nobuhiko Okamoto doing an almost 24/7 \"Awakened Level 5 Accelerator\" vocals on Eijii Nizuma...just JESUS Nobuhiko go all out with this one. However LA's favourite voice actors would go to Sayuri Yahagi as Kaya...because of her deredere vocals being amazing alright..simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nOk, LA didn't find many faults with Bakuman but just one little thing that kinda dumbfounded LA about Bakuman would be why Shounen Jump was changed to Shounen Jack, because here's the thing, Bakuman namedrops ALOT of manga from Shounen Jump, from Naruto, Bleach to One Piece and they even have manga covers showing them yet Jump changed to Jack?, was it because JC couldn't get the \"license\" to have Jump namedropped but their titles instead or that Jump just didn't want unblazened advertising in an anime because that would be unfair advertising for other manga magazines?, which doesn't makes sense due to Shounen Jump's titles being referenced alot but not Jump itself?...LA doesn't know WHY but still irked LA they changed it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if there is one little fault LA could see and this is entirely LA's perspective and that is Mashiro and Miho's long distance relationship as it were. LA already defended this relationship as Miho and Mashiro both have their own ambitions that leads into their dream, however besides the two being the cheerleaders on both sides, their interactions largely consisted of being twice shy and only rarely opening up to each other but being supportive nonetheless. LA isn't saying this relationship is horrible or anything and LA is sure this relationship would develop further from this in the next season but you can see why LA kinda already favoured Kaya and Takagi more due to their fast process and taking it further than most anime romances do even for a beta couple.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is the gamble of the imagination taken real form, of dreams coming true be for the riches or the glory of being serialized. Bakuman is by all means a GREAT anime about looking at the inner workings of the manga industry and it's mangaka's and with fully fleshed out characters, a concentrated focused plot from both it's shounen and romantic aspects and intensity and anticipation of many of the competitions of the best manga being serialized. LA just can't wait to watch the second season!.",

I am also impressed that the manga-kas could transition so smoothly from Death Note to Bakuman. That in itself warranted a decent review. But even without my preconceptions of Ohba and Obata, the story is fantastic. It seems to really draw you into the world of manga and gets down to the brass tax of it. No illusions; no misconceptions. The characters are likable and developed. Throughout the anime (and manga) there's only one thing that bugs me. It'shard to be clear without spoiling it, so I'll only say that something Azuki said seems a bit drastic/unrealistic.  But then again, manga has never been well known for being realistic, right? \\n\r\nOtherwise, the concept is unique and well-orchestrated.",

For, high students(like me), this anime is interesting because it shows how the young people find and choose their future. \r\nIn this anime also shows the young spirit for reaching their dream. Shows that all possible if everyone works hard. They keep drawing a name while they have a high daily activities in their school. High optimism also in this anime, how their face expression after sending a nameto editor. From this anime, I also learn how the process in publishing a manga. It was not simple and the people that involve in this activity have high pressure but normally that is not a problem because they're happy to do that. I conclude that from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAshirogi muto shows how to reach the dream and they thought that they're stupid because they're following their dream to became mangaka.Because became mangaka is a gambler. But, it was the smartest way to follow the dream, I think. I feel I have a motivation after watching it. So, doing everything that you like.

Because if one doesn't pursuit it they won't know that they are good at it and everyone would be the same. So everyone follow your dream and see where it takes you- \r\nBakuman is written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, the same creative teamresponsible for the popular anime/manga Death Note.(Similar character designs-- Mashiro--L, and Takagi--Light Yagami)\\n\r\nBakuman is a shonen anime about creating a first rate manga and someday turning that manga into an anime series. With the added bonus of Slice of life and romcance.  This anime teaches you how a manga artist goes through in life into creating a manga. Our story revolves around  Mashiro and Takagi who team up together to pursue their dream of creating a manga series that will rival popular manga like Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragonball and Hunter X Hunter. They hope to one day  to serialize it and turn it into an anime. But they have a rival Nizuma Eiji who is a manga prodigy and creating new manga left and right.  Mashiro and Takagi goal is to beat Nizuma  Eiji and be number one in Mainstream manga.

Meeting certain deadlines or risking getting cancelled!!!  Creating a manga takes months and needs a lot of time and effort.  Manga artist aren't known yet until they publish their first manga. Like with Mashiro and Takagi- their manga needs to critiqued and if needed make any necessary changes to make it better. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most addicting/inspirational  anime I have ever seen.

This leads to there being a large number of characters that are well developed and you become very emotionally invested in.\r\nThe art is adequate, but there is nothing particularly breathtaking about it. This doesn't take away from the story at all, and in fact may be a boon because it does not distract the viewer from the story.\r\nThe mood and emotional aspect of the anime is not only appropriate, but also exceptionally balanced.It isn't a simple tragedy or comedy, and the ups and downs don't feel out of place. Again this is a boon because even though you will feel for the characters, it won't end up putting off or cause the story to lose focus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is an enjoyable series that is really a complete package. \\n\r\nIn terms of priority for viewing the priority should not be very high unless you wish to get a view into the lives of manga authors.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I definitely recommend that everyone who reads manga or watches anime watches this or reads the manga. It allows you to appreciate just how much work goes into what we often give barely any heed, the fact that the authors also have to make a living.",

            "content": "This anime is probably one of the best I have seen in a while.  I can honestly say that it's the first anime that I have seen in a really long time that has kept me so addicted and enticed.\r\nThis anime is good for every anime and manga fan in several ways.  The first reason being that it's really educational.  We see a lot of fans bashing mangaka and not giving them as much of their appreciation as much as they should.  In watching just the first season, I have learned so much manga and the trials that mangaka go through.There are things I would have probably never learned if I didn't watch Bakuman.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Bakuman has made me appreciate manga and anime more than ever did before, and it also makes me appreciate the mangaka more.  I have learned through Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi that mangaka really do work hard and that they deserve more than what the settle for and receive from their fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is well done, and coming from Ohba Sensei, who did a poor portrayal of females in Death Note, even the females were written well!  I don't particularly dislike any character because I think they all have something special to offer to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is well-written, although it's often slow at times.  However, there are simple and delicate scenes that are going to boil your blood with excitement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to everyone who is curious about learning more about the manga and anime world.  It's definitely one of my favorite anime, and everything about it was simply exquisite.",

Also, the material became quite repetitive closing on the 2nd season.  I found the fact that more than a handful of characters within this anime seem to close one eye frequently.  Now if it was a characteristic of the MC or was reserved forthe MC it wouldnt be so bad , but the fact so many characters do it , drove me insane.  It truly was a stupid quality about the anime . Finally, I only watched it all the way through because of the romance, the content outside of the romance was good by all means , but I would of dropped it otherwise. PS: i disliked the ignorance of the MC by leaps and bounds, because it was too cliche; I didnt count it against the anime though considering the rest of the characters make up for it by leaps and bounds.",

Both are first rate, although the pace of the manga strikes me as slower than that of the the anime.  I've watch the available anime episodes several times and read the manga two or three times.  I think this is going to turn out to be one of my favorites.  The slow pace doesn't bother me much as it seems entirely appropriate to the story and characters.  The internal interaction of the artist/writer team is believable and Kaya is a greatinfluence on the team.  Miho is perfect as the embodiment of the \"dream\" ideal which drives Ashirogi Muto.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has followed the manga very closely (some deviations are to be expected).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this has a long way to go (glad to see a 2nd season has been approved) I expect to follow it all the way.  There is something to be said for slow, careful character development and this work (IMHO) proves that it is worth doing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a first-class work, and although it may disappoint those who prefer a much faster pace, I hope the producers/authors maintain their careful development of this story.  \\n\\n\r\nLong term, I strongly expect this will become a classic!",

            "content": "While the anime is still fresh on my mind, I think this is the perfect time to create a review out of it.\r\n\"Never judge an anime without watching it first.\" - I guess this is the lesson that slapped me hard on my cynical face after I marathon-ed all three seasons of Bakuman in five days. (Yes, it seems like my \"no life\" status as a social being is nearing the permanent mark).\r\nI've heard this anime many times over, but I was hesitant to watch it. I dunno, the story just wasn't interesting at first glance, I guess. I was not entirely interested in theprocess of manga-making before (and for some strange reason, I was living under a rock for years because I was not aware that the same duo that created the masterpiece that is \"Death Note\" was the mastermind of this yet another masterpiece. Stupid.).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, now that I got to dive to this anime masterpiece, which introduced to me whirlwind of emotions, I'm having a hard time, yet again, to find an anime of this caliber.\\n\\n\r\nThat makes me sad and glad all at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, let me break down my subjective review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\n\"YES!\" Echoes me a few days ago when I finally absorbed the first three critical minutes of Bakuman. And I say \"critical\", because the make or break of an anime for me is the first three minutes. I could then gauge how much I would enjoy it. And enjoy it, I did.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is a coming-of-age anime that lets you experience growth, struggle, hardship, friends and conflicts that life throws at you in a chase to reach for your dreams. Though the romance part was a bit over-the-top for me (even though I'm a huge sucker for romance - blame my gender!), everything else in the anime worked well to a highly intensive degree. And my little qualms about the romance were easily discarded on the last season because the characters more than made up for them (couldn't really explain it to people who hadn't watched it yet). Let's just say that the characters were strong enough that the ridiculous improbability of the romance was justified at the end. (Why was I focusing on the romance when all the other parts of the story were ingeniously made?)\\n\\n\r\nThe execution of scenes, the cliffhangers, and how there were no unnecessary scenes were excellently crafted. \\n\\n\r\nJUST. WONDERFUL.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, for people who hadn't watched it yet (and who lives under a rock, like me), my advice is to...\\n\\n\r\nJUST WATCH IT!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nNOW!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING? STOP STARING AT THIS REVIEW! JUST GO WATCH IT, STUPID!\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry about  the \"stupid\". I don't mean it.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nSo, you stayed to read the other parts of this review? Don't blame me if all I'll do is to gush on the masterpiece caliber of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nTonikaku (Anyway...)\\n\\n\r\nSo I chose 9 for art. Why is that, you ask?\\n\\n\r\nI'm assuming you've all seen Death Note (who doesn't?), and you know by now how wonderful the art for that one was. So why not ten for this? I guess because, even though this is an anime about making manga, nothing stands out on the characters' designs. But it more than makes up for the \"mangas\" the main characters were creating - the art for those were superb.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I just gave 9 so as to leave 1 point room for improvement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nPerfect for every scenes. Can't say much, but the songs used for the \"mangas\" and \"animes\" featured in the show were very-well suited to their respective genres.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nHard working characters doing all that they could to reach for their dreams. Their visions and values are above the norm, and outstanding execution of their growths. They simply grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nThe friendly competitions, and sticking to their solid values are a joy to behold. You wouldn't hate ANYONE in this anime. (Maybe except for Iwase...)\\n\\n\r\nAnd who wouldn't dote on Eiji, right? *Crow! Roger!*\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to criticize just one thing, it will be how the female characters were portrayed. (The females in this story are not really how we are, y'know?) Seems like the anime does not get that we are not that stubborn, or cold, or weak (yes, I am referring to Aoki at the first parts, and to Iwase ... even at the end).\\n\\n\r\nI dunno... I just feel that the author don't get us girls. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, aside from the anime's slight prejudice to the female gender, the overall characterizations were flawless. There were no stereotype characters, and each one them a different, tasty flavor.\\n\\n\r\nAshirogi Muto (Azuki, MaSHIro, TakaGI Reaching Dreams) is a penname that will resonate for me in ages.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is an obvious score, considering all my gushing above.\\n\r\n(Love is a strong word, but for this anime, I'd say... I FREAKING LOVE IT TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE!!!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nPlease help me. I can't find anime at par with this. *sniffs*",

NO! it's has its ups and downs. \r\nNo spoilers! I really enjoyed it and I might be just writing randomly but it's just so awesome! Well, of course not everyone has the same taste.\r\nThis anime revolves mainly about sort of slice of life. There is romance, comedy, suspense, mystery. But it's mostly about two young (15 at the start) guys who decided to group together and become mangakas. Tobe honest, it was my first time hearing about mangakas. I never paid attention to all the names for fighting/battle kind of anime or romantic animes, etc. But here, man, I learned a lot hahaha \\n\\n\r\nGive it a try. Watch at least the first 5 episodes (plus 20 more) :3\\n\\n\r\nYeah, the art might be a bit old, it's been a couple of years since it aired but it's not that bad. The story, characters are really good! \\n\r\nSince it's not mainly based around comedy, when the time comes, you'll ROFL xD (or however you write it :S )\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoyed it from beginning to end and loved sawaka-san's conversation with the teacher xD hahahahaah ( you'll get it by the middle of the anime )",

After watching the 3 seasons and all 75 episodes (no regret), I have continuously been inspired by this anime and so have my friends.\r\nI love the story, it is very simplistic and easy to understand. At the start of the anime, Mashiro Moritaka (Saiko) promises Miho Azuki that they will marry if Mashiro manages to get an anime adaptation with the help of Akito Takagi.\r\nThis show perfectly explains the ups and downs of life and how ifyou do not move on, you won't get anywhere.\\n\r\nThere are some laughable gags here and there (that make up the comedy tag) and there are also serious scenes about friendship and being heart-broken. [9]\\n\\n\r\n I didn't mind the art, it followed the original source's art style closely (unlike Death Note, sorta). I don't have much to say about it but it fit well with the anime. [7]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great and it had suitable music and OSTs for specific scenes. It fit well. [7]\\n\\n\r\nOh, characters! This anime had a wide range of personalities, like being hardworking or lazy, or being enthusiastic to the max! I couldn't bring myself to hate any character at all as all of their personalities fit well with the storyline and charactern designs.

            "content": "Close your eyes and imagine i'm sliding my han....Oops sorry,my bad lads wrong script..I meant close your eyes and imagine for a second that the creators of Death Note met once again and decided to collaborate on an anime called Bakuman with a . at the end for some reason..\r\n\"Aha\",you might say,\"why should i bother,it will be the same shit all over again\"...And that's exactly what i thought at first..And i couldn't be more wrong,which incidentaly has never happened since 1985 or so..\r\nNo,as it happens they are also capable of mashing our brains with other kind of stories as well and this anime is theliving proof for it.And surprises keep on coming if you stop and think that Bakuman is an anime adaptation of a manga about a duo whose goal is to make a manga with the aim of eventually getting an anime adaptation..How freakin' nuts is that?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story?Well it's the story of Mashiro Moritaka who after his beloved uncle's death-who was also a mangaka-was left in a dark place,battling with crippling depression and no cares for his future even though he is a brilliant artist.What he does instead is spending his time fantasizing about Azuki Miho,a girl he has a visible crush on and not only that..He also paints some pics of her and that to be honest is kinda creepy..One fateful day,he forgets a notebook containing his drawings of her in class and when he goes back to get it he sees Takagi Akito,his classmate and the top student in the school,waiting for him holding his notebook.Takagi agrees to keep Mashiro\u2019s secret,on the condition that they'll team up and make a manga..Pretty straightforward and almost down to earth if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see the connection with Death Note is just in names only cause the whole concept is totally different,it's more lighthearted.This is-in my mind-an anime targetted mostly for those who read manga,and more specifically Shounen Jump where Bakuman was actually first serialised.In the anime itself it's being referenced as \"Jack\" and it's a weekly publication in Japan with a variety of manga including Naruto,One Piece and Bleach among many other titles.Having your work portrayed in a magazine of this caliber then is a big deal.And one thing that stood out to me was that many of those anime where also making an appearance here which struck me as a bit of an advertisment exercise.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that stood out to me in a very bad way was the romance part of Bakuman.Who in their right mind goes to his crush's house to tell her that if they achieve their dreams they'll get married..No previous interactions involved that would excuse such a remark..And get that...She responded in a positive way..Which ultimately means that either there are people out there crazy enough to go through the ordeal of marriage cause reasons or that the writers were being idiotic on purpose..That there for me was one of the very first shortcomings and one that came close to ruining a big chunk of my interaction with the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing was the main duo's hierarchy and character traits.Mashiro and Takagi have a good chemistry between them but individually they\u2019re not the most likable of personalities and this is more evident with Mashiro whose competitiveness comes close to becoming obssesive taking people down with him.Takagi is a much more likable character,but for some reason the writers thought it would be good?! for him to take back seat even though he was the one to lead the charge in the first place...As for the female counterparts,Azuki is very much underused-for lack of better words-and i can't help but think that she plays more a plot point rather than an actual,you know,character...Like she should be.I can scarcely recall her being on screen to be honest.As for Miyoshi?Think of her as the classic case of tomboy with explosive anger issues(not really,she just kicks and punches Takagi sometimes)who has no idea what she's going to do with her life and ends up serving coffee to the main duo while they're working on their mangas..And i hate to keep coming back to this but the \"romance\" thingy between Azuki and Mashiro was unbelievably idiotic..As down to earth romances go this far surpasses in ridiculousness the ones seen in Kanon...And most of you here know just how much i hated that crap.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main antagonist..Let's say he's a genius type of teenager who makes otakus' penises run wild while aiming for the same publication spot as our duo at the same time..Apart from that...How can i put this in a gentle manner...HE IS A FUCKING RETARD.Every single time he hits the screen he does so with animal screams..And i don't mean once or twice,that would be tolerable to some extent...But no,this fuck does it A-L-L T-H-E F-U-C-K-I-N-G T-I-M-E.\\n\\n\r\nNow that doesn't say much about the story as a whole cause everything else is pretty much great..And i do mean great.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact Bakuman does its' best when it's going for the story it was supposed to in the first place..The makings of manga.From making the manga itself to the innards of manga industry and i have to say that i was glued to my screen each and every moment because i could somehow relate to these guys and their struggles.Bakuman is by no means,shape or form a bad anime..It's just that it could be much much better and that's a pity if you ask me.Ok i wasn't expecting Shirobako levels of achievement but there were some glaring issues that held it back.\\n\\n\r\nGoing to VA's and animation as well as music themes...All very very good.The animation and the music feel a bit old but that has to do with the writers intent of making this feel a bit old school and know what?It freakin' works like a charm and the VA's are there to make the experience even better with their delivery.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up Bakuman is great as an anime.Sure it could be wayyyyyyyy much better in terms of characters as they seem to lack common sense and in many cases emotion.Like i said it's no Shirobako and i didn't expect one to be honest.There are 2 more seasons ahead so i hope they fixed those issues.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely reccomend it",

            "content": "All of the characters in Bakuman are cardboards, and there isn\u2019t any depth to visuals either.  But, the story is as subversive as you are going to get in anime with a premise like this out there.  It just simply energizes its clich\u00e9-infested writing and one-dimensional characters via unpredictable arcs that continue throughout the three seasons.  Yes, the show abounds with cringy movements, most of the drama is forced, and conflicts often play themselves out in a predictable way. Yet, before all of this saps the interest of percipient, it steers the story into an altogether interesting turn and you are hard-pressedto not to continue this totally shallow-but-fun-&-ridiculous & crazy & fun-ride.  In other words,  Bakuman, as a work of pop-culture, that revolves around the mania surrounding an aspect of sub-pop-culture( i.e. manga), has all of the best machinations of its ilk that go into the manipulating the interest of gullible audience and not so gullible ones, who  nevertheless stick with it,  because the shit is totally theirs to embrace, for all of the nuggets of satisfaction that one achieves after having wasted the precious time of their schedule, which would have been otherwise far better pad off, had they the time, dedication, and above all, intellect, to engage with its infinitely better counterpart \u2013 film!  But who can blame them, eh? I mean one can skip half of the story in Bakuman, and still get a kick out of it. It\u2019s THAT amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe lead pair is, basically, so sentimentally twisted in their genericism that you\u2019d get these homoerotic creeps out of the banality they spew out to one another.  And one doesn\u2019t even bother to raise an eyebrow for all the demonstrably contrived but oh-so-crucial moments that outline their friendship as a bond too indefatigable yet subject to the flaws of their individual person, except that the minutiae of realism portrayed here is handled so sloppily that any credence accorded to those moments is lost.  But this assessment literally becomes a joke when you are egotistical & ignorant enough to love these characters and love to see them going through the tribes and tribulations which will end with them to be finally licking the chalices of popularity, which supposedly corresponds to their artistic merit \u2013 one of the basic posits of this show, and the ultimate goal of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why Bakuman is a quintessential pop-culture propaganda. \\n",

            "content": "Made by the same creators of the Death Note Manga/Anime franchise, Bakuman is a great way for people how to learn to make their very own Manga: stories, drawings, characters, you name it.\r\nBakuman reveals the process of how a weekly Manga series is made and how it becomes an Anime, it reveals how popularity is key to both Manga and Anime alike in a Weekly Shonen Jump (renamed Jack in the series) magazine format.\r\nThe story is about hard work, determination, guts, luck and taking gambles on said luck, it is also the story of keeping promises till the very end, now even though it maynot be possible in real life to always keep a promise, Bakuman can nevertheless be inspiring in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is the story of four individuals, two couples, as they take a journey through the worlds of both Manga and Anime creating respectively, two young men who dream of one day surpassing Mangaka authors in terms of quality and heart added to their stories, namely for examples Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball, Eiichiro Oda of One Piece, Masashi Kishimoto of Naruto, Tite Kubo of Bleach and so on, so forth.\\n\\n\r\nThese two young men's names are Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi and together they make up the Mangaka duo Muto Ashirogi with Moritaka serving, as the drawer of their Manga and Akito serving, as the writer of their stories.\\n\\n\r\nWhether by chance or fate, Moritaka meets Akito and because of certain circumstances, they decide to team up with one another and form Muto Ashirogi which they use, as their pen name to refer to themselves together, separately they go by the pen names Saiko for Moritaka and Shujin for Akito respectively.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough they are both the main protagonists, the story focuses more on Saiko and sees both things and life in general from his point of view, he has always wanted to be a Mangaka author and follow in the footsteps of his role model, now teaming up with Shujin, Saiko has a chance to make it big in the Manga world and prove that both he and Shujin have what it takes to surpass even the professionals.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, they are not the only ones gunning for the top seats and ranks of the Manga world, as they face off against other friendly rival Mangaka authors, namely in particular their peer one year older then them named Eiji Niizuma who already at his age is considered the youngest genius there is in terms of Manga creativity, his skill is rival to none, of which inspires both Muto Ashirogi and all other rivalries to try and surpass Niizuma, to prove that they are not just saying they're aiming for the top spot but that they are actually going to do it, come hell or high water.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the goal of surpassing Niizuma and all others, Saiko has a personal stake in why he draws Manga and why he is determined to reach the number one rank of greatest created published Manga of all time ever, he is determined to win both the heart and love of a childhood sweetheart of his named Miho Azuki who reciprocates Mashiro's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Miho wanted to prove to both herself and Saiko that to prove their love is genuine and special, because Saiko has always wanted to be a Mangaka author and Miho has always wanted to be a Anime Seiyu voice actress, Miho has Saiko promise her that they will not become a couple until they have both obtained their dreams and goals for the future, to ensure the promising of one another to each other.\\n\\n\r\nKind of beating around the bush yet at the very same time being pushed right up against it, know what i mean? even so, despite this roundabout way of doing things just to prove each other's love for one another, you could say from one perspective that its a cute way of looking at romance, if i'm not doing good job explaining about the two's way of romance, forgive me, the best way to better clarify what i'm trying to say is by seeing Bakuman and watching for yourself, to judge and see what you make of the whole idea of the promise and what's behind it.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, Muto Ashirogi shows extreme dedication and research to their work on Manga whilst trying to create their very own and get it published in the most popular of weekly Manga magazines, they persevere through trial and error time and time again, never stopping and never once giving up on their aspirations both towards and for the future.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Saiko and Miho's romance is romance also budding on Shujin's side, as Miho's best friend named Kaya Miyoshi falls in love with him, thus bringing the story of four individuals, two couples full circle.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall all deserve praise and whilst Bakuman may not rank highly, as its predecessor counterpart series Death Note, in honest opinion, i say that Bakuman stands, as a series all on its own, its has a warm heart and charm and might, not 100% guaranteed but might make you have warm fuzzy feelings towards the romance featured in the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut lastly back to the core of Bakuman, its creativity in telling a series about how people draw Manga and how Anime follows soon afterwards...Bakuman is a great way of researching Manga creative study processes whilst catching a few laughs in the process too, it will teach up and coming Mangaka authors the basics in the makings of potential great Manga series, either published by magazine or solely published by one person or a team alone on the internet, a good example being for the latter case the Mangaka author ONE who created One Punch Man but that will be saved for that series' Review later on.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate, i hope my Review was helpful and sorry about it being longer then most of the Reviews i make, i also hope that it will help serve in any way possible to inspire potential new Mangaka authors right around the corner.",

            "content": "!This review contains very minor spoilers!\r\nA really realistic anime and one that all of us can take away from, Bakuman tells the story of two shounen who aim to become mangakas in the competitive world of manga.\r\nStory: 7\r\nBakuman's story is super slowly paced throughout the entire anime, but that is a part of what makes it so realistic. The two boys fail again and again, but they learn from each failure and come back better than before. \r\nIt takes a really long time for them to finally get somewhere, but boy is it satisfying to see when they do get there! The story is continuedin the following seasons, so I would recommend watching the sequels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAll the characters get great development throughout the series! \\n\\n\r\nAt the start, Mashiro is a confidence-lacking artist who wants to become a mangaka but is too afraid for a reason (that is kind of a spoiler!!). Takagi, the other main character, gives Mashiro the confidence he needs to start working towards their dreams. \\n\r\nBy the end of the anime, we have two strong characters that have come a long way from the start, but still acknowledging room for improvement and the next leg of their journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are not neglected and also make up an important part of the anime. I'm going to give a shoutout to some of my favorite side characters: Niizuma, Hattori, Fukuda, and Miyoshi!\\n\\n\r\nSeeing the boys progress and grow really inspired me to not give up on my own dreams, and to learn from my failures and how to better myself from them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nThe animation isn't really my preferred style of anime art, but it is good and makes the anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nBakuman's OP/ED/soundtracks weren't particularlly memorable, but they did add help add the right emotions to some scenes. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was great! Niizuma's voice acting was the one that stood out to me and my favorite!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nSince the story was pretty slow through the entire anime, I did get a bit bored at some parts and took a long time finishing this anime. \\n\r\nThe comedy is pretty good too, and added to my enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is an anime that should be on everyone's list. Though it is kind of draggy and should not be watched when you're hungry for action anime, I believe everyone should see it because of its themes that can help bring you through when life if tough.",

            "content": "Enter Bakuman.\r\nA creation that has shocked many people, and I\u2019ll tell you, it shocked me too. I will be reviewing the whole series, as they all have the same plot and it will be weird if I did just one season. This anime is what you call a good creation, and somewhat impressive, and this review will tell you exactly why.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI find the story rather impressive, as it did a great job. However, there was something missing. I know! It didn\u2019t live up much to my expectations. I expected a romance shonen anime that I would want to watch over and over again, butfor this anime, it didn\u2019t do that, but still, the story is impressive and I think they did a really good job on the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation was amazing, but it still didn\u2019t live up to what I expected. I don\u2019t want to explain in details, but in short, I wanted something beautiful that will stay in my memories forever. Sure, it did that, but not really what I wanted. As for the positive things, the art looks like it was drawn by a master artist. Sure, it wasn\u2019t much of a beauty, but it was really well animated. To me, the animation gets better time-to-time, but it is still really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThey did the characters perfectly! They all fit what they really are! The voices, the personalities, presentation, everything! It is absolutely outstanding and brilliant, I think the characters are possibly one of the best parts of the anime, and each character makes a good story, a really good anime. I personally love the characters, they\u2019re just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nOkay, the soundtrack is somewhat impressive, but it didn\u2019t impress me THAT much. Though the music can sometimes be calm and lovely, that\u2019s just it. Some are upbeat, and some are calm, the end. I wanted more of the sound, but on the upside, all of the soundtrack is amazing, but I wanted more! It is so good, but that\u2019s all? It deserved a 7, considering that they put in a ton of good work.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the anime, but it didn\u2019t astonish me much. But still, I got shocked on how beautiful the anime is, but still, it didn\u2019t surprise me much with surprise attack. As for the positive, I actually loved watching this anime. It just reminds me that there are so many manga I haven\u2019t read yet, and it just tells me to start reading some. It also tells me that manga is not all about other people, it just has to be interesting. I was filled with joy watching each episode, and I love the anime a lot. Even if it\u2019s not the best.\\n\\n\r\nCounting all of them: Story, Animation, Character, Sound, and Enjoyment, I would give this anime a 9 out of 10. It was impressive, but it didn\u2019t give me much of what I wanted. Still, it was somewhat entertaining and loveable forever and ever.",

            "content": "Covers season 1 and 2\r\nJ.C. Staff, check. Director Kenichi Kasai with previous slice of life and romance anime work such as Honey and Clover, check. Even the writer and illustrator combo of Ohba Tsugumi and Obata Takeshi, the guys behind Death Note, bring past success to the table.\r\nBakuman features two kids that want to create a hit manga that will eventually be created into an anime. No doubt this is a nostalgia trip story based on the creator\u2019s as they made into the manga creation industry. The director\u2019s influence from previous work makes its\u2019 mark known here ranging from the pastel colors and pallets tothe late 90\u2019s character designs. Much of the anime besides a duo\u2019s goal to become great mangakas is the romance sub-plot of the duo with their female counterparts. Their love story is a major motivation for Bakuman.\\n\\n\r\nThe bromance between Mashiro and Takagi is something of a spectacle, while the story revolves around the motivations and actions of Mashiro. His drive to create a manga to become a hit anime in order to fulfill a non-sensible love struck promise kind of falls into a shounen type anime clashing with shoujo characteristics. Much of the other characters are second nature to what Mashiro himself does ranging from stubborn illustrations to overwork itself. Most of these issues tackled in Bakuman says much about the state of the industry itself. Bakuman clearly clashes with ideals and ideas of what romance is and was and even the characters themselves get called out for it during the journey. While the romance is there for good story intentions, it often feels over used and misguided for the real story being told.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman is strongest when moving away from any sub-plots and focuses on the core, making a hit manga and the struggles that come with it. Season 1 hits this quite well. However, as the series continues from there is where it seems to slow to a crawl. Sure, waiting on weekly rankings to see where they stand or even waiting to hear back from the board if their manga will make it into the magazine makes for a tight intriguing watch. Unfortunately, character motivations and choices battle with the incredible realistic tone on the industry. It is well done in most aspects, but a realistic pace and portrayal may not make the best entertainment in the long run. That\u2019s what hurts Bakuman the most, not the unrealistic fantasy dream of romance in the sub-plot.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt Bakuman comes with frustrations while watching. Also, there is no doubt the third season culminates into something worth the effort, if dying to see how the duo winds up with their manga success. This series is unique and is at least worth the effort of giving a good try.",

And there are funny parts, too. A little bit of everything, but for some people maybe they will find it a bit repetitive, if you don't like the theme. \r\nIf you are an artist and like to draw or you would like to become a comic artist or a mangaka, this definitely is your anime.

            "content": "Bakuman is a masterpiece. There are three seasons to Bakuman and this review will speak to all of them. Bakuman is one of those anime that is so fulfilling throughout the entire 75 episode story that it will leave you feeling complete and satisfied. I have watched anime from all different genre for the last five  years and outside of the typical \"masterpieces\" that the general public often finds agreement on (think Death Note, Code Geass, etc), I had yet to find a show that is less popular that I consider a true masterpiece. Bakuman changed that for me. There is nothing in anyseason of Bakuman that needed changing - everything comes together throughout the seasons to create a complete and satisfying story that will leave your heart warm and your eyes wet.\\n\\n\r\n{Story} - The story of Bakuman is what created the structure for it to be a masterpiece. Every episode serves a purpose in building up your investment in characters and highlighting key facets of the manga industry. As someone that was previously ignorant of the difficulties and challenges faced by mangaka, Bakuman will draw you into the world of manga and leave you breathless. The story draws you into the creative process and will leave you exhausted alongside the main characters as they fight for serialization and an anime adapation. This anime will make you feel the story like no other.\\n\\n\r\n{Art} - While I am inexperienced in what constitutes \"good animation art\", the visuals in this anime certainly created an atmosphere that allowed the story and characters to succeed. I would say I have seen more beautiful anime out there, but Bakuman's art felt proper and natural for the setting.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound} - Similar to the art side side, the sound in Bakuman felt right. There was no noise or songs that felt out of place or distracting from the anime. Every song and sound effect added to the ambiance that Bakuman needed to succeed and it did just that.\\n\\n\r\n{Character} - By far and away the strongest point of Bakuman and what filled out the story frame that allowed this anime to become a masterpiece. I often find anime that have many different \"main characters\" to spread themselves too thin and to draw away from the rest of the story, but every single character in Bakuman served an integral purpose to the overall story. You will care about every character in this story (except maybe Nakai who frustrated the heck out of me) by the time it is finished and understand just how important each person was to the story. I've never felt so heavily invested in over 10 main characters in an anime before - but Bakuman did it in such an excellent fashion that I have zero complaints. I cared more about some of the minor characters in Bakuman due to the way they were developed than I care about most main characters in an average anime.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment} - To put it bluntly, I watched all three seasons of Bakuman (75 episodes) in three days. That's just how incredible the anime was for me. While I tend to binge watch shows, its rare for me to get invested in an anime with more than 25ish episodes and feel the need to watch the next episode immediately. Needless to say, Bakuman is a masterpiece that you will be unable to put down.\\n\\n\r\n{Overall} - Overall I gave Bakuman a 10/10 - a true masterpiece. I felt this anime to be one of the most complete and fulfilling anime that I have ever watched and it will be one of those anime that I binge watch again in the future when I have a hole left in my chest from a less satisfying anime.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman - a true masterpiece.",

If so, Bakuman is defenitly an anime you should consider watching, it tells you everything you could want to know about manga and is filled with dreams, love and friendship.\r\nStory (8):\r\nSo, the story for Bakuman is pretty simple; Moritaka Mashiro has long since given up on his childhood dream of becoming a mangaka (manga artist). That is, until his classmate Akito Takagi sees his drawings and proposes that he and Mashiro become a mangaka duo with Mashiro as the illustrator! Eventually,Takagi convinces Mashiro and the twowork towards there dream of making a manga that gets an anime adaptation.Let the games begin.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nThe art by J.C staff (best known for there slice-of-life works like Tora Dora and Pet Girl Of Sakurasou) was consistent and has a nice style. The character designs were also well done and I felt that overall the art was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9):\\n\r\nThe characters were super lovable! Bakuman dealt with a fairly large cast of characters very well. Our main characters Takagi and Mashiro had wonderful personalities and had a developed friendship that felt realistic. The rest of the cast was also amazing; there was Eiji Nizuma who was far from the typical rival character, Miho Azuki and Miyoshi Kaya were also far from the typical love interests. And there are many over character that are far from typical, too many to name, but they are all just as amazing and developed as these!\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really didn't think the music was great. The pieces were mostly flat and un-memorable, nothing much to write home about. Although, this is just my opinion.\\n\r\nThankfully, the voice acting was amazing. Especially Satoshi Hino (Sayama Ryou in the Code Geass movies) as Takagi and Nobuhiko Okamoto (Obi in Akagami no Shirayuki-hime) as Eiji.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (8):\\n\r\nOverall, as a huge fan of the manga, I think the anime adaptation was very faithful to the manga.",

The whole thing moved to high gear halfway through the second season and it was going up after that. TheRomance idea was extremely far fetched but was still great to watch as the lack of day to day interaction actually made it better and less clich\u00e9 imo\\n\r\n- Good comedy\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some stuff get a little repetitive\\n\r\n- It was kind of predictable, so there was no suspense factor for me.\\n\r\n- Although the show was trying to show how \"cutthroat\" the manga industry is. It was extremely lenient with the MC at some points which took away from the realism enjoyment and added to it's predictability I mentioned\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- A huge cast with many great characters that ranged from completely nuts to simple and lovable\\n\r\n- Kaya Miyoshi (Best Girl) :D\\n\r\n- Kouji Yoshida (Simply loved his scenes) :D\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Barely noticeable character main characters growth. The anime (in it's 3 seasons) supposedly spanned 10 years but even to it's last episodes i still felt like i was watching a high school drama\\n\r\n- Everyone is so fuckin understanding o_O I mean what thae actual fuck. I realize that this a Shounen anime but things need to have a limit\\n\r\n- Related to the point above, the show also lacked real assholes. one can have too much \"Friendly rivalry\" to last a lifetime in this show\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- For an anime about Manga it offer some really great and different types of art\\n\r\n- Environments and character design was good\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- It had some issues with size a depth perception\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Catchy and upbeat OPs and EDs\\n\r\n- Good voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The soundtrack (during the actual anime) was repetitive. I believe it was the same during all three seasons\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nIt was a good and entertaining show with a good amount of drama and comedy and sweet (Although super imaginary) romance but it was \"Too Shounen\" if this was an actual term\\n\r\nif that aspect was toned down a bit i would have enjoyed a lot more\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10)",

Something that is unconvencional anime, like Bakuman would appear to be if you read synopsis, but sometimes it fails at its uniqueness, like Bakuman did. It was one of those stories that drag you in with promising description, but end up being badlands filled with nothing. Nothing! NOTHING!\r\nStarting with story, we have 2 main characters. These two protagonists meet and decide to chase their dreams of becoming manga artists (mangakas). Not a bad premise if you ask me, because it is something different. Most of anime is battle shounen and this is anice change from time to time... No. This isn't any different from basic generic shounen genre. Don't let the synopsis fool you, because this show is trying to be its shounen's close friend. It's like most fighting shounens minus weapons. They completely missed on the 'romance' part (It is there, I know, but only for total of 20 minutes or less)! They striped themselves off of the romance element and filled it with nothing but unimportant 'dream chase' garbage. Only thing you can experience is watching two high school students overcome their difficulties and inexpierences in the world of manga, while this anime somehow managed to ruin even that. Yes.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this anime is its characters. Two guys, two girls. That's main characters, then we have one editor guy and one \"villain\". Like I said before, this anime tries to push the whole 'shounen' plague on you, so they summon a villain. Yes, an enemy for those two guys fight, because it would be boring otherwise. No, it was boring anyway. Here's why: that enemy is a mere competitor - obviously, it's just school anime, no killing - and he is the most cringiest and worst 'madman genius' type, because that role was pushed onto him. Their rival in manga creation world is simply annoying, embarassing, chlidish and suffers from many psychological disorders. I get it though. They were trying to make that his charm... But it failed incredibly. From a crazy rival who was supposed to be a genius, they made him only annoying and predictably boring.\\n\r\nThat wasn't the worst part of the worst part, the characters. The absolute worst place was taken by Miho, love interest of our protagonist. I bailed on the whole romance part since fifth episode - maybe even sooner - but mere character of her and her being in this anime made me almost puke. Classic goody-shoes, shy, spineless girl without character. The worst suffering. *SPOILERS* They kissed. Just kidding. They didn't. You know why? Because she made promise with our protagonist not to date untill they accomplish their dreams. Sure, cute and inevitable wish when you are pursuing your dreams, you want to focus just on that and nothing else. But this anime was put in romance section, so everything they wished for was undeniably  way to make me suffer. While Miho was crybaby and arguably one of the worst characters ever written, her friend Miyoshi - who I deemed the best of them all - was pushed in the corner of the story. And do we give Miyoshi some credits? No, we mostly focus on human garbage disguised as Miho and her male equivalent, Mashiro. While their hearts must've skipped a beat when just being near each other, I sure skipped some of their scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound was just average. Nothing special. Opening was the worst garbage I've ever heard in a while and background music was just meh. I'm not gonna say it was all horrible, they could have no music at all, which would be bigger turnoff.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, again, nothing special. Can't say it was bad either.\\n\\n\r\nNow I can't give it half of the stars, because it was different. If I was obsessed with manga it would be definitely more appealing. But I watched it because it was said to be school romance. I expected more, much more.\\n\r\nWhile this might be garbage for me, I know that many people who are perhaps also younger can enjoy this. Someone who wants to become artist in general, or more specificaly mangaka, this show must be for him. Otherwise it's horrible.\\n\r\nFinal rating is 6/10, because I've seen worse. Be warned though and avoid this if you expect above average anime with decent plot.",

            "content": "If you like reading any kind of manga you will love this anime! Especially if you were ever interested in the process of making manga!\r\nStory- The main plot line is about two guys trying to have their manga published and have an anime made based of their manga. It opens up all of the secrets of the manga world and that is truly amazing! Apart from that, there are also great love and friendship plot lines. The story is very positive and inspiring. Honestly, while watching it,I wanted to become a mangaka too more and more. This anime definitely puts you in a right moodand makes you want to be creative.    Even though it's not some kind of action packed story, I was very intrigued by it. I worried about the characters and I got connected to them a lot. Also, I was very satisfied by the ending and I can't wait to start watching other seasons.\\n\\n\r\nArt-  I loved the drawing style of Bakuman. It suited the story perfectly. It was very realistic and on point. Character designs were great, none of the characters seemed to look alike.\\n\\n\r\nSound-  Seiyuus did an amazing job at portraying characters. There was not that much of a background music,but if there was it was nice. I didn't particularly enjoy the opening song, but I liked the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- all of the characters were very likable and lovely. I can not forget to mention how Takagi Akito reminds me of Light Yagami. But I guess there was some sense in making Takagi so similar looking. My favorite character is Nizuma Eiji (even though he is a supporting character) He is just a genius upcoming mangaka and also he's very funny and has something unusual and quirky about him that makes him very likable. All characters were on point and developed very well and I liked them a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  I enjoyed Bakuman a lot! I think that anyone can like this,no matter what genre they usually go for. It's an amazingly told story that captivates you. I marathoned this anime in 1,5 days, because I just couldn't stop watching it!   Also, I believe that even those,who don't like anime that match may enjoy this anime,because it shows the world of anime and manga so perfectly that you just can not be left without any emotions and feelings to it.\\n\r\n I highly recommend Bakuman!",

Thanks to gg for subbing it (since I watch anything they sub)!\r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nDefinitely, I\u2019m giving this a 9.5/10 for the huge progression of the story, which kept it so promising from the beginning to the end! Majority of the episodes were, basically, amazing, which pushed me to give it this kind of rating, yet some of it were too slow for me to understand or even care to absorb the story beingput through. But on the other side, it usually pushes me to the edge of the seat when things become serious. I mean, drama? It was never too much in Bakuman, but there were rare times of it being so cheesy, it makes me feel like I\u2019m embarrassed to even watch this very episode. I, honestly, can\u2019t bear to know that this had ended esp. with all the cliffhangers, and the \u2018hidden\u2019 characters!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff? I\u2019m not surprised that it isn\u2019t as good as I expect it to be, or even worse! But at least it was fine. Speaking of which, what pushed through making me watch this show was, ironically, the art as well from Bakuman\u2019s volume 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were to my liking! It really portrayed this anime well, in a way. At about the fourth time I heard it, I thought it sucked and became stupid as it repeated, but in the end, it made me remember that there\u2019s just something, just something, about this song that makes me like it at the same time. Just listen to it for yourself! (I\u2019m going to post the OP and ED sequences soon, but I can\u2019t be sure.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this dynamic duo, and perhaps the other unusual mangakas. At first, their rival was \u201cluck\u201d from getting a \u2018good\u2019 editor, then a serialized high school student, then mangakas that came out of nowhere, and probably will repeat in the 2nd season with good drama (again!), but no more random mangakas, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a 9/10! What made me push it back to a 9 was because of the cinematography. I never really like J.C. Staff\u2019s animations, but what I do like about them is that they make anime sequels almost out of nowhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nYou might want to watch this show, yourself. I\u2019m almost kind of a person, who\u2019s almost like \u201cFk that episode, this anime sucks\u201dthing. But I really do recommend you watch this show! (esp. when there\u2019s an upcoming, awesome 2nd season)\\n\\n\r\nI hope the other viewers out there enjoyed the show as much as I did! >:)\\n\\n\r\n--- --- ---\\n\\n\r\nDo visit my blog if you can: http://iseedeadanime.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/bakuman-a-charming-mangaka-story/",

            "content": "I\u2019m always been in love with Death Note. It literally changes how I perceive life. Even after so many years, the overwhelming experience watching it still lingers within me. So when I heard that Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata are doing another story I was more that delighted. I was dying with so much anticipation. \r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nAfter watching anime and reading mangas for more than a decade, I learn to truly appreciate the people who create such magnificent creation. Mangakas are the ones who give birth to them. You can even say that they are the main reason why Iam so fascinated with animes and mangas. So even before watching this series, I definitely admire them. However, watching this series makes me understand mangakas in whole different way. This series shows the weight and gravity of making such a creation. It is very much knowledgeable because it is shown in details. From how one story is given birth to how it is polish to serialization and to being adapted into an anime. But more importantly, the story is about dreaming and having a goal. You will learn that things would not usually go your way, not by just pure effort. A little gamble and pure luck is needed also. This is what I love with Ohba\u2019s story. It is not just entertaining or being interesting but rather, you can definitely learn something from it. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters are very much realistic. Their characters are something that we could really relate to in real life. It is very inspiring not only to aspiring mangakas but with people who have their own dreams as well.  Though, I think that the relationship of Saikou and Azuki is really weird yet somewhat original. I think it is not a great option not to meet until making their dreams come true. I know a lot of people who does that and by the time they are at the peak of their careers, they already forgotten why they\u2019ve dreamt in the first place and its already too late. Yes, love comes with different forms but still. I also think that getting your dreams come true in a very short time is somehow unrealistic. I mean it\u2019s really hard making dreams come true and worst; they sometimes never come true let alone make them at a very short time. I believe anything in haste makes waste. Let me just mention, that the character of Nizuma is very likeable just like L in Death Note. For some reason, the mangakas love to have a certain character that is weird yet so genius. They are also the ones who inspires other characters.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe illustration is somewhat different from Obata\u2019s usual artwork but the touch and trademark is definitely visual. I just love how Obata gives life to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI am not Japanese but I am very much aware how popular Shounen Jump is. Almost all of my favorite animes has been serialized by Shounen Jump so I have a vague idea how the magazine works. But after watching this, I learn a lot. This series shows how the Shounen Jump works and that is very knowledgeable. However, as far as exciting is concern, this series is lacking so much. People who would really relate to the story are mostly from Japan and very few with other nationality. What I\u2019m trying to say is that internationally it would be hard for viewers to comprehend the details of the storyline and plot. Even I, who have knowledge with it, had a hard time comprehending the storyline. It is pretty much interesting but it also has the tendency to get so boring. \\n\\n\r\nWow! It was quiet hard giving comments considering this is about Mangakas. Learning about them in a whole different way, makes the review pretty hard. \\n",

But, in order for this to be accessible, the idea of art is sidestepped. In Bakuman, creating manga, shounen manga at least, is basically a series of popularity battles, with the ultimate goal basically being voted #1 in the magazine that they run in. There\u2019s some lip service paid to alternative manga, but the question of art never really comes up. Which is both damning and myopic in equal measures. This is probably the mostinnocent thing I saw all year, too. The romance, at least the main one, is so ridiculously \u201cinnocent\u201d that it almost becomes like this weird abstract concept of what a first love should be. Which again ties back into its relatively idealized take on its characters, emotions and their milieu. Regardless, this is still heaps of fun.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

Two friends decide that they want to become the greatest mangakas that Japan has ever seen. The simplicity is what truly made this amazing and enjoyable. The anime showed the different challenges that the characters, Mashiro and Takagi, had to face, and it definitely had shounen aspects in it by the way that they never gave up. \r\nCharacter (10/10): Each of the characters were really likable. Mashiro and Takagi were such funny characters and the way they never gaveup was admirable. I believe that it was not only the main characters that made the show amazing but also the supporting characters. Each of the characters had such interesting quirks and characteristics. \\n\r\nSound and Art (10/10): The first opening was really catchy, and the soundtracks were really good. They really fit the mood well. The art was really good with each background being defined clearly by its colors. \\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes slice of life anime.",

            "content": "Bakuman isn't about fan service, so if you're looking for a romance story where two characters fall in love and start making out, you're in the wrong place. I've read comments before about how people were pissed off with how slow and non-existent Mashiro's relationship with Azuki is, though most people probably won't have much of a problem with the amount of the story that's covered in this series, at least. Bakuman doesn't have a whole lot of action either; I'd say it's not really suited for 12 year olds. If your favourite series is Bleach or DBZ, you should turn back now. \r\n-Story-\r\nIf youenjoy anime, what's not to like? Bakuman gives a very in-depth view of what it takes to create good manga while also giving a little info on related stuff in the industry, i.e. voice actors and anime. Many anime/manga fans start to draw in \"anime style\", some of them even create their own independent manga. Bakuman shows you that there's always something that can be improved in both the story and art, that originality is important, and that a job of just drawing pictures all day isn't as easy as one might think. \\n\r\nAlthough the series doesn't spend that much time at the school, the series has a school life and slice of life air about it, which I enjoy. It isn't just educational, but also entertaining. It's got dreams that the average viewer can probably relate to; it's got pure love where material things and using each other for sexual urges have no role; it's got suspense. The end of each episode will often leave you inspired and wanting to see the next one.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and I think the artstyle is interesting how all the characters are really skinny; it's sorta like xxxHolic, but without the freakishly tall part. The art was just good overall. I thought the detail on Takagi's hair was pretty disappointing, though. In the manga, it's just way more defined and the style of it is unique. Here, however, it looks like a cheapened version of Light's hair from Death Note. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nI dislike Mashiro's voice; he just sounds really wimpy. I also dislike the opening theme; I think it just sounds really gay. I think male singers are fine, even some Japanese boybands... I just generally like Japanese music since it tends to sound more like disco or dance music, but this opening theme sounds as gay as American boybands. I could let the opening theme for Itazura na Kiss grow on me, but not this one; I usually just skipped over it. \\n\r\nEveryone else's voices were fair enough and both ending themes were cool. I liked how the ending themes started playing a little bit before it got to the credits; it was timed well. The rest of the music in the series was alright; I guess it fits the slice of life genre. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nNo complaints here. I particularly like Fukuda, how he's just as much of a badass as the characters are in his manga. I also like that his editor is pretty similar despite how he tries to tell Fukuda to be more polite and stuff; they're just a good match. Some characters are skeptical of each other at first and gradually warm up in a convincing way. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nIt bothered me how the series was putting so much focus on Koogy right from the very start. They kept having girls here and there talk about Koogy and they had his posters all over the place and stuff. Having read the manga, it just made it very obvious to me that the final showdown would be with Koogy. I guess it's sort of okay for them to make us see that it would be a problem to face a celebrity who has so much support, but to me it just felt a little too blatant. Same goes for how they were dropping hints about Hiramaru near the end. Other than that, each episode was fun to watch and I never thought it felt like a grind. \\n\\n\r\nThe manga's a bit better, but this is a good anime version that stays pretty true to the manga. The story is interesting and there are no fillers. If you've ever wondered how anime/manga is created or if you want to draw your own manga, you should watch Bakuman.",

            "content": "Mashiro Moritaka- \u201cMy uncle never told me to become a mangaka. I'm drawing manga because I want to. A dream isn't something someone tells you to go for. It's something you fulfil on your own.\" \r\n AMAZING, FANTASTIC & SUPERB.\r\nThese are just a few words to describe how I feel about Bakuman.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nMashiro is a talented drawer whereas Akito Takagi is a promising writer. While still in middle school they decide they want to become the greatest mangaka\u2019s together in all of Japan. Under the pen name Ashirogi Muto their aim is to create a popular manga series and get serialized with Weekly Shounen jackso that readers across Japan can read their stories. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the 1st season you will see their journey to getting serialized will not be easy and their dedication and determination may not be enough to get them ahead. They will face many obstacles and challenges as they try to get to the top, but as we go on we learn that these two will not easily give up on fulfilling their dreams as well as a promise that Mashiro made which they set out from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that I loved about this show was the process of how manga is created. From getting ideas down and generating a storyboard to drawing the characters, background and text to finally presenting your work to an editor with the opportunity of it being selected and getting serialized. You really understand and get the feel of what mangaka\u2019s really do just to get serialized and even when you do it just gets even harder as you have to keep working to ensure your series doesn\u2019t get cancelled. \\n\\n\r\nAs a big fan of manga myself I noticed a lot of references to other popular manga series which is great to see as it gets the characters talking about what their favourite series are and how manga influenced them in deciding to become mangaka\u2019s themselves. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI found the art to be really good. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but every time I look at Mashiro\u2019s dark hair I just love looking at it due to the sharpness at the tips of his hair and the blue streaks compliment his black hair really well. I especially love how they are able to change to different art styles when it comes to the characters creating their manga. I find it amazing how they are able to do that for each manga they are creating. Seeing Mashiro draw with his pen made it seem so realistic and really shows off what a professional is capable of. Each character has their own unique designs that I love and their random quirks when they react to something is always hilarious to see.       \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening song \u201cBlue Bird\" by Kobukuro is fantastic and after listening to it I automatically fell in love with it and is probably my favourite Bakuman song. It really sets the tone for the show and is just so relaxing to watch and listen to. The background music when Ashirogi Muto  succeeds really gets me excited to cheer for them as they are one step closer to their dreams coming true.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth Mashiro & Akito are fantastic leads that have set out goals that they want to achieve so they can fulfil their dreams. They are ordinary people like you & me that have decided to devote their lives to creating manga so that their work can reach people across Japan and possibly the world. I find this truly inspiring as they never give up and will always continue to do what they love no matter what. Mashiro is an amazing drawer who really puts in the effort to bring his characters to life. Seeing them drawn & animated is really cool to see. Akito is always thinking of ideas and is constantly brainstorming on what could potentially be their next big hit. He even goes so far as to write up drafts that are only worthy of Mashiro and not just throw any random ideas at him. \\n\\n\r\nThere are only a few select females in this anime, but I will mention the two that greatly impact both Mashiro & Akito. \\n\\n\r\nAzuki Miho is a promising seiyu (voice actor) and made a promise to Mashiro that she will accept his marriage proposal as soon as both their dreams come true. However they are not to contact each other until their dreams are fulfilled. Even though they cannot directly meet face-to-face she is always thinking about him & supporting his dream. \\n\\n\r\nKaya Miyoshi is Azuki\u2019s best friend and is a big support for Ashirogi Muto. She sometimes helps out with ideas for their manga & usually assists in inking & toning. She is loud & outspoken and says what\u2019s on her mind. She is someone you would definitely want around as she is so caring and early on has feelings for Akito. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of rival characters that Ashirogi Muto will face as they all compete to be number #1. You would think that most of their rivals are only looking out for themselves and are only aiming for the #1 spot no matter what. However as we go on you find out that everyone is supporting each other and they all want to help each other get serialized while maintaining that competitiveness. One rival I found interesting was the genius high school mangaka Niizuma Eiji. At first I found him quite annoying and over the top, but I was pleasantly surprised later on at how much he drove Ashirogi Muto to improve and develop their own manga style. He saw them as rivals that had the potential to beat him and occasionally gave them advice. Turns out I freaking love this character so don\u2019t judge him too quickly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Learning about manga and what goes into creating one and then the steps to getting serialized I found interesting and gave me a whole new appreciation for manga. The time and effort that is put into each chapter by the mangaka\u2019s and the stress they put onto their bodies just to meet deadlines. All the characters had their own personalities which I loved and the comedy was hilarious. Most importantly was seeing Ashirogi Muto work hard to achieve their dreams and continue to move forward.     \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a masterpiece of an anime. As a whole this has entered into one of my favourite anime\u2019s of all time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to know about manga and what goes into getting serialized. Great lead as well as supporting characters. The music and art is fantastic and their journey to being #1 is something you want to see them achieve by the end of it.     \\n\\n\r\nSo the next time you read manga in a library/store or decide to purchase some just maybe think about how much time and effort the mangaka put in to get their story across to their readers.",

It creates multiple layers of motivation and perfectly captures the desire and drive many artists have or want to have in regards to making art. Its conflicts can feel a bit rushed at times, but it does add substance to the show, so I'm giving it a pass. It makes alltheir struggles seem more real due to how it develops the characters and portrays their emotions and motivations throughout the show. Like holy shit though, it sucks you in with a seemingly simple plot above and beyond. It is honestly beautiful to see them follow their dreams for each of their individual reasons. I'd go into specifics, but if anyone actually reads this I want them to be sucked in and experience their development as I have. Honestly though, this is one of the few things I have experienced that has actually moved me to make an actual change in my life.",

Both MC's are easily likable and have clear, understandable and sympathetic personalities. You're with them every step of the way of reaching their goal and seeing their work develop.And for once there's actual romantic tension between the MC and \"his girl\". Also has a great soundtrack. But there is some repetition with the patterns of how the episodes end with the same kind emotions. This is due to every episode ending with the start of the ending song, which brings a hinderance on variety because of both being up-beat songs.

In this case yes.\r\nStory: 9 - Moritaka Mashiro is a pretty much normal high schooler except the matter of fact that he can draw well whereas Akito Takagi is overall intelligent and is an aspiring writer. After pestering Mashiro for a while Takagi managed to convince Mashiro to join him in becoming a mangaka duo after which Mashiro promised made a promise with the girl he liked which is that he with Takagi will make a manga so great that it will have a anime adaption while she will become agreat seiyuu who will voice the female protagonist in their anime. And that's when their journey to fame begins. I didn't have high expectations from Bakuman as the contents sounded quite boring but I thought I should give it a try and honestly it did exceed my expectations especially how its got that shounen battling (competition for first place) element despite their being no actual battles or any of the sorts which made me impressed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art was really good especially the parts when there was emphasis on the making of manga which was done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - The sound was fitting as it described the situation and emotions of the characters properly which is something neccesory for a shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - The characters were done nicely as they had been given the perfect roles especially the supporting characters which had a major impact on the surroundings of our protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I enjoyed this series a lot but I think it felt kind of incomplete but overall this series can be enjoyed by anyone because its really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This review doesn't include my opinion on Bakuman .2 and Bakuman. 3.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Hataraki Man,Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to,Chihayafuru and Genshiken will like this series due to similar elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 - Overall I found this series quite good and this series is recommended for anyone who likes shounen series.",

Thank you to everyone for their hard work.  \r\nWhile watching this show I learned a lot about what it takes to create a popular manga.  I knew it was hard, but not this hard.  Anyway,  this series was amusing at times while being serious.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story of true love, hope, dedication, friendship and passion.  This series is one of my now favorites along with Dragon Ball Z, Tenchi Muyo, FullMetal Alchemist,InuYasha and Yu Yu Hakusho.  I am very happy that I had finally found someone that hosted this series and I am grateful to them.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone that has not seen this show or is watching it, I will say that you will love this show.\\n\\n\r\nThank you again for reading this review and I hope to post more in the near future since I am in the middle of a few other shows I am watching along with Bakuman Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nJa Ne",

            "content": "there are many aspects of this anime that I like so I'll get over with them quickly; It's made by the creators of Death Note a anime that I seriously like, the premise is interesting and it's handled well during the series, it doesn't get melodramatic for a highschool student drama (Thank god), it keeps a nice contrast between seriousness and comedy and it's very grounded in realism to give the expectator a clear view of the world of the manga artists which makes this series even more recommended for someone who wants to be a manga artist.\r\nNow what I don't like of the animeis some mishandlings with the transition from comic to animation, this series has A LOT of dialog and it feels quite uncanny when characters stand still for so long talking making me wonder how do they even breathe. I guess you can say that I'm exaggerating but the thing is that for animation it's better to cut down the dialog for more exposition since everything is in motion you can tell more through expresion and atmosphere rather than words only, people who watch TV don't have the patience for dialog as someone who reads books or comic.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to this conclusion, it's better to read the manga not only because it gets rid of that uncanny feeling I explained earlier but also because character models and commedic expresions have better impact on the manga which is weird considering that it doesn't have the advantage of motion\\n\\n\r\nAlso one last thing, this isn't really a spoiler but don't set your expectations to high on the ending. It's very anticlimatic and it does not give a clear vision to what happens to most of the characters",

I've started off the series with concrete belief that this series will definitely be an awesome one because of the faith I have with the original creator, and it did not disappoint me. I watched this series in an on-and-off basis, but it always manages to impress me, making me to stick myself in front of the screen for a full 20 minutes. The most awesome(?) part is when the series tends to end one episode with cliffhangers (especially when some results are going to be announced) and you will go like \"aww man, don't stop there!Now where's the next episode?\". Somehow, it's perfect in building up tension and then holding you at the edge of the mountain preventing you to continue moving. I find the tension and psychological headaches worked well on me. \\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned that the series is really inspiring & motivating. And I mean it. You follow the dream of two teenagers; you see how determined they are in realizing & moving towards their dreams; you see how they got up again & again even after one & another failures. Somehow, the spirit just blends in to you. It affected me in a good way. Sometimes it makes me guilty - \"what am I doing here slacking my time off when I can actually work as hard as them?\" - despite being a really egoistic person & a person with extreme high self-esteem myself, I have to admit that I'm beaten - be it fictional or not.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really impressed. Watch it to get inspired & motivated. And I'm moving on to the next season.",

What caught my eye though was the mention that the creators where the same people who brought me much entertainment in the form of a little story called Death Note. Then I had to see. After the silly cartoon intro of the first episode, I started to get into the show. I sat there wondering hat would happen. What would the main plot be. Then they finally set it and I was hooked. Just give the show a shot. Three episodes is all I ask. If you don't like itafter that then WATCH MOAR! hahaha. Honestly it is very entertaining and inspiring in a sense. Something about people putting effort into something is refreshing. Plus who here doesn't like drawing? Lastly, I recommend this show because it has a second season. That way you wont be bored should you finish. One of the saddest events for me is watching a show and then learning theirs no continuation. Well that didn't happen here. I came, I saw, and I saw again and again and again. Heck this is one of the few show's I've watched with my family and friends. My mother even reads the books. So if anything it can be a good intro to anime for people of almost all ages.  So why not sit back and give it a try. You wont regret it. Trust me. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. =]",

I was pretty much stuck watching the same old things and had gotten quite bored with watching them. i literally have like 20 animes and mangas i have on hold due to lost interest. Now on with Bakuman it is a series about two teens trying to write the best manga in the world and there are a whole hoard of interesting problems that seem topop up as soon as they feel they are close to there goal. The art work is really good and it seems to pull you in very well. The character's where very very well done and had me begging for more the entire time.  This is the best Anime that i have watched  in porbably 6 months. \\n\r\n-Matt",

I'm however attracted this anime was simply due to its artwork and uniqueness which in a sense revolved on the dreams and determination of those willing to become the most wanted jobs of all Otakus out there in the world. To be a mangaka and to have their work to be turn into an anime. The story began with the main character, Moritaka Mashiro who desired to be a mangaka liked his uncle, and he faced lots of obstacles with his doubts towards his parents approval of allowing him to become onewhen he's still in high school.\\n\\n\r\nApart from its uniqueness showing on how manga was made, and the trouble mangakas have to go through to get where they are, they focused on the love story of Moritaka Mashiro and  Azuki Miho. His sweet and focused dreams of getting the one he love, fuel him to become a mangaka despite of the obstacles thrown at him. It truly shows in this anime, anything is possible if you put the right amount of determination and love into what you love to do. Well, you should just watch to see how this will turn out between both of them.",

It comes from the minds of the creators of Death Note, but don't go in expecting Death Note.\r\nThis is me just reviewing the first season, and so far I've fallen in love. The characters and story flow smoothly with one another. They aren't trying to rush the story their ultimately telling you. \r\nTwo high school kids who want to publish their own manga before graduating. It seems like a feat they won't be able to pull off, but they'lltry their hardest! That's what I love about this anime. These kids are pulling off things I wish I could do so easily, but the anime is still shining a light on reality with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this series an 8. Stick around for season two and three!",

            "content": "Review 12: Bakuman (Get your pens out)\r\nIn this review i'll be explaining what Bakuman is and the characters init as people are getting to confused with Bakuman and Bakugan which annoys me and my friends at school very much. -_-.\r\nFirst of all the series of books is all about two best friends who have brilliant imaginations and wish to create a book together for Shonen Jump.\r\nWhen making some prototypes for Shonen Jump they see all of the highs and lows of being a writers and artist's and how much they need to do to just be in the magazine monthly. Whilst balancing high schoollife and a producers life they realise that their can only be one route for both of them, which means hard decisions and risks that they have to take that would hopefully make their rest of their lives the best it could be.\\n\\n\r\nAkito Takagi: He is one of the main characters for the Bakuman anime and manga series. At the begginning of the series we see him as a 14 year old high school student. His nickname through out the series is Shuujin and as he meets another boy in his class named Moritaka he realises his amazing drawing skills and potential as an artist so he asks if they can help each other out. Hes the most intelligent in his class and gets top grades throughout the school every term, with his intelligence on his side he becomes the maker of the story lines and character profiles which Moritaka than works on to make the stories that they put together come to life. Akito's girlfriend is annoyingly loud and makes Moritaka a bit more frustrated whenever she comes round to their work room.\\n\\n\r\nMoritaka Mashiro: Is really the main character that all of the attention is focused on throughout the series. The series of books starts off with him being 14 just like Akito. They both meet each other by being put in to the same class and had no contact before that which adds a bit of a mysterious side to it as they are complete strangers up until this moment in their lives. He isn't as intelligent as Akito but is more creative as he always draws and doodles in lessons so his grades are always a little bit lower then Akito. As Moritaka is in to art he usually expresses himself through the drawings that he does in class, especially to one girl (who i will not be mentioning), she wants to pursue the dream of becoming a voice over actress and as Moritaka wants to become a artist they realise that their dreams are to different so they try to maintain it for as long as they can, which eventually turns out to be perfect for them both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story than goes on for them as they see all of the ups and downs that any other artist would expect to see and witness at some point in their ives.\\n\\n\r\nyou wouldn't expect the creators at shonen Jump to reveal so much about how to get into the magazine and how it all works in the offices but they reveal a lot about it all and also mentioning the names of some rivals that they will come across at some point which brings the two infamous creators down just a little bit, but they get back up on to thier feet fighting once again to win their place in the magazine and become the artists that they've always wanted to be.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second book in the series you realise that it isn't all fun and games for them all as it's the middle of their term at school people aren't all to comfrotable when they see their names on the back of the weekly Shonen Jump magazine, boys in their classes seem to think that it isn't likely that their dreams will ever come true and that they will fail just like their dreams are.....But when some children in their classes adjust to the fact that they aren't going to give up any time soon some start to admire it and start to become fans of their short stories.\\n\\n\r\nAs i am still watching and reading the series of Bakuman i don't know a lot that happens after the 6th book which makes me feel a little bit down as i could tell you more about the series, i'll be updating on the series when i have time to and will be explaining more about what happens in each book.\\n\\n\r\n21st Of December 2012 (the day we where supposed to die XD) 9:46 PM ~AmyXxx",
