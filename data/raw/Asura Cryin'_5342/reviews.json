            "content": "Alright...I'm writing this for a reason. To hope people will read this and so that they won't waste their time watching this anime like I did. I'm still watching it actually, and I do intend to finish it because I don't normally like dropping too many animes. Although if this series had anymore than 13 episodes, I might of had to reconsider.\r\nStory 5/10: Well...what sort of story is it really? There's little to no plot at all. The only thing I can see going on is that everyone wants the Asura Crying. First they're fighting, and the next their figuring out who to fight nextor being followed by SOMEONE and attacked. Same thing over and over again, and same characters doing the same fighting pattern constantly.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: The artwork isn't COMPLETELY horrible, but it isn't very good either. It's mostly the kind of art your regular mediocre anime would have, whether the plot be good or not. The style isn't totally bland, but it could have been better. The only things that really look good are the machines, which I assume the creators are focusing on as would any other anime devoted to the mecha genre. But seriously, I've seen better looking art in animes that are still focused on making the mechs and what not look the best from anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: What to say about the sound? I guess it's alright..if it was anything like Mars of Destruction then it would have only made this anime even more horrible. Thank god it isn't. It's pretty good, and seems to flow good with the anime in general. The overal sound EFFECTS are decent as well. Nothing that doesn't make it sound too fake. I'd say this is one of the better qualities of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: I was going to give this a 4...but I guess I'm being generous. Yes, GENEROUS. The charactes are pretty boring enough as it is. Nothing really original at all. They look boring as well, and the colors for them aren't too 'bright'. Not to mention their personalities are that of any average anime. Girl partnered with a boy that she probably likes, only to have another companion like him as well, as well as another sometimes sexually harassing him. Your typical naive 'hero', spiritual naive girl, girl with an attitude and a probable tsundere just for kicks. Although the REAL character issue would be the random million characters that pop up in every episode with no explanation about them, except for what side their on. Not to mention sometimes when a character pops up, they suddenly become BFFs with the main character, as to which the main character would probably risk their life for them later on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10: Again, I was going to give this a 2...but eh. As you can see from the other sections, this anime is just boring. I will admit however, that the first few episodes will keep you entertained. But only the first few..maybe the first 4-6 if anything? After that, everything just goes downhill. I really had high hopes for this anime..but after everything I've seen, it's just trash. It was ruined completely with all the random unexplained crap that goes on. I really don't expect it to get any better. Because truthfully, how can it? Maybe if they actually showed some sort of character background and development with the other characters, and made other things more clear, it would have been a tad more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 3/10. It's terrible..and I advise anyone and EVERYONE to avoid watching it so they won't waste any time like I have. I feel bad for the talented voice actors that have to provide their voices for this disaster. So really, unless you actually like watching animes with boring characters, confusing 'plot twists' with no explanation, and having a series that's hoarded with tons of random characters at once, then by all means, go for it. If not, seriously. Don't watch this. You're much better off watching something like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Code Geass, or Macross Frontier. Actual animes with VERY high potential.",

            "content": "Story 6:\r\nThe storyline of \"Asura Cryin' \" happens to be one that has a lot of detail and a lot of planning to it. However, it is one of those storylines that as good as it might be, was definatly not executed to the best ability. On top of this, there are a few things that one should know before they watch the anime.\r\nOne of the things that is problematic is that the storyling does not flow well, there are constant flashbacks, and important details that help the anime to run are revealed at intervals that are not always the best time for them tocome into play.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is some of the humor that is crammed into the storyline. While some of the humor is actually funny, some of it is not that funny, or it happens to be put in at the wrong time, or the humor is not needed for the story to run along. Some of the humor is sex related.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is, \"Asura Cryin' \" is not really about the occult, and not really about the church. It is really a fantasy version of the two, where magic, demons, and mechas exist. Yes, I said mecha... technollogy actually plays a big role in this, which was not something I was expecting. But the way they work together is a nice asspect, however, not exactly executed to the best ability.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nI may be the only one, but I was in a way disturbed that two of the male characters had a bang of hair that was longer then the rest of their hair, like double the length, if not more. The art work, which is beuatiful, had been given a down trodding by such things as this that just don't seem in place, or they have a wierd effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on this is supreme. The opening and ending is beuatifully done, not to mention that the voice actors are fairly good. The sound effects also work into it well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point in \"Asura Cryin' \" is the numbers of different characters that are within the work, and the depth that has gone into them. Problem is, we only get a glimpse of them overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI had to say I enjoyied the anime for it's relativly neat ideas and concepts here, though I was disapointed by the way the storyline was executed, it seemed sporadic and disconjealed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is definatly not going to be for everyone. As stated above, it will have it's problems. But if one overlooks, or is even forewarned about the storylines... ddity... they might be able to get through it.",

            "content": "Someone has to say it.\r\nIf you watch anime because you want to secretly be the protagonist and have all these beautiful girls at school covet you, sleep in your bed, let you touch their tits, giggle when you lift their skirts and get all blushing and innocent even though you have the intentions of a registered sex offender... get a life. I'm sick of stumbling on a harem anime when I was hoping for something with substance.\r\nAlso, this anime managed to screw the cliche pooch harder than any in recent memory.\r\nThere's the everyguy, shy and reserved Tomo. He has a ghost girl, Misao, following himaround. He has already met her in the first episode, so we're instead treated to vague flashbacks as to why the hell this is so. The only role Misao seems to have is that if you're a ghost, and suspended in the air, people are going to see your translucent butt. \\n\\n\r\nTomo also has a weird shepherd's crook dredlock hanging down from his head, so you wind up staring at it as if it's some terrible sore/tumor that's seeping blood and pus.\\n\\n\r\nWhat puzzles me is how blurbs always refer to the protagonist as \"everyday.\" If you're an everyday high school boy you pop zits and masturbate all of the time. Miko, gun-wielding demons, yakuza, and douchy \"holy order\" types don't go kicking in the doors and smashing the windows of the luxury home you live in by yourself with a ghost girl.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the premise. \"Everyday\" boy has a ghost girl and is heir to a secret briefcase that contains a giant robot thing that everyone wants. He goes to a school where everyone dresses like Nazis who have accidentally bleached their arm bands. \\n\\n\r\nThe flat characters from his double life conveniently show up at his school--because the evil types in the world don't hang out in political offices, army bases, etc. They prefer high schools, and the many beautiful moe-type girls he knows also show up and are more than willing to let him have his way with them. But he doesn't. Because that's exactly what an \"everyday\" high school boy would do, right.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two eps have essentially set forth such a ludicrious premise that world destruction, the briefcase, moe demon chicks, and the various goons of the yakuza and holy order are linked. And Tomo (with his mysterious \"brother\" who remains unseen) is at the centre of all of this.\\n\\n\r\nGee, where shall this go?\\n\\n\r\nUnless I drop this, I'll update in mid-season.",

            "content": "Ok, getting straight into it:\r\nI always watch something to the end no matter what although i'm seriously reconsidering that ultimatum after this.\r\nStory:\r\nHalf the time you don't have a flippin' clue as to whats actually going on- no, more than half the time. Every episode, It'll change scene or introduce new unexplained characters who instantly merge themselves into the story with all the sensitivity of a blunt axe swinging down onto a solid block of steel. I suppose if you were to watch it again and again, you may just glimpse the actual plot that does its best to stay away from its rightful position. therefore,2. 1 is reserved for no-plot anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nIts not great but its not bad either. There are some bits where I would question whether the artist was feeling alright because the proportions are a little off. Its colourful, which boosts its rating and there's some effort done on the 'robot' things. The artwork is pretty much 'Meh' and gets a middle mark.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound is good. Sound showcases the seiyuu's talent and rather nice BGM. There's a BOOM when an explosion occurs, a brrrooOOMM when a motorbike moves and even some hydrauliky sounds when the robots move. Its good. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing that makes it exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDear Lord, please throttle them now. It gets as high as 3 because there are some ok characters in it. And by ok, I mean slightly amusing. But the rest, like the idiot main character and everyone that calls him by his full name more than once, are abysmal. Their personalities are messed up, they have such bad decision making and negotiating skills like: \"be our POW or die from the 50 bagillion guns pointed at you by year older high school students\" The main then replies \"That's soo unfair! you're mean! *pouts*\" Horrific.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell aside from EVERYTHING else, the fight scenes are alright and the poor usage of comedy makes me feel so sympathetic that I give them the undeserving score of 4. I think i've laughed once during my time watching it, I could be mistaken; Its so hard to remember between the frowns and disgust that surface every few minutes. I would not watch this ever again and may delete it from my library. The second series will be ignored and I will watch Kobato by CLAMP instead. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nCrap. Pigs spew. Grandma Dorris's hairy arse.\\n\r\nIf you want to waste 260 hours of your 700,000+/- hour lifespan, then by all means, watch Asura Cryin'. Thank you for your time XD\\n\\n\r\n*Bows Low*",

When you see Asura Cryin, you think slice of life, or romance, you dont think at all that it would be a battle anime, but lo and behold it is.\r\nthe story hasnt been fully hashed out after the first episode, so I wont really go into it, but there are battles, and ghosts, and magic, and mystery, and big suits of armor, so I think it will be worth the ride.\r\nArt is solid, nothing out of the ordinary. the Designs on the armor are pretty slickthough.\\n\\n\r\nSound again pretty average, the opening was catchy and had a cool Techno beat.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters werent explained a whole lot but its got a pretty big twist on the main heroin, the fact that shes not alive provides an interesting obstacle to be over come by the main hero.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the first episode goes, it was very enjoyable, the show has sort of a Chrome Shelled Regios feel to it, with a touch of Escaflone. If you enjoy high school life/ Battle anime, I would definetly check this one out.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This review will (probably) be updated after the show is over.",

            "content": "What to say for this series... It was very bad. \r\nArt: No, just no. The art may seem fine, but it really isn't. It is inconsistent and unoriginal. We see the creators drawing Tomoharu normally, and then pinning a hair tail and a squiggily thing up on his head to make him look unique, but it just makes him look overly retarded. Then we have inconsistency with the drawings. Some parts, we see the eyes drawn weirdly, or one scene there is a whole bunch of blood, the next there's none. We might say Kanade looks well drawn, but she really isn't. Not trying tosound like a pervert or anything, but the breasts are all drawn inconsistently (no, I don't only look at her breasts while watching this anime, just something I noticed >.>) All the characters have some weird hair style, or their faces just look really weird. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh, the things I hate the most. This is the funniest part out of the whole anime on what Tomoharu did. Kanade tells him not to use Kurogane anymore. Then during a time when Shuri was kidnapped, he remembers what Kanade tells him, looks at Misao, then summons Kurogane. Kanade tells him two times to not use Kurogane and he just ignores her, and then at the end, he yells why didn't anyone tell me this. He is the most stupidest and densest person in anime history. Not to mention all of a sudden making Misao turn visible. That was the most random and stupidest turn of events. Then they make Kanade nothing more than an object of fanservice. Making her say lewd jokes or having lewd things done to her. She clearly is  an important character, but...let's make the audience thing otherwise. All the characters have unoriginal characters or appearances. They are all stupidly dumb or retarded. \\n\\n\r\nSound: What to say, nothing really. It wasn't good or bad. At the end, they just used the opening and ending back to back. The music wasn't great, but it wasn't too bad. I mean when someone gets stabbed, we actually hear it. So it's \"normal\". The opening was ok, not really my taste.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Story is horrible. We see one episode they're doing something serious, the next, they're going to Hawaii. At episode one, they throw out all these questions at you. Answer some of it, and forgot the other ones. We see characters like the Third Student President show up at the first episode, then as if they forgot all about her, decide to put her in the last two episodes. One episode, they show Tomoharu meeting Yoh for the first time, next episode, Tomoharu knows all about Yoh and who they're talking about. Then we see Yoh injuring Shuri severely, then we see them in a good character relationship. The story is poorly thought out, and it seems the creators are just throwing everything out randomly, like demons, mechas, ghosts and a Seto Gozubarou type father.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Factor: The only enjoyment I ever liked was the fact that I get to see retards running around in the anime and doing stupid stuff over and over again. It was, overall, a poorly thought out story.",

Overall, this anime only got better towards the end and the story was pretty decent. I was expecting a good ending and it turned out good at first but later near the end of the last episode, a twist in the plot happened which was pretty touching in my opinion.\r\nArt\r\nThe art and design given by this anime is pretty good, character expressions were actually alright and abovedecent while the effects were nice too.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting's actually kind of good but some effort could be put in, I like the opening for this anime and sound effects were pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAsura Cryin' was not really a serious anime at first, I had a good laugh at the start of the few episodes because there were some humorous scenes, and after when the characters know about the truth, the anime totally changed into a serious sequence which kept me in excitement wanting to what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find this anime actually enjoyable if you have nothing to do. It's not bad but some may find it terrible because of the plot.",

            "content": "Alright im gonna keep this review Very short and Very simple(this is my first review). This Anime is NOT that bad. Yes, the story is confusing, but if you have any brain at all you can figure it out. It's a very deep and very complex story that took me in. No, its not laid out in ABC's. You have to think about it and pay attention to the diolouge and whats going on. And if you do that then you you WILLl enjoy this anime. \r\n     This story's protagonist is a high school boy who,of corse, is draged in to the middle of this battle between conflicting student councle athorites. He himself is very unusual in the fact that he is haunted by his childhood friend(a.k.a. female ghost). Anyways, a lot of things happen and you DO have to pay attention and be able to catch the foreshadowing thats at play, but dont get me wrong if your too dumb to follow a complex story then this is most likely not the anime for you.\\n\r\n     The chracters I thought were very good. yeah, there are one or two generic played out characters, but the rest of the characters I found were very enjoyable to watch, And each of the characters has their own complex, unique and interesting past. I loved the characters in this anime; I thought the writers did a fantastic job.\\n\r\n     The bottom line is this IS a good watch. With lots of enjoyment factors. If you can keep up, your not gonna be able to stop watching. The whole point of an anime is to get the veiwer to watch the next episode, and trust me your gonna want to know what happens in the next episode. Dont get me wrong, there are a few loose ends, but they all get answerd and your never too lost. Basicly if your into to good animes with, what i beleave, beautifuly written storys that keep you wanting more, Then you'll love it. If your just lazy looking for a casual whatch, then this may not be the anime for you.  I'm Insider66047 and I say I'm phyced for the second season of this great anime.",

Sure, they try to throw in some normal segments of high school life, but then *BOOM* sceneshift and  you have no idea what is going on. Score is higher than I want it to be.\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nWell..... the mecha look interesting.....\r\nSound: 4/10\r\nI dislike nearly everything about the music to the series. The only good things are some of the voices.\r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nThere really doesn't seem to be any coherent thought process thatcould have even begun to create this series. So far the viewer has been introduced to a miko who happens to be the daughter of a yakuza boss (or something like that), the president of the (what looks like cultic) science club who knew your older mysterious (OOOOH!) brother, a ghost girl who is bound to you for some strange reason, and some crazy \"religious higher order\" zealots. Doesn't help when you're stuck trying to figure out what the hell they all want with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't a good reason why I am still watching this. I mean, when I'm spending about 1/2 the time trying to piece together what the hell is going on, you can tell there's something wrong. What feels even more wrong is that the series tries to take itself seriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nWatch if you want to see a train wreck or a mash-up of everything and want to laugh about how mediocre an attempt it is.",

            "content": "You will have to put a lot of effort to follow this show and frankly you will get little reward for your troubles. Many aspects have a lot of content to them, rules, ins and outs that you need to know to follow the show. However even with all of that I still have no idea what is going on with this show.\r\n\"Asura Cryin\" has a lot of problems but the one I had the biggest issue with is that the whole show is convoluted.  Not only is the story complex but it is unnecessarily complex. There is a lot of different factions andrules for these factions. A person may not be able to attack someone if they are a member of a certain faction so long as that person doesn't interact with members of this other faction. Also the way the members of different factions interact don't make any sense. Enemies have lunch with one another, making all the separate groups feel pointless. Just to make sure I don't care about these groups at all the show decided to pick the stupidest and nonsensical covers possible. There is the School Student Council, The Science Club, The Second School Student Council, and it goes from there. Each name more meaningless then the last.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this complexity between groups it would makes sense that the story was equally deep, but actually the storyline is very shallow. Some young boy gets a package that holds one of the most powerful magical mechs in the world. Some event needs to be stopped or the world will end. The thing is 13 episodes later I still don't know what that event is and why the world will be destroy. There is a mysterious quality to all of this at first but that soon goes away after the story stops moving forward and the show doesn't seem to be concerned in answering any of the questions it brought up. To be completely fair this isn't the complete story, there is another show, but at the end of the last episode I still don't have enough information to understand so of the basic/core elements of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a mecha show, and with that comes a few action scenes. The quality of the action varies a lot. Most of it is the one mech does its super move and then the other mech does its super move and the fight is over. There are the few the go outside of this norm. These are well done and interesting. Still more often than not the mech scenes are kind of lame. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things I didn't completely hate in the show was the comedy. The comedy is definitely on the corny side. Expect jokes about Tomo(the male lead) and breasts along with a few toilet jokes. Probably not everyones taste but I kind of like it. However with a few laughs come a honorable sense of timing. I can't count the number of times that the show tells a joke that just destroys what little pacing the show had. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved most about the show was the relationship between the two main characters. The personalities of Tomo and Misao play off one another so well. Those 2 would bring a smile too my face more often then not. The rest of the cast didn't deliver quite as many smiles. They start out good. Each character is given a deep back story and a personality that is all their own. That is where it ends, the show doesn't do anything with the characters after that. I don't mean the show does a poor job of developing them, I mean the show literally doesn't do anything with them. In some cases you don't even see them for 4 or 5 episodes and in the 13 episode show 4 or 5 episodes is kind of a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nIs \u201cAsura Cryin\u201d a good show, not really. Does \"Asura Cryin\" have its moments, you bet. There were times it made me laugh and the 2 main characters are a joy to watch. It is too bad the there is a lot more bad then good in the show. The rest of the cast could be described as \u201cthin\u201d at best and after the 3rd episode I stopped caring about the story line.\\n",

Enough for some tearjerkers.\r\nThe first season lacks big parts of the backstory since this was put into the second season of the anime. Whoever starts this anime has to prepared to watch both seasons, because without the 2nd season it is way to incomplete to be satisfied. Sounds negative, butisn't actually a bad thing. Different from other anime series that give you many hints about the \"finished puzzle\", you get some pieces, but not enough for the outcome to not be surprising.\\n\r\nIt is a light novel series compressed into two anime seasons, so many points sadly can't be clarified.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite those complaints, Asura Cryin' is a series that can be enjoyed if you are ready to put some own toughts into it to follow the plot.",

Asura Cryin\u2019 is that anime. \r\nThe story was all over the place, with massive amounts of hinting and mysterious comments, but little to no closure on even what the story\u2019s goal is. This, in itself, is not a problem. Other anime (and stories in general) have managed to pull this sort of mysterious atmosphere off, and still be enjoyable. But AC shootsdown any possibility of such easygoing enjoyment by filling in its awkward silences of confusion with fan service shattering any amount of depth it just barely managed to have. \\n\\n\r\nThere were other things I would have appreciated being clarified. Such as the school. Why are there three student councils? Later it seems the Asura Machina thing is not known school-wide, and is a secret society. It seems a bit difficult for it to be secret when it\u2019s run by the student councils. Why this school? \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, it was not much better. The different factions in the first few episodes wanted to kill each other, but managed to almost immediately be buddy-buddy without transition. There isn\u2019t even a common enemy for them to be going up against until the end! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this had its moments. I enjoyed Reishirou. But it asked a ton of questions without giving enough answers, or an interesting enough storyline, for me to care. If I want to see giant robots duke it out, I could watch Gurren Lagann that at least has a unique plot and story line. Or, Infinite Stratos that makes no secret what-so-ever that it\u2019s going to be shallow, harem mecha and nothing else.  \\n\\n\r\n(review feedback appreciated. positive or negative. if something was not clear, please let me know and I'll strive to strengthen that area in my writing.)",

            "content": "Asura Cryin is a series that seems to be about ghosts... but then turns into a story about mechs and humanoid demons. It is a combination of comedy/mystery/action/mech. I originally jumped on this series due to some fairly interesting teasers and good OP/ED. However, the series seems to hide everything from the viewer to the extent that I ended up confused after each episode. The character development seems half-hearted and the story, though eventually interesting, is cryptic for the majority of the show. If you have a short patience, this isn't your show.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation quality is fairly good throughout. Colors are vivid, effects are ofgood quality, and characters are well drawn, though I don't know how being a demon entails multiple eye colors... Sadly, all the mech scenes, and a significant part of the fx, are done with CG, and not in a good way. It is used enough that it seemed to be a huge cost-cutting measure.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were above average with an electro based OP and eerily dark ED. The bgm is average but decent. The only VA that stands out here is Misao. I didn't find anyone that outstanding. I was also wondering why one of the girls is like monotone all the time (explained near the end of the show).\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 4/5, VA: 3/5\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAsura Cryin seems to merge verbally-named special attacks from  with the random appearing mech aspect of Kyoshiro and a ghost/apparition aspect of . The combination of so many disparate bases doesn't mix very well, yielding an angry fruit salad based product that is anything but smooth.\\n\\n\r\nThere are constantly mysterious themes that repeat throughout the show that are either only explained near the very end or (for the most part) are totally unanswered. It was very displeasing to finish the show and still have no idea what the majority of the show was about. The only consoling aspect is the fact that there will be a second season. The second season does yield more dividends, see that review for more details.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters feel very underdeveloped in this series, mostly since additional background will be given in the second season. For this series, much of the characters pasts are completely unknown and the rare flashbacks that the series provides tends to beget even more questions. The lack of story focus carries on here as well as numerous secondary characters appear, play a significant role in a single instance, and then join the gang and from that point onwards play a minor role (until maybe the second season?). Regardless, it was difficult balancing so many seemingly unimportant characters.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThere are some humorous moments, some occurrences that are just wrong, a bit of fan service, and a few relaxing moments. However, the majority of this series can be described as chaotic and anything but normal slice of life. It tries to bolt on too many features to the extent that none of the characteristics stand out in the end.",

It's an enjoyable anime overall but it does have some shortcomings.\r\nThere are some parts of the story that they went out of their way to make viewers realize what's going on.  They pushed so hard that they made the main character seem dim witted and unable to do simple guess work.  I'm not sure why they did this but it did take away from the story for me.\r\nRepetition.  Get used to it.  They use it a lot to fill some episodes to stretch them out to meet theirtime obligations.  There's a couple of fillers in the first season that I can't figure out WHY they put them in the first place.  There was plenty of story available to do an entire 2 seasons with but they really gyp the viewer with these fillers.  \\n\\n\r\n A number of characters blend in with others enough so that if you're not paying attention that you'll be wondering who you're looking at more than a couple of times during this first season.\\n",

            "content": "I was looking for a something similar to \"Break Blade\" which i will be doing a review on soon. This is the first season of \"Asura Cryin\" and will also do a review on the second season. So enjoy this review! \r\nCharacters \r\nThe characters in this anime are quite interesting. The more the story goes on the more you wonder about them. The more you wonder about them, the less answers you get. What i am trying to get at is, there is no background information on the characters. The development between the characters were done quite well, but we don't really knowwho they are. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that came out in 2009 they had a excellent graphics team put together and did a nice job. The fighting scenes may be short but are quite amazing to watch. Lots of action packed scenes with explosions, missiles, and mecha. \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\\n\r\nAsura Cryin has a great story, but lacks quite a lot of detail. A somewhat normal teenage life is about to change within minutes. Asura Cryin lacked in the past stories, but makes up for it with the \"present\" story that is being told. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nFrom watching this anime kept me entertained for throughout the whole anime. There were many parts that i myself was confused at what was going on. That being said the confusion usually ended after about 5 minutes of watching the anime. There are an amazing amount of questions that are just left un-answered. The anime is quite watchable even without these questions answered, don't let the confusion stop you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nI would say that this anime had quite a good story but lacked in the character background department. Because it lacked in the characters background it left quite a lot of questions un-answered. But at the end of the anime they announced that a second season will be released, and hopefully they are leaving that information till the second season. \\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion \\n\\n\r\nWell, my opinion stays straight to the point that the characters were not explained well enough. I mean there are a lot of characters where stuff is not explained where it should be. But, that does not ruin the story, the story is just amazing! I would recommend this to anyone who likes a Mecha, Action, Romance, Harem genres.",

            "content": "Alright...I'm writing this for a reason. To hope people will read this and so that they won't waste their time watching this anime like I did. I'm still watching it actually, and I do intend to finish it because I don't normally like dropping too many animes. Although if this series had anymore than 13 episodes, I might of had to reconsider.\r\nStory 5/10: Well...what sort of story is it really? There's little to no plot at all. The only thing I can see going on is that everyone wants the Asura Crying. First they're fighting, and the next their figuring out who to fight nextor being followed by SOMEONE and attacked. Same thing over and over again, and same characters doing the same fighting pattern constantly.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: The artwork isn't COMPLETELY horrible, but it isn't very good either. It's mostly the kind of art your regular mediocre anime would have, whether the plot be good or not. The style isn't totally bland, but it could have been better. The only things that really look good are the machines, which I assume the creators are focusing on as would any other anime devoted to the mecha genre. But seriously, I've seen better looking art in animes that are still focused on making the mechs and what not look the best from anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: What to say about the sound? I guess it's alright..if it was anything like Mars of Destruction then it would have only made this anime even more horrible. Thank god it isn't. It's pretty good, and seems to flow good with the anime in general. The overal sound EFFECTS are decent as well. Nothing that doesn't make it sound too fake. I'd say this is one of the better qualities of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: I was going to give this a 4...but I guess I'm being generous. Yes, GENEROUS. The charactes are pretty boring enough as it is. Nothing really original at all. They look boring as well, and the colors for them aren't too 'bright'. Not to mention their personalities are that of any average anime. Girl partnered with a boy that she probably likes, only to have another companion like him as well, as well as another sometimes sexually harassing him. Your typical naive 'hero', spiritual naive girl, girl with an attitude and a probable tsundere just for kicks. Although the REAL character issue would be the random million characters that pop up in every episode with no explanation about them, except for what side their on. Not to mention sometimes when a character pops up, they suddenly become BFFs with the main character, as to which the main character would probably risk their life for them later on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10: Again, I was going to give this a 2...but eh. As you can see from the other sections, this anime is just boring. I will admit however, that the first few episodes will keep you entertained. But only the first few..maybe the first 4-6 if anything? After that, everything just goes downhill. I really had high hopes for this anime..but after everything I've seen, it's just trash. It was ruined completely with all the random unexplained crap that goes on. I really don't expect it to get any better. Because truthfully, how can it? Maybe if they actually showed some sort of character background and development with the other characters, and made other things more clear, it would have been a tad more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 3/10. It's terrible..and I advise anyone and EVERYONE to avoid watching it so they won't waste any time like I have. I feel bad for the talented voice actors that have to provide their voices for this disaster. So really, unless you actually like watching animes with boring characters, confusing 'plot twists' with no explanation, and having a series that's hoarded with tons of random characters at once, then by all means, go for it. If not, seriously. Don't watch this. You're much better off watching something like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Code Geass, or Macross Frontier. Actual animes with VERY high potential.",

However, it is one of those storylines that as good as it might be, was definatly not executed to the best ability. On top of this, there are a few things that one should know before they watch the anime.\r\nOne of the things that is problematic is that the storyling does not flow well, there are constant flashbacks, and important details that help the anime to run are revealed at intervals that are not always the best time for them tocome into play.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is some of the humor that is crammed into the storyline. While some of the humor is actually funny, some of it is not that funny, or it happens to be put in at the wrong time, or the humor is not needed for the story to run along. Some of the humor is sex related.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is, \"Asura Cryin' \" is not really about the occult, and not really about the church. It is really a fantasy version of the two, where magic, demons, and mechas exist. Yes, I said mecha... technollogy actually plays a big role in this, which was not something I was expecting. But the way they work together is a nice asspect, however, not exactly executed to the best ability.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nI may be the only one, but I was in a way disturbed that two of the male characters had a bang of hair that was longer then the rest of their hair, like double the length, if not more. The art work, which is beuatiful, had been given a down trodding by such things as this that just don't seem in place, or they have a wierd effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on this is supreme. The opening and ending is beuatifully done, not to mention that the voice actors are fairly good. The sound effects also work into it well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point in \"Asura Cryin' \" is the numbers of different characters that are within the work, and the depth that has gone into them. Problem is, we only get a glimpse of them overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI had to say I enjoyied the anime for it's relativly neat ideas and concepts here, though I was disapointed by the way the storyline was executed, it seemed sporadic and disconjealed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is definatly not going to be for everyone. As stated above, it will have it's problems. But if one overlooks, or is even forewarned about the storylines... ddity... they might be able to get through it.",

I'm sick of stumbling on a harem anime when I was hoping for something with substance.\r\nAlso, this anime managed to screw the cliche pooch harder than any in recent memory.\r\nThere's the everyguy, shy and reserved Tomo. He has a ghost girl, Misao, following himaround. He has already met her in the first episode, so we're instead treated to vague flashbacks as to why the hell this is so. The only role Misao seems to have is that if you're a ghost, and suspended in the air, people are going to see your translucent butt. \\n\\n\r\nTomo also has a weird shepherd's crook dredlock hanging down from his head, so you wind up staring at it as if it's some terrible sore/tumor that's seeping blood and pus.\\n\\n\r\nWhat puzzles me is how blurbs always refer to the protagonist as \"everyday.\" If you're an everyday high school boy you pop zits and masturbate all of the time. Miko, gun-wielding demons, yakuza, and douchy \"holy order\" types don't go kicking in the doors and smashing the windows of the luxury home you live in by yourself with a ghost girl.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the premise. \"Everyday\" boy has a ghost girl and is heir to a secret briefcase that contains a giant robot thing that everyone wants. He goes to a school where everyone dresses like Nazis who have accidentally bleached their arm bands. \\n\\n\r\nThe flat characters from his double life conveniently show up at his school--because the evil types in the world don't hang out in political offices, army bases, etc. They prefer high schools, and the many beautiful moe-type girls he knows also show up and are more than willing to let him have his way with them. But he doesn't. Because that's exactly what an \"everyday\" high school boy would do, right.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two eps have essentially set forth such a ludicrious premise that world destruction, the briefcase, moe demon chicks, and the various goons of the yakuza and holy order are linked. And Tomo (with his mysterious \"brother\" who remains unseen) is at the centre of all of this.\\n\\n\r\nGee, where shall this go?\\n\\n\r\nUnless I drop this, I'll update in mid-season.",

Every episode, It'll change scene or introduce new unexplained characters who instantly merge themselves into the story with all the sensitivity of a blunt axe swinging down onto a solid block of steel. I suppose if you were to watch it again and again, you may just glimpse the actual plot that does its best to stay away from its rightful position. therefore,2. 1 is reserved for no-plot anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nIts not great but its not bad either. There are some bits where I would question whether the artist was feeling alright because the proportions are a little off. Its colourful, which boosts its rating and there's some effort done on the 'robot' things. The artwork is pretty much 'Meh' and gets a middle mark.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound is good. Sound showcases the seiyuu's talent and rather nice BGM. There's a BOOM when an explosion occurs, a brrrooOOMM when a motorbike moves and even some hydrauliky sounds when the robots move. Its good. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing that makes it exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDear Lord, please throttle them now. It gets as high as 3 because there are some ok characters in it. And by ok, I mean slightly amusing. But the rest, like the idiot main character and everyone that calls him by his full name more than once, are abysmal. Their personalities are messed up, they have such bad decision making and negotiating skills like: \"be our POW or die from the 50 bagillion guns pointed at you by year older high school students\" The main then replies \"That's soo unfair! you're mean! *pouts*\" Horrific.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell aside from EVERYTHING else, the fight scenes are alright and the poor usage of comedy makes me feel so sympathetic that I give them the undeserving score of 4. I think i've laughed once during my time watching it, I could be mistaken; Its so hard to remember between the frowns and disgust that surface every few minutes. I would not watch this ever again and may delete it from my library. The second series will be ignored and I will watch Kobato by CLAMP instead. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nCrap. Pigs spew. Grandma Dorris's hairy arse.\\n\r\nIf you want to waste 260 hours of your 700,000+/- hour lifespan, then by all means, watch Asura Cryin'. Thank you for your time XD\\n\\n\r\n*Bows Low*",

When you see Asura Cryin, you think slice of life, or romance, you dont think at all that it would be a battle anime, but lo and behold it is.\r\nthe story hasnt been fully hashed out after the first episode, so I wont really go into it, but there are battles, and ghosts, and magic, and mystery, and big suits of armor, so I think it will be worth the ride.\r\nArt is solid, nothing out of the ordinary. the Designs on the armor are pretty slickthough.\\n\\n\r\nSound again pretty average, the opening was catchy and had a cool Techno beat.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters werent explained a whole lot but its got a pretty big twist on the main heroin, the fact that shes not alive provides an interesting obstacle to be over come by the main hero.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the first episode goes, it was very enjoyable, the show has sort of a Chrome Shelled Regios feel to it, with a touch of Escaflone. If you enjoy high school life/ Battle anime, I would definetly check this one out.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This review will (probably) be updated after the show is over.",

            "content": "What to say for this series... It was very bad. \r\nArt: No, just no. The art may seem fine, but it really isn't. It is inconsistent and unoriginal. We see the creators drawing Tomoharu normally, and then pinning a hair tail and a squiggily thing up on his head to make him look unique, but it just makes him look overly retarded. Then we have inconsistency with the drawings. Some parts, we see the eyes drawn weirdly, or one scene there is a whole bunch of blood, the next there's none. We might say Kanade looks well drawn, but she really isn't. Not trying tosound like a pervert or anything, but the breasts are all drawn inconsistently (no, I don't only look at her breasts while watching this anime, just something I noticed >.>) All the characters have some weird hair style, or their faces just look really weird. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh, the things I hate the most. This is the funniest part out of the whole anime on what Tomoharu did. Kanade tells him not to use Kurogane anymore. Then during a time when Shuri was kidnapped, he remembers what Kanade tells him, looks at Misao, then summons Kurogane. Kanade tells him two times to not use Kurogane and he just ignores her, and then at the end, he yells why didn't anyone tell me this. He is the most stupidest and densest person in anime history. Not to mention all of a sudden making Misao turn visible. That was the most random and stupidest turn of events. Then they make Kanade nothing more than an object of fanservice. Making her say lewd jokes or having lewd things done to her. She clearly is  an important character, but...let's make the audience thing otherwise. All the characters have unoriginal characters or appearances. They are all stupidly dumb or retarded. \\n\\n\r\nSound: What to say, nothing really. It wasn't good or bad. At the end, they just used the opening and ending back to back. The music wasn't great, but it wasn't too bad. I mean when someone gets stabbed, we actually hear it. So it's \"normal\". The opening was ok, not really my taste.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Story is horrible. We see one episode they're doing something serious, the next, they're going to Hawaii. At episode one, they throw out all these questions at you. Answer some of it, and forgot the other ones. We see characters like the Third Student President show up at the first episode, then as if they forgot all about her, decide to put her in the last two episodes. One episode, they show Tomoharu meeting Yoh for the first time, next episode, Tomoharu knows all about Yoh and who they're talking about. Then we see Yoh injuring Shuri severely, then we see them in a good character relationship. The story is poorly thought out, and it seems the creators are just throwing everything out randomly, like demons, mechas, ghosts and a Seto Gozubarou type father.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Factor: The only enjoyment I ever liked was the fact that I get to see retards running around in the anime and doing stupid stuff over and over again. It was, overall, a poorly thought out story.",

Yes, the story is confusing, but if you have any brain at all you can figure it out. It's a very deep and very complex story that took me in. No, its not laid out in ABC's. You have to think about it and pay attention to the diolouge and whats going on. And if you do that then you you WILLl enjoy this anime. \r\n     This story's protagonist is a high school boy who,of corse, is draged in to the middle of this battle between conflicting student councle athorites. He himself is very unusual in the fact that he is haunted by his childhood friend(a.k.a. female ghost). Anyways, a lot of things happen and you DO have to pay attention and be able to catch the foreshadowing thats at play, but dont get me wrong if your too dumb to follow a complex story then this is most likely not the anime for you.\\n\r\n     The chracters I thought were very good. yeah, there are one or two generic played out characters, but the rest of the characters I found were very enjoyable to watch, And each of the characters has their own complex, unique and interesting past. I loved the characters in this anime; I thought the writers did a fantastic job.\\n\r\n     The bottom line is this IS a good watch. With lots of enjoyment factors. If you can keep up, your not gonna be able to stop watching. The whole point of an anime is to get the veiwer to watch the next episode, and trust me your gonna want to know what happens in the next episode. Dont get me wrong, there are a few loose ends, but they all get answerd and your never too lost. Basicly if your into to good animes with, what i beleave, beautifuly written storys that keep you wanting more, Then you'll love it. If your just lazy looking for a casual whatch, then this may not be the anime for you.  I'm Insider66047 and I say I'm phyced for the second season of this great anime.",

Sure, they try to throw in some normal segments of high school life, but then *BOOM* sceneshift and  you have no idea what is going on.

So far the viewer has been introduced to a miko who happens to be the daughter of a yakuza boss (or something like that), the president of the (what looks like cultic) science club who knew your older mysterious (OOOOH!) brother, a ghost girl who is bound to you for some strange reason, and some crazy \"religious higher order\" zealots.

I mean, when I'm spending about 1/2 the time trying to piece together what the hell is going on, you can tell there's something wrong.

            "content": "You will have to put a lot of effort to follow this show and frankly you will get little reward for your troubles. Many aspects have a lot of content to them, rules, ins and outs that you need to know to follow the show. However even with all of that I still have no idea what is going on with this show.\r\n\"Asura Cryin\" has a lot of problems but the one I had the biggest issue with is that the whole show is convoluted.  Not only is the story complex but it is unnecessarily complex. There is a lot of different factions andrules for these factions. A person may not be able to attack someone if they are a member of a certain faction so long as that person doesn't interact with members of this other faction. Also the way the members of different factions interact don't make any sense. Enemies have lunch with one another, making all the separate groups feel pointless. Just to make sure I don't care about these groups at all the show decided to pick the stupidest and nonsensical covers possible. There is the School Student Council, The Science Club, The Second School Student Council, and it goes from there. Each name more meaningless then the last.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this complexity between groups it would makes sense that the story was equally deep, but actually the storyline is very shallow. Some young boy gets a package that holds one of the most powerful magical mechs in the world. Some event needs to be stopped or the world will end. The thing is 13 episodes later I still don't know what that event is and why the world will be destroy. There is a mysterious quality to all of this at first but that soon goes away after the story stops moving forward and the show doesn't seem to be concerned in answering any of the questions it brought up. To be completely fair this isn't the complete story, there is another show, but at the end of the last episode I still don't have enough information to understand so of the basic/core elements of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a mecha show, and with that comes a few action scenes. The quality of the action varies a lot. Most of it is the one mech does its super move and then the other mech does its super move and the fight is over. There are the few the go outside of this norm. These are well done and interesting. Still more often than not the mech scenes are kind of lame. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things I didn't completely hate in the show was the comedy. The comedy is definitely on the corny side. Expect jokes about Tomo(the male lead) and breasts along with a few toilet jokes. Probably not everyones taste but I kind of like it. However with a few laughs come a honorable sense of timing. I can't count the number of times that the show tells a joke that just destroys what little pacing the show had. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved most about the show was the relationship between the two main characters. The personalities of Tomo and Misao play off one another so well. Those 2 would bring a smile too my face more often then not. The rest of the cast didn't deliver quite as many smiles. They start out good. Each character is given a deep back story and a personality that is all their own. That is where it ends, the show doesn't do anything with the characters after that. I don't mean the show does a poor job of developing them, I mean the show literally doesn't do anything with them. In some cases you don't even see them for 4 or 5 episodes and in the 13 episode show 4 or 5 episodes is kind of a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nIs \u201cAsura Cryin\u201d a good show, not really. Does \"Asura Cryin\" have its moments, you bet. There were times it made me laugh and the 2 main characters are a joy to watch. It is too bad the there is a lot more bad then good in the show. The rest of the cast could be described as \u201cthin\u201d at best and after the 3rd episode I stopped caring about the story line.\\n",

Enough for some tearjerkers.\r\nThe first season lacks big parts of the backstory since this was put into the second season of the anime. Whoever starts this anime has to prepared to watch both seasons, because without the 2nd season it is way to incomplete to be satisfied. Sounds negative, butisn't actually a bad thing. Different from other anime series that give you many hints about the \"finished puzzle\", you get some pieces, but not enough for the outcome to not be surprising.\\n\r\nIt is a light novel series compressed into two anime seasons, so many points sadly can't be clarified.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite those complaints, Asura Cryin' is a series that can be enjoyed if you are ready to put some own toughts into it to follow the plot.",

Asura Cryin\u2019 is that anime. \r\nThe story was all over the place, with massive amounts of hinting and mysterious comments, but little to no closure on even what the story\u2019s goal is. This, in itself, is not a problem. Other anime (and stories in general) have managed to pull this sort of mysterious atmosphere off, and still be enjoyable. But AC shootsdown any possibility of such easygoing enjoyment by filling in its awkward silences of confusion with fan service shattering any amount of depth it just barely managed to have. \\n\\n\r\nThere were other things I would have appreciated being clarified. Such as the school. Why are there three student councils? Later it seems the Asura Machina thing is not known school-wide, and is a secret society. It seems a bit difficult for it to be secret when it\u2019s run by the student councils. Why this school? \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, it was not much better. The different factions in the first few episodes wanted to kill each other, but managed to almost immediately be buddy-buddy without transition. There isn\u2019t even a common enemy for them to be going up against until the end! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this had its moments. I enjoyed Reishirou. But it asked a ton of questions without giving enough answers, or an interesting enough storyline, for me to care. If I want to see giant robots duke it out, I could watch Gurren Lagann that at least has a unique plot and story line. Or, Infinite Stratos that makes no secret what-so-ever that it\u2019s going to be shallow, harem mecha and nothing else.  \\n\\n\r\n(review feedback appreciated. positive or negative. if something was not clear, please let me know and I'll strive to strengthen that area in my writing.)",

            "content": "Asura Cryin is a series that seems to be about ghosts... but then turns into a story about mechs and humanoid demons. It is a combination of comedy/mystery/action/mech. I originally jumped on this series due to some fairly interesting teasers and good OP/ED. However, the series seems to hide everything from the viewer to the extent that I ended up confused after each episode. The character development seems half-hearted and the story, though eventually interesting, is cryptic for the majority of the show. If you have a short patience, this isn't your show.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation quality is fairly good throughout. Colors are vivid, effects are ofgood quality, and characters are well drawn, though I don't know how being a demon entails multiple eye colors... Sadly, all the mech scenes, and a significant part of the fx, are done with CG, and not in a good way. It is used enough that it seemed to be a huge cost-cutting measure.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were above average with an electro based OP and eerily dark ED. The bgm is average but decent. The only VA that stands out here is Misao. I didn't find anyone that outstanding. I was also wondering why one of the girls is like monotone all the time (explained near the end of the show).\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 4/5, VA: 3/5\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAsura Cryin seems to merge verbally-named special attacks from  with the random appearing mech aspect of Kyoshiro and a ghost/apparition aspect of . The combination of so many disparate bases doesn't mix very well, yielding an angry fruit salad based product that is anything but smooth.\\n\\n\r\nThere are constantly mysterious themes that repeat throughout the show that are either only explained near the very end or (for the most part) are totally unanswered. It was very displeasing to finish the show and still have no idea what the majority of the show was about. The only consoling aspect is the fact that there will be a second season. The second season does yield more dividends, see that review for more details.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters feel very underdeveloped in this series, mostly since additional background will be given in the second season. For this series, much of the characters pasts are completely unknown and the rare flashbacks that the series provides tends to beget even more questions. The lack of story focus carries on here as well as numerous secondary characters appear, play a significant role in a single instance, and then join the gang and from that point onwards play a minor role (until maybe the second season?). Regardless, it was difficult balancing so many seemingly unimportant characters.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThere are some humorous moments, some occurrences that are just wrong, a bit of fan service, and a few relaxing moments. However, the majority of this series can be described as chaotic and anything but normal slice of life. It tries to bolt on too many features to the extent that none of the characteristics stand out in the end.",

Get used to it.  They use it a lot to fill some episodes to stretch them out to meet theirtime obligations.  There's a couple of fillers in the first season that I can't figure out WHY they put them in the first place.  There was plenty of story available to do an entire 2 seasons with but they really gyp the viewer with these fillers.  \\n\\n\r\n A number of characters blend in with others enough so that if you're not paying attention that you'll be wondering who you're looking at more than a couple of times during this first season.\\n",

            "content": "I was looking for a something similar to \"Break Blade\" which i will be doing a review on soon. This is the first season of \"Asura Cryin\" and will also do a review on the second season. So enjoy this review! \r\nCharacters \r\nThe characters in this anime are quite interesting. The more the story goes on the more you wonder about them. The more you wonder about them, the less answers you get. What i am trying to get at is, there is no background information on the characters. The development between the characters were done quite well, but we don't really knowwho they are. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that came out in 2009 they had a excellent graphics team put together and did a nice job. The fighting scenes may be short but are quite amazing to watch. Lots of action packed scenes with explosions, missiles, and mecha. \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\\n\r\nAsura Cryin has a great story, but lacks quite a lot of detail. A somewhat normal teenage life is about to change within minutes. Asura Cryin lacked in the past stories, but makes up for it with the \"present\" story that is being told. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nFrom watching this anime kept me entertained for throughout the whole anime. There were many parts that i myself was confused at what was going on. That being said the confusion usually ended after about 5 minutes of watching the anime. There are an amazing amount of questions that are just left un-answered. The anime is quite watchable even without these questions answered, don't let the confusion stop you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nI would say that this anime had quite a good story but lacked in the character background department. Because it lacked in the characters background it left quite a lot of questions un-answered. But at the end of the anime they announced that a second season will be released, and hopefully they are leaving that information till the second season. \\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion \\n\\n\r\nWell, my opinion stays straight to the point that the characters were not explained well enough. I mean there are a lot of characters where stuff is not explained where it should be. But, that does not ruin the story, the story is just amazing! I would recommend this to anyone who likes a Mecha, Action, Romance, Harem genres.",

Well if you take into consideration that a bunch of random crap happens and nothing is explained you will understand exactly why I gave Asura Cryin' the rating I did.  Characters come in and out without any real explanation, and the story is no different.  This anime could have been a lot better.  It looked promising with the robots and the fighting, but towards the end proved to be another anime that didn't offer much if you are looking to watch something that makes any sense.",

To put it plainly, it's as if the story telling is just so bad that people who you thought might be the villain ends up actually being an ally, without questioning whether or not they could be trusted. Characters where youthink are enemies are just immediately misunderstood allies, with absolutely no effort to take time to explain an event that had occurred in previous episodes.",

I like this anime due to the graphical setting which is resemble to the real life, but I hate some points when they put the student's council role and school life that didn't fits with the characterbackground that seem older concerning their position on the each parties of Society.",

(reading over my review there actually isn't, so read on!)\r\nStory; 8\r\nThe story starts off fairly interesting, grabbing your attention and having you ask yourself \"who is that girl?\" \"what happened to that kid?\" The story line then progresses on, telling you about the main characters life and those around him. Honestly they had the ability and the resources to make the story line so much better, but all the same, it was still good.\r\nArt; 7\r\nThe art & animation, to me, looks like every other animemade in this era. Could've been a little better but what can you expect, its what? 2009?\\n\\n\r\nSound; 8\\n\r\nOnly because I really don't know all that much about what goes in to rating the \"sound\" portion of the anime, as I can't understand any of it without reading subtitles, heh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 9\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, were great. They're still not a ten / ten , but they're still not terrible. The beginning episode had you questioning pretty much everyone's backstory, and I for one, love when they do this. I love wanting to watch every episode ever made all in one day, and that's exactly what I did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 9\\n\r\nThis being one of my first actual finished anime series, aside from deathnote, I really loved it. I tell all my friends that are fond of these types of anime to watch it. I don't like watching any of the real popular ones like \"Attack on Titan\" and \"Soul Eater\" or anything else my friends all watch because, well, I like having a show all to myself that exclusively only I know about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; 8\\n\r\nThis is one of my first and favorite anime series, and I couldn't have picked a better one. Thanks to this website and the recommendations tab, I've found four other anime's a lot like this that I love all the same. Overall this anime had me yelling at my computer and TV, and out searching for the manga in barnes & noble the next time I went. I hope my review is okay, considering I've never done this type of thing, but even if it's completely terrible I hope you can get one thing out of it, how great this anime is in my eyes.",

            "content": "This anime caught my eye because it looked like a magical mech anime. My experience with this kind of anime is that it can either be very good or very bad. To my pleasant surprise although it is not the best magical mech anime Ive seen this anime actually has quite a bit to offer. \r\nThe story is very intriguing because it has many aspects to it from different dimensions to contracts with demons to our main main character who has enough girls that cause him trouble in his life. I felt that all the episodes were very purposeful and were needed to fully understandwhat was happening in the anime. I found the progression of the story was done very well and there were no parts of the story where it was dull. Overall the story was very good although it did seem alot to take in a times.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was one of the things that stood out in the anime. The animation overall was easy on the eyes and the mech designs were actually very entertaining to watch despite having a 3d design. The effects were a visual treat that brought  spice to mech battles.\\n\\n\r\nWhat stood out to me the most in this anime is the characters. Baseline they are already hard to forget because they all have their unique personality and contribution to the story. Character progression was what I was impressed with in this anime. The more challenges the each character faces the deeper the connection they make with the viewer and this happens as the anime progresses. The characters help the viewer understand the story better which i think is a brilliant effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a very good watch and has much to offer. The twists and turns make all the more exciting and entertaining.",
