            "content": "I don\u2019t know about you, but my high school years were\u2026 not very exciting. I spent a lot of time by myself, reading in the corner of the classroom or somewhere quiet in the library at lunch. I had a group of friends, yeah, but there were only a few that I\u2019d ever really talk to. Even then, I\u2019d always decline if they ever asked me to go out somewhere, telling them about how busy I was or how I \u201chad other plans\u201d. \r\nI never said much. I remember a few of my classmates sometimes asking why I was so quiet all the time, whyI only tried to just sit there and read. I never knew how to answer. That was just how I was, I guess \u2013 I didn\u2019t like talking, and I wasn\u2019t very comfortable around most people. Why? I\u2019d tell you I was shy, but I wouldn\u2019t be saying very much. And it\u2019s not like I was bullied or anything \u2013 no one picked on me or hated me in particular. I might\u2019ve preferred being by myself, sure, but I still had a few friends \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like I hated being around people. I think someone called me mute once. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since I graduated and I\u2019ve\u2026 moved on\u2026 since then, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it\u2019s all just in the past. When we graduated, that was that \u2013 some of us went to the same university, some didn\u2019t. I ended up cutting ties with most of those who didn\u2019t, and I still don\u2019t find myself talking a whole lot with those who did. But, hey, at the very least I\u2019ve come to realise how silly I used to be, trying to stay away from people like the plague \u2013 it\u2019s all just a natural part of growing up, and only now did I get the chance to finally join the club. \\n\\n\r\nOreGairu understands this. All of it. Everything. You see it in the slight furrow of Hikigaya\u2019s brow as his head rests on his palm, eyes brooding over to the noisiest parts of the classroom. You see it in the droop of his shoulders, hands finding solace where his trouser pockets were, as his bag bounces in perfect rhythm to each of his slow, dreary steps. OreGairu knows what it\u2019s like to sit in that corner of the classroom, by yourself, never talking, with you finding your mouth a little stale when it\u2019s time to leave because it\u2019s been closed for so long. It\u2019s just that OreGairu\u2026 does not think these things are silly. \\n\\n\r\nPeople are weird. We say one thing when we mean the opposite, we\u2019re quick to find flaws but we\u2019re not quick to trust. We\u2019re nasty for the sake of nastiness, and we\u2019re still all sorts of vicious to others even when we don\u2019t know it. People are complex and hard to understand, incredibly strange and all sorts of unpredictable \u2013 no one plays by exactly the same rules, and we will never reach a perfect understanding of each other no matter how hard we try. I\u2019m with Hikigaya on this one: why do we still keep trying to get caught up in this mess when we know it\u2019ll just cause us all sorts of problems later? \\n\\n\r\n\u2026Or that\u2019s what I\u2019d be saying a year ago, at least. Because to someone like Hikigaya \u2013 someone like me, in the past \u2013 we can\u2019t explain why people find themselves inevitably drawn to each other anyway. \\n\\n\r\nBecause to OreGairu, you don\u2019t need to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s how when you strip away all of his self-defeating cynicism and hateful snark, Hikigaya is actually a pretty ordinary teenage boy, with all the same desire, jealousy, and fear as any other. We see it when he\u2019s with Komachi: he\u2019s not with the outside world anymore, he\u2019s with someone he knows. He\u2019s calm, he\u2019s open, and she listens while he lets out all of his deepest wounds, all of his most buried secrets. It\u2019s no surprise, of course, when they\u2019re family \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for each other for fifteen years, and they\u2019ll be there for another fifteen more. Hikigaya says he lives the way he does because he has no other choice, but that\u2019s not true \u2013 he lives the way he does because he doesn\u2019t trust the world enough to share himself with it, to share the Hikigaya that banters so naturally and playfully with his little sister. \\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s a slow process. OreGairu only manages to give us a vague eventuality, a \u201cone day he\u2019ll change\u201d kind of thing, because it takes actually spending time with your closest friends to realise how far you\u2019ve managed to distance yourself from them in the first place. Hikigaya\u2019s finally starting to open himself up to the world, even if just a little, and through OreGairu we see how that can have profound effects on other people. Even then, he still doesn\u2019t get anything more from those who aren\u2019t close to him than a \u201cyou\u2019ve kinda changed\u201d, with them finding him only slightly less boring to look at. Because\u2026 that\u2019s how it is. Because it\u2019s the small things like that that show how, someday, maybe when he\u2019s dusting off one of his old yearbooks he found in his garage, he\u2019ll be able to look back on this moment as just an embarrassing memory \u2013 when he could say he was more open, honest, and true to himself than ever before.  \\n\\n\r\nMy birthday\u2019s coming up in a few weeks. I\u2019ve never been to many parties, but maybe I\u2019ll invite a few people to a movie or something. I know I won\u2019t change in a week, and I certainly won\u2019t change tomorrow, but in a year, maybe two, I might not be saying the same. OreGairu gave me a chance, and I\u2019m not letting it go. But I can thank it later. For now, it\u2019s time to turn OreGairu off \u2013 I have some old friends to catch up on.",

            "content": "I tend not to write negative reviews for shows, especially if they have strong fan bases.  Inevitably the fans of the show (if they exist) will vote your review down, and as petty as it is to care, having a well reviewed... review ironically means a lot to me (I know don\u2019t judge).  Still sometimes there is a show with such a glaring divide between fanbases that I feel like it\u2019s important to provide a fair(ish) criticism as to why some people may not like a show. \r\nWhen it comes to Yahari Ore..(I\u2019m not writing the title out) I am one of thosepeople.  For a lot of people the biggest issue is that the second season of the show is very different in tone, going from a relatively light hearted and bubbly/funny slice of life romcom ala Chunnibyou or Pet Girl of Sakourasou to a much more dramatic and somber tone as seen in shows like True Tears, White Album or EF a tale of memories\u2026except seemingly completely devoid of romance (you could make an argument to remove the romance tag all together).  So essentially the show has to stand on the overall quality of the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory-2\\n\r\nAaaaaand that\u2019s where this show really loses me and I figure people like me.  Full disclosure, I\u2019m in my early 30s.  I am married, I have children, I\u2019ve been away to college, I\u2019ve had real jobs in various settings, and lived a fairly satisfying and interesting life for a huge nerd with marginal social skills.  For me SOL animes with their ever present high school settings are only interesting if the story and the characters draw me into a space where I can indulge and escape.  That is not present in Yahari.  Where shows like Toradora or Kokoro Connect take the high school setting and turn it up to 10 with over the top melodrama or supernatural elements, Yahari decides to take a \u201crealistic\u201d approach to high school drama.  There are no over the top Tsundere\u2019s, no magical elements, no over the top characters for straight characters to play off on.  There is only the mild and meek interactions of a high school community, and for me that\u2019s just not enough.  I don\u2019t watch anime to see \u201crealistic\u201d human conflict so the whole show feels empty and drab.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, nothing happens in this show.  There is no specific interesting conflict driving any plot development.  The main focus is how these characters learn about themselves and conflict with each other due to their constant changes... but it's fricken boring.\\n\\n\r\nOver half the season involves the main character attending meetings about an event they are trying to throw.  LIKE 5 EPISODES SPEND 15 MINUTES OF AIRTIME OF THE MAIN CHARACTER (who is actually rather interesting) ATTENDING A MEETING!  I remember one episode spent like a full 30 seconds of screen time showing two characters walk away at a flat  angle with no music swell, no tension, no dramatic purpose, just a lingering shot of them walking across the street.  There is only the most marginal romantic development with the main prospective couplings.  The only comedic elements involve borderline homoeroticism which seems completely out of place.  There are no bombshell moments.  There is pretty much nothing. Now if you are a high schooler or maybe someone with a greater sensitivity to \u201cdrama\u201d and the struggle of being a confused and angsty teenager,  then maybe you\u2019ll enjoy it, but I found nothing of interest in the \u201cdrama\u201d presented in this anime.  Furthermore, although the drama is presented as   \u201crealistic\u201d I would argue that on the whole it is actually not.  High school kids don\u2019t act like this.  In reality these kids all act like emotionally repressed adults.  When real teenagers have conflict they act out or lash out, all of these kids just internalize and go mute.  If I had more time on my hands I would go back and count up just how much of the show involves the characters just staring at each other dramatically in between dialogue not saying anything.  The only decent moments come early and late into the show but by then I was resenting the show for wasting my time getting to these points.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 5\\n\r\nThis one is hard for me to grade fairly.  On one hand I hate all of the characters because they do pretty much nothing, they act in odd and unnatural ways but, on the other hand the main characters have well rounded and complex personalities that would be interesting to watch if they actually did anything.  The main character Hachiman could possibly have been one of my favorite SOL leads of all time.  He is misanthropic without being perverted and unlikable.  He has flaws but they\u2019re endearing.  His dialogue and analyses of the world around him is the high point of the show, or at least it would be if he talked more.  Most of his dialogue is internal.  He spends a chunk of the show allowing himself to be led around by other characters.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, he hardly spends any time with the two main female characters that we saw in the first season.  There is an interesting and well done moment early in the season between him and one of the main girls, but after that I am not sure they had another moment alone.  Instead it\u2019s him and the girls older sister, him and a popular guy from school him and a girl he used to like years ago, him and a third main female character who is pretty uninteresting.  When the show finally gets back to him and the main girls they were having a falling out of sorts and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t understand why.  At first you might think it was cause I wasn\u2019t paying attention, but in reality it\u2019s cause there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a reason.  If you check out the boards you will see plenty of threads looking for an explanation of the what\u2019s and the why\u2019s of these sleep inducing conflicts.  Why is Yukino mad at Hachiman again?  Who is it that Hayama actually likes and why.  Where the hell is Zaimokuza this whole time(yeah remember him). Seriously if you look at the forum there's more fan theory's than a five nights at freddie's message board.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the character notes are subtle and understated.  In a live action show where facial expressions and dynamic directing can help show an important development instead of telling it, thisworks fine,  but there\u2019s only so much you can do in anime for human subtlety.  So either you go read one of the threads where someone who read the novel explains what the problem is OR you are left in the dark. \\n\\n\r\nSimply put, although Yahari has characters who are unique and could have had some interesting and dynamic interactions, there is nothing in the plot that stirs the pot.  Just a ton of pointless angst.\\n\\n\r\nSound-5\\n\r\nI honestly can\u2019t speak well to the sound as I can\u2019t remember anything about the sound track.  The voice acting is pretty high quality though.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-7\\n\r\nThis is probably the strongest point of the show.  The animation is solid and doesn\u2019t distract from anything.  It\u2019s nothing special but it\u2019s brightly colored and detailed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 4\\n\r\nI won\u2019t go and say this is a bad anime.  There is plenty here to like, but buyer beware.  If you\u2019re looking for a more dynamic show that will have you hanging on to the drama or felling the feels or anything you\u2019re going to be disappointed.  There are much better shows for romance and much better shows for realistic drama.  But if you\u2019ve watched everything then go at it.\\n",

            "content": "\"What the hell is with everyone telling me to change? I don't want other people telling me who I am\" - Hachiman Hikigaya\r\nA sequel to any anime always presents a challenge to both the creators and viewers of the show simply because the creators have to produce something better then what it started with in order to satisfy the majority of people that wished for that second season and the viewers have to decide whether or not the sequel lives up to the expectations that they wished for (In this case 2 years ago).  \r\nLet me start by saying this... Yahari Ore no SeishunLove Comedy wa Machiatteiru. Zoku is by far absolutely brilliant in what it brings to a \"typical\" high school anime combining elements of drama, comedy, and romance into show that screams to be watched by the masses. \\n\\n\r\nStory: While most high school anime focus primarily on romance, drama, or comedy, Zoku balances the 3 elements and incorporate each to make a show that isn't over saturated with love triangles or clueless airheads that can't take a hint. What is also phenomenal about the show is the realism that it portrays as we take the perspective of Hikigaya and dive into his life as a ordinary high school student who just wishes to be alone. The story focuses primarily on the troubles and tribulations of high school life whether it be helping a friend with social anxieties or assisting the student council president in daily activities. It takes these everyday problems that students have to deal with and creates these situations where Hikigaya is forced to cooperate. What grasped my attention the most is how Hikigaya deals with these situations that he is presented with and what he does to resolve these problems through is own personal beliefs and the experience he has gained by observing society and the fake attitudes that people conceal behind a mask of popularity and social status. What drives the show and makes it worthwhile is to see how Hikigaya handles these situations along with his fellow club members and the sudden shifts, turns, and drops this emotional roller coaster of a show throws at you as you try to discover the \"Real Things' this show truly offer. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At the time you're reading this I can safely assume that you watched the first season of the show and have a general understanding of how our 3 main characters act and behave so I can make this short and simple. Let's start with our main protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman, If you haven't seen the first season then I advise you to go to that now because Hikigaya can be described in one word and that is Pragmatic. Hikigaya always takes things at face value and honestly doesn't care about what people think. He's anti social in a way that he wishes to be alone because he knows this would not only benefit himself but the people around him. It creates this awkward tension that makes Hikigaya either loved or hated  by some but personally I see Hikigaya as a character that should be respected because of how he analyzes the world around him which to some respect is cruel but 100% true. Then we have Yukino Yukinoshita, Yukino can be described as an \"Ice Queen\" and will literally never \"let it go\" if you ever cross her bad side. She's smart and beautiful in way that is both cute and deadly at the same time. She has this \"Royal\" essence that makes her a force to be reckoned with and her snide remarks towards those she finds inferior make Yukino a beautiful nightmare you wish you can witness. Lastly we have Yui Yuigahama who is our cheerful little ball of sunshine that brightness up everyone's day whenever they are feeling down. She is the type of girl that needs support and friends to keep her company and will do anything to keep that friendship lasting until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The animation of this season compared to last is a enormous improvement beyond many levels of quality. They switched to Feel Productions and I applaud the overall animation quality knowing how hard it must of been to make Hikigaya's eyes seem more dead then usual along with the cast being improved drastically in only a 2 year gap. The backdrops were stunning, The art style fit the theme well, and by far it was the best animation they could have possibly created. The opening was fantastic as I believe it was a better opening then it's predecessor and  the ending was also catchy as sung by the voice actresses themselves just as last season did. The OST's of the anime were good as it fit the show nicely at just the right times and I have no complaints at all for it was simply put, better then last season. \\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku did everything it was set out to do and more. It provided a story that made me want to watch over and over and left me depressed as I waited each weak for each episode to release. It brought back that sense of nostalgia 2 years ago when I was watching the first season and it reminded me how much I love Hikigaya. If you like an anime that revolves around a school setting where the premise of the story is everyday problems that have to be solved by someone who really doesn't wish to be part of society then please watch this show. I can't recommend this show enough and you won't be disappointed. The novels are the main source material where this anime is adapted from and I wait for the day that maybe... and just maybe... a season 3 will be announced. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Hahahaha! Been a long time since I have last wrote a review. This is going to be a little weird. Let me start off by saying that this series is definitely not for everyone. The people who should not watch this anime is...\r\n-People who have tons of friends and have never been hurt by them\r\n-People who have been happy constantly and have never experience loneliness\r\n-People are optimistic to the point of delusion\r\n-Basically, people who have the head ten feet up their a**es\r\n-Or people who only enjoy anime for battle shounen\r\nAlso by the way,\r\nSOL-Slice of Life\r\nRomCom-Romantic Comedy\r\n*I'm going to be using those abbreviations A LOT!\r\nStory:8\r\nOne ofthe the many good points of this series. My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU is very contrary to its name. Instead of acting as most ordinary SOL RomCom (Harem galore, Idiot Protagonist, generic females, et cetera), it acts more like a deconstruction of the genre instead. It's a story that while on paper is mundane, is told from an interesting point of view of a pessessmistic but kind loner. That is what makes the story good and better then the average RomCom. We recieve various monologue from the protagonist, Hachiman Hikigaya(8man) so while the story itself is somewhat mundane, the actions that Hachiman takes and the thoughts he thinks make the story compelling and intriguing to watch. The story continues from the first season, as Hachiman continues to solve problems that are brought to the Service Club. However unlike the first season the second is much less comedic and more heavily invested on the complex emotions of the multiple characters that the show presents. Despite being a \u201cromance\u201d anime, it isn\u2019t the shows full focus. There are a lot of that, and many teasing of characters being liking each other, but it is a secondary concern below just simple friendship and character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe art from this season is a large step-up from the original one. The character designs being the biggest change. At first, I actively disliked it at first, but as I continue to watched the character designs began to not only grow on me, but grew to the point where I like it more the original. Their looks now allow for more emotions and are less stiff. Studio Feels also manage to create great animation that allow you to be able to understand character thoughts just through their movements. All and all, the art and animation for the second season was fantastic, and while not as flashy or pretty as some of the action series as of late, but it is quite stunning in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe opening was actually pretty average for the most part, and in to be quite honest I prefer the opening of the first one. However, the anime counters that by making the ending fantastic and much better than the one from the first season (again, in my opinion). But the background soundtrack and voice acting is where this anime truely shines. Its subtle and minimalist tracks helps build up suspense, and allow for emotions to come naturally. The music will never overtake what is happening and will never be the star of the show. But it never needed to be, it being a minimalist type soundtrack. It purpose is to enhanced the show and what is going on, it tracks help amplify suspense when need, it also builds sadness or joy when it is played. A lot of people I know and probably a large portion of music-lovers out there dislike minimalist music so this track probably isn\u2019t something you can listen to over and over. That being said, a few out there will find this enjoyable to constantly listen to, and some of you might even find it among your favorite music tracks. Regardless, few can argue that the music got what needed to be done, and did it with flying colors. The voice acting make the already realistic characters seem more real, and makes for what they say actual conversations that could happen instead of just characters in a fictional setting, talking. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nOh boy, the character is where this truely surpassed my expectations. Being a RomCom, I went into this show expecting s***. As mention above RomComs usually follow a very generic formula. One of the ingriedients would be generic as hell characters, Idiotic and nice protagonist along with girls to fit every fetish and tropes to fall in love with said protagonist. This show does almost a complete reverse, with a highly realistic(pessimisstic) and intelligent protagonist with only two fully fleshed out and developed female protagonist. Let\u2019s talked about Hachiman(8man) first, as well as talking about how much I love it when a show implements catharticism correctly. This could range from when Hachiman puts down other people with his superior rationality, or when he solves problems by commiting social suicide only to realized later on that it was a TSPP(tempory solution permanent problem). His way of thinking and morales in life resonates with me on a personal level. Which is a large reason why Hachiman is a character that is not for everyone. If you could relate to him through life experiences or you\u2019re able to understand and realize his viewpoints on life then he may very well be one of your favorite main character in any series, SOL RomCom or otherwise as he was for me. If you\u2019re one of the people mention on the list of people who would hate this anime, Hachiman is probably the biggest reason why. He is negative, and cynical, which is great as now their is a main protagonist that is similar to me and millions of other people out their who aren\u2019t optimistic as soceity tells us we should be. Now on to the female leads, which we have two of. Yukino being the first one we are introduced to, and like Hachiman, is a loner and has been bullied in her younger years. Unlike Hachiman however, she is far more successful and thus, sometimes have a superiority complex. She faces many of the same problem that faces Hachiman, but many of the times these problems require different solutions and are caused by different causes for the two characters. So it makes the two characters, while similar, also distinctively different. This causes many opportunities for the the. Final, but definitely not last of the main characters, is Yui. She is the bubbly, happy, social type. And she is absolutely and one hundred percent necessary for the show to work. She acts as a foil to the two other main characters, but in some odd way is still as completely relatable as the other two. Her interaction and chemistry with the other two is at times comedic, and at other time emotional brings along a whole entire other sets of problems. Her character brings to light an entire different view point and to put it simply, without Yui, the entire show would be completely different and more than likely, no where near as good. The most important thing about the supporting cast is each supporting member is that each one is a fully fleshed out character and anyone who is named would likely show up more then once. They are each filled with their owned personalities that are not just generic tropes, each often having problems that can watchers can relate to. Each are realistic, such as Hayama who despite at first seems like a Gary Stu, later turn out to be just as troubled and filled with problems as everyone else in the show, or Komachi who (for the first time in forever not a love interest), actually act as a simply would to the main character. Having fights with him, giving advice, understanding, apologizing for mistake, et cetera. All this combined with the emotionally broken and trouble main characters each being rejected by society in some way make this show have the most diverse set of characters and one of the most realistic and relatable group I have ever seen from not only anime, but from a story in general.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nLike all my other reviews, the enjoyment is not factored into the final review, so this long section is completely skippable. What else is there needed to be said, everything that praises and critics (to which there are few) have already been said in the moderately long review. So lets talk about why this anime means so much for me (which again, if it is boring then is completely skippable), and while it rank at number two in my list of favorite animes. The reason is simple, I have never in my entire life relate to an anime as much as this one, and even more than that I have never relate to a character as much as Hachiman. Like him I have tried to reach out to make friend in the past, only to be left in severe disappointment. It didn\u2019t take long after that to just simply stop caring, and since then I have always been more pessimistic than an optimistic. And with every telling me that is an terrible way of living and that would lead to wrong to thing negative thoughts, only enhanced my pessimism, as using optimism to \u201chelp\u201d a pessimist really doesn\u2019t work. I could fully imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes and often could see the world through his eyes. From him getting rejected without much thought by a crush. From being despised from a trait that was gained at birth, and from spending hours simply doing nothing looking at others doing things that required more then a single person. I could also imagine myself in his shoes, when he was trying to do the right thing, but not being able find a method that would not involve hurting and most likely more then likely others. As a result even now, I only have a small group of friend and even a smaller group in which I can freely talked and express my problems. My advice for anyone who meets a Hachiman in their life and want to become friends with them would be to never talk about celebrities with them, but more importantly be patient. Just be patient and stick around and never try to \u201cfix\u201d them. My advice for people like me or Hachiman (which can be taken with a grain of salt) would be to stop thinking that your way of living is wrong, it just different. Don\u2019t try to make friends for the sake of making friends, but make friends who you would help you when ask, and you would help if they ask. That got a little heavy and I also didn\u2019t imagine it would go on a mini therapy (though I don\u2019t think I made a great therapist) session. Well that is the reason why this show recieve a perfect ten in the enjoyment catagory, that and because even though the show isn\u2019t gear towards everyone, I felt like one of the people that is was gear towards. From it storytelling, to its art, to it beautifully constructed minimalist soundtrack that I could listen to over and over again, and it splendid and beautifully constructed cast of main characters. Since this is skippable, let\u2019s talk about the romance to which I can quickly sumarized up with imagery. You see there are two gigantic battleship which have said and are fighting each other. There is also a ship for a cute underclassmate, but that one is more like a wooden conoe. Anyway, I currently being told to walked the plank on both ships multiple times because of how much I like the characters. What I\u2019m trying to say is I have literally no idea what side I am on, and would be happy and sadden by any choice the author picks for the main character. Which is kind of a lose-lose and win-win senario. Confused. So am I about how I feel.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:9\\n\r\nLike all show, it has its flaws such as the title. And as all shows, it is not for everybody. But if you have ever been outcasted of soceity either it only have been a while or for your entire dang life, I would urge you greatly to watch the show. It shows that your way of living, no matter what, is not right nor is it wrong. It shows the pros and cons to living like Hachiman, and living like someone like Hayama. I have already rambled enough out the shows good and bad points in the review sections, and have already said how much I like the show in my enjoyment section. There really isn\u2019t much else to say besides me saying that if you don\u2019t consider yourself to be part of these people...\\n\\n\r\n-People who have tons of friends and have never been hurt by them\\n\r\n-People who have been happy constantly and have never experience loneliness\\n\r\n-People are optimistic to the point of delusion\\n\r\n-Basically, people who have the head ten feet up their a**es\\n\r\n-Or people who only enjoy anime for battle shounen\\n\\n\r\nThen go watch the f***ing show. I\u2019ll end it here, just so you can so watch it, heck, I\u2019ll even include a link to the show on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\n-http://www.crunchyroll.com/my-teen-romantic-comedy-snafu\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I like it that much, and writing this review kind of made me appreciate it more. Not sure if it will have the same effect on you, but hey, there\u2019s only one way to find out.\\n",

            "content": "MOD EDIT -*The review contains spoilers*-\r\nOregairu has really built up quite a reputation ever since it first aired didn\u2019t it? Whilst the reaction to it was a mixed bag of \u201cHaganai if it was actually good\u201d and \u201cugh, this is pretentious garbage\u201d back in 2013, two years of steadily increasing attention from the light novel community and such have turned it into the only post-Spice and Wolf light novel adaptation that people can say is actually good with a straight face. The fact that Studio feel was attached to the new season did make some people moo a bit, but not enough to prevent itfrom reaching the top 100 on MAL upon airing of the first episode. And of course, with huge popularity comes a huge and quite frankly f*cking awful fanbase that I\u2019m going to swiftly ignore because I have it on good authority that reading their comments actually causes eye cancer and it shouldn\u2019t really affect any personal judgments about the show anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my own personal judgment, I remember being really harsh against this show back when it first aired, but I honestly can\u2019t remember why. In fact, I barely remember what happened in the first season beyond Hachiman joining a club with two troubled girls named Yui and Yukino who may or may not have a crush on him, and helping people out in his own cynical self-defeating way. I remember the visual design being kinda meh because Brains Base hasn\u2019t done a good job at offering anything more than stale colors for years, but they were still a better alternative than feel\u2019s usual output. So discovering that the animation and direction in this season actually put Sankarea\u2019s Shaft-like surprise presentation to shame was more of a pleasant surprise than Nintendo finally releasing a new IP. Third-person shooter, you say? Wonder how long it\u2019ll take for them to milk that into oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nI do remember the first season feeling like a load of build-up for a climax we never got though. Things happened, but the only real contribution to the story was some characters going through minor realizations that they had yet to use. I\u2019m fully aware that conclusions aren\u2019t the final judgment of quality and that buildup is important too, but you\u2019ve got to use that buildup for something or else you\u2019d just be like the anime version of Destiny: always on grind. So does the second season of Yahari fix that? Sure...in some alternate universe where good anime is more plentiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime continues from the conclusion of the school festival arc in the first season when Hachiman is confronted about his self-defeating personality and how it can be really troublesome to people around him. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from putting it to use in order to break up a confession surrounding one of his male companions and a girl he likes, which causes a rift to form between him and his fellow club members, who agree with him about as much as I agree with anybody who continues to deny the existence of global warming (how blind can you be to not notice our abnormal weather, you idiots?). This rift starts to grow wider when some girls from his middle school life, including one that he confessed to, show up around the same time a student council election occurs and the club is asked to help one of the students bail from it by nominating themselves. From there, Hachiman is put through the ringer regarding his own personal demons and if he can\u2019t get past them, he\u2019ll lose the few people in his life who actually do care for him.\\n\\n\r\nA good drama in theory, but the show enters Spice and Wolf territory in that it has a weak base conflict and it doesn\u2019t even really follow up on its potential. Imagine if you were watching a drama and the base conflict for much of the story was about some dude refusing to admit that he hated bananas. You may be thinking \u201cwait, that sounds f*cking stupid\u201d, and that\u2019s what I said with the majority of the season minus the f-word. It was impossible for me to hold student council elections on the same level as the highschool version of Jesus\u2019s sacrifice because A) it didn\u2019t work when Degrassi* did it B) you can still hang out with each other and stuff if the club doesn\u2019t exist anymore. There isn\u2019t any sacrificing schoolwork and your future for the club with no guarantee that you\u2019ll succeed. It\u2019s just really personal conflicts that aren\u2019t given enough grounding to make any sense, and it dragged out far longer than it should have.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call the conflicts as bad as Spice and Wolf\u2019s because there\u2019s more to Oregairu that makes it one of the better LN adaptations than furthering relationships - or as much you can nail relationships in regards to LN-like characters. Unlike Lawrence, and Holo to a lesser extent, these characters have some ghosts in their life and the relationships are a means to exploring them, even if it still doesn\u2019t do as much with them as it should have. One way to fix that would have been to reveal what Yukino\u2019s problems actually are. Yeah, we know she\u2019s bad at socializing, not helped by an annoying older sister who acts like a cocktease boyfriend stealer from a crappy doujin or an even crappier gross-out comedy, but the show is as fast to reveal useful information as video game companies are to release actual reasons to get hyped for their products. The name is there and it looks nice, but how about some actual gameplay, huh?\\n\\n\r\nSo there were multiple times when the show just kind of lost me, mired in the very idea of its self-loathing that it forgets to really develop it beyond its base premise and goes into Catching Fire-levels of \u201cholding out but have faith in us\u201d right down to having a very similar style of ending. And it annoyed me here just as much as it annoyed me in that movie, because it looked like it was finally going to get interesting regarding the relationships and inner-problems that the characters have been going through in its last two episodes. The characters make up and come to realizations about their current situation, but the future is still vague and you need to take more than the small steps you just went through in order to achieve real personal growth.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, the show ends at what seemed like the middle of a story that has had too much devoted to its buildup and we\u2019re not going to be getting another season anytime soon given how many of the light novels there are at the time this review goes out. It frustrates me to no end to see what anime could have been, only to come off as unfinished. Maybe you could say that the realization that the characters love their life and their friends and are even capable of romance is enough for you, but that feels kinda weak to me. There are plenty of shows on the Disney Channel that say the same thing, and being better executed isn\u2019t enough to really make Oregairu any different from them. Sure I wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable with sitting through love triangle drama, especially if it involves a man named Armani, but sometimes you\u2019ve just got to rip off that bandage rather than peel it slowly and prolong the pain by 10x the amount it would have taken otherwise.\\n\\n\r\n*I never actually watched Degrassi so I don\u2019t know if it overdramatized student council stuff, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me either way given how much else it overdramatizes.",

            "content": "Ah, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Also known as My Romantic Comedy SNAFU, this series is not your typical romantic comedy or what you may expect from it. It may seem like misleading sometimes but the foundation of this series is heavily built on our main characters rather than romantic relationships. Anyone familiar with the first season will realize that social commentary and analysis is a key part of why the series succeeded in capturing its unique dynamics. With the way the first season left off, there\u2019s more from where that came from.\r\nIt should be obvious but watching the first season isimperative to understand the second season, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku. While a good portion of the franchise follows a slice of life style way of storytelling, the characterization of the characters heavily focuses on their insight and what they perceive with themselves to the world. Take Hachiman Hikigaya for example. This guy is what many could describe as a straight outcast. He has build a social barrier with a personality that makes him the alpha loner. His signature dead fish eyes has become a trademark of the series. His facial expressions is the epitome of being apathetic. The things he does, the things he says, and the way he behaves around is an antithesis of what most people are like. According to Hachiman himself, he believes that \u201cyouth is simply an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites are born from the ashes of past failures.\u201d A self-proclaimed statement and like this with many others define what Hachiman is like throughout the first season. And in this sequel, we see even more of his social analysis of others and the world around him.\\n\\n\r\nI find it rather interesting though in regards with Hachiman\u2019s role in this second season. Early on, there are some rather memorable things he mentions that perhaps labels himself as a villain. However, there\u2019s also that sort of idea where he is building an illusion around himself to be friendly and caring towards others. Then, there\u2019s Yukino Yukinoshita, the cold beauty of the Service Club. Nicknamed the \u201cIce Queen\u201d, we can see her as being both a bit haughty and blunt. Throughout this season, there\u2019s a peculiar connection that she builds with both Yui and Hachiman. Our dynamic trio of the Service Club, there\u2019s a lot to go on about these three characters. Yukino\u2019s particular insistence on Hachiman to become a better person seems to further their friendship apart. Her own insecurity also shows throughout the season in particular with an election that she reluctantly takes part of. In fact, the election arc brings out quite a bit with the main characters. Yukino\u2019s desperation to protect her own self-image (furthered from the involvement of her sister\u2019s words and testimony) brings out a vulnerable side. On the other hand, we have Yui, who truly shows her own personality during conversations she has with Hachiman. Those magical moments brings out a sincere image that really shows selflessness. Speaking of Hachiman though, we can see that his actions speaks a bit louder than words. The election story shows what he desires for and wishes to maintain to create a stable life for himself. Take it as a grain of salt even if he shows a bit of hypocrisy of his own. That\u2019s youth for ya.\\n\\n\r\nAnother prominent character that makes her presence quite well known is Iroha Isshiki. I label her as much of a sheep in disguise. This is because of the way she acts and speaks despite trying to maintain an innocent image in front of others. Unlike Yukino though, she has a deep caring about her character. There\u2019s also an interesting factor to note about her relationship with Hachiman. Unlike many others, she seems to enjoy hanging out with him; perhaps not necessarily as genuine friends but rather someone she can rely on. I think it\u2019s evident that Hachiman is perhaps the only person she can be comfortable with as her true self. This is suggested by the fact that Hachiman has built this social barrier around him that prevents himself to change her anyways. This is perhaps suggested that they have similar personalities so in a way, Hachiman sees himself when conversing with her. It may all seem odd but the show\u2019s dynamic always plays around with these stereotypes. It\u2019s actually what makes this series self-aware and realize the importance of finding someone you can relate with.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the majority of the season focusing on characterization, we do get a lot of plot emphasis as well. Romance has never been a true intention of this series but the second season does start off with such a theme. From an indirect point, we still have Kaori Orimoto. Remember that girl Hachiman mentioned in flashbacks when he was rejected before? Yeah, that girl. Her role in this season is to get involved with others to get what she wants. I think Hachiman is well aware of this with his previous experience but nonetheless gets involved. Also, it doesn\u2019t seem like her perception of Hachiman has changed from her younger days. Needless to say, there is no connection between the two other than the fact that he can become part of a bigger game plan for her. On the other hand, we have Shizuka, the teacher and adviser of the Service Club. I can honestly say that she is a role model with her own ideologies. Despite her small role in this season, there are moments when she shines more than the others. The most prominent of this relates to making Hachiman realize the motivations of his actions. She opens his eyes to reality and I guess in some ways makes Hachiman think about the social barrier he has constructed around himself. The apex of the season makes Hachiman realizes what he has been doing and perhaps for the first time in the series shows human emotions; something that seemed inconceivable in the beginning. Honestly, human emotion is a prestige and I think this series highlights that in a lot of ways. For the way the story is crafted with the building up, purposes, ideologies, and whatever youth comes to suggest, it\u2019s a very realistic way to portray such emotions.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the heavy stuff from season 2, there are also lighthearted moments. In particular, I find the sibling relationship between Hachiman and his sister Komachi to bring out the humor. I think she is perhaps one of the only characters that he behaves casually around with like normal siblings should. There\u2019s also the Hachiman and Isshiki moments where she often misunderstands his words as \u201cpick-up lines\u201d. Dialogues work in a lot of way in fact for this show. When it comes to comedy, this series isn\u2019t shy to deliver that as well. Oh and did I forget that Hachiman always wants to protect Saika\u2019s smile? \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a major change in this season, it would be the artwork. Production studio Feels is now in charge with the producing this season so the difference compared to the first season is a bit obvious. It will take a little time to get used to but I\u2019d say that the quality actually improved. It also seems to be metaphoric in a way with our characters\u2019 development too when it comes to their expressions. Now we have more dynamic facial features, body language with emotional signs, and in general the way this series should be handled \u2013 to clarify youth. Character designs also has slight changes although Hachiman still retains his signature dead-fish eyes, Yukino retaining her youthful beauty, Saika retaining his trap-like appearance, and the list goes so on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a heavy as the emotions are, the soundtrack remains just as evidently strong. The melancholic tune shows is portrayed many times appropriately when it needs to and all the time reminds us what this series is about. Similarly, the OP theme song \"Harumodoki\u201d by Nagi Yanagi has a very smooth way with its lyrics to illustrate the mood of the show. However, the most prominent feature still relies on its character voice casting. Like I mentioned before, SNAFU is a rather talky show so character voice mannerism is exceptionally important to get the message across. Thankfully, we got Hachiman for that with his inner thoughts. In fact, all character voice mannerisms does a wonderful job at portraying their characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, I think of this series as both a lighthearted and dark driven work. It\u2019s never afraid to pull out stunts that may or may shock the audience. And in fact, there are moments this season when I thought characters go to a place where they can never come back. It keep you at the edge of your seat to see how our characters change or what will happen next. Rather than going with a clich\u00e9 romantic angle, SNAFU delivers performance with a magnetic appeal to human emotions. Director Kei Oikawa always seems to be able to appeal to these emotions to really sink the audience in. In essence, it captures the very idea of youth and what the first season has built itself around with. Just do be aware that this adaptation does rush some events and omit a few parts of the light novel elements to fit the show into a single cour. But yet, the second season still lives up to its hype in storytelling, characterization, comedy, and in general all-around portrayal of what I had expected to be.",

            "content": "Eh, so this is my first time writing a review cause I felt like I needed to review this anime. Sadly it will have to be on a bad note. \r\nAnd here's the thing where you give scores and write very long paragraphs for different aspects. \r\nI judge every category according to how it affected the enjoyment of the anime perceived by me.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story is essentially nonexistent, or moves at the pace of a crippled snail. This is truly frustrating to watch because of the lack of plot progression, and the lack of change in character or character relationships. The show mainly consists ofuneventful student council meeting scenes that Hikigaya attends and teenage edgy emotional melodrama(Drama is great, but this can't be considered drama. It's more like drama between teen girls who repress their feelings and refuse to share them, causing some awkwardly tense moments). Nearly every episode ends up forgettable and unexciting as I always have to search up on wikipedia what happened in the  last episode to remind myself of it. It's that forgettable. Since the story gets nowhere I end up having to drag my feet to watch this, which really isn't a good thing if this anime is meant to be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like the author of the novels, or at least the novels adapted this season, chickened out of trying to create some meaningful form of romance which was not blushing, because that doesn't count. There is a lot of ambiguity surrounding who the male MC is likely to have romance with, which is annoying because this is categorized under romance, so I expect to see romance. The author also forgot about the comedy tag as well, because there is little to none. You might as well rip off the comedy and romance tag on this show, because they've completely left it behind for some meaningless melodrama which I did not enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n(I can't judge the story in full however, cause it isn't completed.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nThe character with the most screen time was Hikigaya as always, with his ever famous pessimistic monologues. It's a pity that they didn't give up more time to explore what other characters are thinking such as the cold Yukino and semi-happy Yui.\\n\\n\r\nThey all seek the mystical \"real thing\", like true friendship with each other or something. Their relationships are all broken and superficial. The characters always talk and talk, very vaguely about the \"real thing\" and it's BORING. Heck, they barely change until the ending, where I still don't feel that anything has been truly resolved. This leaves space for a 3rd season, which I hope brings more meaningful development so I can actually like the characters and enjoy the dang show.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the other comedic purposed characters we don't see much of, the nerd white haired fat dude, tennis gender ambiguous dude and stuff. Those guys were funny...\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nArt doesn't really play a role in this anime in terms of enjoyment, but it was good nonetheless as terrible art would make watching this more unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nNothing bad to say here either.\\n\\n\r\nOther Comments:\\n\r\nAt the end of every episode, there was always this bitter and tense atmosphere left behind and it felt like it was getting nowhere. I really hoped there would be romance. I really did. The author probably chickened out because he was too afraid for there to be a love interest which would cause some backlash of dissapointed fans.\\n\\n\r\nHow it should have been:\\n\r\n(There's no point complaining if you can't suggest a way to make it better.)\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was a good season that drew many people in and introduced the characters, which some of the comedic characters should have reappeared in S2 to balance the always tense atmosphere of the anime. The second season had actual romance, keeping the mood of the first season. Despite causing fans to rage, the author should make some romance build up between Hikigaya and one of the girls about halfway. The other half could have been the other girl trying to win his heart, which brings about some proper drama, but eventually accepting it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIf you like melodrama with vague conversations on self discovery and fixing broken relationships that get absolutely nowhere, this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf none of the above, don't watch it. But do watch the first season, I think I enjoyed it.\\n",

            "content": "When Hideaki Anno, the creator of Evangelion said that Anime will die within the next 5 years, I would disagree with his statement. However, the only thing I would agree is that anime will lose its quality in the next 5 years. Everything has been rehashed and repeated from previous anime,\r\nI thought Winter Season was awful season for anime, but Spring 2015 proved me wrong. One example would be Vampire Holmes & Ame-iro Cocoa. Although I didn't see Ame-iro Cocoa. Spring 2015 has no interesting anime for me to review, especially Knights of Sidonia season 2. If you are wondering why I am not activein MAL is because I already lost interest in anime. And now, Oregairu Season 2 is one of the most disappointing anime that I have watched alongside with Death Parade.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (5):\\n\\n\r\nAs I have said, this is a continuation to season 1 of Oregairu. The 1st season was great and enjoyable and it is one of my favourite anime of all time. The 2nd season however is a boring and dull show to watch. I was waiting for the story to end and I wa not engaged in this anime at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I appreciated about the story is how the girls like Yukino, Yui & Haruno tried to understand Hikigaya's situation and how they learn how to understand one another. But I have seen anime that have done a better job in that area than compared to Oregairu 2. For example, \"Your Lie in April\", \"Golden Time\".\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was very weak and this anime to me felt more like a drama. The drama was weak as well.\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent. Although the characters do not look like their personality in the past season.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the opening and ending theme are standard.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nHachiman Hikigaya is one of my favourite character. The reason why is that he has witty dialogues and he understands the society better than anyone else. I always believe in him and his situation in life even though he has been through rejections and rough times. Everyone might say he is one of the best character. However, in season 2, he has no witty dialogues and he just gives too much exposition. In some situations, he easily solves problems by himself, although I also understand that Yukino didn't like the way how he does things in episode 3. He became like a wish-fulfilment character with no depth whatsoever. Just like Shiba Tatsuya, Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nYukino became more uninteresting as a character. Saori Hayami voiced characters that are cool and serious. However, her charm was completely gone. In the 1st season Yukino's voice had charm.\\n\\n\r\nYui & Haruno are the only good characters in the show. However, they were not good enough to carry the show on their own.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like the way Hayato tried to be understanding towards Hachiman and I appreciated his development. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters became more dull and bland as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI was not convinced that this season really offered anything new. I give this anime a 5 out of 10. I'm sorry. I wanted to say I enjoyed this anime, but I can't.\\n\\n\r\nI don't say that this is a bad anime. But if you enjoy this season, that's fantastic. I won't judge you. \\n\\n\r\nJust like Death Parade, this anime offered nothing to me.",

            "content": "Minor spoilers.\r\nA truly beautiful series. Definitely one of the best shows that has premiered so far this year for me.\r\nThe first season sets up the premise of the story. Our main character, Hikigaya Hachiman, is dragged into the Service Club by his meddling teacher. There he meets the school's \"Ice Queen\", Yukino Yukinoshita. The first season introduces us to the main characters, their strengths, and above all, the dynamics they have with each other. It is a melodramatic, typical romcom, with no twists and turns. Though I have to admit the dialogue and pessemism the main character shares with the viewers is quite interesting tolisten to. \\n\\n\r\nIf the first season is the set up, the second season is the ideological and emotional fallout that results from the mixing and melding of such contrasting personalities. We, as viewers, get a front row seat as the fascades set up in season 1 fall off and expose a flawed, yet strangely relatable, cast. Compared to the perfect personas we were used to in season 1, season 2 exposes viewers to a cast as flawed as they are genuine. Self-centered and rotten to the core, these main characters struggle, writhe, and suffer with their own desires as they try to keep the friendship they have with each other alive.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode appears to be relatively shallow on first glance; however, upon further inspection, there are deeper meanings in each dialogue between the characters. Initially coming off as small-talk on the surface, such conversations actually reveal more about the selfish motives each person has. Never are these selfish desires spelled out in their entirety. Instead they are presented to the viewers piece by piece, as if pieces of a puzzle, and even when all the pieces are out in the open, the answer is still vague. I believe that these characters and the dialogue they share is the high point of Oregairu and the sole driving force behind it. The authenticity and realness of the conversations they talk about--love, struggle, and friendship, isn't in black and white, unlike many other shows. That's why the conclusion to the show at the end of season 2 is as fitting as it gets. Not all problems reach a conclusion. In fact, we choose to ignore many of the ones we face in hope that they just \"disappear\". This is yet another beautiful thing Oregairu presents to its viewers. It shows that although you make an attempt to hide a problem, all it does is become more obscure behind a layer of superficiality. Superficiality never lasts forever, and thus you are doomed to face the problem you worked so hard to conceal--oftentimes with exponentially worse repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is unique in every sense of the word. Because of the studio switch, fans were scared; after all, FEEL isn't really the most high budget, top of the line animation studio. However, I personally feel that, although reluctant at first, I prefer the second series's animation over the first. It's more detailed, fluid, and compliments the second series's dramatic tone. Had it been the other way around, however, I probably wouldn't have rated it so highly.\\n\\n\r\nSound is beautiful, break taking, and outstanding. The OPs and EDs (of both series) are amazing, but the one that takes the crown is definitely \"Hello Hello Alone\" (Yui Ballade). People who watched season 2 will agree with me in that it's a truly beautiful song, and the way it was executed/placed in episode 13 was well done. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you want a genuine, down to earth romcom that successfully avoids the cliches usually found in many shows in that genre, look no further. I wouldn't say its sole focus is romance (or anywhere close for that matter). Rather, it's a coming of age tale of an antisocial loner as he meets new friends, experiences new things, and ultimately, finds love. Though the real question here is: what happens next?",

            "content": "Overall (10/10)\r\nBefore I really break into anything, let me give you a short quote from the afterword of the light novel's first volume. (translated by frog-kun)\r\n\"This may seem sudden, but the \"youth\" that is commonly referred to by the world at large is a mistaken notion. It's a downright lie. Going on a date at Lalaport in your uniforms with a cute girl, getting invited by a friend to another school to eat lunch with a girl... those things just don't exist. Those things were works of complete fiction....\r\n... In other words, that youth romantic comedy was filled with lies. And everyone is getting tricked.\r\nRealyouth was getting off school with just a guy friend, parking yourself at a Saizeriya and squatting there until night while surviving on only on drinks and focaccia. And all you do with him is say bad things about your classmates and complain about school. That was the true picture of youth. I'm speaking from experience here, so I'm pretty sure about it.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, I don't really hate that kind of youth.\\n\\n\r\nGetting excited about mixing together melon soda and orange juice and calling it \"melage\"... going on a field trip and playing mahjong with three other guys in the midst of that savage environment... falling into silence after seeing that girl I liked flirting with her boyfriend... now that I think back on those times, I could call each and every one of those fond memories.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, that was a lie. I hated that kind of youth. I wanted to go on a date with a girl in my uniform too. Hell, I still want to.\"\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru is about those feelings, what reality is like versus the dreams of the version we wish we had. And it leads into my favorite story of all time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I feel obliged to warn you, Season 1 captured the \"comedy\" portion of the title, with rather minimal (but a still existent) focus on the \"romantic\" part. Zoku is the opposite, it has comedy, but it takes a back seat to the romance.\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nZoku picks up right after Season 1. I'm not going to talk about plot here, rather how the story adds to this masterpiece, so don't worry about spoilers here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Zoku is at a rather difference pace than Oregairu's season 1. The first season focused on issues that were solved quickly. One request was covered an episode, or at most, two episodes. The pacing of Zoku is much slower, and in my opinion better. \\n\\n\r\nBut that pacing has a purpose (other than the fact that they wanted to get a second season out with less material). Hikigaya Hachiman kept making little sacrifices in the first season, ones that don't seem to have much significance, but over a number of them they build into one conflict that isn't so easy to solve.\\n\\n\r\nThese conflicts have solutions, and that's where the beauty of this anime starts to form. Almost every scene is seen from the perspective of Hachiman, When he understands something, you will understand it, If he doesn't understand it, you won't either, unless you have a keen eye. When he figures out the solution, you'll get it too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this adds so much to the re-watchability of this anime. Rewatch it once and you start to notice small little details that lead into the plot later on. Rewatch it twice and you start even more things that help you understand the characters (but that little facet is for later).\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nIf you are like me, the art of season 1 was great. For its time it was pretty good, and it was a bit higher quality of the light novel art, it tried mimicking the style and it succeeded. Well the light novel art did evolve over time into something nicer and the anime didn't just keep up, it outdid the work it was adapted from.\\n\\n\r\nThe detail of the characters, the backdrops, the sunsets, each of them have a beauty rivaled by very few other anime series. In some cases, there are flashbacks to season 1, so you have to go back to that style from the new seasons art which would break the flow and feeling of the scenes, right?\\n\\n\r\nNope! Every flashback was redrawn with Zoku's style so you feel even more absorbed. This is a nice touch that I wish more anime did when they make a season 2 with a larger budget and more time. It was always awkward when they switched back and forth, and that little bit of extra work was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful, most of you guys reading subs may miss it, but while the lips sync, there are like 3 to 4 shapes that the animators just run in a circle. It works, but it still feels awkward. Well this anime adds another 3-4 shapes which definitely helps. But when it comes down to important scenes, that's when the animation shines, and becomes strange at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nImagine drawing out the mouth so it changes shape and moves in a way that perfectly matches the shape of the mouth in real life. I have a scene from this anime sticking out it my mind it has that big of an impact. (suki... nano....) But that's isn't where this ends.\\n\\n\r\nMost drawn animations try to avoid lots of rotations outside of the opening, its a lot more work. So when you find an anime that does it a lot (take Oregairu. Zoku) it shows how much effort these animators make. You cant just slide things around and have the program manipulate a few small changes, the artist must draw. a lot.\\n\\n\r\nBut that does mean some awkward moments exist, because those things are drawn and chained together a smooth flow is broken. It's not bad, but its noticeable (like playing a game at 60fps then cap it at 30, it doesn't look bad, just strange and unfamiliar.)\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nI'm going to cut this short because it will just turn into a fandom.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP (Harumodoki) is sung once again by Yanagi Nagi, my favorite singer. Her voice is hauntingly beautiful anyway she sings, throw that together with some amazing composing and that OP is wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED (Everday World) is sung by Touyama Nao and Hayami Saori. Nao impressed me with the ballad version of Hello Alone back in season one (she plays Yuigahama Yui) and Hayami Saori's singing voice makes me want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nWell its worth saying that I ordered the CD version of the OP and ED's from the past season imported from Japan, I love these songs that much, and the lyrics are just as touching.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST itself is very beautiful and not only matches, but enhances the mood of the show. Rests in the music are timed at key points with the dialogue and the tension of a conversation that seems friendly on top but has a lot of aggression underneath is enhanced thanks to the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably guess, two of my favorite voice actors are Touyama Nao and Hayami Saori. In all their other works they've done such a great job. But we can't just focus on the heroines. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Eguchi Takuya. His voice acting is something else. Cold, dead, emotionless, perfect for Hikigaya, but when he needs to he can speak in a way that makes you want to laugh out loud (remember the \"guys don't only think about obscene stuff\" line from season 1, episode 1) He controls the flow and feel of the anime wonderfully, and he can play a full range of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one more person worth talking about here Sakura Ayane, she plays a new character introduced later (Isshiki Iroha). Her character is very difficult to play because she has a wide range of emotions that doesn't always match with what she's saying, and Sakura-san does her job exceedingly well. (I want to go into it more, but I can't because spoilers, lets just say Iroha has to sound fake and authentic at the same time)\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\r\nOh where to begin. The biggest and best part of this series of the characters, so I intend to spend some time here. I'll give an overview of what makes all the characters as a whole amazing and give a non-spoiler in depth rundown of each of the four major characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Oregairu special is that it is a story from the heart of Wataru Watari and his dreams of how his childhood went. He spent time thinking about the life he wished he had vs the life actually had. And what this leads to are smart, witty, realistic characters that the main viewing demographic (the otaku) can relate so much. I can pretty much all aspects of myself represented in each of these characters, although a little bit hyperbolized. (wait hyperbolized is a word?!?!?) \\n\\n\r\nAnd these characters develop and change in a way that seems so insanely natural. You finish this and you rewatch season 1, your first thought is \"was yukinoshita really this much of a bitch [that word was used in the anime, I reserve the right to keep this up even though it uses that word because it was used in the anime], Its not that her personality did a 180, its that you just never noticed it change that much because it felt so natural. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a point in this series when an unnamed character says one line. 5 seconds that completely destroys your perception of them, but it doesn't feel wrong, in fact it matches that character so well for being the exact opposite of what they have been acting like its scary. These kinds of characters are special.\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman:\\n\r\nIf you are expecting the heroic 8man here from season one, well too bad. He's starting to change, he still has his pessimistic outlook, but there are positives mixed it now too. He's the side of your mind that wants to give up when something, but pushes through because you have to. not because you want to. No one cares about him (or so he thinks) so he sacrifices himself, seeing no problem with it because the only people who would be hurt would be the nonexistent people that care about him. He's a loner and he can sacrifice himself, make himself the villain for others, because he's a loner. But oh boy that character development. (It's such a shame I cant spoil)\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino:\\n\r\nShe's the exact same as Hikigaya, but at the exact time the perfect opposite. Also a loner, she has the pain of someone who has. While hikigaya's existence faded out and was ignored, Yukinoshita was troubled because she was amazing and people were jealous. She could do anything she tried, she was smart, and she was pretty. Girls, prepare the torture tools. (I'm not jealous, no really I swear I'm not jealous). Yukinoshita instead of pushing through challenges she dislikes because she has to, pushes through those challenges because she feels she can change the outcome. You either give in to change, or you change the world so you don't have to. She hasn't really lived up to the classic image of a Tsundere. Shes more tsuntsun (hate) than deredere (love) for the sake of a description lets call her a tsuntsuntsuntsuntsuntsundere. And eventually all Tsunderes must change, right? right? there are stories that don't end that way, though. (I'm net telling you because I like you or anything, I'm just obliged as the guy writing the review *blush*)\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama Yui:\\n\r\nShe acts as the oddgirl out, and the bridge at the same time. Yukinoshita and Hikigaya are so similar that Yuigahama's character doesn't belong in their relationship, she feels out of place, she's that different. But Yukinoshita and Hikigaya are also complete opposites, so you need someone completely social and outgoing to break them both open and act as a bridge. She may seem confident, but she has the problem of having to fit in. She always puts on this face to fit in with her friends, she's gotten quite good at it. In terms of development, you she may seem like the happy-go-lucky type, but Yuigahama is actually pretty amazing. And scary as hell. No seriously she is the only character that I have such a hard time reading, I'm terrified. I noticed it with some small details in season 1 and throughout season 2, but really she's scary. (hold me Totsuka, you tennis captain you, you can make me feel safe. Oh wait, he's a guy like me. God is an idiot.)\\n\\n\r\nIshiki Iroha: NEW CHARACTER!\\n\r\nI can't talk much about her. I have to say something insightful about her personality though. Iroha is the flattest character you will ever meet. She's so 2D her character seems fake. Well that's because it is, she's putting on a fa\u00e7ade to hide her true self. She doesn't want to be hated, and she's pretty sure her true self will be, so she puts on a face. And we all know those are never perfect, they don't have the depth a real personality has. Go behind her cover, and all of a sudden you see this deep hole with an infinite depth. A little hint as to what to look out for if you want to understand her character, keep an eye out for her appearance vs her tone of voice, he small glances, and how she acts with just Hikigaya vs with others, how she hands bags around with just Hikigaya vs with others. The insight! The details here rival the literature you break down in high school English Literature (maybe an advanced course, but not AP)\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are beautiful, the lack depth in a way that actually adds insight and builds depth to their characters, they arnt static, they change in ways you don't even notice, and small facets in their personality and actions can be read into to help understand them. Honestly, I think these are some of the most perfected characters I've ever seen.\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is my favorite series ever. The calendar when I write this marks 2 days after Zoku's finale has come out. I've already rewatched the series already twice. I watched through season 1 in time for season 2, then season 2 weekly, then between the week of the second to last episode and last episode I rewatched the entire series from season 1, episode 1 through season 2, episode 12 in time for episode 13. Watched episode 13 at 2:00AM local time the second it got put up. Then I rewatched from season 1, episode 1 through season 2, episode 13. I love this thing that much. I own all the LN's including vol 11 which has been out for 4 days (at this point it time) (and I don't read/speak Japanese). Its an obsession. (Wataru Watari isn't bullying me into saying this, no seriously I'm really not being bullied, believe me, please.)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not for everyone, but Oregairu definitely captures a magical spark unrivaled by any other story for those that its pacing and style matches. And for the otaku, who lets face it in general happens to be the loner, it speaks to the heart. So, as I wait and hope Wataru Watari will continue writing past vol 14 so there will be enough material for a season 3 in two to three years, have a picture. It's taken from the Japanese art site Pixiv, but because that is loaded with R-18 stuff, I'm not going to link it there. Have my reupload instead- note this also contains all characters from BOTH season 1 and 2 minus one - from season 2) http://i.imgur.com/vnR7fdw.jpg The artist is IoNamichi (https://twitter.com/IoNaomichi)",

            "content": "If there's anything to take away from Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, it's that people can be very fickle, confusing beings. People are different, and that is somewhat to be expected. Some people are more extroverted than others, and some are more introverted. Some people are more perceptive and can read social situations better than others. Some people have grown weary of the strings of social stigmas and expectations that come attached when interacting with others. However, it doesn't really matter which type of social personality that one identifies with or how different you might think you are from your peers. Humansare social beings and we instinctively desire contact with others. We desire to be praised and acknowledged. We desire our opinions and actions to be noticed and heard. We desire love and companionship. We desire compassion and mutual understanding. However deep down inside, we also desire something more. It's something that we're often unsure if we already have or whether we can obtain it. Sometimes, it's easier to be satisfied by the blissful facade than having the real thing. Nonetheless, we still desire that little extra something. Something genuine.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Oregairu takes a step \u2014 or a few steps rather \u2014 away from the hook that grabbed the attention of many in the first season; it shies away from the anti-social protagonist point-of-view and begins to crunch down on the development of the cast, rather than the snarky humor, sarcastic tone, and dark knight approach that was prevalent in the first season. Though still apparent, along with Hachiman's inner monologues, they are not utilized to quite the same scale as the first season. If you came for solely those things, you'll likely be disappointed with what the second season of Oregairu has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku attributes most of it's focus onto the growth of the series' characters, rather than events where Hachiman commits social suicide for the benefit of others. This character growth extends past the service club, as we're given a little more insight into Hayama and his clique throughout the season. We're also introduced to Hachiman's underclassman Iroha, who adds a bit more audacity and flare to the character lineup. Along with the new addition of Iroha, the second season of Oregairu attempts to really push the romance sub-genre onto the stage. Whether you enjoy shipping characters and partaking in waifu wars is left to your own discretion.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the supporting cast getting their turn in the spotlight, the headliner is still Hachiman, as he resumes his pivotal role of the leading male protagonist of the series. One of the greatest aspects about this series was, and still is, Hachiman as a character. Simply put, his character is well-written, likeable, and refreshing. Hachiman's character as gone a long way from the start of the first season to the end of the second season, and it's interesting to see how his experiences have sparked his gradual change from social outcast to someone acknowledged by his peers. In addition to Hachiman, Yukino also undergoes a considerable amount of changes. Unfortunately, her family issues are only lightly touched upon near the end of this season, acting as the cliffhanger for the later light novels, and possibly a potential third season.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having a substantially different feel (pun intended) than its preceding season, I did find that Zoku had both merits and flaws. One of the biggest changes in the series, besides the change in studios, was the change in both content quality and pacing. As the series descends into more of a drama than romantic comedy, one would expect the pacing to slow down substantially. Oregairu has always been a very character-driven series, but with the extra emphasis on the supporting characters, there didn't seem to be enough screen time allotted to making sure key events and important monologues were executed coherently. As a result, many scenes felt like a contest of who could spill the most spaghetti. If you've read the light novels, the show will likely come off as disappointing, as the anime tends to look far more melodramatic due to less content. On the flip side, I do believe that Studio Feel did an adequate job with the series, all things considered. I thought the art and animation were actually quite good, though some designs from the first season seemed a bit better to me personally. I'm not one to nitpick about OP's and ED's, given that I usually skip them, and there wasn't anything noteworthy here. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest gripes with Oregairu, the anime in particular,  is that it is praised far too often for things that it doesn't really deserve that much praise for. Many people watch Oregairu and self-insert into Hachiman, which is perfectly fine since you can do whatever you want, but that emotional connection detracts from one's perspective of how well a story is actually written. I find Oregairu to be a pretty good series, but that doesn't mean it's time to sweep all the negative aspects under the rug simply because it's a little different. A lot of the issues and events in this series are excessively melodramatic. From the perspective of any adult, or mature individual, watching this series, many of the problems that plague the characters are quite petty. They are problems that should realistically be resolved by sitting everyone down and talking things through instead of having everyone play connect the dots. But that wouldn't be interesting, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe goal of many anime series is to promote the source material. In this case, it's to coerce viewers to read the Light Novels. To get the full experience, while also filling in the missing gaps from the show, I would recommend doing so.",

            "content": "\"I want something genuine\" -HH\r\nTHIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILER\r\nSlightly different from the 1st season who more focused to the Volunteer Club to \"help\" each other. The 2nd season are much more focused to Hachiman's character development and tp the people around him. Depend on audience taste, it can reduce the interest to watch. Imo, it makes the anime much more interesting because, for character who doesn't looked important finally had a development at this season.\r\n\"Too much drama\"\r\nSometimes, it can make you happy, sad, angry, make you wanna smash your screen, but first, Welcome to Oregairu where your emotion gone up and down like a roller coaster.Some scene is pretty unpredictable, for example, that scene when Hayato \"restore\" Hachiman's name after he being abused by his middle \"friend\". MUCH BROMANCE. The most interesting drama is when Hachiman's resolve a problem by sacrificed himself, causing further conflict. Very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n\"Hardly To Understand Dialog\"\\n\r\nOregairu is filled by a dialog who doesn't seem important, maybe the audience who likes a comedy anime can feel bored. But believe me, the dialog, all of them, even who doesn't seem important, are the core of the anime, and maybe you must really pay attention from the 1st episode until the end. The problem is, the dialog are literally spoken, so you really need to use your brain to really understand the story. For example, Haruno who being nice to Yukino and Hachiman, but it can turn to the opposite of it as the story unfolds, and led to speculation. But hey, it's woman, full of code and puzzle.\\n\\n\r\n\"The Cliffhanger\"\\n\r\nWell, maybe this the most obnoxious part of the anime where the ending, can't be said as ending. It's because the anime doesn't have the material from the LN anymore. So, you need to wait for the Volume 12 release, or just wait for the season 3. But the ending had the plus points like it can make so much speculation i.e \"What's the point of this anime?\". Why? because, as I said before, the last dialog between Hachiman, Yui, Yukino, not literally spoken. So, don't be confused if a confession can takes a 1/4 episode with a \"hardly understand\" words.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nFor those who already watched the 1st season, to watch the 2nd is a MUST. And for those who haven't really watch this anime, whether the 1st or 2nd season, I recommend to watch the 1st season first. Oregairu can offer a really deep story who need to use your brain to understand. If you don't like this sort of anime, with a complex storyline and so much feels, this may not for you. But if you love an anime who have so much drama and so focused the storyline, this is for you.\\n\r\nThere is so much lesson from this anime, i.e, \"Be a loner, if you lucky, there will be 2 moe girls who fight just for yourself\" Btw, ignore that. Even though you hated, hurt yourself, there are still people who care with you, Believe it.\\n\r\nEven though this is a romance anime, Oregairu still offered more drama between Hachiman, and the people around him, but after all that, we know that Hachiman is just a human, like we all. 'My Romantic Comedy is Wrong as I expected' isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this is my first review, so I'm sorry if my english is broken, or you're hardly understand my review.\\n",

            "content": "I found this series particularly frustrating watch, primarily due to what I felt was a fantastic lead character wasted on lackluster storytelling, vague writing, and uninteresting, underdeveloped love interests. \r\nHachiman is a good, solid character. His lines are witty and entertaining, and he has just the right balance of flaws and redeeming qualities. The relationship dynamic between he and his younger sister is especially endearing. However, most importantly, his character is relatable. In comparison, I found Yui and Yukino to be dull. Their characters display little growth throughout the series; Yukino is especially poorly developed. I found there to be little or unsatisfactory explanation givento the relationship between her, her sister, and her mother. Yui remains a cheerful people-pleaser throughout both seasons and is given little personality other than 'nice' and 'happy'. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was weak and meandering, even for a slice of life. The plot point of the 'contest' between the club members to see who can help the most people is introduced once in the pilot and then seemingly forgotten, only to be brought up twice more at random parts of the series. The conflict between Yukino and her family, which seems to me deserving greater - even central - prominence is barely explored and left unresolved. The arch involving the joint student-council Christmas event was unnecessarily long, and ultimately anti-climactic and boring. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, the writing bothered me. I found the conversations to be maddeningly, infuriatingly vague and loosely-defined: essentially running around in circles saying fancy words, getting nowhere and meaning nothing. (Ironically, the anime pokes fun at the Student Council President of the neighbouring high-school for doing the exact same thing.) \\n\\n\r\nI feel that this anime had the potential to be emotionally poignant and extremely memorable if only it had been delivered better, with clearer writing and stronger character development. A shame.",

            "content": "The girl asked: what do you have to do to keep going. And her brain answered: choose a number of things that will make you feel half-alive, half-useful...Yukinoshita did.\r\nWhy do people feel pain, why do people cause pain...the world is fun, can't we just laugh. The world is beautiful, can't we just look...Humans are capable of kindness and feeling good when receiving it, can't they just be kind...Humans are capable of hate and ill behavior, can't they just not hate...Yuigahama wondered.\r\nAnd Hikigaya was the person who took great pride in the value of his word. For he would literally rather turning into a villain inthe eyes of everyone he knew, in order to confirm the effectiveness of his predisposition and accuracy towards life, than having to confront the consent of those people in case his process of thinking proved inefficient. And as noble as his first notion and manner of conduct struck out, his second eliminated all nobility his character could ever emit.\\n\r\nBreaking out from ill, long established notions such as this one however, the individual would have to shatter down every belief and principle that led him to foster it, all the way to the foundation, and then reconstruct it  properly and accordingly, so that no vacancy would be left behind. Although, managing such dainty deeds would demand the abetment of a life changing experience. \\n\r\nYahari, narrates the way Hikigaya is running towards such an experience. The way Yukino and Yui find answers to their long-life questions...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe second season starts from where it was left, and once again it shows nothing more than simple high school days, without the plot being different or more revealing than the prequel, and of course not any less pleasant. In fact, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku might be considered a lot better and improved. Every shoujo anime, more or less, recycles the cultural festival, the traditional Japanese festival, the episode in the beach, the field trip and the valentine's day, without it being noted as something negative, especially for Yahari who presents its cliche in its own well executed and unique manner. However, second season's development is much more original than the average, consequently more intriguing. Yahari, which is characterized by that fluffy, light, butterfly like aura, maintains it and elaborates it further. The adjectives sweet, cute and soaked in sunset are fit to describe the vibe Yahari gives off.\\n\r\nAlthough the plot doesn't change, the development of the characters does. Everyone will be surprised by how much deep the author  can understand and exhibit human relationships. Through daily routine and everyday dialogue, Yahari makes you sink into psychological states, that aside being everyday and normal, their representation impresses you so much. While seeming like an easy thing to do, Wataru Watari (the author) does not only show aspects of the human character but also is capable enough to analyze them. After all, that is all that differentiates Yahari from every other shoujo anime and places it in a league of its own. Aside our three protagonists, this time we get a better and effective picture of the support characters too along with an utterly new one. Unfortunately, the screen time for the best girlish male character of all, Saika Totsuka is considerably reduced. We lose Hikigaya's incredible monologue that showed his messed up but still notable way of thinking by expanding it in lengths of the entire anime than to a single person. Whoever found Yukinoshita annoying will change his mind, since she found some sort of stability her personality and agile process of thinking soothes, to a point where it comforts you along with her. And lastly, Yuigahama finally reveals the first hints of the nasty parts of her character, which even though being flaws remain cute, same as  everything that has to do with her.\\n\r\nThe art is as good as ever, and due to the fact that the studio changes or that it is newer we have brighter colors. The buildings and landscapes become more unique and distinguish from other anime that have about the same pavements or houses or school corridors. Moreover, a number of mesmerizing scenes have been added, incredibly pleasant to the eye, like scenes covered in sunset or snow. The character drawings, pretty much remain the same, except to an information addressed mostly to the girls, is that their clothes are quite fashionable. It's rare and pleasant to see anime characters with a sense of fashion  except cuteness.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending is at the same level as the first season, therefore really good. Especially the ending that Yuigahama lends her voice to. As for the music during the main part, even though it isn't anything particularly notable it adds perfectly to the sweet atmosphere that characterizes Yahari.\\n\r\nIf you don't find the second season better you will sure find it worthy to be watched. Also it may surprise you in some certain parts when occasions unfit to its slow progress happen. You will enjoy the noticeable difference in the atmosphere and the  growth of the characters, however you may dislike the fact that it doesn't draw to a conclusion. It seems as if there will be a third season, but if not, you can always finish it in the manga.\\n",

No magic, no monster, no guns and no hot springs episodes. How can an anime like that survive in this day and age? I'll tell you why! The show has character , it understands the importance dramatic timing. Season 1 was more on thelight hearted side introducing us to our lovable characters but still have several poignant scenes underneath. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 was when things really started kicking into high gear, already well develop characters get even better while against high tension drama. What a snafu succeeds in whether you like it or not is subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nIt's doesn't like to tell what a characters true intentions are outright. It's like a puzzle, you are meant to pick out and piece together bits of it. From the Audio clues to visual clues and even so much of it is still a mystery. There are times when you feel like you got it then the show throws another curveball at you again. You are forced to pick up the pieces and start  again.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand how this kind of story telling can piss someone off but bear with me here the show is more than just pretentious. It's a rarity that a show can be heart warming by doing so little.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, read watch and play all snafu material if there's one series that won't overstay it's welcome it's this one.

On the art category(up), I'd say that it was a Fair since there isn't much on the fanservice for this anime to sell, but as usual it still rely on the school uniform moe, the sound (up) is good when we talk about the opening title \"Harumodoki\" by  by Nagi Yanagi and  \"Everyday World\" which is the closing theme since both fit well with the anime theme. Character(up), since the anime is all about Hikki's SNAFU Romance, I basically see no differences at all from the 1st sequel to this 2nd sequel, not even the introduction of Iroha and Kaori has contributed to any amount in this anime, in fact it only made me irritated about all the characters in this anime, on the enjoyment and overall of this anime (up), well it was fair enough at one point to be able to see the MC guy who wants to be an asshole but he can't were we see him do such task that seemly doesn't really make him an ass rather an opposite of what he wants to project, also there where moments as to the relationship between   Yukinon and her mom where at one point we were made to think that she maybe made  married to someone....or at least that what I think , but it was nice that it wasn't that way, but for me to give this anime's overall a high score was just isn't a fair thing to do since like I've said, this anime ended in a dull tune as excepted in most anime with a harem genre.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3???????? I think it'll be better if studio Feel and TBS just leave it as a light novel or if there gonna be a manga adaptation then leave it there as well if the next season will end up in an ambiguous  manner.",

            "content": "I first started watching the first season of Oregairu at the same time that the second season was airing, as I was seeing immense amounts of praise for the show and I wanted to catch up in time for the finale so that I could do my best to decipher it along with everyone else while it was still hot on the platter. As I watched the majority of the show back-to-back on my first run, I was able to form an immediate impression of the difference between the first and second seasons, and as I assume anyone that would be thinking of watching thishas already seen the first season I can tell you what you're going to find in relation to what you've already seen. If you haven't seen either season and you're checking this out because you want to see if the show is worth investing time in (aka it gets better as it progresses) then the short answer is yes, Oregairu does nothing but get better over time and watching the first season is well worth it to be able to see this one as well. Let's take a look into why.\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, otherwise known as Oregairu, otherwise known as \"SNAFU!\" (but not really. Please, no one let that actually catch on) at first glance will appear to be your typical slice-of-life high school romance focusing on a male protagonist and the various females that inevitably flock around him as he struggles to mature and find his place in the world. The first season is set apart from the fold not by its plot but by its incredibly well-written central cast and the well-designed drama that evolved from their relatable shortcomings. It's a show that rewards rewatching, as many character's thought processes and personalities are displayed not through blatant dialogue but through small moments, whether it be body language or some cryptic utterance, and the show is reluctant to ever lay out all its cards on the table for the lazy: from the beginning, Oregairu rewards attention and investment, giving more to those that are more willing to pick apart the show. The show is predictable in a good way: everything derives from the slow-moving yet powerful arcs of its characters, and the most powerful moments are often painful as not all of these kids have yet figured out what is best for them or the people around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was definitely notable: the protagonist, Hikigaya Hachiman aka \"Hiki\" stands a cut above the fold in regards to male MCs, acting not only as a window into the lives of the other characters but as an engaging and compelling narrator with a plethora of internal dialogue and a unique set of clearly-spoken beliefs about high school life. Hachiman's own development is probably one of the best parts of the show, as he struggles with his fear of non-genuine relationships and tries to understand the vast diversity of ways in which people's feelings manifest, and his character alone is really enough to make twelve episodes of content engaging and enjoyable. The other two lead characters, two girls named Yui and Yukino, are vastly different people and act as effective foils to Hikki, pushing and pulling to try and help him have a healthier outlook while also struggling with their own problems and trying to work out their relationships with him. As a trio the three are definitely memorable, and are a good enough reason to watch any show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the first season also had a lot of things I had issues with. For starters, the art was extremely bland: neither particularly pretty nor interesting, and though it was usually passable and rarely got in the way of the experience it never enhanced it either. The way in which a scene is portrayed: small details, lighting, character expressions, ect. can have a huge impact on how effective that scene is, and the first season of Oregairu did not really have this going for it. Even its most powerful moments were usually portrayed in a pretty cut-and-dry way, something that was at times irksome. The second and far more major issue I had with the show was its reliance on shitty formulaic slice-of-life contrivances, especially when it came to humor. There was a fair amount of tiresome slapstick and obviously unrealistic scenarios that clashed horribly with the show's amazing writing and characters, sometimes breaking the immersion experience. The plot as well was essentially just the characters meandering through your usual slice-of-life occurrences, with a camping trip, a school fair, a sports episode and more, and even worse these events felt very episodic rather than a constantly-flowing story. The show's supporting cast had some strong members: most notably Hayama, the model kindly alpha male with more than just a surface layer, but many of them seemed simply to be gag characters like \"yaoi girl\" and \"trap character\" where the majority of their interactions seemed to be defined by these single, overblown character traits. In all, it was a fun and intelligent experience but it was nothing I could call a masterpiece. Definitely worth a watch even on its own, but relying almost exclusively on its phenomenally written main three characters to carry a show that was otherwise generic and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThat was season 1.\\n\\n\r\nI'll never forget the first ten minutes of the first episode of season two. If it hadn't been for the presence of the characters I was familiar with I would have assumed I was watching a different show. As I mentioned earlier, I watched the first season for the first time straight into the second season, so I had only finished the first season minutes before diving into Oregairu S2. It was the same show, yes: the same characters, their same personalities, the same crisp dialogue and subtle moments and complex emotions. It even picked up directly where the first season had left off, so we were in the middle of the same events. But it was also something entirely different. Oregairu season 2 impressed me from the very first moment and every moment afterwards as it quickly solidified the fact that it was essentially a dream sequel. Why? Well, let's look into what you can expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing to jump out at you is the art. There is nothing more obviously different between the first and second seasons than the visuals. Where once characters were drawn roughly, backgrounds were bland and lighting was non-existent, now everything is brought to life with some of the most outstanding visuals and direction I've seen. The show becomes GORGEOUS: everything from the suns setting through the windows of the club room to the eerie glow of a bamboo forest at twilight to watching fireworks explode over the river at night, everything is outstandingly drawn and displayed. Rather than having to have to infer the atmosphere through the character's reactions to it, now you can feel it right there with them. The mood practically seeps out of the screen, filling your heart with the reborn world of Oregairu. The characters now have far more detailed designs, allowing for much more to be told using brief shots of their complicated expressions or body language, and this is something the show puts to incredible use. I can't get over how amazing it was to see the characters I cared about brought to life in this way, freed from their cut-out shackles and rendered in full illustrious beauty as they were always meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, the show has an entire season of development to build off of and it puts this to DAMN GOOD USE. Not only does it give incredible focus to the main three but a plethora of other characters get a much more dynamic focus, especially Hayama, the teacher and Yukino and Hikki's sisters. Rather than dividing these into separate and enclosed stories, season two connects the dots in the ways that everyone's actions and development affect the rest of the cast, and many characters that before seemed to exist more as isolated incidents now feel as though they are a cohesive and important part of a living, breathing world. Even the gag characters are now regarded far more as people, possessing complexity and involvement in the story beyond simply their tagline, which REALLY helped with the immersion. This is not to say that the main three get any less of the spotlight: the best parts of the first season were the ones that were most intense, the drama that would surface briefly before characters tried to bury it and return to the status quo. Season two features characters that are no longer content with the status quo, though. They have recognized that they want to be more than they are right now, that they want more, and that they are slowly willing to risk what they have for what they might be able to achieve. People learn to be more honest about how they feel, and become willing to speak up about that. Sparks fly, people fall in love and make enemies and lose things they care about. It's good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story: Oregairu season one layered phenomenal characters on top of trite formula, and witty exchanges on top of dismally dull humor. I can say with joy and exuberance that season two is done with that. The presence of slice-of-life fluff humor is almost entirely gone, and rather than breaking the story down into episodic events that drive the characters along the characters themselves drive the events, choosing where they go and what they do and not confining arcs of the story to the events of the highschool. For example, the student council election plays a part in the story, but it is not as if the actual election and the culmination of the character's feelings regarding it coincide: the election is merely something that happens, and the effects of it are seen long after the event itself has passed. In this way the story feels natural and as if we are following the lives of the characters rather than the events of the school. What you will get in season two is a pure, chocolaty flow of rich character interactions unburdened by cliches and nonsense and jarring humor. There is a solid balance of funny moments, touching moments, difficult moments and depressing moments, but all of them are handled tactfully and intelligently so that when there IS humor is feels more like something funny is actually happening in the world rather than the show creating something funny for the audience to laugh at. I had a stupid grin on my face on many occasions, and I was glued to the scene by visceral dread on many others.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, however, that even this second season will not fulfill the wishes of everyone. I got to see very satisfying and defining character development executed with immaculate grace with brilliant writing, and I was perfectly thrilled with that. However, although the characters could definitely be considered to have undergone full arcs, anyone seeking a conclusion to the story itself will likely not find a satisfying version of that in this season. I will be perfectly happy if we never get anything else, but I can't deny that a sequel of some sort, whether it be a third season, a movie, or an OVA series would be appreciated in really giving the story a fully completed feel. In addition, the convoluted nature of the way that character's thoughts and emotions are portrayed has been ramped up even more in this season and the show is oftentimes difficult to follow without paying close attention. It's not always an easy show to decipher, and it can definitely feel sometimes as though it is getting bogged down in convoluted melodrama more than telling an actual story. Personally, I found it to be delightful, but I can't promise the same experience for everyone, especially if you're someone who enjoyed the more light--hearted atmosphere of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, season two of Oregairu is an outstanding continuation of the franchise that exceeds all expectations and brings the show to a new level. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the first season, and I would recommend the franchise as a whole to anyone who enjoys good drama, relatable characters and good writing, and who isn't opposed to giving just one more high-school rom-com a shot. Oregairu may be in many ways just like all the others, but it does everything so much better that it's not even in the same league.",

            "content": "\"If this is all that it takes to tear us apart, maybe we weren't all that close to begin with.\"\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku, otherwise known as OreGairu 2,  has been my single must watch of this season. There are other good anime, sure, but this one takes the cake. Why? Because of it tells a story that is so believable, understandable and relatable that it is difficult not to connect with it in some way. It depicts characters who are deep, and full of emotion. High school is a time of growth and learning, and OreGairu 2 allows youto take that journey hand in hand with the characters. I know for me, at least, it resonated deep and was an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI suppose that the story itself is rather normal: but that's the beauty of it. In an anime like this, which attempts to connect to the viewer, the best way to do so is create a scenario that is very believable and then focus on the character development and interaction. The story is rather plain, but it receives high marks because of the way that it fits in with the theme and tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is great. Not much to say here. An improvement from the previous season, the backgrounds are serene and well drawn, and the facial expressions are so well done and convey so much feeling and emotion without needing to tell to your face. The characters are all designed well and their appearances often match their personalities quite well, making them recognizable. Overall, if I had to sum it up, I would say that you could take any background from this series and make it your wallpaper. Furthermore, the characters are all well designed and well drawn. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST is what it needs to be when it needs to be. It is calming and peaceful when it needs to be, lighthearted and upbeat when it needs to be, and sad and dramatic when it needs to be. I had no qualms whatsoever with the OST, as it greatly contributes to the feeling of the show. Furthermore, the voice acting is on point. All of them do so well at conveying emotion and feeling for their characters. The main trio is especially worth mention, as I feel that Yui, Hikigaya and Yukinoshita are voiced perfectly. For the role that they have and the personality they have, they are simply perfect. Also worth note is the OP, Haru Modoki. Having been introduced to the vocalist, Nagi Yanagi through Owari no Sekai Kara, I instantly fell in love with her voice. Take my favorite Japanese singer, and couple that with a beautiful song full of emotion and you have what I believe to be an opening in contention for OP of the year. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI don't believe that the characters of this anime could get anything less than a 10. They are so fleshed out and well thought that they feel like real people. Often times anime loses focus on the characters and they feel very 2D. Not a lot of development, very predictable, cliche and above all boring. Having an anime like OreGairu then becomes so refreshing. Somehow, OreGairu achieves something that very few anime do. It not only fleshes out its main trio, but also develops its supporting cast. Sure, the main trio is the focus, and receives a lot more attention. But the side characters are also very well thought out. Yes, the main three are amazingly done, but I believe that you could take any of the side characters and make them a main character of another series. For me, the notable side characters are Iroha (probably my favorite from the supporting cast) and Hayama. Both of them are fleshed out to a degree and are honestly unpredictable, making them so interesting. The interactions between all the characters also make this series shine. It contains a very mature tone, and honestly may not be for everyone. It isn't full of nonstop action and fanservice. Rather, it contains the characters who make decisions and face the consequences. It faces a stark reality that it is impossible to make everybody happy, and that in life, you will have to make decisions that have downsides. Furthermore, it gives a rather not subtle criticism of social norms, much like the previous season. Overall, these characters make the show, and are the sole reason that this anime is so good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOreGairu is so relatable and understandable. I genuinely felt for each of the characters and their dilemmas, even if I haven't personally underwent what they did. OreGairu tells a tale of love, heartbreak and friendship. It details the struggles of life, inner turmoil and the dilemma of priorities. Somehow, OreGairu takes romance, school life, drama, comedy and slice of life, a combination that we have seen a lot of before, and creates what I believe to be a classic. I truly believe that OreGairu will become one of the classics of this period, representing well the potential that anime has. Yes, it is a mature anime, but that is not a bad thing. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and will wholeheartedly recommend it to pretty much anybody.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? With the characters being as good as they are, beautiful art and deep themes, OreGairu is a must watch of the season and may be one of the best to come out in recent years. For me, it ranks up there with Clannad and Anohana, other animes of the same genre which are considered to be classics. I really really hope that there will be a season 3, as there is source material remaining in the LN which I haven't read, and that the ending of OreGairu 2 was essentially a cliffhanger. If you haven't seen OreGairu, then I highly recommend it, as it takes you on a journey that is priceless and irreplaceable. Of all anime I've watched, these are some of the characters I care about the most, and I hope for those of you who watch it, you can find something here for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n~Thanks for reading the review! If you could rate helpful or not, that would be great for me. Any advice and tips are also very helpful. If you want to chat about anime, I'm typically online a few times a week, so feel free to message me. Thanks!~",

            "content": "So every so often there comes an anime so good that you'll start digging through all of the forums you can find to hopefully find information on the elusive second season. Oregairu was one such show for me. The cool dark philosophical attitude of Hachiman with great supporting characters including two compelling heroines and superb writing all-around kept me laughing and intent from beginning to end. So naturally I was overjoyed to hear about Oregairu TOO! \r\nBetween seasons control of the show switched studios, which always gives me pause, and this time those worries were justified. The new studio's art was very pretty and certainlyacceptable, although the first season's art was more expressive and had some very fun exaggerated faces that were nowhere to be seen in season 2. And the difference in art can be seen throughout all aspects of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the anime had changed completely. Season 1 was predominately a slice of life comedy with some great character drama to bring out all sides of the well-developed cast. The second season gets rid of almost the entirety of the comedy aspect of the show. From the more realistic and less deformed art to a much more serious (and quite frankly slower) story, this show seemed to let out all of the lightning the first season had captured. \\n\\n\r\nWorst of all were the changes in writing and plot-developement. It's clear to see the show was trying to build off of the fairly epic and dramatic finale of the previous season by bringing 8man, Yukino, and Yui closer together and then throwing some serious questions into their relationships. BUT, in doing so all of the fantastic witty banter between Hachiman and Yukino was lost as well as all of the comedic tone from the service club's activities. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does feel much more like a real high school story, but in the worst way. Season 1's charm was mostly felt in showcasing Hachiman's cynical twisted view of the world, and both finding humor in and solving realistic problems from such an unconventional point of view. In season 2 Hachiman still tries to take on the dark world of the high school social experience, but gone is his devil may care attitude. Suddenly every problem 8man encounters is treated like the end of the world. The extreme gravity placed on every single plot point of Oregairu TOO! does a total disservice to the actual situations encountered throughout. This attitude stretches to Yukino and Yui as well who become completely distraught over 8man's attempts to sacrifice himself for the greater good. The big problem is the none of the actions 8man takes warrant this kind of melodramatic attitude at all. None of 8man's actions even come close to his outburst at the festival committee or dismantling of the committee chairman of season 1's finale, and with so few comedic elements and such little romantic progression, there's nothing to balance out season 2's overwhelming melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redemption in this season is in the new character Iroha, and the further explored Hayama. Iroha is a very interesting new character who seems to really bring out the best in 8man. The moments and conversations those two share are surely the highlight of the season. Hayama showed hints of his analytic mind and worldviews that were surprisingly similar to 8man's last season, and this season goes even more in depth into his mind. He becomes even more cool (if that's possible) and shows some flaws that weren't there before to make him much more relatable and human. These two certainly try to support their hearts out (along with Haruno), but they can only do so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe season finally ends on some sort of compromise between 8man, Yui, and Yukino. While it's nice to see them being friendly again, the ending is very bland and leaves such little impact on the characters as a whole. The entire theme of the season \"compromise and stay the course\" seems to be the antithesis of last season's \"be true to yourself no matter what\". What we're left with is a Hachiman who shows much more emotion, but has less heroism and has lost his comedic cynical side completely. I still give this show a 6 on the merit of how much of the character's personalities held through from season 1, but all in all Oregairu TOO! was a huge disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nFingers crossed for a redeeming season 3!",

            "content": "I don\u2019t know about you, but my high school years were\u2026 not very exciting. I spent a lot of time by myself, reading in the corner of the classroom or somewhere quiet in the library at lunch. I had a group of friends, yeah, but there were only a few that I\u2019d ever really talk to. Even then, I\u2019d always decline if they ever asked me to go out somewhere, telling them about how busy I was or how I \u201chad other plans\u201d. \r\nI never said much. I remember a few of my classmates sometimes asking why I was so quiet all the time, whyI only tried to just sit there and read. I never knew how to answer. That was just how I was, I guess \u2013 I didn\u2019t like talking, and I wasn\u2019t very comfortable around most people. Why? I\u2019d tell you I was shy, but I wouldn\u2019t be saying very much. And it\u2019s not like I was bullied or anything \u2013 no one picked on me or hated me in particular. I might\u2019ve preferred being by myself, sure, but I still had a few friends \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like I hated being around people. I think someone called me mute once. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since I graduated and I\u2019ve\u2026 moved on\u2026 since then, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it\u2019s all just in the past. When we graduated, that was that \u2013 some of us went to the same university, some didn\u2019t. I ended up cutting ties with most of those who didn\u2019t, and I still don\u2019t find myself talking a whole lot with those who did. But, hey, at the very least I\u2019ve come to realise how silly I used to be, trying to stay away from people like the plague \u2013 it\u2019s all just a natural part of growing up, and only now did I get the chance to finally join the club. \\n\\n\r\nOreGairu understands this. All of it. Everything. You see it in the slight furrow of Hikigaya\u2019s brow as his head rests on his palm, eyes brooding over to the noisiest parts of the classroom. You see it in the droop of his shoulders, hands finding solace where his trouser pockets were, as his bag bounces in perfect rhythm to each of his slow, dreary steps. OreGairu knows what it\u2019s like to sit in that corner of the classroom, by yourself, never talking, with you finding your mouth a little stale when it\u2019s time to leave because it\u2019s been closed for so long. It\u2019s just that OreGairu\u2026 does not think these things are silly. \\n\\n\r\nPeople are weird. We say one thing when we mean the opposite, we\u2019re quick to find flaws but we\u2019re not quick to trust. We\u2019re nasty for the sake of nastiness, and we\u2019re still all sorts of vicious to others even when we don\u2019t know it. People are complex and hard to understand, incredibly strange and all sorts of unpredictable \u2013 no one plays by exactly the same rules, and we will never reach a perfect understanding of each other no matter how hard we try. I\u2019m with Hikigaya on this one: why do we still keep trying to get caught up in this mess when we know it\u2019ll just cause us all sorts of problems later? \\n\\n\r\n\u2026Or that\u2019s what I\u2019d be saying a year ago, at least. Because to someone like Hikigaya \u2013 someone like me, in the past \u2013 we can\u2019t explain why people find themselves inevitably drawn to each other anyway. \\n\\n\r\nBecause to OreGairu, you don\u2019t need to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s how when you strip away all of his self-defeating cynicism and hateful snark, Hikigaya is actually a pretty ordinary teenage boy, with all the same desire, jealousy, and fear as any other. We see it when he\u2019s with Komachi: he\u2019s not with the outside world anymore, he\u2019s with someone he knows. He\u2019s calm, he\u2019s open, and she listens while he lets out all of his deepest wounds, all of his most buried secrets. It\u2019s no surprise, of course, when they\u2019re family \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for each other for fifteen years, and they\u2019ll be there for another fifteen more. Hikigaya says he lives the way he does because he has no other choice, but that\u2019s not true \u2013 he lives the way he does because he doesn\u2019t trust the world enough to share himself with it, to share the Hikigaya that banters so naturally and playfully with his little sister. \\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s a slow process. OreGairu only manages to give us a vague eventuality, a \u201cone day he\u2019ll change\u201d kind of thing, because it takes actually spending time with your closest friends to realise how far you\u2019ve managed to distance yourself from them in the first place. Hikigaya\u2019s finally starting to open himself up to the world, even if just a little, and through OreGairu we see how that can have profound effects on other people. Even then, he still doesn\u2019t get anything more from those who aren\u2019t close to him than a \u201cyou\u2019ve kinda changed\u201d, with them finding him only slightly less boring to look at. Because\u2026 that\u2019s how it is. Because it\u2019s the small things like that that show how, someday, maybe when he\u2019s dusting off one of his old yearbooks he found in his garage, he\u2019ll be able to look back on this moment as just an embarrassing memory \u2013 when he could say he was more open, honest, and true to himself than ever before.  \\n\\n\r\nMy birthday\u2019s coming up in a few weeks. I\u2019ve never been to many parties, but maybe I\u2019ll invite a few people to a movie or something. I know I won\u2019t change in a week, and I certainly won\u2019t change tomorrow, but in a year, maybe two, I might not be saying the same. OreGairu gave me a chance, and I\u2019m not letting it go. But I can thank it later. For now, it\u2019s time to turn OreGairu off \u2013 I have some old friends to catch up on.",

            "content": "I tend not to write negative reviews for shows, especially if they have strong fan bases.  Inevitably the fans of the show (if they exist) will vote your review down, and as petty as it is to care, having a well reviewed... review ironically means a lot to me (I know don\u2019t judge).  Still sometimes there is a show with such a glaring divide between fanbases that I feel like it\u2019s important to provide a fair(ish) criticism as to why some people may not like a show. \r\nWhen it comes to Yahari Ore..(I\u2019m not writing the title out) I am one of thosepeople.  For a lot of people the biggest issue is that the second season of the show is very different in tone, going from a relatively light hearted and bubbly/funny slice of life romcom ala Chunnibyou or Pet Girl of Sakourasou to a much more dramatic and somber tone as seen in shows like True Tears, White Album or EF a tale of memories\u2026except seemingly completely devoid of romance (you could make an argument to remove the romance tag all together).  So essentially the show has to stand on the overall quality of the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory-2\\n\r\nAaaaaand that\u2019s where this show really loses me and I figure people like me.  Full disclosure, I\u2019m in my early 30s.  I am married, I have children, I\u2019ve been away to college, I\u2019ve had real jobs in various settings, and lived a fairly satisfying and interesting life for a huge nerd with marginal social skills.  For me SOL animes with their ever present high school settings are only interesting if the story and the characters draw me into a space where I can indulge and escape.  That is not present in Yahari.  Where shows like Toradora or Kokoro Connect take the high school setting and turn it up to 10 with over the top melodrama or supernatural elements, Yahari decides to take a \u201crealistic\u201d approach to high school drama.  There are no over the top Tsundere\u2019s, no magical elements, no over the top characters for straight characters to play off on.  There is only the mild and meek interactions of a high school community, and for me that\u2019s just not enough.  I don\u2019t watch anime to see \u201crealistic\u201d human conflict so the whole show feels empty and drab.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, nothing happens in this show.  There is no specific interesting conflict driving any plot development.  The main focus is how these characters learn about themselves and conflict with each other due to their constant changes... but it's fricken boring.\\n\\n\r\nOver half the season involves the main character attending meetings about an event they are trying to throw.  LIKE 5 EPISODES SPEND 15 MINUTES OF AIRTIME OF THE MAIN CHARACTER (who is actually rather interesting) ATTENDING A MEETING!  I remember one episode spent like a full 30 seconds of screen time showing two characters walk away at a flat  angle with no music swell, no tension, no dramatic purpose, just a lingering shot of them walking across the street.  There is only the most marginal romantic development with the main prospective couplings.  The only comedic elements involve borderline homoeroticism which seems completely out of place.  There are no bombshell moments.  There is pretty much nothing. Now if you are a high schooler or maybe someone with a greater sensitivity to \u201cdrama\u201d and the struggle of being a confused and angsty teenager,  then maybe you\u2019ll enjoy it, but I found nothing of interest in the \u201cdrama\u201d presented in this anime.  Furthermore, although the drama is presented as   \u201crealistic\u201d I would argue that on the whole it is actually not.  High school kids don\u2019t act like this.  In reality these kids all act like emotionally repressed adults.  When real teenagers have conflict they act out or lash out, all of these kids just internalize and go mute.  If I had more time on my hands I would go back and count up just how much of the show involves the characters just staring at each other dramatically in between dialogue not saying anything.  The only decent moments come early and late into the show but by then I was resenting the show for wasting my time getting to these points.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 5\\n\r\nThis one is hard for me to grade fairly.  On one hand I hate all of the characters because they do pretty much nothing, they act in odd and unnatural ways but, on the other hand the main characters have well rounded and complex personalities that would be interesting to watch if they actually did anything.  The main character Hachiman could possibly have been one of my favorite SOL leads of all time.  He is misanthropic without being perverted and unlikable.  He has flaws but they\u2019re endearing.  His dialogue and analyses of the world around him is the high point of the show, or at least it would be if he talked more.  Most of his dialogue is internal.  He spends a chunk of the show allowing himself to be led around by other characters.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, he hardly spends any time with the two main female characters that we saw in the first season.  There is an interesting and well done moment early in the season between him and one of the main girls, but after that I am not sure they had another moment alone.  Instead it\u2019s him and the girls older sister, him and a popular guy from school him and a girl he used to like years ago, him and a third main female character who is pretty uninteresting.  When the show finally gets back to him and the main girls they were having a falling out of sorts and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t understand why.  At first you might think it was cause I wasn\u2019t paying attention, but in reality it\u2019s cause there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a reason.  If you check out the boards you will see plenty of threads looking for an explanation of the what\u2019s and the why\u2019s of these sleep inducing conflicts.  Why is Yukino mad at Hachiman again?  Who is it that Hayama actually likes and why.  Where the hell is Zaimokuza this whole time(yeah remember him). Seriously if you look at the forum there's more fan theory's than a five nights at freddie's message board.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the character notes are subtle and understated.  In a live action show where facial expressions and dynamic directing can help show an important development instead of telling it, thisworks fine,  but there\u2019s only so much you can do in anime for human subtlety.  So either you go read one of the threads where someone who read the novel explains what the problem is OR you are left in the dark. \\n\\n\r\nSimply put, although Yahari has characters who are unique and could have had some interesting and dynamic interactions, there is nothing in the plot that stirs the pot.  Just a ton of pointless angst.\\n\\n\r\nSound-5\\n\r\nI honestly can\u2019t speak well to the sound as I can\u2019t remember anything about the sound track.  The voice acting is pretty high quality though.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-7\\n\r\nThis is probably the strongest point of the show.  The animation is solid and doesn\u2019t distract from anything.  It\u2019s nothing special but it\u2019s brightly colored and detailed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 4\\n\r\nI won\u2019t go and say this is a bad anime.  There is plenty here to like, but buyer beware.  If you\u2019re looking for a more dynamic show that will have you hanging on to the drama or felling the feels or anything you\u2019re going to be disappointed.  There are much better shows for romance and much better shows for realistic drama.  But if you\u2019ve watched everything then go at it.\\n",

            "content": "\"What the hell is with everyone telling me to change? I don't want other people telling me who I am\" - Hachiman Hikigaya\r\nA sequel to any anime always presents a challenge to both the creators and viewers of the show simply because the creators have to produce something better then what it started with in order to satisfy the majority of people that wished for that second season and the viewers have to decide whether or not the sequel lives up to the expectations that they wished for (In this case 2 years ago).  \r\nLet me start by saying this... Yahari Ore no SeishunLove Comedy wa Machiatteiru. Zoku is by far absolutely brilliant in what it brings to a \"typical\" high school anime combining elements of drama, comedy, and romance into show that screams to be watched by the masses. \\n\\n\r\nStory: While most high school anime focus primarily on romance, drama, or comedy, Zoku balances the 3 elements and incorporate each to make a show that isn't over saturated with love triangles or clueless airheads that can't take a hint. What is also phenomenal about the show is the realism that it portrays as we take the perspective of Hikigaya and dive into his life as a ordinary high school student who just wishes to be alone. The story focuses primarily on the troubles and tribulations of high school life whether it be helping a friend with social anxieties or assisting the student council president in daily activities. It takes these everyday problems that students have to deal with and creates these situations where Hikigaya is forced to cooperate. What grasped my attention the most is how Hikigaya deals with these situations that he is presented with and what he does to resolve these problems through is own personal beliefs and the experience he has gained by observing society and the fake attitudes that people conceal behind a mask of popularity and social status. What drives the show and makes it worthwhile is to see how Hikigaya handles these situations along with his fellow club members and the sudden shifts, turns, and drops this emotional roller coaster of a show throws at you as you try to discover the \"Real Things' this show truly offer. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At the time you're reading this I can safely assume that you watched the first season of the show and have a general understanding of how our 3 main characters act and behave so I can make this short and simple. Let's start with our main protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman, If you haven't seen the first season then I advise you to go to that now because Hikigaya can be described in one word and that is Pragmatic. Hikigaya always takes things at face value and honestly doesn't care about what people think. He's anti social in a way that he wishes to be alone because he knows this would not only benefit himself but the people around him. It creates this awkward tension that makes Hikigaya either loved or hated  by some but personally I see Hikigaya as a character that should be respected because of how he analyzes the world around him which to some respect is cruel but 100% true. Then we have Yukino Yukinoshita, Yukino can be described as an \"Ice Queen\" and will literally never \"let it go\" if you ever cross her bad side. She's smart and beautiful in way that is both cute and deadly at the same time. She has this \"Royal\" essence that makes her a force to be reckoned with and her snide remarks towards those she finds inferior make Yukino a beautiful nightmare you wish you can witness. Lastly we have Yui Yuigahama who is our cheerful little ball of sunshine that brightness up everyone's day whenever they are feeling down. She is the type of girl that needs support and friends to keep her company and will do anything to keep that friendship lasting until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The animation of this season compared to last is a enormous improvement beyond many levels of quality. They switched to Feel Productions and I applaud the overall animation quality knowing how hard it must of been to make Hikigaya's eyes seem more dead then usual along with the cast being improved drastically in only a 2 year gap. The backdrops were stunning, The art style fit the theme well, and by far it was the best animation they could have possibly created. The opening was fantastic as I believe it was a better opening then it's predecessor and  the ending was also catchy as sung by the voice actresses themselves just as last season did. The OST's of the anime were good as it fit the show nicely at just the right times and I have no complaints at all for it was simply put, better then last season. \\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku did everything it was set out to do and more. It provided a story that made me want to watch over and over and left me depressed as I waited each weak for each episode to release. It brought back that sense of nostalgia 2 years ago when I was watching the first season and it reminded me how much I love Hikigaya. If you like an anime that revolves around a school setting where the premise of the story is everyday problems that have to be solved by someone who really doesn't wish to be part of society then please watch this show. I can't recommend this show enough and you won't be disappointed. The novels are the main source material where this anime is adapted from and I wait for the day that maybe... and just maybe... a season 3 will be announced. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Hahahaha! Been a long time since I have last wrote a review. This is going to be a little weird. Let me start off by saying that this series is definitely not for everyone. The people who should not watch this anime is...\r\n-People who have tons of friends and have never been hurt by them\r\n-People who have been happy constantly and have never experience loneliness\r\n-People are optimistic to the point of delusion\r\n-Basically, people who have the head ten feet up their a**es\r\n-Or people who only enjoy anime for battle shounen\r\nAlso by the way,\r\nSOL-Slice of Life\r\nRomCom-Romantic Comedy\r\n*I'm going to be using those abbreviations A LOT!\r\nStory:8\r\nOne ofthe the many good points of this series. My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU is very contrary to its name. Instead of acting as most ordinary SOL RomCom (Harem galore, Idiot Protagonist, generic females, et cetera), it acts more like a deconstruction of the genre instead. It's a story that while on paper is mundane, is told from an interesting point of view of a pessessmistic but kind loner. That is what makes the story good and better then the average RomCom. We recieve various monologue from the protagonist, Hachiman Hikigaya(8man) so while the story itself is somewhat mundane, the actions that Hachiman takes and the thoughts he thinks make the story compelling and intriguing to watch. The story continues from the first season, as Hachiman continues to solve problems that are brought to the Service Club. However unlike the first season the second is much less comedic and more heavily invested on the complex emotions of the multiple characters that the show presents. Despite being a \u201cromance\u201d anime, it isn\u2019t the shows full focus. There are a lot of that, and many teasing of characters being liking each other, but it is a secondary concern below just simple friendship and character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe art from this season is a large step-up from the original one. The character designs being the biggest change. At first, I actively disliked it at first, but as I continue to watched the character designs began to not only grow on me, but grew to the point where I like it more the original. Their looks now allow for more emotions and are less stiff. Studio Feels also manage to create great animation that allow you to be able to understand character thoughts just through their movements. All and all, the art and animation for the second season was fantastic, and while not as flashy or pretty as some of the action series as of late, but it is quite stunning in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe opening was actually pretty average for the most part, and in to be quite honest I prefer the opening of the first one. However, the anime counters that by making the ending fantastic and much better than the one from the first season (again, in my opinion). But the background soundtrack and voice acting is where this anime truely shines. Its subtle and minimalist tracks helps build up suspense, and allow for emotions to come naturally. The music will never overtake what is happening and will never be the star of the show. But it never needed to be, it being a minimalist type soundtrack. It purpose is to enhanced the show and what is going on, it tracks help amplify suspense when need, it also builds sadness or joy when it is played. A lot of people I know and probably a large portion of music-lovers out there dislike minimalist music so this track probably isn\u2019t something you can listen to over and over. That being said, a few out there will find this enjoyable to constantly listen to, and some of you might even find it among your favorite music tracks. Regardless, few can argue that the music got what needed to be done, and did it with flying colors. The voice acting make the already realistic characters seem more real, and makes for what they say actual conversations that could happen instead of just characters in a fictional setting, talking. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nOh boy, the character is where this truely surpassed my expectations. Being a RomCom, I went into this show expecting s***. As mention above RomComs usually follow a very generic formula. One of the ingriedients would be generic as hell characters, Idiotic and nice protagonist along with girls to fit every fetish and tropes to fall in love with said protagonist. This show does almost a complete reverse, with a highly realistic(pessimisstic) and intelligent protagonist with only two fully fleshed out and developed female protagonist. Let\u2019s talked about Hachiman(8man) first, as well as talking about how much I love it when a show implements catharticism correctly. This could range from when Hachiman puts down other people with his superior rationality, or when he solves problems by commiting social suicide only to realized later on that it was a TSPP(tempory solution permanent problem). His way of thinking and morales in life resonates with me on a personal level. Which is a large reason why Hachiman is a character that is not for everyone. If you could relate to him through life experiences or you\u2019re able to understand and realize his viewpoints on life then he may very well be one of your favorite main character in any series, SOL RomCom or otherwise as he was for me. If you\u2019re one of the people mention on the list of people who would hate this anime, Hachiman is probably the biggest reason why. He is negative, and cynical, which is great as now their is a main protagonist that is similar to me and millions of other people out their who aren\u2019t optimistic as soceity tells us we should be. Now on to the female leads, which we have two of. Yukino being the first one we are introduced to, and like Hachiman, is a loner and has been bullied in her younger years. Unlike Hachiman however, she is far more successful and thus, sometimes have a superiority complex. She faces many of the same problem that faces Hachiman, but many of the times these problems require different solutions and are caused by different causes for the two characters. So it makes the two characters, while similar, also distinctively different. This causes many opportunities for the the. Final, but definitely not last of the main characters, is Yui. She is the bubbly, happy, social type. And she is absolutely and one hundred percent necessary for the show to work. She acts as a foil to the two other main characters, but in some odd way is still as completely relatable as the other two. Her interaction and chemistry with the other two is at times comedic, and at other time emotional brings along a whole entire other sets of problems. Her character brings to light an entire different view point and to put it simply, without Yui, the entire show would be completely different and more than likely, no where near as good. The most important thing about the supporting cast is each supporting member is that each one is a fully fleshed out character and anyone who is named would likely show up more then once. They are each filled with their owned personalities that are not just generic tropes, each often having problems that can watchers can relate to. Each are realistic, such as Hayama who despite at first seems like a Gary Stu, later turn out to be just as troubled and filled with problems as everyone else in the show, or Komachi who (for the first time in forever not a love interest), actually act as a simply would to the main character. Having fights with him, giving advice, understanding, apologizing for mistake, et cetera. All this combined with the emotionally broken and trouble main characters each being rejected by society in some way make this show have the most diverse set of characters and one of the most realistic and relatable group I have ever seen from not only anime, but from a story in general.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nLike all my other reviews, the enjoyment is not factored into the final review, so this long section is completely skippable. What else is there needed to be said, everything that praises and critics (to which there are few) have already been said in the moderately long review. So lets talk about why this anime means so much for me (which again, if it is boring then is completely skippable), and while it rank at number two in my list of favorite animes. The reason is simple, I have never in my entire life relate to an anime as much as this one, and even more than that I have never relate to a character as much as Hachiman. Like him I have tried to reach out to make friend in the past, only to be left in severe disappointment. It didn\u2019t take long after that to just simply stop caring, and since then I have always been more pessimistic than an optimistic. And with every telling me that is an terrible way of living and that would lead to wrong to thing negative thoughts, only enhanced my pessimism, as using optimism to \u201chelp\u201d a pessimist really doesn\u2019t work. I could fully imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes and often could see the world through his eyes. From him getting rejected without much thought by a crush. From being despised from a trait that was gained at birth, and from spending hours simply doing nothing looking at others doing things that required more then a single person. I could also imagine myself in his shoes, when he was trying to do the right thing, but not being able find a method that would not involve hurting and most likely more then likely others. As a result even now, I only have a small group of friend and even a smaller group in which I can freely talked and express my problems. My advice for anyone who meets a Hachiman in their life and want to become friends with them would be to never talk about celebrities with them, but more importantly be patient. Just be patient and stick around and never try to \u201cfix\u201d them. My advice for people like me or Hachiman (which can be taken with a grain of salt) would be to stop thinking that your way of living is wrong, it just different. Don\u2019t try to make friends for the sake of making friends, but make friends who you would help you when ask, and you would help if they ask. That got a little heavy and I also didn\u2019t imagine it would go on a mini therapy (though I don\u2019t think I made a great therapist) session. Well that is the reason why this show recieve a perfect ten in the enjoyment catagory, that and because even though the show isn\u2019t gear towards everyone, I felt like one of the people that is was gear towards. From it storytelling, to its art, to it beautifully constructed minimalist soundtrack that I could listen to over and over again, and it splendid and beautifully constructed cast of main characters. Since this is skippable, let\u2019s talk about the romance to which I can quickly sumarized up with imagery. You see there are two gigantic battleship which have said and are fighting each other. There is also a ship for a cute underclassmate, but that one is more like a wooden conoe. Anyway, I currently being told to walked the plank on both ships multiple times because of how much I like the characters. What I\u2019m trying to say is I have literally no idea what side I am on, and would be happy and sadden by any choice the author picks for the main character. Which is kind of a lose-lose and win-win senario. Confused. So am I about how I feel.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:9\\n\r\nLike all show, it has its flaws such as the title. And as all shows, it is not for everybody. But if you have ever been outcasted of soceity either it only have been a while or for your entire dang life, I would urge you greatly to watch the show. It shows that your way of living, no matter what, is not right nor is it wrong. It shows the pros and cons to living like Hachiman, and living like someone like Hayama. I have already rambled enough out the shows good and bad points in the review sections, and have already said how much I like the show in my enjoyment section. There really isn\u2019t much else to say besides me saying that if you don\u2019t consider yourself to be part of these people...\\n\\n\r\n-People who have tons of friends and have never been hurt by them\\n\r\n-People who have been happy constantly and have never experience loneliness\\n\r\n-People are optimistic to the point of delusion\\n\r\n-Basically, people who have the head ten feet up their a**es\\n\r\n-Or people who only enjoy anime for battle shounen\\n\\n\r\nThen go watch the f***ing show. I\u2019ll end it here, just so you can so watch it, heck, I\u2019ll even include a link to the show on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\n-http://www.crunchyroll.com/my-teen-romantic-comedy-snafu\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I like it that much, and writing this review kind of made me appreciate it more. Not sure if it will have the same effect on you, but hey, there\u2019s only one way to find out.\\n",

            "content": "MOD EDIT -*The review contains spoilers*-\r\nOregairu has really built up quite a reputation ever since it first aired didn\u2019t it? Whilst the reaction to it was a mixed bag of \u201cHaganai if it was actually good\u201d and \u201cugh, this is pretentious garbage\u201d back in 2013, two years of steadily increasing attention from the light novel community and such have turned it into the only post-Spice and Wolf light novel adaptation that people can say is actually good with a straight face. The fact that Studio feel was attached to the new season did make some people moo a bit, but not enough to prevent itfrom reaching the top 100 on MAL upon airing of the first episode. And of course, with huge popularity comes a huge and quite frankly f*cking awful fanbase that I\u2019m going to swiftly ignore because I have it on good authority that reading their comments actually causes eye cancer and it shouldn\u2019t really affect any personal judgments about the show anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my own personal judgment, I remember being really harsh against this show back when it first aired, but I honestly can\u2019t remember why. In fact, I barely remember what happened in the first season beyond Hachiman joining a club with two troubled girls named Yui and Yukino who may or may not have a crush on him, and helping people out in his own cynical self-defeating way. I remember the visual design being kinda meh because Brains Base hasn\u2019t done a good job at offering anything more than stale colors for years, but they were still a better alternative than feel\u2019s usual output. So discovering that the animation and direction in this season actually put Sankarea\u2019s Shaft-like surprise presentation to shame was more of a pleasant surprise than Nintendo finally releasing a new IP. Third-person shooter, you say? Wonder how long it\u2019ll take for them to milk that into oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nI do remember the first season feeling like a load of build-up for a climax we never got though. Things happened, but the only real contribution to the story was some characters going through minor realizations that they had yet to use. I\u2019m fully aware that conclusions aren\u2019t the final judgment of quality and that buildup is important too, but you\u2019ve got to use that buildup for something or else you\u2019d just be like the anime version of Destiny: always on grind. So does the second season of Yahari fix that? Sure...in some alternate universe where good anime is more plentiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime continues from the conclusion of the school festival arc in the first season when Hachiman is confronted about his self-defeating personality and how it can be really troublesome to people around him. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from putting it to use in order to break up a confession surrounding one of his male companions and a girl he likes, which causes a rift to form between him and his fellow club members, who agree with him about as much as I agree with anybody who continues to deny the existence of global warming (how blind can you be to not notice our abnormal weather, you idiots?). This rift starts to grow wider when some girls from his middle school life, including one that he confessed to, show up around the same time a student council election occurs and the club is asked to help one of the students bail from it by nominating themselves. From there, Hachiman is put through the ringer regarding his own personal demons and if he can\u2019t get past them, he\u2019ll lose the few people in his life who actually do care for him.\\n\\n\r\nA good drama in theory, but the show enters Spice and Wolf territory in that it has a weak base conflict and it doesn\u2019t even really follow up on its potential. Imagine if you were watching a drama and the base conflict for much of the story was about some dude refusing to admit that he hated bananas. You may be thinking \u201cwait, that sounds f*cking stupid\u201d, and that\u2019s what I said with the majority of the season minus the f-word. It was impossible for me to hold student council elections on the same level as the highschool version of Jesus\u2019s sacrifice because A) it didn\u2019t work when Degrassi* did it B) you can still hang out with each other and stuff if the club doesn\u2019t exist anymore. There isn\u2019t any sacrificing schoolwork and your future for the club with no guarantee that you\u2019ll succeed. It\u2019s just really personal conflicts that aren\u2019t given enough grounding to make any sense, and it dragged out far longer than it should have.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call the conflicts as bad as Spice and Wolf\u2019s because there\u2019s more to Oregairu that makes it one of the better LN adaptations than furthering relationships - or as much you can nail relationships in regards to LN-like characters. Unlike Lawrence, and Holo to a lesser extent, these characters have some ghosts in their life and the relationships are a means to exploring them, even if it still doesn\u2019t do as much with them as it should have. One way to fix that would have been to reveal what Yukino\u2019s problems actually are. Yeah, we know she\u2019s bad at socializing, not helped by an annoying older sister who acts like a cocktease boyfriend stealer from a crappy doujin or an even crappier gross-out comedy, but the show is as fast to reveal useful information as video game companies are to release actual reasons to get hyped for their products. The name is there and it looks nice, but how about some actual gameplay, huh?\\n\\n\r\nSo there were multiple times when the show just kind of lost me, mired in the very idea of its self-loathing that it forgets to really develop it beyond its base premise and goes into Catching Fire-levels of \u201cholding out but have faith in us\u201d right down to having a very similar style of ending. And it annoyed me here just as much as it annoyed me in that movie, because it looked like it was finally going to get interesting regarding the relationships and inner-problems that the characters have been going through in its last two episodes. The characters make up and come to realizations about their current situation, but the future is still vague and you need to take more than the small steps you just went through in order to achieve real personal growth.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, the show ends at what seemed like the middle of a story that has had too much devoted to its buildup and we\u2019re not going to be getting another season anytime soon given how many of the light novels there are at the time this review goes out. It frustrates me to no end to see what anime could have been, only to come off as unfinished. Maybe you could say that the realization that the characters love their life and their friends and are even capable of romance is enough for you, but that feels kinda weak to me. There are plenty of shows on the Disney Channel that say the same thing, and being better executed isn\u2019t enough to really make Oregairu any different from them. Sure I wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable with sitting through love triangle drama, especially if it involves a man named Armani, but sometimes you\u2019ve just got to rip off that bandage rather than peel it slowly and prolong the pain by 10x the amount it would have taken otherwise.\\n\\n\r\n*I never actually watched Degrassi so I don\u2019t know if it overdramatized student council stuff, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me either way given how much else it overdramatizes.",

            "content": "Ah, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Also known as My Romantic Comedy SNAFU, this series is not your typical romantic comedy or what you may expect from it. It may seem like misleading sometimes but the foundation of this series is heavily built on our main characters rather than romantic relationships. Anyone familiar with the first season will realize that social commentary and analysis is a key part of why the series succeeded in capturing its unique dynamics. With the way the first season left off, there\u2019s more from where that came from.\r\nIt should be obvious but watching the first season isimperative to understand the second season, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku. While a good portion of the franchise follows a slice of life style way of storytelling, the characterization of the characters heavily focuses on their insight and what they perceive with themselves to the world. Take Hachiman Hikigaya for example. This guy is what many could describe as a straight outcast. He has build a social barrier with a personality that makes him the alpha loner. His signature dead fish eyes has become a trademark of the series. His facial expressions is the epitome of being apathetic. The things he does, the things he says, and the way he behaves around is an antithesis of what most people are like. According to Hachiman himself, he believes that \u201cyouth is simply an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites are born from the ashes of past failures.\u201d A self-proclaimed statement and like this with many others define what Hachiman is like throughout the first season. And in this sequel, we see even more of his social analysis of others and the world around him.\\n\\n\r\nI find it rather interesting though in regards with Hachiman\u2019s role in this second season. Early on, there are some rather memorable things he mentions that perhaps labels himself as a villain. However, there\u2019s also that sort of idea where he is building an illusion around himself to be friendly and caring towards others. Then, there\u2019s Yukino Yukinoshita, the cold beauty of the Service Club. Nicknamed the \u201cIce Queen\u201d, we can see her as being both a bit haughty and blunt. Throughout this season, there\u2019s a peculiar connection that she builds with both Yui and Hachiman. Our dynamic trio of the Service Club, there\u2019s a lot to go on about these three characters. Yukino\u2019s particular insistence on Hachiman to become a better person seems to further their friendship apart. Her own insecurity also shows throughout the season in particular with an election that she reluctantly takes part of. In fact, the election arc brings out quite a bit with the main characters. Yukino\u2019s desperation to protect her own self-image (furthered from the involvement of her sister\u2019s words and testimony) brings out a vulnerable side. On the other hand, we have Yui, who truly shows her own personality during conversations she has with Hachiman. Those magical moments brings out a sincere image that really shows selflessness. Speaking of Hachiman though, we can see that his actions speaks a bit louder than words. The election story shows what he desires for and wishes to maintain to create a stable life for himself. Take it as a grain of salt even if he shows a bit of hypocrisy of his own. That\u2019s youth for ya.\\n\\n\r\nAnother prominent character that makes her presence quite well known is Iroha Isshiki. I label her as much of a sheep in disguise. This is because of the way she acts and speaks despite trying to maintain an innocent image in front of others. Unlike Yukino though, she has a deep caring about her character. There\u2019s also an interesting factor to note about her relationship with Hachiman. Unlike many others, she seems to enjoy hanging out with him; perhaps not necessarily as genuine friends but rather someone she can rely on. I think it\u2019s evident that Hachiman is perhaps the only person she can be comfortable with as her true self. This is suggested by the fact that Hachiman has built this social barrier around him that prevents himself to change her anyways. This is perhaps suggested that they have similar personalities so in a way, Hachiman sees himself when conversing with her. It may all seem odd but the show\u2019s dynamic always plays around with these stereotypes. It\u2019s actually what makes this series self-aware and realize the importance of finding someone you can relate with.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the majority of the season focusing on characterization, we do get a lot of plot emphasis as well. Romance has never been a true intention of this series but the second season does start off with such a theme. From an indirect point, we still have Kaori Orimoto. Remember that girl Hachiman mentioned in flashbacks when he was rejected before? Yeah, that girl. Her role in this season is to get involved with others to get what she wants. I think Hachiman is well aware of this with his previous experience but nonetheless gets involved. Also, it doesn\u2019t seem like her perception of Hachiman has changed from her younger days. Needless to say, there is no connection between the two other than the fact that he can become part of a bigger game plan for her. On the other hand, we have Shizuka, the teacher and adviser of the Service Club. I can honestly say that she is a role model with her own ideologies. Despite her small role in this season, there are moments when she shines more than the others. The most prominent of this relates to making Hachiman realize the motivations of his actions. She opens his eyes to reality and I guess in some ways makes Hachiman think about the social barrier he has constructed around himself. The apex of the season makes Hachiman realizes what he has been doing and perhaps for the first time in the series shows human emotions; something that seemed inconceivable in the beginning. Honestly, human emotion is a prestige and I think this series highlights that in a lot of ways. For the way the story is crafted with the building up, purposes, ideologies, and whatever youth comes to suggest, it\u2019s a very realistic way to portray such emotions.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the heavy stuff from season 2, there are also lighthearted moments. In particular, I find the sibling relationship between Hachiman and his sister Komachi to bring out the humor. I think she is perhaps one of the only characters that he behaves casually around with like normal siblings should. There\u2019s also the Hachiman and Isshiki moments where she often misunderstands his words as \u201cpick-up lines\u201d. Dialogues work in a lot of way in fact for this show. When it comes to comedy, this series isn\u2019t shy to deliver that as well. Oh and did I forget that Hachiman always wants to protect Saika\u2019s smile? \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a major change in this season, it would be the artwork. Production studio Feels is now in charge with the producing this season so the difference compared to the first season is a bit obvious. It will take a little time to get used to but I\u2019d say that the quality actually improved. It also seems to be metaphoric in a way with our characters\u2019 development too when it comes to their expressions. Now we have more dynamic facial features, body language with emotional signs, and in general the way this series should be handled \u2013 to clarify youth. Character designs also has slight changes although Hachiman still retains his signature dead-fish eyes, Yukino retaining her youthful beauty, Saika retaining his trap-like appearance, and the list goes so on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a heavy as the emotions are, the soundtrack remains just as evidently strong. The melancholic tune shows is portrayed many times appropriately when it needs to and all the time reminds us what this series is about. Similarly, the OP theme song \"Harumodoki\u201d by Nagi Yanagi has a very smooth way with its lyrics to illustrate the mood of the show. However, the most prominent feature still relies on its character voice casting. Like I mentioned before, SNAFU is a rather talky show so character voice mannerism is exceptionally important to get the message across. Thankfully, we got Hachiman for that with his inner thoughts. In fact, all character voice mannerisms does a wonderful job at portraying their characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, I think of this series as both a lighthearted and dark driven work. It\u2019s never afraid to pull out stunts that may or may shock the audience. And in fact, there are moments this season when I thought characters go to a place where they can never come back. It keep you at the edge of your seat to see how our characters change or what will happen next. Rather than going with a clich\u00e9 romantic angle, SNAFU delivers performance with a magnetic appeal to human emotions. Director Kei Oikawa always seems to be able to appeal to these emotions to really sink the audience in. In essence, it captures the very idea of youth and what the first season has built itself around with. Just do be aware that this adaptation does rush some events and omit a few parts of the light novel elements to fit the show into a single cour. But yet, the second season still lives up to its hype in storytelling, characterization, comedy, and in general all-around portrayal of what I had expected to be.",

            "content": "Eh, so this is my first time writing a review cause I felt like I needed to review this anime. Sadly it will have to be on a bad note. \r\nAnd here's the thing where you give scores and write very long paragraphs for different aspects. \r\nI judge every category according to how it affected the enjoyment of the anime perceived by me.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story is essentially nonexistent, or moves at the pace of a crippled snail. This is truly frustrating to watch because of the lack of plot progression, and the lack of change in character or character relationships. The show mainly consists ofuneventful student council meeting scenes that Hikigaya attends and teenage edgy emotional melodrama(Drama is great, but this can't be considered drama. It's more like drama between teen girls who repress their feelings and refuse to share them, causing some awkwardly tense moments). Nearly every episode ends up forgettable and unexciting as I always have to search up on wikipedia what happened in the  last episode to remind myself of it. It's that forgettable. Since the story gets nowhere I end up having to drag my feet to watch this, which really isn't a good thing if this anime is meant to be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like the author of the novels, or at least the novels adapted this season, chickened out of trying to create some meaningful form of romance which was not blushing, because that doesn't count. There is a lot of ambiguity surrounding who the male MC is likely to have romance with, which is annoying because this is categorized under romance, so I expect to see romance. The author also forgot about the comedy tag as well, because there is little to none. You might as well rip off the comedy and romance tag on this show, because they've completely left it behind for some meaningless melodrama which I did not enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n(I can't judge the story in full however, cause it isn't completed.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nThe character with the most screen time was Hikigaya as always, with his ever famous pessimistic monologues. It's a pity that they didn't give up more time to explore what other characters are thinking such as the cold Yukino and semi-happy Yui.\\n\\n\r\nThey all seek the mystical \"real thing\", like true friendship with each other or something. Their relationships are all broken and superficial. The characters always talk and talk, very vaguely about the \"real thing\" and it's BORING. Heck, they barely change until the ending, where I still don't feel that anything has been truly resolved. This leaves space for a 3rd season, which I hope brings more meaningful development so I can actually like the characters and enjoy the dang show.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the other comedic purposed characters we don't see much of, the nerd white haired fat dude, tennis gender ambiguous dude and stuff. Those guys were funny...\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nArt doesn't really play a role in this anime in terms of enjoyment, but it was good nonetheless as terrible art would make watching this more unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nNothing bad to say here either.\\n\\n\r\nOther Comments:\\n\r\nAt the end of every episode, there was always this bitter and tense atmosphere left behind and it felt like it was getting nowhere. I really hoped there would be romance. I really did. The author probably chickened out because he was too afraid for there to be a love interest which would cause some backlash of dissapointed fans.\\n\\n\r\nHow it should have been:\\n\r\n(There's no point complaining if you can't suggest a way to make it better.)\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was a good season that drew many people in and introduced the characters, which some of the comedic characters should have reappeared in S2 to balance the always tense atmosphere of the anime. The second season had actual romance, keeping the mood of the first season. Despite causing fans to rage, the author should make some romance build up between Hikigaya and one of the girls about halfway. The other half could have been the other girl trying to win his heart, which brings about some proper drama, but eventually accepting it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIf you like melodrama with vague conversations on self discovery and fixing broken relationships that get absolutely nowhere, this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf none of the above, don't watch it. But do watch the first season, I think I enjoyed it.\\n",

            "content": "When Hideaki Anno, the creator of Evangelion said that Anime will die within the next 5 years, I would disagree with his statement. However, the only thing I would agree is that anime will lose its quality in the next 5 years. Everything has been rehashed and repeated from previous anime,\r\nI thought Winter Season was awful season for anime, but Spring 2015 proved me wrong. One example would be Vampire Holmes & Ame-iro Cocoa. Although I didn't see Ame-iro Cocoa. Spring 2015 has no interesting anime for me to review, especially Knights of Sidonia season 2. If you are wondering why I am not activein MAL is because I already lost interest in anime. And now, Oregairu Season 2 is one of the most disappointing anime that I have watched alongside with Death Parade.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (5):\\n\\n\r\nAs I have said, this is a continuation to season 1 of Oregairu. The 1st season was great and enjoyable and it is one of my favourite anime of all time. The 2nd season however is a boring and dull show to watch. I was waiting for the story to end and I wa not engaged in this anime at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I appreciated about the story is how the girls like Yukino, Yui & Haruno tried to understand Hikigaya's situation and how they learn how to understand one another. But I have seen anime that have done a better job in that area than compared to Oregairu 2. For example, \"Your Lie in April\", \"Golden Time\".\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was very weak and this anime to me felt more like a drama. The drama was weak as well.\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent. Although the characters do not look like their personality in the past season.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the opening and ending theme are standard.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nHachiman Hikigaya is one of my favourite character. The reason why is that he has witty dialogues and he understands the society better than anyone else. I always believe in him and his situation in life even though he has been through rejections and rough times. Everyone might say he is one of the best character. However, in season 2, he has no witty dialogues and he just gives too much exposition. In some situations, he easily solves problems by himself, although I also understand that Yukino didn't like the way how he does things in episode 3. He became like a wish-fulfilment character with no depth whatsoever. Just like Shiba Tatsuya, Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nYukino became more uninteresting as a character. Saori Hayami voiced characters that are cool and serious. However, her charm was completely gone. In the 1st season Yukino's voice had charm.\\n\\n\r\nYui & Haruno are the only good characters in the show. However, they were not good enough to carry the show on their own.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like the way Hayato tried to be understanding towards Hachiman and I appreciated his development. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters became more dull and bland as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI was not convinced that this season really offered anything new. I give this anime a 5 out of 10. I'm sorry. I wanted to say I enjoyed this anime, but I can't.\\n\\n\r\nI don't say that this is a bad anime. But if you enjoy this season, that's fantastic. I won't judge you. \\n\\n\r\nJust like Death Parade, this anime offered nothing to me.",

            "content": "Minor spoilers.\r\nA truly beautiful series. Definitely one of the best shows that has premiered so far this year for me.\r\nThe first season sets up the premise of the story. Our main character, Hikigaya Hachiman, is dragged into the Service Club by his meddling teacher. There he meets the school's \"Ice Queen\", Yukino Yukinoshita. The first season introduces us to the main characters, their strengths, and above all, the dynamics they have with each other. It is a melodramatic, typical romcom, with no twists and turns. Though I have to admit the dialogue and pessemism the main character shares with the viewers is quite interesting tolisten to. \\n\\n\r\nIf the first season is the set up, the second season is the ideological and emotional fallout that results from the mixing and melding of such contrasting personalities. We, as viewers, get a front row seat as the fascades set up in season 1 fall off and expose a flawed, yet strangely relatable, cast. Compared to the perfect personas we were used to in season 1, season 2 exposes viewers to a cast as flawed as they are genuine. Self-centered and rotten to the core, these main characters struggle, writhe, and suffer with their own desires as they try to keep the friendship they have with each other alive.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode appears to be relatively shallow on first glance; however, upon further inspection, there are deeper meanings in each dialogue between the characters. Initially coming off as small-talk on the surface, such conversations actually reveal more about the selfish motives each person has. Never are these selfish desires spelled out in their entirety. Instead they are presented to the viewers piece by piece, as if pieces of a puzzle, and even when all the pieces are out in the open, the answer is still vague. I believe that these characters and the dialogue they share is the high point of Oregairu and the sole driving force behind it. The authenticity and realness of the conversations they talk about--love, struggle, and friendship, isn't in black and white, unlike many other shows. That's why the conclusion to the show at the end of season 2 is as fitting as it gets. Not all problems reach a conclusion. In fact, we choose to ignore many of the ones we face in hope that they just \"disappear\". This is yet another beautiful thing Oregairu presents to its viewers. It shows that although you make an attempt to hide a problem, all it does is become more obscure behind a layer of superficiality. Superficiality never lasts forever, and thus you are doomed to face the problem you worked so hard to conceal--oftentimes with exponentially worse repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is unique in every sense of the word. Because of the studio switch, fans were scared; after all, FEEL isn't really the most high budget, top of the line animation studio. However, I personally feel that, although reluctant at first, I prefer the second series's animation over the first. It's more detailed, fluid, and compliments the second series's dramatic tone. Had it been the other way around, however, I probably wouldn't have rated it so highly.\\n\\n\r\nSound is beautiful, break taking, and outstanding. The OPs and EDs (of both series) are amazing, but the one that takes the crown is definitely \"Hello Hello Alone\" (Yui Ballade). People who watched season 2 will agree with me in that it's a truly beautiful song, and the way it was executed/placed in episode 13 was well done. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you want a genuine, down to earth romcom that successfully avoids the cliches usually found in many shows in that genre, look no further. I wouldn't say its sole focus is romance (or anywhere close for that matter). Rather, it's a coming of age tale of an antisocial loner as he meets new friends, experiences new things, and ultimately, finds love. Though the real question here is: what happens next?",

            "content": "Overall (10/10)\r\nBefore I really break into anything, let me give you a short quote from the afterword of the light novel's first volume. (translated by frog-kun)\r\n\"This may seem sudden, but the \"youth\" that is commonly referred to by the world at large is a mistaken notion. It's a downright lie. Going on a date at Lalaport in your uniforms with a cute girl, getting invited by a friend to another school to eat lunch with a girl... those things just don't exist. Those things were works of complete fiction....\r\n... In other words, that youth romantic comedy was filled with lies. And everyone is getting tricked.\r\nRealyouth was getting off school with just a guy friend, parking yourself at a Saizeriya and squatting there until night while surviving on only on drinks and focaccia. And all you do with him is say bad things about your classmates and complain about school. That was the true picture of youth. I'm speaking from experience here, so I'm pretty sure about it.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, I don't really hate that kind of youth.\\n\\n\r\nGetting excited about mixing together melon soda and orange juice and calling it \"melage\"... going on a field trip and playing mahjong with three other guys in the midst of that savage environment... falling into silence after seeing that girl I liked flirting with her boyfriend... now that I think back on those times, I could call each and every one of those fond memories.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, that was a lie. I hated that kind of youth. I wanted to go on a date with a girl in my uniform too. Hell, I still want to.\"\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru is about those feelings, what reality is like versus the dreams of the version we wish we had. And it leads into my favorite story of all time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I feel obliged to warn you, Season 1 captured the \"comedy\" portion of the title, with rather minimal (but a still existent) focus on the \"romantic\" part. Zoku is the opposite, it has comedy, but it takes a back seat to the romance.\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nZoku picks up right after Season 1. I'm not going to talk about plot here, rather how the story adds to this masterpiece, so don't worry about spoilers here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Zoku is at a rather difference pace than Oregairu's season 1. The first season focused on issues that were solved quickly. One request was covered an episode, or at most, two episodes. The pacing of Zoku is much slower, and in my opinion better. \\n\\n\r\nBut that pacing has a purpose (other than the fact that they wanted to get a second season out with less material). Hikigaya Hachiman kept making little sacrifices in the first season, ones that don't seem to have much significance, but over a number of them they build into one conflict that isn't so easy to solve.\\n\\n\r\nThese conflicts have solutions, and that's where the beauty of this anime starts to form. Almost every scene is seen from the perspective of Hachiman, When he understands something, you will understand it, If he doesn't understand it, you won't either, unless you have a keen eye. When he figures out the solution, you'll get it too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this adds so much to the re-watchability of this anime. Rewatch it once and you start to notice small little details that lead into the plot later on. Rewatch it twice and you start even more things that help you understand the characters (but that little facet is for later).\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nIf you are like me, the art of season 1 was great. For its time it was pretty good, and it was a bit higher quality of the light novel art, it tried mimicking the style and it succeeded. Well the light novel art did evolve over time into something nicer and the anime didn't just keep up, it outdid the work it was adapted from.\\n\\n\r\nThe detail of the characters, the backdrops, the sunsets, each of them have a beauty rivaled by very few other anime series. In some cases, there are flashbacks to season 1, so you have to go back to that style from the new seasons art which would break the flow and feeling of the scenes, right?\\n\\n\r\nNope! Every flashback was redrawn with Zoku's style so you feel even more absorbed. This is a nice touch that I wish more anime did when they make a season 2 with a larger budget and more time. It was always awkward when they switched back and forth, and that little bit of extra work was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful, most of you guys reading subs may miss it, but while the lips sync, there are like 3 to 4 shapes that the animators just run in a circle. It works, but it still feels awkward. Well this anime adds another 3-4 shapes which definitely helps. But when it comes down to important scenes, that's when the animation shines, and becomes strange at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nImagine drawing out the mouth so it changes shape and moves in a way that perfectly matches the shape of the mouth in real life. I have a scene from this anime sticking out it my mind it has that big of an impact. (suki... nano....) But that's isn't where this ends.\\n\\n\r\nMost drawn animations try to avoid lots of rotations outside of the opening, its a lot more work. So when you find an anime that does it a lot (take Oregairu. Zoku) it shows how much effort these animators make. You cant just slide things around and have the program manipulate a few small changes, the artist must draw. a lot.\\n\\n\r\nBut that does mean some awkward moments exist, because those things are drawn and chained together a smooth flow is broken. It's not bad, but its noticeable (like playing a game at 60fps then cap it at 30, it doesn't look bad, just strange and unfamiliar.)\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nI'm going to cut this short because it will just turn into a fandom.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP (Harumodoki) is sung once again by Yanagi Nagi, my favorite singer. Her voice is hauntingly beautiful anyway she sings, throw that together with some amazing composing and that OP is wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED (Everday World) is sung by Touyama Nao and Hayami Saori. Nao impressed me with the ballad version of Hello Alone back in season one (she plays Yuigahama Yui) and Hayami Saori's singing voice makes me want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nWell its worth saying that I ordered the CD version of the OP and ED's from the past season imported from Japan, I love these songs that much, and the lyrics are just as touching.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST itself is very beautiful and not only matches, but enhances the mood of the show. Rests in the music are timed at key points with the dialogue and the tension of a conversation that seems friendly on top but has a lot of aggression underneath is enhanced thanks to the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably guess, two of my favorite voice actors are Touyama Nao and Hayami Saori. In all their other works they've done such a great job. But we can't just focus on the heroines. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Eguchi Takuya. His voice acting is something else. Cold, dead, emotionless, perfect for Hikigaya, but when he needs to he can speak in a way that makes you want to laugh out loud (remember the \"guys don't only think about obscene stuff\" line from season 1, episode 1) He controls the flow and feel of the anime wonderfully, and he can play a full range of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one more person worth talking about here Sakura Ayane, she plays a new character introduced later (Isshiki Iroha). Her character is very difficult to play because she has a wide range of emotions that doesn't always match with what she's saying, and Sakura-san does her job exceedingly well. (I want to go into it more, but I can't because spoilers, lets just say Iroha has to sound fake and authentic at the same time)\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\r\nOh where to begin. The biggest and best part of this series of the characters, so I intend to spend some time here. I'll give an overview of what makes all the characters as a whole amazing and give a non-spoiler in depth rundown of each of the four major characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Oregairu special is that it is a story from the heart of Wataru Watari and his dreams of how his childhood went. He spent time thinking about the life he wished he had vs the life actually had. And what this leads to are smart, witty, realistic characters that the main viewing demographic (the otaku) can relate so much. I can pretty much all aspects of myself represented in each of these characters, although a little bit hyperbolized. (wait hyperbolized is a word?!?!?) \\n\\n\r\nAnd these characters develop and change in a way that seems so insanely natural. You finish this and you rewatch season 1, your first thought is \"was yukinoshita really this much of a bitch [that word was used in the anime, I reserve the right to keep this up even though it uses that word because it was used in the anime], Its not that her personality did a 180, its that you just never noticed it change that much because it felt so natural. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a point in this series when an unnamed character says one line. 5 seconds that completely destroys your perception of them, but it doesn't feel wrong, in fact it matches that character so well for being the exact opposite of what they have been acting like its scary. These kinds of characters are special.\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman:\\n\r\nIf you are expecting the heroic 8man here from season one, well too bad. He's starting to change, he still has his pessimistic outlook, but there are positives mixed it now too. He's the side of your mind that wants to give up when something, but pushes through because you have to. not because you want to. No one cares about him (or so he thinks) so he sacrifices himself, seeing no problem with it because the only people who would be hurt would be the nonexistent people that care about him. He's a loner and he can sacrifice himself, make himself the villain for others, because he's a loner. But oh boy that character development. (It's such a shame I cant spoil)\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino:\\n\r\nShe's the exact same as Hikigaya, but at the exact time the perfect opposite. Also a loner, she has the pain of someone who has. While hikigaya's existence faded out and was ignored, Yukinoshita was troubled because she was amazing and people were jealous. She could do anything she tried, she was smart, and she was pretty. Girls, prepare the torture tools. (I'm not jealous, no really I swear I'm not jealous). Yukinoshita instead of pushing through challenges she dislikes because she has to, pushes through those challenges because she feels she can change the outcome. You either give in to change, or you change the world so you don't have to. She hasn't really lived up to the classic image of a Tsundere. Shes more tsuntsun (hate) than deredere (love) for the sake of a description lets call her a tsuntsuntsuntsuntsuntsundere. And eventually all Tsunderes must change, right? right? there are stories that don't end that way, though. (I'm net telling you because I like you or anything, I'm just obliged as the guy writing the review *blush*)\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama Yui:\\n\r\nShe acts as the oddgirl out, and the bridge at the same time. Yukinoshita and Hikigaya are so similar that Yuigahama's character doesn't belong in their relationship, she feels out of place, she's that different. But Yukinoshita and Hikigaya are also complete opposites, so you need someone completely social and outgoing to break them both open and act as a bridge. She may seem confident, but she has the problem of having to fit in. She always puts on this face to fit in with her friends, she's gotten quite good at it. In terms of development, you she may seem like the happy-go-lucky type, but Yuigahama is actually pretty amazing. And scary as hell. No seriously she is the only character that I have such a hard time reading, I'm terrified. I noticed it with some small details in season 1 and throughout season 2, but really she's scary. (hold me Totsuka, you tennis captain you, you can make me feel safe. Oh wait, he's a guy like me. God is an idiot.)\\n\\n\r\nIshiki Iroha: NEW CHARACTER!\\n\r\nI can't talk much about her. I have to say something insightful about her personality though. Iroha is the flattest character you will ever meet. She's so 2D her character seems fake. Well that's because it is, she's putting on a fa\u00e7ade to hide her true self. She doesn't want to be hated, and she's pretty sure her true self will be, so she puts on a face. And we all know those are never perfect, they don't have the depth a real personality has. Go behind her cover, and all of a sudden you see this deep hole with an infinite depth. A little hint as to what to look out for if you want to understand her character, keep an eye out for her appearance vs her tone of voice, he small glances, and how she acts with just Hikigaya vs with others, how she hands bags around with just Hikigaya vs with others. The insight! The details here rival the literature you break down in high school English Literature (maybe an advanced course, but not AP)\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are beautiful, the lack depth in a way that actually adds insight and builds depth to their characters, they arnt static, they change in ways you don't even notice, and small facets in their personality and actions can be read into to help understand them. Honestly, I think these are some of the most perfected characters I've ever seen.\\n\r\n____________________\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is my favorite series ever. The calendar when I write this marks 2 days after Zoku's finale has come out. I've already rewatched the series already twice. I watched through season 1 in time for season 2, then season 2 weekly, then between the week of the second to last episode and last episode I rewatched the entire series from season 1, episode 1 through season 2, episode 12 in time for episode 13. Watched episode 13 at 2:00AM local time the second it got put up. Then I rewatched from season 1, episode 1 through season 2, episode 13. I love this thing that much. I own all the LN's including vol 11 which has been out for 4 days (at this point it time) (and I don't read/speak Japanese). Its an obsession. (Wataru Watari isn't bullying me into saying this, no seriously I'm really not being bullied, believe me, please.)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not for everyone, but Oregairu definitely captures a magical spark unrivaled by any other story for those that its pacing and style matches. And for the otaku, who lets face it in general happens to be the loner, it speaks to the heart. So, as I wait and hope Wataru Watari will continue writing past vol 14 so there will be enough material for a season 3 in two to three years, have a picture. It's taken from the Japanese art site Pixiv, but because that is loaded with R-18 stuff, I'm not going to link it there. Have my reupload instead- note this also contains all characters from BOTH season 1 and 2 minus one - from season 2) http://i.imgur.com/vnR7fdw.jpg The artist is IoNamichi (https://twitter.com/IoNaomichi)",

            "content": "If there's anything to take away from Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, it's that people can be very fickle, confusing beings. People are different, and that is somewhat to be expected. Some people are more extroverted than others, and some are more introverted. Some people are more perceptive and can read social situations better than others. Some people have grown weary of the strings of social stigmas and expectations that come attached when interacting with others. However, it doesn't really matter which type of social personality that one identifies with or how different you might think you are from your peers. Humansare social beings and we instinctively desire contact with others. We desire to be praised and acknowledged. We desire our opinions and actions to be noticed and heard. We desire love and companionship. We desire compassion and mutual understanding. However deep down inside, we also desire something more. It's something that we're often unsure if we already have or whether we can obtain it. Sometimes, it's easier to be satisfied by the blissful facade than having the real thing. Nonetheless, we still desire that little extra something. Something genuine.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Oregairu takes a step \u2014 or a few steps rather \u2014 away from the hook that grabbed the attention of many in the first season; it shies away from the anti-social protagonist point-of-view and begins to crunch down on the development of the cast, rather than the snarky humor, sarcastic tone, and dark knight approach that was prevalent in the first season. Though still apparent, along with Hachiman's inner monologues, they are not utilized to quite the same scale as the first season. If you came for solely those things, you'll likely be disappointed with what the second season of Oregairu has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku attributes most of it's focus onto the growth of the series' characters, rather than events where Hachiman commits social suicide for the benefit of others. This character growth extends past the service club, as we're given a little more insight into Hayama and his clique throughout the season. We're also introduced to Hachiman's underclassman Iroha, who adds a bit more audacity and flare to the character lineup. Along with the new addition of Iroha, the second season of Oregairu attempts to really push the romance sub-genre onto the stage. Whether you enjoy shipping characters and partaking in waifu wars is left to your own discretion.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the supporting cast getting their turn in the spotlight, the headliner is still Hachiman, as he resumes his pivotal role of the leading male protagonist of the series. One of the greatest aspects about this series was, and still is, Hachiman as a character. Simply put, his character is well-written, likeable, and refreshing. Hachiman's character as gone a long way from the start of the first season to the end of the second season, and it's interesting to see how his experiences have sparked his gradual change from social outcast to someone acknowledged by his peers. In addition to Hachiman, Yukino also undergoes a considerable amount of changes. Unfortunately, her family issues are only lightly touched upon near the end of this season, acting as the cliffhanger for the later light novels, and possibly a potential third season.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having a substantially different feel (pun intended) than its preceding season, I did find that Zoku had both merits and flaws. One of the biggest changes in the series, besides the change in studios, was the change in both content quality and pacing. As the series descends into more of a drama than romantic comedy, one would expect the pacing to slow down substantially. Oregairu has always been a very character-driven series, but with the extra emphasis on the supporting characters, there didn't seem to be enough screen time allotted to making sure key events and important monologues were executed coherently. As a result, many scenes felt like a contest of who could spill the most spaghetti. If you've read the light novels, the show will likely come off as disappointing, as the anime tends to look far more melodramatic due to less content. On the flip side, I do believe that Studio Feel did an adequate job with the series, all things considered. I thought the art and animation were actually quite good, though some designs from the first season seemed a bit better to me personally. I'm not one to nitpick about OP's and ED's, given that I usually skip them, and there wasn't anything noteworthy here. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest gripes with Oregairu, the anime in particular,  is that it is praised far too often for things that it doesn't really deserve that much praise for. Many people watch Oregairu and self-insert into Hachiman, which is perfectly fine since you can do whatever you want, but that emotional connection detracts from one's perspective of how well a story is actually written. I find Oregairu to be a pretty good series, but that doesn't mean it's time to sweep all the negative aspects under the rug simply because it's a little different. A lot of the issues and events in this series are excessively melodramatic. From the perspective of any adult, or mature individual, watching this series, many of the problems that plague the characters are quite petty. They are problems that should realistically be resolved by sitting everyone down and talking things through instead of having everyone play connect the dots. But that wouldn't be interesting, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe goal of many anime series is to promote the source material. In this case, it's to coerce viewers to read the Light Novels. To get the full experience, while also filling in the missing gaps from the show, I would recommend doing so.",

            "content": "\"I want something genuine\" -HH\r\nTHIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILER\r\nSlightly different from the 1st season who more focused to the Volunteer Club to \"help\" each other. The 2nd season are much more focused to Hachiman's character development and tp the people around him. Depend on audience taste, it can reduce the interest to watch. Imo, it makes the anime much more interesting because, for character who doesn't looked important finally had a development at this season.\r\n\"Too much drama\"\r\nSometimes, it can make you happy, sad, angry, make you wanna smash your screen, but first, Welcome to Oregairu where your emotion gone up and down like a roller coaster.Some scene is pretty unpredictable, for example, that scene when Hayato \"restore\" Hachiman's name after he being abused by his middle \"friend\". MUCH BROMANCE. The most interesting drama is when Hachiman's resolve a problem by sacrificed himself, causing further conflict. Very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n\"Hardly To Understand Dialog\"\\n\r\nOregairu is filled by a dialog who doesn't seem important, maybe the audience who likes a comedy anime can feel bored. But believe me, the dialog, all of them, even who doesn't seem important, are the core of the anime, and maybe you must really pay attention from the 1st episode until the end. The problem is, the dialog are literally spoken, so you really need to use your brain to really understand the story. For example, Haruno who being nice to Yukino and Hachiman, but it can turn to the opposite of it as the story unfolds, and led to speculation. But hey, it's woman, full of code and puzzle.\\n\\n\r\n\"The Cliffhanger\"\\n\r\nWell, maybe this the most obnoxious part of the anime where the ending, can't be said as ending. It's because the anime doesn't have the material from the LN anymore. So, you need to wait for the Volume 12 release, or just wait for the season 3. But the ending had the plus points like it can make so much speculation i.e \"What's the point of this anime?\". Why? because, as I said before, the last dialog between Hachiman, Yui, Yukino, not literally spoken. So, don't be confused if a confession can takes a 1/4 episode with a \"hardly understand\" words.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nFor those who already watched the 1st season, to watch the 2nd is a MUST. And for those who haven't really watch this anime, whether the 1st or 2nd season, I recommend to watch the 1st season first. Oregairu can offer a really deep story who need to use your brain to understand. If you don't like this sort of anime, with a complex storyline and so much feels, this may not for you. But if you love an anime who have so much drama and so focused the storyline, this is for you.\\n\r\nThere is so much lesson from this anime, i.e, \"Be a loner, if you lucky, there will be 2 moe girls who fight just for yourself\" Btw, ignore that. Even though you hated, hurt yourself, there are still people who care with you, Believe it.\\n\r\nEven though this is a romance anime, Oregairu still offered more drama between Hachiman, and the people around him, but after all that, we know that Hachiman is just a human, like we all. 'My Romantic Comedy is Wrong as I expected' isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this is my first review, so I'm sorry if my english is broken, or you're hardly understand my review.\\n",

            "content": "I found this series particularly frustrating watch, primarily due to what I felt was a fantastic lead character wasted on lackluster storytelling, vague writing, and uninteresting, underdeveloped love interests. \r\nHachiman is a good, solid character. His lines are witty and entertaining, and he has just the right balance of flaws and redeeming qualities. The relationship dynamic between he and his younger sister is especially endearing. However, most importantly, his character is relatable. In comparison, I found Yui and Yukino to be dull. Their characters display little growth throughout the series; Yukino is especially poorly developed. I found there to be little or unsatisfactory explanation givento the relationship between her, her sister, and her mother. Yui remains a cheerful people-pleaser throughout both seasons and is given little personality other than 'nice' and 'happy'. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was weak and meandering, even for a slice of life. The plot point of the 'contest' between the club members to see who can help the most people is introduced once in the pilot and then seemingly forgotten, only to be brought up twice more at random parts of the series. The conflict between Yukino and her family, which seems to me deserving greater - even central - prominence is barely explored and left unresolved. The arch involving the joint student-council Christmas event was unnecessarily long, and ultimately anti-climactic and boring. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, the writing bothered me. I found the conversations to be maddeningly, infuriatingly vague and loosely-defined: essentially running around in circles saying fancy words, getting nowhere and meaning nothing. (Ironically, the anime pokes fun at the Student Council President of the neighbouring high-school for doing the exact same thing.) \\n\\n\r\nI feel that this anime had the potential to be emotionally poignant and extremely memorable if only it had been delivered better, with clearer writing and stronger character development. A shame.",

            "content": "The girl asked: what do you have to do to keep going. And her brain answered: choose a number of things that will make you feel half-alive, half-useful...Yukinoshita did.\r\nWhy do people feel pain, why do people cause pain...the world is fun, can't we just laugh. The world is beautiful, can't we just look...Humans are capable of kindness and feeling good when receiving it, can't they just be kind...Humans are capable of hate and ill behavior, can't they just not hate...Yuigahama wondered.\r\nAnd Hikigaya was the person who took great pride in the value of his word. For he would literally rather turning into a villain inthe eyes of everyone he knew, in order to confirm the effectiveness of his predisposition and accuracy towards life, than having to confront the consent of those people in case his process of thinking proved inefficient. And as noble as his first notion and manner of conduct struck out, his second eliminated all nobility his character could ever emit.\\n\r\nBreaking out from ill, long established notions such as this one however, the individual would have to shatter down every belief and principle that led him to foster it, all the way to the foundation, and then reconstruct it  properly and accordingly, so that no vacancy would be left behind. Although, managing such dainty deeds would demand the abetment of a life changing experience. \\n\r\nYahari, narrates the way Hikigaya is running towards such an experience. The way Yukino and Yui find answers to their long-life questions...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe second season starts from where it was left, and once again it shows nothing more than simple high school days, without the plot being different or more revealing than the prequel, and of course not any less pleasant. In fact, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku might be considered a lot better and improved. Every shoujo anime, more or less, recycles the cultural festival, the traditional Japanese festival, the episode in the beach, the field trip and the valentine's day, without it being noted as something negative, especially for Yahari who presents its cliche in its own well executed and unique manner. However, second season's development is much more original than the average, consequently more intriguing. Yahari, which is characterized by that fluffy, light, butterfly like aura, maintains it and elaborates it further. The adjectives sweet, cute and soaked in sunset are fit to describe the vibe Yahari gives off.\\n\r\nAlthough the plot doesn't change, the development of the characters does. Everyone will be surprised by how much deep the author  can understand and exhibit human relationships. Through daily routine and everyday dialogue, Yahari makes you sink into psychological states, that aside being everyday and normal, their representation impresses you so much. While seeming like an easy thing to do, Wataru Watari (the author) does not only show aspects of the human character but also is capable enough to analyze them. After all, that is all that differentiates Yahari from every other shoujo anime and places it in a league of its own. Aside our three protagonists, this time we get a better and effective picture of the support characters too along with an utterly new one. Unfortunately, the screen time for the best girlish male character of all, Saika Totsuka is considerably reduced. We lose Hikigaya's incredible monologue that showed his messed up but still notable way of thinking by expanding it in lengths of the entire anime than to a single person. Whoever found Yukinoshita annoying will change his mind, since she found some sort of stability her personality and agile process of thinking soothes, to a point where it comforts you along with her. And lastly, Yuigahama finally reveals the first hints of the nasty parts of her character, which even though being flaws remain cute, same as  everything that has to do with her.\\n\r\nThe art is as good as ever, and due to the fact that the studio changes or that it is newer we have brighter colors. The buildings and landscapes become more unique and distinguish from other anime that have about the same pavements or houses or school corridors. Moreover, a number of mesmerizing scenes have been added, incredibly pleasant to the eye, like scenes covered in sunset or snow. The character drawings, pretty much remain the same, except to an information addressed mostly to the girls, is that their clothes are quite fashionable. It's rare and pleasant to see anime characters with a sense of fashion  except cuteness.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending is at the same level as the first season, therefore really good. Especially the ending that Yuigahama lends her voice to. As for the music during the main part, even though it isn't anything particularly notable it adds perfectly to the sweet atmosphere that characterizes Yahari.\\n\r\nIf you don't find the second season better you will sure find it worthy to be watched. Also it may surprise you in some certain parts when occasions unfit to its slow progress happen. You will enjoy the noticeable difference in the atmosphere and the  growth of the characters, however you may dislike the fact that it doesn't draw to a conclusion. It seems as if there will be a third season, but if not, you can always finish it in the manga.\\n",

No magic, no monster, no guns and no hot springs episodes. How can an anime like that survive in this day and age? I'll tell you why! The show has character , it understands the importance dramatic timing. Season 1 was more on thelight hearted side introducing us to our lovable characters but still have several poignant scenes underneath. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 was when things really started kicking into high gear, already well develop characters get even better while against high tension drama. What a snafu succeeds in whether you like it or not is subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nIt's doesn't like to tell what a characters true intentions are outright. It's like a puzzle, you are meant to pick out and piece together bits of it. From the Audio clues to visual clues and even so much of it is still a mystery. There are times when you feel like you got it then the show throws another curveball at you again. You are forced to pick up the pieces and start  again.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand how this kind of story telling can piss someone off but bear with me here the show is more than just pretentious. It's a rarity that a show can be heart warming by doing so little.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, read watch and play all snafu material if there's one series that won't overstay it's welcome it's this one.

On the art category(up), I'd say that it was a Fair since there isn't much on the fanservice for this anime to sell, but as usual it still rely on the school uniform moe, the sound (up) is good when we talk about the opening title \"Harumodoki\" by  by Nagi Yanagi and  \"Everyday World\" which is the closing theme since both fit well with the anime theme. Character(up), since the anime is all about Hikki's SNAFU Romance, I basically see no differences at all from the 1st sequel to this 2nd sequel, not even the introduction of Iroha and Kaori has contributed to any amount in this anime, in fact it only made me irritated about all the characters in this anime, on the enjoyment and overall of this anime (up), well it was fair enough at one point to be able to see the MC guy who wants to be an asshole but he can't were we see him do such task that seemly doesn't really make him an ass rather an opposite of what he wants to project, also there where moments as to the relationship between   Yukinon and her mom where at one point we were made to think that she maybe made  married to someone....or at least that what I think , but it was nice that it wasn't that way, but for me to give this anime's overall a high score was just isn't a fair thing to do since like I've said, this anime ended in a dull tune as excepted in most anime with a harem genre.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3???????? I think it'll be better if studio Feel and TBS just leave it as a light novel or if there gonna be a manga adaptation then leave it there as well if the next season will end up in an ambiguous  manner.",

            "content": "I first started watching the first season of Oregairu at the same time that the second season was airing, as I was seeing immense amounts of praise for the show and I wanted to catch up in time for the finale so that I could do my best to decipher it along with everyone else while it was still hot on the platter. As I watched the majority of the show back-to-back on my first run, I was able to form an immediate impression of the difference between the first and second seasons, and as I assume anyone that would be thinking of watching thishas already seen the first season I can tell you what you're going to find in relation to what you've already seen. If you haven't seen either season and you're checking this out because you want to see if the show is worth investing time in (aka it gets better as it progresses) then the short answer is yes, Oregairu does nothing but get better over time and watching the first season is well worth it to be able to see this one as well. Let's take a look into why.\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, otherwise known as Oregairu, otherwise known as \"SNAFU!\" (but not really. Please, no one let that actually catch on) at first glance will appear to be your typical slice-of-life high school romance focusing on a male protagonist and the various females that inevitably flock around him as he struggles to mature and find his place in the world. The first season is set apart from the fold not by its plot but by its incredibly well-written central cast and the well-designed drama that evolved from their relatable shortcomings. It's a show that rewards rewatching, as many character's thought processes and personalities are displayed not through blatant dialogue but through small moments, whether it be body language or some cryptic utterance, and the show is reluctant to ever lay out all its cards on the table for the lazy: from the beginning, Oregairu rewards attention and investment, giving more to those that are more willing to pick apart the show. The show is predictable in a good way: everything derives from the slow-moving yet powerful arcs of its characters, and the most powerful moments are often painful as not all of these kids have yet figured out what is best for them or the people around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was definitely notable: the protagonist, Hikigaya Hachiman aka \"Hiki\" stands a cut above the fold in regards to male MCs, acting not only as a window into the lives of the other characters but as an engaging and compelling narrator with a plethora of internal dialogue and a unique set of clearly-spoken beliefs about high school life. Hachiman's own development is probably one of the best parts of the show, as he struggles with his fear of non-genuine relationships and tries to understand the vast diversity of ways in which people's feelings manifest, and his character alone is really enough to make twelve episodes of content engaging and enjoyable. The other two lead characters, two girls named Yui and Yukino, are vastly different people and act as effective foils to Hikki, pushing and pulling to try and help him have a healthier outlook while also struggling with their own problems and trying to work out their relationships with him. As a trio the three are definitely memorable, and are a good enough reason to watch any show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the first season also had a lot of things I had issues with. For starters, the art was extremely bland: neither particularly pretty nor interesting, and though it was usually passable and rarely got in the way of the experience it never enhanced it either. The way in which a scene is portrayed: small details, lighting, character expressions, ect. can have a huge impact on how effective that scene is, and the first season of Oregairu did not really have this going for it. Even its most powerful moments were usually portrayed in a pretty cut-and-dry way, something that was at times irksome. The second and far more major issue I had with the show was its reliance on shitty formulaic slice-of-life contrivances, especially when it came to humor. There was a fair amount of tiresome slapstick and obviously unrealistic scenarios that clashed horribly with the show's amazing writing and characters, sometimes breaking the immersion experience. The plot as well was essentially just the characters meandering through your usual slice-of-life occurrences, with a camping trip, a school fair, a sports episode and more, and even worse these events felt very episodic rather than a constantly-flowing story. The show's supporting cast had some strong members: most notably Hayama, the model kindly alpha male with more than just a surface layer, but many of them seemed simply to be gag characters like \"yaoi girl\" and \"trap character\" where the majority of their interactions seemed to be defined by these single, overblown character traits. In all, it was a fun and intelligent experience but it was nothing I could call a masterpiece. Definitely worth a watch even on its own, but relying almost exclusively on its phenomenally written main three characters to carry a show that was otherwise generic and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThat was season 1.\\n\\n\r\nI'll never forget the first ten minutes of the first episode of season two. If it hadn't been for the presence of the characters I was familiar with I would have assumed I was watching a different show. As I mentioned earlier, I watched the first season for the first time straight into the second season, so I had only finished the first season minutes before diving into Oregairu S2. It was the same show, yes: the same characters, their same personalities, the same crisp dialogue and subtle moments and complex emotions. It even picked up directly where the first season had left off, so we were in the middle of the same events. But it was also something entirely different. Oregairu season 2 impressed me from the very first moment and every moment afterwards as it quickly solidified the fact that it was essentially a dream sequel. Why? Well, let's look into what you can expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing to jump out at you is the art. There is nothing more obviously different between the first and second seasons than the visuals. Where once characters were drawn roughly, backgrounds were bland and lighting was non-existent, now everything is brought to life with some of the most outstanding visuals and direction I've seen. The show becomes GORGEOUS: everything from the suns setting through the windows of the club room to the eerie glow of a bamboo forest at twilight to watching fireworks explode over the river at night, everything is outstandingly drawn and displayed. Rather than having to have to infer the atmosphere through the character's reactions to it, now you can feel it right there with them. The mood practically seeps out of the screen, filling your heart with the reborn world of Oregairu. The characters now have far more detailed designs, allowing for much more to be told using brief shots of their complicated expressions or body language, and this is something the show puts to incredible use. I can't get over how amazing it was to see the characters I cared about brought to life in this way, freed from their cut-out shackles and rendered in full illustrious beauty as they were always meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, the show has an entire season of development to build off of and it puts this to DAMN GOOD USE. Not only does it give incredible focus to the main three but a plethora of other characters get a much more dynamic focus, especially Hayama, the teacher and Yukino and Hikki's sisters. Rather than dividing these into separate and enclosed stories, season two connects the dots in the ways that everyone's actions and development affect the rest of the cast, and many characters that before seemed to exist more as isolated incidents now feel as though they are a cohesive and important part of a living, breathing world. Even the gag characters are now regarded far more as people, possessing complexity and involvement in the story beyond simply their tagline, which REALLY helped with the immersion. This is not to say that the main three get any less of the spotlight: the best parts of the first season were the ones that were most intense, the drama that would surface briefly before characters tried to bury it and return to the status quo. Season two features characters that are no longer content with the status quo, though. They have recognized that they want to be more than they are right now, that they want more, and that they are slowly willing to risk what they have for what they might be able to achieve. People learn to be more honest about how they feel, and become willing to speak up about that. Sparks fly, people fall in love and make enemies and lose things they care about. It's good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story: Oregairu season one layered phenomenal characters on top of trite formula, and witty exchanges on top of dismally dull humor. I can say with joy and exuberance that season two is done with that. The presence of slice-of-life fluff humor is almost entirely gone, and rather than breaking the story down into episodic events that drive the characters along the characters themselves drive the events, choosing where they go and what they do and not confining arcs of the story to the events of the highschool. For example, the student council election plays a part in the story, but it is not as if the actual election and the culmination of the character's feelings regarding it coincide: the election is merely something that happens, and the effects of it are seen long after the event itself has passed. In this way the story feels natural and as if we are following the lives of the characters rather than the events of the school. What you will get in season two is a pure, chocolaty flow of rich character interactions unburdened by cliches and nonsense and jarring humor. There is a solid balance of funny moments, touching moments, difficult moments and depressing moments, but all of them are handled tactfully and intelligently so that when there IS humor is feels more like something funny is actually happening in the world rather than the show creating something funny for the audience to laugh at. I had a stupid grin on my face on many occasions, and I was glued to the scene by visceral dread on many others.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, however, that even this second season will not fulfill the wishes of everyone. I got to see very satisfying and defining character development executed with immaculate grace with brilliant writing, and I was perfectly thrilled with that. However, although the characters could definitely be considered to have undergone full arcs, anyone seeking a conclusion to the story itself will likely not find a satisfying version of that in this season. I will be perfectly happy if we never get anything else, but I can't deny that a sequel of some sort, whether it be a third season, a movie, or an OVA series would be appreciated in really giving the story a fully completed feel. In addition, the convoluted nature of the way that character's thoughts and emotions are portrayed has been ramped up even more in this season and the show is oftentimes difficult to follow without paying close attention. It's not always an easy show to decipher, and it can definitely feel sometimes as though it is getting bogged down in convoluted melodrama more than telling an actual story. Personally, I found it to be delightful, but I can't promise the same experience for everyone, especially if you're someone who enjoyed the more light--hearted atmosphere of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, season two of Oregairu is an outstanding continuation of the franchise that exceeds all expectations and brings the show to a new level. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the first season, and I would recommend the franchise as a whole to anyone who enjoys good drama, relatable characters and good writing, and who isn't opposed to giving just one more high-school rom-com a shot. Oregairu may be in many ways just like all the others, but it does everything so much better that it's not even in the same league.",

            "content": "\"If this is all that it takes to tear us apart, maybe we weren't all that close to begin with.\"\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku, otherwise known as OreGairu 2,  has been my single must watch of this season. There are other good anime, sure, but this one takes the cake. Why? Because of it tells a story that is so believable, understandable and relatable that it is difficult not to connect with it in some way. It depicts characters who are deep, and full of emotion. High school is a time of growth and learning, and OreGairu 2 allows youto take that journey hand in hand with the characters. I know for me, at least, it resonated deep and was an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI suppose that the story itself is rather normal: but that's the beauty of it. In an anime like this, which attempts to connect to the viewer, the best way to do so is create a scenario that is very believable and then focus on the character development and interaction. The story is rather plain, but it receives high marks because of the way that it fits in with the theme and tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is great. Not much to say here. An improvement from the previous season, the backgrounds are serene and well drawn, and the facial expressions are so well done and convey so much feeling and emotion without needing to tell to your face. The characters are all designed well and their appearances often match their personalities quite well, making them recognizable. Overall, if I had to sum it up, I would say that you could take any background from this series and make it your wallpaper. Furthermore, the characters are all well designed and well drawn. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST is what it needs to be when it needs to be. It is calming and peaceful when it needs to be, lighthearted and upbeat when it needs to be, and sad and dramatic when it needs to be. I had no qualms whatsoever with the OST, as it greatly contributes to the feeling of the show. Furthermore, the voice acting is on point. All of them do so well at conveying emotion and feeling for their characters. The main trio is especially worth mention, as I feel that Yui, Hikigaya and Yukinoshita are voiced perfectly. For the role that they have and the personality they have, they are simply perfect. Also worth note is the OP, Haru Modoki. Having been introduced to the vocalist, Nagi Yanagi through Owari no Sekai Kara, I instantly fell in love with her voice. Take my favorite Japanese singer, and couple that with a beautiful song full of emotion and you have what I believe to be an opening in contention for OP of the year. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI don't believe that the characters of this anime could get anything less than a 10. They are so fleshed out and well thought that they feel like real people. Often times anime loses focus on the characters and they feel very 2D. Not a lot of development, very predictable, cliche and above all boring. Having an anime like OreGairu then becomes so refreshing. Somehow, OreGairu achieves something that very few anime do. It not only fleshes out its main trio, but also develops its supporting cast. Sure, the main trio is the focus, and receives a lot more attention. But the side characters are also very well thought out. Yes, the main three are amazingly done, but I believe that you could take any of the side characters and make them a main character of another series. For me, the notable side characters are Iroha (probably my favorite from the supporting cast) and Hayama. Both of them are fleshed out to a degree and are honestly unpredictable, making them so interesting. The interactions between all the characters also make this series shine. It contains a very mature tone, and honestly may not be for everyone. It isn't full of nonstop action and fanservice. Rather, it contains the characters who make decisions and face the consequences. It faces a stark reality that it is impossible to make everybody happy, and that in life, you will have to make decisions that have downsides. Furthermore, it gives a rather not subtle criticism of social norms, much like the previous season. Overall, these characters make the show, and are the sole reason that this anime is so good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOreGairu is so relatable and understandable. I genuinely felt for each of the characters and their dilemmas, even if I haven't personally underwent what they did. OreGairu tells a tale of love, heartbreak and friendship. It details the struggles of life, inner turmoil and the dilemma of priorities. Somehow, OreGairu takes romance, school life, drama, comedy and slice of life, a combination that we have seen a lot of before, and creates what I believe to be a classic. I truly believe that OreGairu will become one of the classics of this period, representing well the potential that anime has. Yes, it is a mature anime, but that is not a bad thing. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and will wholeheartedly recommend it to pretty much anybody.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? With the characters being as good as they are, beautiful art and deep themes, OreGairu is a must watch of the season and may be one of the best to come out in recent years. For me, it ranks up there with Clannad and Anohana, other animes of the same genre which are considered to be classics. I really really hope that there will be a season 3, as there is source material remaining in the LN which I haven't read, and that the ending of OreGairu 2 was essentially a cliffhanger. If you haven't seen OreGairu, then I highly recommend it, as it takes you on a journey that is priceless and irreplaceable. Of all anime I've watched, these are some of the characters I care about the most, and I hope for those of you who watch it, you can find something here for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n~Thanks for reading the review! If you could rate helpful or not, that would be great for me. Any advice and tips are also very helpful. If you want to chat about anime, I'm typically online a few times a week, so feel free to message me. Thanks!~",

            "content": "So every so often there comes an anime so good that you'll start digging through all of the forums you can find to hopefully find information on the elusive second season. Oregairu was one such show for me. The cool dark philosophical attitude of Hachiman with great supporting characters including two compelling heroines and superb writing all-around kept me laughing and intent from beginning to end. So naturally I was overjoyed to hear about Oregairu TOO! \r\nBetween seasons control of the show switched studios, which always gives me pause, and this time those worries were justified. The new studio's art was very pretty and certainlyacceptable, although the first season's art was more expressive and had some very fun exaggerated faces that were nowhere to be seen in season 2. And the difference in art can be seen throughout all aspects of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the anime had changed completely. Season 1 was predominately a slice of life comedy with some great character drama to bring out all sides of the well-developed cast. The second season gets rid of almost the entirety of the comedy aspect of the show. From the more realistic and less deformed art to a much more serious (and quite frankly slower) story, this show seemed to let out all of the lightning the first season had captured. \\n\\n\r\nWorst of all were the changes in writing and plot-developement. It's clear to see the show was trying to build off of the fairly epic and dramatic finale of the previous season by bringing 8man, Yukino, and Yui closer together and then throwing some serious questions into their relationships. BUT, in doing so all of the fantastic witty banter between Hachiman and Yukino was lost as well as all of the comedic tone from the service club's activities. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does feel much more like a real high school story, but in the worst way. Season 1's charm was mostly felt in showcasing Hachiman's cynical twisted view of the world, and both finding humor in and solving realistic problems from such an unconventional point of view. In season 2 Hachiman still tries to take on the dark world of the high school social experience, but gone is his devil may care attitude. Suddenly every problem 8man encounters is treated like the end of the world. The extreme gravity placed on every single plot point of Oregairu TOO! does a total disservice to the actual situations encountered throughout. This attitude stretches to Yukino and Yui as well who become completely distraught over 8man's attempts to sacrifice himself for the greater good. The big problem is the none of the actions 8man takes warrant this kind of melodramatic attitude at all. None of 8man's actions even come close to his outburst at the festival committee or dismantling of the committee chairman of season 1's finale, and with so few comedic elements and such little romantic progression, there's nothing to balance out season 2's overwhelming melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redemption in this season is in the new character Iroha, and the further explored Hayama. Iroha is a very interesting new character who seems to really bring out the best in 8man. The moments and conversations those two share are surely the highlight of the season. Hayama showed hints of his analytic mind and worldviews that were surprisingly similar to 8man's last season, and this season goes even more in depth into his mind. He becomes even more cool (if that's possible) and shows some flaws that weren't there before to make him much more relatable and human. These two certainly try to support their hearts out (along with Haruno), but they can only do so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe season finally ends on some sort of compromise between 8man, Yui, and Yukino. While it's nice to see them being friendly again, the ending is very bland and leaves such little impact on the characters as a whole. The entire theme of the season \"compromise and stay the course\" seems to be the antithesis of last season's \"be true to yourself no matter what\". What we're left with is a Hachiman who shows much more emotion, but has less heroism and has lost his comedic cynical side completely. I still give this show a 6 on the merit of how much of the character's personalities held through from season 1, but all in all Oregairu TOO! was a huge disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nFingers crossed for a redeeming season 3!",

            "content": "So, hi, first review, yeah, not very used to it...\r\nJust finished the season. Before it, I watched the first one, get interested to the whole story, started the Light Novel and... Was amazed. The \"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru.\" This light novel is truly one of the best things I've ever read. It's so simple: you just take school, a guy, two girls, age's problems we all had. That works. And usually that's what we call shounen. When you're 14 it looks magnificent for you, when you're 18 it isn't so amazing already, and so on... But when your school is anormal, real-like one, when your guy is an aloof one not because of his bad fate, but because he is quite a smart one, who has his own way, and he is NOT a looser, when your girls is real-like too, not some gorem-type stuff, when problems are very believable, then you have a seinen. And \"OreGairu\" is the last one.\\n\\n\r\nWhy it is so great and enjoyable, why the story looks so interesting, and the characters look so real, why the slightest feel of romance makes us more exited then when we watch some usual \"show and tell it all\" romance? The only firm answer I have\u2014it's surely because of Wataru Watari's, the author of Light Novel's, fascinating story writing and creating skills. The \"OreGairu\" is always in the first places among light novel, usually the first one. It started in 2011, and in 2012 it has already win it's first reward\u2014Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!, Best Novel Series, 15th place. It is the most prestigious light novel guide book in Japan, which tells us things. And that was only the beginning, who would thought about that:\\n\\n\r\nKono Light Novel ga Sugoi! 2013\\n\r\n6th place in Best Novel Series, Wataru Watari\\n\r\n6th place in Best Illustrator, Ponkan8\\n\r\n4th place in Best Male Character, Hachiman Hikigaya\\n\r\n8th place in Best Female Character, Yukino Yukinoshita\\n\\n\r\nKono Light Novel ga Sugoi! 2014\\n\r\n1st place in Best Novel Series, Wataru Watari\\n\r\n2nd place in Best Illustrator, Ponkan8\\n\r\n1st place in Best Male Character, Hachiman Hikigaya\\n\r\n2nd place in Best Female Character, Yukino Yukinoshita\\n\r\n4th place in Best Female Character, Yui Yuigahama\\n\\n\r\nYes. Things are just like this. In short, in the moment, \"OreGairu\" is the best LN series ever made. One of the, at least. \\n\\n\r\nWow, lot's of text, sorry! Well, about the \"Zoku\" season. From the beginning the only and the main one question was \"Could \"Feel\" make it right? The way readers would be happy and people who didn't read LN would want too?\". And the answer is YES. The 10th score is not for the LN, it is exactly for the adaptation. That's how you make adaptations! That's how!\\n\\n\r\nLet's just quickly look!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\\n\r\nWell, the original one is marvellous, but they could spoil it, they were making 8 (!!!) volumes in 13 (!!!) episodes! God, is it even possible to make this at least good? And they did it. They shortened the not-so-very important moments, the lengthened the most important ones. Great job, it is really the best adaptation I've ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nHere it's simple. Art is great. Especially flush moments. This series deserved a great art style, it got it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nAs in the first season, the second one has really in-place and good-hearing music. The musicians are the same, and the openings and endings are all great too. Not speaking about Voice Actors, they're great too. Way to go, usually music in second seasons really worse. Not this time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the LN and Feel adaptation skills, they are really realistic and sympathetic. Especially the Lead ones, Hachiman and Yukinoshita.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nThat's a very personal moment, depends on a looooot of stuff. I totally liked it veeery much, the end is fascinating, in gives us a glimpse on the newest volume, the 11th one, and I just can't wait to read it. The whole season went smoothly, a lot of great, funny, thinkfull and blush moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nSo, summarizing all the above, the score is 10. I wasn't so sure, was minding give it a 9, after all, 10 is really a hard-to-get score, but the last, 13th, episode made it to the top. The end in any thing is very important, and here it is great. I had a lot of feelings, few times I just stopped the episode to calm. Sympathy is great, that's true. \\n\\n\r\nWell, \"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku\" is one the best adaptation works out there, if you ask me. Way to go, Feel!\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for a wall of text, hope you enjoyed it =)",

            "content": "In the first season, the art was a lot different, and I kind of enjoyed it. But now, this season, it takes it into a whole new level.\r\nIn the first season, it was comedy-filled and it did not really focus much on the story, until it ended in a cliffhanger. Season 2 takes off right after season 1 and shows what happened after. But when they showed it, it took me to a whole new level. The art, the style, the animation, the everything. They basically made the show a lot more gorgeous than what it was. And on top of that, the story managedto progress more deeply, into what was known as \"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story goes to a whole new level as drama is added exponentially throughout the season. The story becomes serious as it tackles more on the feelings of each character such as Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui. Their lives become more serious as they have to face themselves every day without truly letting out their feelings. On a side note, side characters such as Hayato and Iroha somewhat make it more interesting. They add more in Hachiman's quest something genuine as they build up his emotions and realizations in life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I've said, the art and animation greatly improved from season 1. Season 1 started with a good enough animation and acceptable art style. Season 2 started with a flare with all the shiny and crisp details put around it. It was as if it was a different show from the first.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOregairu Season 2 (let's just call it Oregairu for short) had one of my favorite anime theme songs this season. So because of that, the sound really brings it up there. The ending theme was good too, and the soundtrack played along pretty well during most scenes in Oregairu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters is really, and definitely where Oregairu Season 2 really excelled at. We have the antisocial Hikigaya Hachiman, the ever so cheerful Yuigahama Yui, and the shy but beautiful Yukino Yukinoshita.\\n\\n\r\nI'd only focus on Hachiman, as he's the main driving force of the show. His very clever and wise interpretations, ability to read BETWEEN the lines, and his wild declarations whenever he talks in his mind. Hachiman always ends up hurting himself for the greater good, which ends up hurting the characters around him that care. That being said, Hachiman still ends up hurting someone even if he tries his best not to. Hachiman is a character to be remorseful of, that one character that many can relate about, and that one character that anyone just wants to be friends with.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotions shown for each characters is the main reason why this show is going to have a season 3. :p\\n\r\n*Spoiler*\\n\r\nBecause the group wants to let out their emotions to each other, at the same time, if they do, then the whole group would feel awkward afterwards. That is why Hachiman and the rest are still in search for something \"genuine.\" That genuine thing is about them truly letting out their emotions, which is yet to happen in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI waited every week for the first episode until the last, just to see Hachiman's somewhat crazily-smart dictations and declarations, as it was somewhat satisfying just watching him read between the lines like an Albert Einstein.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Oregairu Zoku boasts one of the best anime of the season and maybe of the year, as it trails the hardness of finding something genuine, and at the same time going through emotional scenes ever wondering if their emotions can finally reach each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first ever review, so I hope you all some Pax et Bonum!",

How to behave in that particular situation? Why am I living this hypocritical life, I dont really need friends or do I? \r\nThe same above situations are clearly depicted in this anime. Our MC is sluggard but intelligent but takes the above questions into consideration and quits making friends...This anime tells perfectly whether you need a friend or not.\r\nNow setting aside the gist and praises of the anime...\r\nSoundtracks are good, Character development maybelittle less but you can understand whats the mindset of each character, and even Art is good.\\n\r\nOnly thing that's problematic is that there is way too much conversation and too much dialogues which are spoken indirectly, but thats what makes this anime \"awesome\". ( You will understand them if you understand the situation, you dont need to read whole conversation)\\n\r\nAnd only drawback is there isn't much story, and mostly some event is going and our Club members are helping them out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is an awesome anime with topics of life, It is really educational about friends and life. There might be long pointless dialouges but that whats makes this anime pretty different and needs to be watched at least once....:)",

            "content": "The first season of Yahari SNAFU was a very solid character driven show that did a fantastic job in humanizing its characters and some really fun character interactions, not to mention a fantastic character dynamic between the main leads and some of the side characters.\r\nYahari's first season did a fantastic job building up the characters. Hachiman in particular stands out because of this, even ending the first season solemnly vowing to not change his ways of working alone and solving things.\r\nThis is finally truly brought to the test, and everything the characters stood for in the first season is questioned or changed in the second.This season resolved to an extent the inner conflicts of the characters, helping us understand them better and introducing conflicts to all the various characters of the show, including the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a sense of balance now, since while Hachiman is undeniably the main lead and the show mainly focuses on him, it became more about the side characters as well, all of whom develop in some shape or form in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThis works. It works brilliantly. The drama the conflicts cause feel extremely realistically developed and very tightly written, and not once did I end up feel that the show was being melodramatic for the sake of being melodramatic. The show feels more...meaningful, and almost every character's actions in this season carry a certain amount of weight, even their words which was something we took for granted in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and animation quality is absolutely beautiful to look at, and while many were skeptical about the studio change, this is all but gone now. Studio Feels have done a perfect job in bringing the show to life, and it is consistent in its beauty throughout the show, not even once dropping in quality. The visual effects and background are every bit as smooth and beautiful to look at, so I really can't thing of a single complaint here.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is incredibly better than the first season and has high hearing value outside of the show, never feeling like it wasn't fitting the scenes where those respective tracks were playing at.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song of this season is easily among my favorite songs to emerge out of anime in recenty memory, and is increibly nostalgic and sentimental, fitting the tone of the season extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't have more to say. Even if you disliked the first season, you're bound to find this enjoyable and engaging in some way or form.\\n\r\nThose who did enjoy the first season will find one of the best character dramas to come out of anime in recent memory, a bold statement, but one I feel this show deserves. \\n\r\nI can't think of anything this season did wrong and I simply cannot await another season.\\n\r\nI cannot recommend this highly enough.",

            "content": "Relationships are the thing that bonds people together.  We familiarize ourselves with the people we know by knowing ourselves what kind of person they are and connect deeper after we understand the accomplishments and more importantly the problems and issues that they have experienced in their lives.  But sadly, that is never always the case, as sometimes, we don't always know whether the person we think we know, is the person they actually are.  And with Oregairu, that becomes something worth talking about.\r\nStory (8.66/10): Picking up right after the first season of Oregairu ends, this season continues the tales of the VolunteerClub, where its three members Hikigaya, Yukino, and Yui continue through their club activities of helping other people in their school with their problems.\\n\\n\r\nLike its first season, Oregairu Zoku bears the same style of story, a very simple story idea (that being club activities) put in very complex plot points that give a lot more meaning than meets the eye.  However, this time, the show centrally focuses on the main three characters of the series rather than on the people that they actually help, giving us a lot of character development for the featured characters of the series.  Most importantly, the show focuses more on Hikigaya and his view on his relationships and the way he tries to resolve the issues that come forward to the volunteer club.  The show focuses heavily on character dynamics and are very masterfully done as exhibited by the change in character that Hikigaya gets within the series, and by how other characters are influenced and explored thanks to our protagonist's way of doing things.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the story focuses on the other two main characters, Yukino and Yui for a good chunk of the time, though not as much as Hikigaya gets.  Likewise, the heroines get character exploration and details that make them seem more lifelike, another plus to the storytelling and the structure that the show takes.  Most importantly though, the anime never loses focus on what it wants to tell you.  It strictly focuses on the characters and the relationships that they have with one another, with each of them seeing their own faults and flaws which doesn't waste any time and grips in the viewer with the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, however, the show has a couple flaws with itself as well.  The number one issue that this show has is simply its way of storytelling.  Because the show focuses so heavily on relationships and the way the characters talk and interact with one another, it inherently becomes very text heavy and for a complicated show that requires the attention of the viewer for its complete run in order for someone to fully understand it, it can be a bit overwhelming at times.  In addition, several plot points within the show don't really seem to be completed.  As I have said before, the actual events within the story are in overview, very simple, so when that simple plot points (such as organizing an event) sort of disappears next episode without actually seemingly being finished, that raises a couple flags.  \\n\\n\r\nBut really, I think the biggest flaw with this story is its ending because, CLIFFHANGER!  Yes, Oregairu ends on a very big cliffhanger, so big in fact that I pounded my desk after finishing the series.  It's not fun when a show has a cliffhanger ending, and because second much less third seasons of things don't always get made, it's a bit of a slap to the face when your fans finish one season and can't see what happens afterwards either because the show either doesn't have more time through another season to explain, or there's just no delivering because they aren't going to make anymore.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite the few flaws within the series, there really isn't much to complain about the story.  It's a wonderfully crafted show with complete focus towards what it wants to deliver and really puts into perspective the kinds of things we take for granted, asking questions like are our relationships actually genuine?  Or do we really know the people that we assume to be our friends and family?\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple story to contrast the complicated details\\n\r\n+ Complete focus on the plot\\n\r\n+ Great themes\\n\r\n- Cliffhanger ending\\n\r\n- Text heavy, so can be complicated when watching\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.98/10): Similarly, the cast is a wonderfully created group that really makes the show a lot more lifelike and a very good show on account of how realistic the characters seem with the way they act, and how fresh they are on account of not a single one of them really being considered a cliche or troupe.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have our main protagonist, Hikigaya Hachiman.  As our dead fish-eyed protagonist, Hikki returns back to the series as the forefront for the series.  Unlike last time, Hikki not only just helps out with the requests that he and his club are given, but the show is mostly devoted to him and the ideals that he has for himself and for his life.  What really makes his character a lot more interesting is that fact that the show challenges Hikki and the way he does things through conflicts and situations that he is not familiar with.  In the end, we get this great character development that really makes him a shining example of character growth, earning the show a huge positive because of how consistent and well-paced his development is.  Also, for the entire show, he monologues his internal thoughts, so you can also get to know him in this way.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Yukinoshita Yukino, one of the two main heroines of the series.  In terms of development and screentime, Yukino gets significantly less than she does than in the first season on account of the way the story in this season plays out with about the first 6-7 episodes focusing mainly on Hikigaya and the development that he has.  But for the latter bit, the show takes a turn and focuses on her, tackling the issues that Yukino was somewhat shown back in the first season.  In terms of development, the show does offer her some, however it's not entirely as prominent and upfront as what Hikigaya had with his story, and it required Hikki as a catalyst to even begin.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Yuigahama Yui.  Yui is more of the bum of the three, not really getting any extreme development and for the majority of the series, standing in the sidelines alongside Yukino.  Similar to the other two, they all want to find something genuine in the relationships they have, something that has them all coming out in truth rather than hiding things from one another.  Yui for the most part serves as the catalyst for this ideal, and for the series, wants to really do something for herself and not rely on other people in order to solve a task, trying to get people to share their burden with her, which is admirable, but the show doesn't really put enough screentime to blossom out that trait of hers.  \\n\\n\r\nSide characters in Oregairu have historically also been very good characters, as many of the side cast are essential to the plot of the show and are the ones that create the issues for our main protagonists to solve and help with the development of themselves and our protagonists.  In this season, there are several new people that take the reign like Isshiki, as well as many old faces like Hayato and his circle of friends, the trap Totsuka, Hikigaya's sister ,Komachi, and Yukino's sister, Haruno.  In comparison to a general side cast, these characters feel a lot more lifelike, like real people just like our protagonists.  They all have a hidden side to them that they don't like, and they all have flaws just like a normal person does.  They're not just plot devices, but character that also have the burdens of life.  In character-based shows, this is a very big positive for the series.  The only issue is that not everyone really gets treated the same, so a lot of old faces might not show up as often as people may like.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great main cast\\n\r\n+ Great side cast\\n\r\n+ Absurd amount of character development\\n\r\n-  Some members of the main cast aren't treated with major development\\n\r\n-  Not all of the side cast really gets shown\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 8.21/10): The art for Oregairu has improved from the last we saw in the first season.  Using a very light color palette, the show sparkles in a much higher quality artstyle that looks very nice to look it.  In addition, the movements and actions of the characters are very fluid, not faltering in the characters' interactions and how they act with one another.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art does come with a couple things that I have to note.  For one thing, it's not entirely consistent.  For the most part, the series looks relatively the same the whole way through, but for a couple episodes, the quality dips down and goes back to the way that the first season looked, rather than the higher quality style that the second season provides.  It's not much of an issue seeing as how the first season looks good as well, but the differences become very obvious that the show looks different when that happens, with me noticing the difference right away the moment it came on.  Also, there're some CGI sharks at the end.  CGI sharks that clash and don't look very good.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the anime provides a nice OP that flourishes with wishful and whimsical terms just like what it had in the first season of the anime.  Personally, I find it to be a very nice and calming piece that bears some sense to be memorable.  The ED on the other hand has a very similar tone, and sounds great as well, but compared to the OP, I don't find it as memorable, but it is still a good track that deserves mention.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great artstyle\\n\r\n+ Good OST\\n\r\n-  Art is inconsistent at times\\n\r\n-  Some tracks aren't too memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.44/10): Oregairu was definitely a good viewing experience.  Putting into retrospect the way we talk and interact with the people we know is a topic that can really get one to think.  It was a great show to watch, and I was for the most part, gripped with the story that was being presented.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nI did in fact.  With the way the show handled its characters and made them more than just a simple figure in a cast of one-note personalities, it really made me feel more attached to the characters and made them more lifelike.  In addition, the character development was really nice to see and to see just how much of it there was made the show even better.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nApart from the really glaring ending of a cliffhanger, I have an issue with the show itself.  Because Oregairu is such a text-heavy anime, anime of this category have historically very complex plots and moments, leading one to be very lost if they don't pay attention.  Admittedly, this happened to me, and as a result, some things and conversations that I watched didn't always make sense, and I'm not quite sure if they were missing some things or if there were events that I had to recall in order to make sense of the conversation at hand.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I would.  Oregairu is a series that in recent years, has been one of the better shows to have been released.  It is by far one of the better shows in the Spring 2015 season and touches up on some really deep topics and themes.  While I personally had a bit of a tougher time understanding what was completely going on, perhaps you would have an easier time.  Just make sure to pay attention to virtually everything, as one line of dialogue missed can lead to some confusion down the line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.50/10",

            "content": "Note: Covers both seasons\r\nOregairu\u2019s premise, on the surface seems like a typical romance comedy. It had all the components to formulate such a series, however, what it truly seeks for, is the viewer\u2019s recognition of the aspect of realism and negativity, how the social system operates and its cruelty to those who deceive it; it portrays a story of Hachiman Hikigaya, an pessimistic protagonist, who rejects reality and conceives it to be almost like a prison, his hope in social interactions in turmoil, due to his past experiences with the downsides of love and life.\r\nSo what happens? Well you guessed it; Yukino Yukinoshita, a girlof every student\u2019s dreams, not only beautiful but a genius. However, the catch is, she has quite the cynical personality, so what happens when you allow these two characters to interact? Calamity. The humor that sparks between the two is nothing short of a masterpiece, that\u2019s not where it stops however, let\u2019s just tie the loose ends of what at this point you assume to be, a typical romcom and include add another girl into the scene, said person is Yui Yuigahama, she is cheerful whatever the occasion and almost serves as the glue for the trio\u2019s relationship, throughout the course of the show, whether it is humor, or a darker aspect of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough its comedy is gold, that is not its selling point, but rather the characters themselves are what makes this series cross over from the typical sorts, to what I would consider a masterpiece, although this aspect of the show was not prevalent near the beginning of the series, but rather the latter and for the entirety of season 2, it is pretty interesting, as by following such a pattern, I assume the author is trying to convey that \u201cNothing can be the same once you truly get to know an individual\u201d, which is quite the focal part of the anime. It\u2019s these post-event interactions which allow these characters to mature.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a story however, there isn\u2019t actually much to it, which is as expected of a slice of life, however between season 1 and season 2, there is a large difference, as season 1 is rather dependent on the comedy until the latter parts, but season 2 is entirely dramatic to supplement character growth, which comedy would somewhat negate so I believe it to be for the good, going back to the former point however, I personally believe the lack of plot augments this show, as it means we have no reason to be distracted away from its main attraction; the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this show seem typical, but in reality most are actually not. Let\u2019s just nitpick some of them. Hachiman, the main character, is at the very centre of this show, not only in terms of his position, but his depth. This is due to the capacity of information he relays through his monologues, which exaggerate his characterisation to a ridiculous degree. His focus on realism is so adamant, that he is almost na\u00efve in his approaches to life, which is interesting as his nemesis in the series, Hayato Hayama, is like our loveable MC in a way, as his ability to be realistic is in the same plane, however he shines where Hachiman doesn\u2019t, in that he knows off certain situations and hence is aware of where his ability to say something would benefit or go against him, that\u2019s what makes him the \u201cideal\u201d character, whilst Hachiman on the other hand is portrayed as the villain, something Hachiman accepts and almost looks up to that side of him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYukino, is another character, that is very much fleshed out, and another one on the surface that I assumed to be typical. However, yet again to be slapped in the face! Her character development infact dwells on her inner conflict of emotions, but most importantly due to her interactions with Hachiman, but it worked both ways, which is something I am quite keen about in Oregairu, how social interactions, which were originally seen as taboo to Hachiman, almost changed both of them into something else. Now, Yui, on the other hand, has nothing to her, as Hachiman said himself, she is just a nice girl, now, you would probably think, what was the author\u2019s purpose behind this? Whilst, I can\u2019t say this for certain, I think it\u2019s because due to not being emotionally scarred in any way, she can act towards Hachiman and Yukino as a glue, however it\u2019s clear that due to her lack of awareness of such matters, she is often isolated from the conversations, even though it seems as though Hachiman is being isolated, due to his seat position in the club.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the artwork, it\u2019s terribly generic, particularly in season 2, where the style was completely altered, destroying Hachiman\u2019s iconic \u201cdeadfish\u201d eye in the process. I think the deep lying fact behind it is to show how the surface of the series can be generic, and the outlook of the characters can supplement such a deceitful thought. OST in the series, was excellent and complemented the specific scenarios incredibly well. I also enjoyed all openings and endings, particularly the Zoku ending, where it was altered for one episode to be slow paced, to reflect on taste of the episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the conclusion, this series is one of my favourites of all time, particularly season 2, as it elaborates more on the relationships of the trio, hence bringing out more of its positive aspects, as deficit, what was lost from season 1 was comedy, and even though that was solid, I believe it would seem forced due to the seriousness of the plot during the 2nd season in opposed to the first for the majority. Regardless, I enjoyed both seasons, and I had a lot of fun writing this review, thanks for reading and I hope you give this series a try!",

            "content": "To be honest I want to watch this series till the end before writing a review, however, after watching 12 episodes with the finale remaining I think it's fair to make a judgment this far (although knowing Hachiman, Yukino and Yui, we really never know what might happen).\r\n***\r\nIt's finally come to this. Oregairu 2 has delivered the final blow and has left us hanging like before. My my, I wonder how long can they keep this up.\r\nWhatever. I liked it so be it. \r\nOregairu is something that I wouldn't usually like. High school romcom, club activities, cultural festival, valentines day, etc. you name it youhave it. So I keep on wondering the entire time I'm watching it, \"why? why do I like this anime? what makes it special given the cliches it presented so far?\" Then it dawned to me, it's Hachiman after all. Because it's him. Funny how he think of himself as nobody when almost everybody is so into him. Ironic, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just like your ordinary high school romcom with harem-like set up. I say harem-like because although there's quite number of girls compare to our main man Hachiman, it didn't feel like harem, at least to me. So basically, Oregairu is about a disillusioned boy whose views about people and society are somewhat negative. That's why he choose to be alone and do everything on his own at his own pace. That was until he met Yukino and Yui. Following after where the first season left off the story continues for them.\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes this anime special for me? I say, the characters. And the way the story develops is like a cozy afternoon on a weekend. Hmm. So nice.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman is my favorite character of all. You might say, well of course, he's the mc after all. That may be true, but I like him because he's awkwardly adorable. He may appear to be a tsundere but I think he's not. He's just painfully realistic. His methods may be low but as long as it woks I think it's fine. He may look self-sacrificing but hey, someone's really got to do the dirty job, right? It's not something everybody can do. Because those people are willing to take the blame, be the scapegoat, and be hated just so something is done. I like really like his guts.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is someone I really had difficulty understanding. But that doesn't stop me from liking her as well. Cool and collected. As expected of someone from a distinguished family. For most of the part she's prim and proper. But she was known for her witty argument with Hachiman. You can't help but find it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nYui maybe isn't as witty as the two but she has her own place in between. She keeps them together. Her personality is of an ordinary cheerful and bubbly character. But normal isn't bad. Everyone shines on their own. I feel that Yui being nice is genuine.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the others, well, I don't dislike Iraho, she's like a catalyst for something. And Hayato might be like any popular guy, but popularity can also cost you much. Sure there are expectations, even so it can't be an excuse to be vague. And oh, I don't really like Haruno, she likes to pull strings with people around her. She may have good intentions so as to push Yukino, maybe it was her way of looking out for her, but she's her sister, I wish there was other way. Well, I think the relationship between siblings with the same gender and opposite gender are different.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu is interesting to watch. High school is a stage where everything is possible and unexpected things can happen. Youth is like a roller coaster ride. You can be stupid and foolish. You can make mistakes and treat it as part of growing up. You can love with all your heart and cry your heart out when things didn't work out. And then you learn. You sharpen your values and you become wise.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman may be tough but it comes with a price. He'll speak his mind when no one else would want to take the fall. And he takes pride in it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Everyone has something they hold dear, something they never want to lose. That's why they pretend. That's why they hide the truth. That's why they lie.\"\\n\\n\r\n~ Hikigaya Hachiman\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, Oregairu is definitely a must-watch.",

            "content": "Let's start with the good. Oregairu has some great, believable characters. From the beginning of the series, I've always thought Hachiman was one of the best main characters ever spawned in anime, with his hyper-realistic and negative outlook on the world and human relations. He takes everything we expect out of an anime protagonist; naivety, loved by all characters, attractiveness; and turns it on its head. He is looked down on as a creep by all of his classmates, he seems to have come to terms with this. Yukino and Yui are really the first two real friends he ever has, but due to hisreputation and his bitterness, none of them are really willing to admit it. It only stands to reason that this would create some complicated drama between them but....\\n\\n\r\nI felt like I was watching a daytime soap opera or some other generic drama-filled pedantic depressing romp through the lives of a bunch of people who just can't seem to get it together. Every episode spiraled further downward into a depressing confusing mess of emotions that just didn't seem to go anywhere and were never properly explained. Where the first season had some decent comedy mixed in with the drama, the second season had more drama, like frosting on pudding. It was convoluted, thick and heavy, and it always left a bitter taste in my mouth when the episode was over.\\n\\n\r\nEven the last episode, despite its fun, cute, and otherwise enjoyable moments just devolved into meaningless babble about \"the real thing\" and how something-or-the-other is ending or something-or-the-other would never be the same, and then the credits rolled, like if George Carlin were to end his routine with a Laffy Taffy joke and proudly bow and leave the stage.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone seemed to love the second season of Oragairu. I did not. I kept watching, hoping to see some kind of development, but it just flat-lined at that deadpan, semi-intellectual woe-is-me drama after a few episodes and stayed there until the end.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for more clever Hachiman antics, more comedy, more cute tension between the main characters, or any kind of mix of ups and downs, you might just have to wait for the third season. If you liked the first season, statistically you will probably (unlike me) like the second season, but prepare for constant debilitating, depressing drama.",

            "content": "Wow. Things start getting real here.\r\nBefore I begin, I would like to preface the fact that I rarely give a rating of \u201c10\u201d to anything (I think I\u2019ve given a total of three \u201c10s\u201d since the writing of this review). My criteria for granting a \u201c10\u201d includes 1) It is a truly enjoyable masterpiece that astonishes and provokes thought, or 2) It is a piece that truly resonates with me on a personal and fundamental level. With the case of Oregairu Season #2, this will be the latter.\r\nIt is no secret that we live in a society where your ability to conform to the status-quois constantly being judged and evaluated. I would argue that our high schools are veritable breeding grounds for this kind of judgmental behavior, and is due to the fact that if you aren\u2019t able to adapt to society\u2019s demands of conformity and \u201cmake friends,\u201d you risk becoming isolated, avoided, and ultimately alone. Some people are inevitably hurt by this. Their experiences (which are typically painful) tell them that there\u2019s no point in trying to reach out to others because they\u2019re just going to get hurt in the end, and that they might as well spare themselves the possibility of pain and humiliation by withdrawing themselves and cutting off all contact with others. Others go along with what others say and agree with them, even if it\u2019s at the cost of their identity. And others still recognize the value of conformity, but are healthily accepting of themselves so that they are able to remain true to themselves even at the cost of companionship. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I can say that I am quite fortunate to have been able to play society\u2019s game well and come out with a good number of friends and acquaintances, the number of close friends that I have probably numbers only in the handful. I am admittedly difficult to get to know, and I tend to be quiet and keep to myself, preferring to listen to others instead of talking because I am inherently more interested in learning about other people. Naturally, I would prefer to hang out with my close friends more so than any of my other friends, simply because we don\u2019t have to worry about judging ourselves with each other and can be ourselves freely, speaking our minds given our mutual understanding. I ask, then: What better way to achieve this type of closeness than with the person that you love most?\\n\\n\r\nLove makes us do strange things. I can say with absolute certainty that I, at some point, was all three types of people I have described above. And unfortunately, this process revolved around the three people I managed to fall in love with at some point in my life. I am inclined to call them \u201cnice girls,\u201d and I would try to appreciate their tastes in food, music, TV, pretty much anything that piqued their interest in, in order to become closer to them. I did this even though, at the end of the day, some of the things that I did just didn\u2019t seem that appealing to me. But of course, none of that mattered to me at the time considering that my feelings for the other person superseded my own desires. My life became devoted to providing them with as much pleasure as I possibly could, in the na\u00efve hopes that one day they would reciprocate my efforts in kind. These nice girls.\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019d like to think that we\u2019ve all done something similar in terms of sacrificing our own interests for the sake of someone important to us. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d really be here if everything went fine and dandy for me, as I eventually learned at some point in my relationships with them that they ended up liking and going out with someone else (often times without the luxury of finding out directly from them, much to my terrible surprise). Each time this happened, I felt increasingly more humiliated, hopeless, and (wrongfully) convinced that I would be alone for the rest of my life (I was being fairly dramatic back then, but I never really had much self-esteem to begin with). In addition, it frustrated me that, despite my honesty and feelings on the matter, I couldn\u2019t get the same kind of honesty in return, even if it meant that my heart would ultimately be broken. Needless to say, I became quite weary of my interactions with the opposite sex for quite some time, and I became jaded in the topic of love.\\n\\n\r\nBut then I came across this show. This magnificent show. This series that understood what I was going through. That understood the different ways that relationships are formed and maintained in the real world, how fleeting and long-lasting they are, and that showed me that while my methods of pursuing the greatest challenge and achievement of life were indeed noble, they were ultimately wrong. It was weird realizing that I was seeing an albeit dramatized representation of my life in this show, as I wasn\u2019t expecting to learn anything about myself when I started this series. What I actually got in return was an opportunity to objectively watch something that almost literally told me \u201chere\u2019s where you went wrong\u201d in my endeavors, and to have gained valuable insight from a medium such as this was, to put it lightly, awe-inspiring. To say that this experience has challenged my preconceptions of anime as only a means of entertainment is a gross understatement; I have come out a new, wiser, and more authentic person. \\n\\n\r\nYou could criticize me for having such a \u201ccheesy\u201d reaction to something as simple as a TV show. Which is fair. After all, these are my experiences. Not yours. But for those of you who have experienced failure in romance and relationships, and are looking to find meaning your failure, to understand, or to feel understood, I can think of no finer example than the series that I am critiquing right now. Oregairu gets it. All of it. And one cannot help but sympathize for the genius that is Wataru Watari and the experiences he must have lived through in order to produce such an emotional masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall tone of this season is a lot more serious in contrast to the more lighthearted one the previous season had, and that is because we are starting to get into the crux of the matter that the author is trying to convey. It would be difficult for me to recommend this series to those either looking for something lighthearted or those who aren\u2019t able to relate to what I have just mentioned above, mostly because those people would probably get impatient with, or wouldn\u2019t fully appreciate, the drama that happens in the series. But if the possibility of finding answers to your relationship issues in a medium such as this seems appealing to you, or, if nothing else, advice on what to look for in a serious relationship, I highly recommend that you continue forward with this series and give this season a shot. Because at the end of the day, wouldn\u2019t it be better to be liked by someone because of who you are, rather than what you\u2019ve done?\\n\\n\r\nAuthenticity is hard to find these days. But I move forward with renewed hope that one day, I will find what I\u2019m looking for. So I\u2019ll be here. Watching. Waiting. For someone to come my way. Someone honest. Someone real. \\n\\n\r\nSomeone\u2026 genuine.",

            "content": "We live in a world where realistic relationship is a fantasy fairy tales and novels make up.\r\nHumans continue living by tricking one another, being a phony, lying even to themselves and hiding our own motives.\r\nEven if someone comes to you and say \"You can be real to me, because I'll be so to you too\", you won't open up to them, and in fact close your heart towards them, thinking they have some motives under their back.\r\n\"But still, I want something genuine.\"\r\n-Hikigaya Hachiman\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru Zoku, commonly called in the west as My RomCom SNAFU Zoku (called in this reviewas romcom snafu zoku) is one of those harem anime that contains moe, cute girls being cute, unrealistic setting of girls getting attracted to main characters and main character having the solution to all problems.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone, however, calls this anime as \"just one of those stupid moefag harem anime\", they are sorely mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of RomCom SNAFU aired and was finished some time ago, interesting a number of anime fans for its unique style of problem-solving, an unorthodox main character who has lived a majority of his life as a loner, after his hurting memories in his middle-school. Along with the socially inept Yukinoshita and 'too' socially apt Yuigahama, the three members of service club solve the students' problem in a wrongly manner, unable to come up with a more 'correct' and 'proper' solution. This fresh pace of romantic comedy called attention of numerous viewers as the popularity of the first season left some in cliffhanger and others in relative nonchalance.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season also follows our protagonist, Hikigaya Hachiman (henceforth called Hachiman) as he continues his work as a member of service club. The other two members of the service club, Yuigahama Yui and Yukinoshita Yukino (referred to by their last names in here) as they finally tackle the source of the problem of their falsified relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself follows--or appears to follow--the conventional style of a harem love comedy anime. Hachiman saves a number of people from their problems and gains hearts of famous--some even idolized--girls and even boys, despite the fact that he is referred to as the 'outcast of society', especially the society that Hachiman's classmates populate. Yuigahama and Yukinoshita are both expressed, in all of SNAFU's media mix including the orignal work, as the beauties of the school that a number of male students take interest in. The new additions of the casts, Isshiki Iroha, Kawasaki Saki and Yukinoshita Haruno are all explained and shown as above-the-average girls, although they all seem to take interest in a dead-eyes protagonist such as Hachiman.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime is not a love comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime centralized more in the difficulties Hachiman, Yuigahama and Yukinoshita face in their twisted relationship, as they all tackle the perhaps most difficult question in all human relationships--whether it is that of romantic nature, of friendship, of envy, of anything--\\n\\n\r\n\"What is genuine?\"\\n\\n\r\nThey know that the relationship they have led up to that time is nothing of genuine nature, and therefore can be broken upon a single trouble. They know that the partnership they have believed in season 1 is nothing of genuine nature, and therefore can be betrayed upon a single misunderstanding. They know that the friendship they have relied on until then is nothing of genuine nature, and therefore can be destructive upon a single word of that cold bastard called reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of RomCom SNAFU is not something that cannot be thought of by an amateur writer. The scenario itself is not superficial, as it contains no unexpected plot twists or well-crafted surprises incorporating the beginning of the show. However, the settings and scenarios are not only described well, but also illustrated realistically. Although it is unlikely that people would live a love-comedy-like life, but if they did, this is how it would happen. The solutions Hachiman offers to the students' requests and the outcomes of his decisions are welly illustrated. If there is something all writers can be proud of, it is accurate depiction of reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest problems RomCom SNAFU Zoku faces as an adaptation are the favoritism the producers play towards certain characters and their failure in controlling the pace of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is evident upon the difference in Hachiman's reaction to Yuigahama and Yukinoshita's romantic approaches. While he evidently shows interest to Yukinoshita's approaches, he seems to show nonchalant to rejecting reactions towards Yuigahama's approaches, despite the fact that the original and season 1 shows Hachiman's equal reactions towards the two heroines. These kinds of favoritism is a double-edged sword as while it may bring up the specific heroine's support, it may also be shown as a political motive to sell more, which can and is viewed negatively.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is evident in the end of the anime where it ends in a cliffhanger. Although the anime has controlled its pace magnificently for both original work followers and first-time watchers, the anime's extreme pace of squeezing an entire volume of the story into two episodes or less cannot be viewed as anything more than rash judgment. It has unfortunately even reached the end of all released volumes and showed the preview of the 11th, unreleased, volume.\\n\\n\r\nAs these are not minor problems, the story segment which could almost be viewed as a masterpiece was pulled down severely, even threatening the overall enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the case of art, the second season excelled in comparison to the first as all the characters were drawn beautifully and accurately to the original work, to my personal enjoyment. While there were some questionable emotional depiction of the characters, the overall quality was superb. The heroines' emotional distresses and Hachiman's struggle, especially at the climax scene, proved that Studio Feel is capable of delivering the internal conflicts RomCom SNAFU is famous for. Except for minor quality breaks here and there, and the undersized hands in comparison to the characters' heads, I have no complaints against the animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the two voice actors, Hayami Saori and Touyama Nao, and Yanagi Nagi returns as the singers of the openings and endings. The new opening, sung by Yanagi Nagi, the singer of the first season's opening, excelled in all qualities of a good song. Its lyrics depicted the internal struggles discussed in the anime perfectly, its rhythm was catchy enough to stick in the mind in a short span of time, its quality was over-the-head with the use of Yanagi Nagi's soft yet pained tone, as if singing about a regrettably parted love.\\n\\n\r\nThe endings' qualities were superb as well, as both voice actors performed magnificently in their duets, solo (in the ballad versions of the ending) and in their character songs. Touyama Nao asides, Hayami Saori is one of the few voice actors who are recognized widely for her performance in singing. Touyama Nao however performed over-the-top as well, in comparison to her usual songs, to my greatest pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST's were the same as the ones used in the first season with some additions, one of them being the piano version of the opening, and it was a great choice for the producers to have used the same OSt's since it closed the gaps between the second season and the first season, which were widely opened by the art style. The OST's themselves were also a wonderful collection of music, my favorite being one played at bright times in the service club's everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in the case of the anime's characters, there is nothing I can say other than how wonderfully they are portrayed. Their reactions and thought processes are very humanlike, which is the most any viewer can ask from a writer. The characters themselves were very lovely as well, perhaps because of their humaneness. Hachiman, for instance, shows his humaneness over and over again through the portrayal of his internal struggles, not just with his relationship with the members of service club, but also with him himself, who suffers a severe identity crisis in the matter of his validity as a provider of solutions in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAnother likeable aspect of the characters is the fact that none of them are perfect. Hachiman, as explained above, solves questions presented to him in an unorthodox--and downright morally wrong--methods. His personality asides, he feels a great deal of self-hate throughout the anime which increases more and more in magnitude as the story progresses. Yuigahama's habit of putting others before her--which seems to get assimilated as the story progresses, in contrast to Hachiman's and Yukinoshita's problem, to be explained afterwards--is constantly questioned by others, and before others, herself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, perhaps the central item used in the progression of the story, Yukinoshita's problem, is of greater magnitude than the other two main characters, in contrast to seemingly perfect surface that she presents. Her root problem, the conflict she holds with her mother and her sister, Haruno, is perhaps the hardest problem ever unearthed in the story, and definitely the most complicated one. However, her problem does not only stop there as her character is shown to have severely reliant attitude.\\n\\n\r\nAll these three characters are perfected because of their imperfection. Their imperfection proves their humanness.\\n\\n\r\nThe character aspect does not stop here as the anime provides deep insights for all the characters' personalities. Hayama Hayato, the seemingly perfect protagonistic character, Isshiki Iroha, the seemingly manipulative 'typical' high-school girl, Miura Yumiko, the seemingly antagonistic character, Ebina Hina, the seemingly comical relief girl of the story, Tobe Kakeru, the seemingly comical relief boy of the story, Zaimokuza Yoshiteru, the seemingly otaku delusional of the story, and Saika Totsuka, the seemingly boy-girl of the story, are actually much more than they appear to be.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is nothing I can ask more than a group of complicated, human-like, interesting, fun-to-analyze characters such as them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was an enjoyable experience. The cast of characters with the voice actors' amazing acting was superb. I was more than satisfied with the amazing quality of the animation itself and the songs. I found the seemingly-romcom-like story to be more than interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, aforementioned problems did quite an impact on my overall impression of the anime, enjoyment included.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the minor problems such as the crash of art quality, severely skipped storyline or unsatisfying depiction of the characters' emotions were manageable and not bad enough for me to drop my impression of the anime too much, I found the almost malicious favoritism and extreme cliffhanger to be not only questionable but also downright disappointing to the beautiful quality of the anime the producers have shown up to the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that such a cliffhanger boosts the sale of the original work, in addition to the bluray sales and possibility of the third season, but a cliffhanger ending without a speck of feeling of resolution when a third season is not even planned is nothing but malice and political motives. I found this move of Studio Feel to be downright insulting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is true that, while the cliffhanger ending may raise some unwanted and negative attentions, the story itself and the quality was top-notch, with my interest to the original work and the series boosted.\\n\\n\r\nRomCom SNAFU is indeed not a masterpiece. It has its downsides, its misgivings and its imperfections. However, it would be a sin to call this a bad anime, or in fact, a normal anime. It is an anime almost guaranteed to capture the viewers' attention.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for that, I salute at Studio Feel and Watari Wataru for releasing Hikigaya Hachiman's adventures to the world.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is true, despite all its positive sides, its fulfillment and its epicness, that the sole world I would use to describe Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru as \"INCOMPLETE\".\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I cannot, in good conscience, give this anime any more score than a flat 8.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, I can also say with confidence that this is not the end of Hachiman's journey, and that even if it is, there is much enjoyment that can be experienced by this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, you MUST watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThank you and happy anime.",

            "content": "Well, before I jumped into the new season of Yahari Ore [...] I decided to re-fresh myself on the prior season and at the end of it all, I still found myself feeling an ability to relate to the feelings of the MC and to enjoy the small amounts of drama that occurred. It's a good watch, no doubt.\r\nThis sequel, however, took characters I didn't even realize, myself, that I related to so deeply and really fleshed them out. Enough to the point where I really felt myself understanding the MC's motivations and feelings because I have also, to some extent, felt the same- especiallyin the brutal environment that can be high-school social life. \\n\\n\r\nI feel this really makes the series honest. The ending bit is especially great because it alters the way you feel towards one of the heroines (if that title suffices,) and opens up a new way of understanding the motivations of the characters and actually connects with the first season. \\n\\n\r\nI had tears at some points, not going to lie about that, but this presentation was great, and even though there may be some who want a more concrete ending with a finality I say this; instead of looking for closure, why not reflect on the emotions and motivations of the characters and enjoy the growth and admittance, the shame and denial, and the overall feeling that resounds too true with basic human wants and fears.\\n\\n\r\nAn awesome, awesome, sequel. Not a masterpiece, but damn, I was gratefully surprised with how the show evolved. Probably one of the more, if not most, honest high-school setting series' I have ever enjoyed.",

            "content": "I once came to this conclusion: that no matter how wide my vocabulary, and no matter how skilled I am at constructing sentences, whatever I say to make myself understood by others will never come across the way I mean it to. We all have different experiences that lead to different ways of thinking; the way I think it best to express something is different than the person next to me. Is there a right way? A wrong way?\r\nEven as I write this, I'm aware that this will be read by others, and that my words need to be arranged in such a way thatmy true feelings might reach the next person. But by consciously stringing my words in this way, don't my feelings get tarnished in some way? Don't they become... fake?\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteriru (both seasons) touch upon this idea of deceit versus truth while addressing the issues that come with youth. As the main character, Hachiman Hikigaya, reads between the lines in everything he hears - with ever present skepticism - so the viewer is forced to do the same. Sometimes, the thoughts and feelings of characters are left unknown, or left for us to guess, but that's not all it's about. As long as we can feel, and try to understand, and strive and struggle and find...\\n\\n\r\nI'll gravitate away from the philosophical ideas the show leaves behind and go on to point out that the characters, the story, the art - everything comes together perfectly to instill all kinds of human emotion. I found myself frustrated, happy, and sometimes tearing up. I think most people can relate to this show on some level.\\n\\n\r\nBy calling the show perfect, however, almost begs the question that it is right, correct, genuine... that in no other way could the creators have pulled off making me feel this way. I am me - whoever that is - and what works for me may not work for others. So some may not enjoy it, or understand it, and some may get something completely different out of it. Perhaps my own perception is off. But does it matter? We're flawed, but we try, we try and connect, and we run in circles, and we get left behind, and the point of it all? \\n\\n\r\nThat's something we have to figure out on our own.",

            "content": "\"I want something genuine.\" - Hikigaya Hachiman.\r\nThroughout my numerous years in school, i've had to learn the hard way that things are not perfect. There are always things that do not go as expected. Evidently things like friends and relationships. It is easy to say that all your previous bonds, relationships, and memories from your school would be preserved and remain as you enter high school. Saying it and it actually happening are two very different things.\r\nThinking back to it, many of my close friends who I had special connections with in middle school, ended up drifting away as we entered high school. Our interestshad diverged and we stopped having things to talk about. Our ignorant speeches of us exclaiming that \"we'll still always be friends\" had felt seemingly empty. It wasn't something that either of us put that much thought into, something that wasn't completely genuine to us.   \\n\\n\r\nWhat is being genuine?\\n\\n\r\nOregairu is a series that portrays these feelings quite accurately, and even if the level of seclusion Hachiman has towards everyone around him is abnormally higher than your typical average student, it still makes him feel like an incredibly relatable character. Oregairu dives deep into the question of just what is this thing that we call being genuine and how often terms like absolute and genuine are thrown around without any meaning. \\n\\n\r\nHachiman is able to look through these facades more often than not because the painful truth is, he's been through it all before. People acting nice around him always gave him the wrong idea about their relationship. It has been something that time after time, he has misinterpreted and has had to endure the consequences for. Through Hachiman's eyes we see that stripped of all of his cynical thoughts, how artificial and fake some relationships that we have with others are. \\n\\n\r\nBut...as true as this might be, it is not necessarily our fault. We humans are very strange creatures. We often say things we do not mean. We often do things that do not directly correlate with how we feel. Does this make us horrible people? No.  \\n\\n\r\nWe're only human and as much as we hate to confess, we do these things to stop the people that we love from being hurt. Similarly to how Hachiman solves his problems, many of us are willing to sacrifice our own well being for others. \\n\\n\r\nAs long as the people we love aren't hurt, what is the problem? \\n\\n\r\nOregairu addresses the seemingly subtle yet painful consequences that this can have with our relationships. Through Hachiman and his friends, we see how these fake relationships can build walls that prevent people from truly understanding each other. These fake relationships build idealistic images of what people expect from each other. When you realize that the person is not who you expected them to be, it really makes you wonder if you really knew them at all. Those fake words that were used to help prevent our loved ones from being hurt, end up being the thing that hurts them the most.\\n\\n\r\nBut.. it doesn't always have to end up like that. Some people do want to try to find something genuine in all of their relationships. It's hard, and it might not always be successful, but slowly we see step by step, Hachiman realistically trying to achieve this goal with the help of his friends. Here we have Oregairu, as we see Hachiman's journey in trying to find that one relationship that he can wholeheartedly say is truly genuine.  \\n",

            "content": "YOU COULD COUNT THIS REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS\r\nBefore watching this anime, My favorite anime was Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.\r\nOregairu season 1, and 2, blew SnPnK off my list. Oregairu is so great at being a Slice of Life and RomCom, everything feels perfect, and I am not even exaggerating. Instead of having general slice of life and RomCom cliches, it has a unique story (correct me on that if it was already done in old or anime that I have never seen), relatable characters and doesn't turn into harem like some of the romcom/SoL i've seen.\r\nStory : 9/10\r\nThe pacing is perfect. The story kindadivides into arcs which all connect into a final story. Each arc gives backstory to the characters, and reveals their hidden feelings or character. It all feels so well executed that you get really into the story. I won't summarize the story, so no spoilers here.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, since the anime is new, it has some pretty good art. First season did have some flaws like Yukino sharing the same look as Shizuka, but it's fixed in the second season. All the characters look well and represent what they are well, for example Yukino being the silent Dandere has a character design that looks like a Dandere.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is pretty good with good vocals, not the best opening out there though, that's why I am giving a 9/10. The voice acting is perfect, which is well, expected.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where this anime shines. The characters are so damn well represented, even with the cliches, they represent a real life class, with the bullies, the bitch who acts like a V.I.P. (basically a tsundere), the rejected people.. e.t.c. The character development is also perfectly done. The deeper the story gets the more you feel attached to them (which is again, normal, in good anime). Yukino (my personal favorite) goes from being a bitchy rich girl with no feelings to a week and loving character. Nothing much to say, the characters are just downright perfectly executed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe moment I finished the anime, I was already on forums trying to find out if season 3 is coming. This, as I said in the beggining, knocked SnPnK out of first place on my favorite anime list, and SnPnK is nearly perfect. Although, If you are into shounens or Harem anime, this is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOregairu is one of the best anime I have ever seen. With overall perfect characters, an amazing love triangle story, and good art. I would gladly recommend this to someone who likes SoL RomCom or to a SAO fanboy to show him what a real love story is.",

            "content": "The series takes a surprisingly nuanced and organic approach to Hikky's growth as a person.  Rather than manic bursts of change, which is a rather contrived and tired device used by many series, Hikky slowly claws himself through the mud to find the answers within himself and in the people around him that he grows to love and care for.  This pace mirrors real growth and is more applicable and topical.\r\nEach of us has an internal monologue, and almost without exception, that voice is negative.  Hikigaya Hachiman's monologue probably composes half or more of the spoken lines in this series... which isexactly as it should be.  Anyone who is or has had a difficult time fitting in with others can easily find at least a part of themselves in the way that he looks at the world around him.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when one holds this monologue up to the light and checks whether it matches up with reality, one often finds that it doesn't.  The conflict between how we see ourselves and how the world sees us offers an opportunity for growth and change.  This friction is at the surface of Oregairu 2 in the form of Hikky's monologue, and the events and relationships in the series are more raw and relatable for its presence.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the composition of elements in Oregairu 1, you can picture Zoku as a refinement (though not a perfection) of those same elements.",

            "content": "The first season was good, but I never imagined the second season would be so perfect. Welcome to Oregairu, an anime featuring some of the most well done character relationships I have ever seen. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nOne thing I really enjoyed about this season was its lack of clear-cut arcs which so many anime seem to have. There's nothing innately wrong with having arcs; the issue is that it often prevents genuine character development. The completion of an arc usually means the main character of that section is now irrelevant, and the nature of having arcs means that character, or characters, will only have just thatone arc to develop. By avoiding this convention, Oregairu allows our characters to develop over all 13 episodes, not just 3 or 4. \\n\r\nPlot wise, the story picks off immediately after the first season. Hachiman and the girls go back to doing their Service Club duties, except this time Hachiman's methods will not go unpunished. His tendency for self-sacrifice may sit well with him, but he'll soon learn that self-sacrifice doesn't only hurt him, but others around him as well. \\n\r\nThis may give the impression that the second season is depressing. It's not, but it is definitely more serious because we'll see the bonds of our three beloved characters really put to the test. Think of it as a more mature version of season one. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually really good. You'll see a major difference between the two seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSolid opening and ending themes. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this category deserves an 11/10. You'll witness a great amount of growth in Hachiman, something that I actually saw some people disliked. Many people have claimed he's lost his sarcastic and pessimistic attitude, something that attracted all of us to the show in the first place. To be honest, this is sort of true. He's less sarcastic, but only because of how much he's matured. He's come to realize that \"youth is a waste\" isn't really accurate, and that trying to maintain this apathetic attitude doesn't bring happiness to himself nor the people he cares about. Watching him grow from his trials was extraordinarily satisfactory. \\n\r\nHis journey means he has drastic effects on the people around him, however, and you'll see how Yukino, Yui, and the others are affected by it, for better or for worse. Can't really say much more without spoiling it, as the show is  heavily character-focused. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJust really perfect development of characters. Sometimes I wish the show was more light-hearted like the first season, but it's by no means a serious drama or anything. It's still the characters we know and love, but now they've grown up a bit, and it's been fantastic to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a big fan of season one, which I know a lot of people are, you will fall in love with season two. Definitely a must watch from Spring 2015. \\n\\n\r\nIf this review was helpful, please say so! If not, I'd be glad to know how I can improve.  \\n",

            "content": "This anime scored pretty high in my book!!\r\nYAHALLO!! Time to review the second season of the widely acclaimed \"Most Relatable Anime!\" The Batman is back in business with Oregairu Zoku, the sequel to the anime that had everyone saying \"that's exactly what I thought!\" or \"I totally went through something like this!\" This season takes the realistic problems faced by our high school protagonists and develops them further, finally using the drama to help the characters change themselves into better people.\r\nThis season is much more serious than the first season. If you are looking for the amazing monologue comedy and hilarious character interactions from before,this season doesn't have as much of it. It's still there, of course, and Hachiman still speaks the truth, but this season focuses more on the drama and the development of its characters rather than the comedy. It delves deeper into the themes of understanding, trust, manipulation, desire, and the ability to fend for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- One of the best main characters is back with his anti-hero tactics, his savage and on-point monologue, and his selfish but selfless attitude. In this season, he develops as a person a lot and starts to open up and realize that just because his way of doing things is correct, doesn't mean it's right. Shirou would be proud.\\n\r\n- Beautiful OST and brilliant performance of the seiyuus truly bring out the struggles of high school life, and how it is much harder than it seems.\\n\r\n- One of the most down to earth cast of characters ever. They are all extremely imperfect, they have their good points and they also have a lot of flaws. They all have their own selfish desires, and they feel like real people that you have probably met before. This makes them really good characters.\\n\r\n- Very powerful scenes and imagery. Some of the scenes sent shivers down my spine.\\n\r\n- Finally, the romantic tension starts to kick in tenfold. It's subtle and not obvious or overdone, but it is still extremely intense and impactful, and really affects the characters and the story.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- A lot of dialogue. There is a lot of talking in this series, so if you ain't a fan of reading subs or hearing people mumble on and on, sorry m8.\\n\r\n- Characters sometimes piss you off (although I believe that the mistakes they make and their annoying characteristics makes them great as characters.)\\n\r\n- Much less comedy than the first season. I came expecting my sides to fall off but I received life lesson after life lesson thrown at my face. (Not that I'm complaining, that's why it's good!)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nPlot development shot through the roof with this season. Taking the drama that was building up from the first season, the second season takes that drama to thoroughly develop the plot and especially the characters. Hachiman starts to realize that his Batman Martyr methods aren't good ways to solve his problems, as he doesn't realize the serious repercussions that it creates. The story is about how he and the other characters make revelations about themselves and about each other, and how they deal with it. The drama isn't forced at all and you can definitely imagine something similar to this plot happening in real life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNothing has changed much from the first season. The characters still look amazing, and the scenery is still good. You can easily tell the mood of a scene or of a character by how they are drawn or animated. The mood that the art gives off can be extremely intense, like how a painful expression can completely turn around the atmosphere. This season is animated by a different studio, but other than a slight increase in quality, nothing too drastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSimilar to how the art was extremely impactful on the mood of a scene, the soundtrack and the voice actors did an amazing job portraying the emotions of a character. The subtle fluctuations in a voice really tells you the mood of a character and makes it more intense. The voice actors performed amazingly. The OP and the ED weren't anything special, but the OST was surprisingly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacter development heaven. The characters discover so much throughout this season. Each character is extremely different from each other and full of characteristics. This cast of characters is one of the most multi dimensional cast ever, as you really can't judge them by their covers. They all have their goals and desires, and they all have their own beliefs and methods of obtaining them. The development of the relationships between them is very complex, but that highlights just how characteristic each character is.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this show has the best trap and best imouto ever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe Oregairu series never fails to disappoint, it's humor is extremely good and the drama and character development results in a thrilling ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis series definitely isn't for everyone, as some people won't relate to Hachiman as I and others did, but it's still an amazing anime to follow for a show that takes point of views to a whole new level.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nA famous adage goes along the lines of, \u201cIt is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.\u201d Putting it differently, romance is something that everyone should go through no matter the outcome, because despite the difficulties it generates, the heart-skipping, cheek-blushing, and smile-bringing make it all worthwhile. But what if that was not the case? What if, against our better judgement, the \u201canti-romance\u201d took center stage? That is whereYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku comes in. As one of the premier anti-romance anime \u2013 focusing onthe throes and pains of love, not the jubilation and elation it oft produces \u2013 OreGairu Zoku has one goal in mind: finding the \u201creal thing.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nMany aspects of the world are formed as polar opposites, such as with romance and anti-romance. Usually called dichotomies, more concrete examples of this phenomenon are: black and white, up and down, and nice and rude. Their power comes from the distinct contrast they generate, because it is easier to see and understand an object when it is compared against everything that it is not. Another of these pairings is positive and negative, and in OreGairu Zoku\u2019s case, it strives for maximum negativity, creating a dichotomy that leads to the \u201creal thing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOreGairu Zoku steeps its narrative in negativity, which can readily be seen when its conflicts are broken down. More specifically, who they involve, where they take place, and what they apply reveal its constant negative vibe.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cwho\u201d part of the conflicts is the easiest to surmise. The plot does not mainly focus on Yukino and Yui, but rather the rest of the cast. This seems obvious, given the purpose of their club. However, unlike the first season, it is not the two of them working together with Hachiman to solve the problems at hand but rather a disjointed effort. Indeed, much of this season shows the triangle separated until later episodes. Worse still is that even when they are around, either other characters such as Iroha and Hayato are looked at or their scenes are saturated with gloom, signifying how much emphasis is placed on everyone besides Yukino and Yui.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBesides\u201d is appropriate given the context because \u201cwhere\u201d these conflicts take place is, too. Before, the majority of the issues centered around the school \u2013 the track field, the gym and rooftop, the student council room, and so on \u2013 but in OreGairu Zoku, the locations mostly shift away from \u201chome turf.\u201d The beginning of the drama happens on a school trip, the collaboration with another school is conducted in a neutral building, and Iroha\u2019s confession takes place at an amusement park. Even the climactic conflict occurs at the local zoo and not the school. As a result, the conflicts come off as distant, uneasy, and therefore negative because they do not occur in a known, comfortable setting. The negativity is amplified further when the non-focus of the main trio is taken into account since not only are the locations unfamiliar but also the people nearby are as well.\\n\\n\r\nAmplification nears its peak when the \u201cwhat\u201d of the conflicts is investigated. While the people involved undergo these problems, the conflicts apply indirect pressure on Hachiman and the two girls. The cohesiveness of a group, the delicate handling of two sides butting heads, and the failed relaying of feelings are meant to mirror and highlight the most important conflict: the one brewing between the three main characters. Thus, negativity builds as Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui refuse to address their own issue despite the numerous signs being raised around them, pushing the main conflict to the breaking point. OreGairu Zoku\u2019s conflicts also have a \u201cwhy\u201d \u2013 the resolutions are roundabout instead of upfront \u2013 and a \u201cwhen\u201d \u2013 as seniors, there is little time left \u2013 that induce the crestfallen mood further. Coupled with the dismantling and displacement of the \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d respectively, the negativity is almost undeniable.\\n\\n\r\nNegativity is what OreGairu Zoku breathes and lives. It is not more Yukino and Yui, but less of them. It is not direct conflict handling, but indirect. It is not honesty that is valued, but dishonesty. The writing of the anime itself is often misleading, with nobody ever outright saying what needs to be said or what exactly is going on, choosing convolution over clarity. Indeed, much of this essay uses negative language \u2013 \u201cdisjointed,\u201d \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d \u201cfailed,\u201d and so on \u2013 because the narrative has to inherently be described as such, demonstrating the pervasiveness and therefore the strength of its motif.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is constantly mired in this theme of negativity, and subsequently the drama that ensues gains more weight because everything is wrong at every turn. Nothing ever seems to work as intended, and even when it does, there is still the larger, looming conflict between the main cast that solidifies the negativity\u2019s foothold throughout the season. It is this theme that leads to the show\u2019s whole point of finding the \u201creal thing\u201d: long-lasting relationships.\\n\\n\r\nDiscovering the \u201creal thing\u201d is not easy because negativity covers it, wraps it, and pushes it to an unreachable area. Fights ensue, feelings are hurt, and friendships are tested as the negativity is waded through. But it is this insane amount of negativity that accentuates those positive moments that much more. Picking out presents with others, having a close friend heal a wound, and making chocolate with a bunch of people are so much more rewarding for Hachiman and the others because the relationships they share, despite all of the negativity being thrown their way throughout the season, stand strong. The adversity does not ruin them. Rather, camaraderie and understanding are achieved, leading ultimately to the connections that they always wanted to have.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while the negative connotations of who, what, where, when, and why threaten relationships, it is the second half of the dichotomy that makes them worth fighting for.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOreGairu Zoku\u2019s spree of negativity persists in its visual presentation. Low lighting is used to paint individual scenes in a somber tone. Coloring likewise is lowered, in the sense that dull hues \u2013 browns, blacks, and greys \u2013 make up most of the art, washing the audience in darker feelings. The backgrounds, while lacking gross variety (arguably another form of negativity), are often crisp, detailed, and simple. This is especially noticeable when compared to the first season; rather than a cartoony style, OreGairu Zoku adopts this more realistic one, foregoing fun in favor of finesse. Collectively, the visuals ooze negativity, following the anime\u2019s overall theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs and actual animation also see an elevated amount of attention. First, Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui each have designs that reflect their personalities. Hachiman\u2019s posture and fish-like eyes match his loner attitude. Yukino\u2019s long, black hair and crystal-blue eyes make her as calm, cool, and collected as possible. As for Yui, her bun and large breasts coincide with her bubbliness. Second, actual animation is quite nuanced, showcasing deft hand, eye, and body movements that capture the characters reactions and improve the already realistic representation.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe series is called \u201cMy Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU,\u201d with the sequel adding on the word \u201ctoo\u201d at the end. Not \u201ctwo\u201d number-wise, but \u201ctoo\u201d meaning also. Because the anime is not about Hachiman\u2019s snafu but rather the snafus of the other characters, and therefore the relationships involved. However, and weirdly, OreGairu Zoku has a peculiarity when it comes to its characters. In essence, each member of the cast is, with the exception of Hachiman, considerably weak but is used in unison to further expound on its theme of negativity and the \u201creal thing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTwo elements of the anime cause said weakness of the characters: the direction of the show and the general antipathy towards putting its characters outside of their singular roles. First, as a byproduct of OreGairu Zoku\u2019s narrative structure \u2013 where the focus shifts away from Yukino and Yui and to the rest of the cast \u2013 a lot of the development for the main girls is lost or at the minimum hastily strewn together. The beginning pushes Hachiman and the girls apart and the middle sections do little with them. It is not until the end where shells start to crack, but by that point it is \u201ctoo little, too late,\u201d leaving next to no room to witness the effects of the changes hinted at. Again, the exception is Hachiman who does gain a new perspective after his memorable breakdown, which caused him to, however slightly, become more empathetic towards others and their feelings. This is visible in his dealings with his sister, Iroha, and Yukino, each of who have relational problems with Hachiman that are taken care of as his person slowly changes. Second, practically each member of the cast is forced into one role. Komachi is her brother\u2019s rock, the person who will always understand him. Shizuka is the nice teacher who keeps her students following the right path. Iroha is the girl meant to represent the \u201cbad end\u201d for Yukino and Yui. The worst offender is Haruna, Yukino\u2019s older sister, who acts as nothing more than an instigator. In other words, the majority of the characters are convenient devices that push the plot where it needs to go rather than people with development or growth of their own. Hachiman is, once again, exempt from this type of treatment because his role changes based on the events taking place. Where the rest of the cast is set in stone, he adapts into the aggravator, the thinker, or the motivator depending on the conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe original statement sounds conflicting on its own. After all, how can characters who are subpar on an individual basis produce a meaningful message? Interestingly, the majority of the cast is not supposed to be looked at individually but rather in comparison to Hachiman. Consider a few characters and their characterizations. Yukino on the outside is intelligent and independent, but on the inside she is scarily reliant on other people. Yui on the outside is the nicest person on the planet, but on the inside she is strangely selfish. Iroha on the outside is beyond cute, but on the inside she is manipulative and sinister. In short, the cast have positive and negative halves. They are two-faced, masking their true, negative selves with a positive exterior that hides who they really are. The only person who is notlike this is Hachiman. Hachiman is not two-faced, he does not put up a mask; he simply acts and behaves normally, refusing to conform to a set \u201cstandard.\u201d Thus, he appears strange, but that is only because everyone else around him blends together since they hide their true selves. So, though unintuitive, he is the single positive shield guarding against a negative onslaught.\\n\\n\r\nEven more profound is how this negativity, like the story, reveals the \u201creal thing\u201d that are stalwart relationships. For OreGairu Zoku, the relationships it has are not only its strongest facet but also reinforce its themes. The best relationship in the anime is one that is rarely shown: Hachiman and Komachi\u2019s. There are around seven small scenes in total showcasing the brother and sister, but it perfectly captures two siblings\u2019 connection with their joking, teasing, and worrying. Another is between Hachiman and Yui, where Yui\u2019s overt kindness does not affect him as much as everyone else. Haruna, despite being one of the weakest characters in the show, has an interesting relationship with Hachiman, where he acts as a proxy for Yukinoshita. But no matter the relationship, the common thread between each is Hachiman. He is that pillar of positivity that everyone flocks to because he is exactly what they need. Thus, his relationships prove how, when negativity is beaten, when that sword is dodged, blocked, and defeated, said relationships blossom and strengthen. They are more steadfast because the brunt from the hilt is over, and what is left are relationships that have nothing left to fear.\\n\\n\r\nThey are, simply put, the \u201creal thing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is pretty powerful, due to the noticeable guitar chords, the strong vocalist, and quick beats with contrarily slow lyrics. Just for good measure, the piece also blends positivity and negativity, with it sounding both hopeful and melancholic simultaneously, and therefore fitting the motif of the anime nicely. The ending theme is not as powerful, but its oddly positive vibes and multiple vocalists continue with the notions of negativity and relationships, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack, however, is lacking, with many of the pieces working as intended without being memorable in execution. The best track offered is an acoustic guitar arrangement for the content times, but otherwise they are not much more than nice background filler.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is not filler, but instead superb. Takuya Eguchi as Hachiman provides a wonderfully cynical voice, Saori Hayami as Yukino nails the cool beauty speaking, and Nao Touyama as Yui provides the happiness in waves, with much of the cast giving similarly well-done performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI am not sure how many people know it, but I am not a fan of this series, and my views on the first season are evidence for that. It was too comedic for its own good, the narrative subplot between the main cast was poorly fleshed out, and too much attention was given to Hachiman. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season, to put it lightly, thoroughly impressed me. The comedy is there, but appropriately timed, the subplot with the dog and the car is gone, and Hachiman is no longer the only object given attention. The anime also relied less on Yukino\u2019s cat infatuation and Yui\u2019s breasts, favoring instead the relationships they shared with Hachiman. The kitties and the boobs are still present (and Iroha more or less becomes the comedian to replace the other two), but its prioritization of the serious over the goofy was a welcome sight.\\n\\n\r\nAlso welcoming was the return of Yukino\u2019s insulting but playful banter with Hachiman, Iroha\u2019s rejection skit that always made me chuckle, and Komachi being, well, Komachi. I am not a huge fan of Hachiman\u2019s more philosophical musings but when his inner talks were used for quips and \u201cthe voice of reason,\u201d I was often smiling then as well. But more than all of this is how valuable its theme is. I am someone who cherishes the relationships with the people I know; I want to be friends with everyone I meet. So watching this show give as much importance as I do to such connections was the biggest surprise of them all.\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku is an anti-romance anime that pushes the \u201canti\u201d portion to the brink. The narrative is strong, the characters thematic, and the visuals stunning. While there are minor flaws with parts of the cast and soundtrack, it is still easy to say that this one did, in fact, find the \u201creal thing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, very strong theme of negativity leads to heavy drama and the \u201creal thing\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, negativity persists in the art style alongside fitting character designs and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, weak characters thoroughly support Hachiman, with everyone expounding on negativity and the \u201creal thing\u201d even further\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, OP and ED continue the negative, positive, and relationship themes, with an average soundtrack and above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, impressive leap in quality compared to the first season, with some fun characters, interesting relationships, and a relatable theme to boot\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

Each episode show us their interaction with each other in their club. A lot of people come to theirclub to ask for help, ranging from simple to complicated things, and in the end, most of the problems is solved by the trio (Yui, Yukinon, and Hachiman). But after Hikigaya sacrificing himself so many times, the club faces a lot of conflict. Yui and Yukinon's heart, including Hikigaya's breaking a bit by bit.\\n\r\nYui and Yukinon didn't like the way Hikigaya solves problems, and their ideology is different. The climax is at episode _SPOILER_SPOILER_ 8, where Hikigaya crying in front of Yui and Yukinon, and in the end he ask them to help with the problems he face. Even though they come across a lot of problems, they always learn, sometimes, you cannot solves something by yourselves. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9.8/10\\n\r\nDespite the Studio change from season 1's brains base to feel animation studio, the animation quality is improving a lot, (for me) , but i gave the art 9.8 because at some episode, the running scene feel a bit weird lol. Everything else is good though.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI totally love the OP > Harumodoki sung by Yanagi Nagi , and the Ending > Everyday world which is sung by the 2 main character (Yuigahama Yui = Nao Touyama) and (Yukinoshita Yukino = Hayami Saori). all of the voice actress also did a great job voicing each of them, when they are happy, when they are sad, or when they are angry, all of the expression seem to fit with the voice they make. And for the BGM, it is good, but nothing else i can say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nAll of them have unique characteristic.\\n\r\nEven though oregairu's cast a lot of people, they do get a nice character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nIf i can gave the enjoyment's score more than 10, i will definitely do it ahaha. I did enjoy this anime a lot, and by the end of this season, i'm hoping for more Oregairu, an OVA, a Movie, or maybe a Season 3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if i sum up all the score up until enjoyment part, i gave this anime 9.8/10 and i round it up to the 10.\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, and if you who read this review like an anime with\\n\r\nSchool, Comedy, and a bit romance, this anime is for you.",

            "content": "Favorite Quote: \"It's not empty words I'm after. There was something else I desired all along. Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship, or anything of the sort. I don't care about being understood. I simply wish to understand. Understand, know, and rest easy in that knowledge, gain some peace of mind. Because not understanding terrifies me. Saying I want to understand everything is extremely self righteous. It's a dictatorial and conceited wish. It's shameless and repulsive. And I'm absolutely disgusted at myself for wanting that. But if we feel the same way, if a relationship exists where we can force that ugly self consciousness upon eachother and accept it, I know there's no way that can happen. I realize that's completely out of reach. But still I want something genuine.\" -Hachiman Hikigaya\\n\\n\r\nThis is a long quote I'm sorry about that. As somebody who experienced some of Hachiman's troubles throughout school, this is by far my favorite quote from my all time favorite romcom character. But honestly, it had me in tears. There is so much truth to his speech it's almost scary.  In my opinion, what he means is friendships, relationships, and interactions simply out kindness, guilt, or mutual understanding is fake, something that individuals wouldn't initially do if there wasn't some external factor involved. It has to be something that is real, something we always wanted not by maintaining an image, a status quo, or from guilt of any sort.  Furthermore, this also gets me thinking about if these relationships between people can truly exist and if Hachiman's way of thinking is without a doubt negative, but scares and pisses everyone of because it's so true to many certain extents.   Sorry that was just a few things I thought about after finishing this series. So now let's get into the review without any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story in the Yahari Ore no Seishun Zoku is almost identical with the first season. Not much has changed at all. The writing and the plot are relatively similar. The Service Club still regularly does it's duty by completing other people's requests. However, the only big difference in this is that the plot becomes alot more complex and thought provoking as the series progressed. The writing is done extremely well allowing audiences to be engaged. It never bored me throughout the series. Also, it contributed to the plot by making it very realistic.  It also becomes clear that the romance becomes alot more evident as the series progresses.  \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: There were a few differences in the art. There were obvious minor changes to the character designs of Yukino and Hachiman. Nevertheless, this didn't distract me from enjoying the series. The colors were also still done fantastically.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending themes were still top notch. Although the opening changed significantly, it still captured the overall mood of the new season.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in the second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun continued to intrigue me. I mentioned before in my first review that the main character was what set it apart from allot of romantic comedies, but the other characters contributed significantly. Our main character is still very much the same except he begins to open up more than usual. Towards the ending especially. The character development of numerous characters made it very appealing. This is especially true for Yukino whom we see begins to soften up significantly when she is around our main character. In fact, the contribution of new characters also made it feel like a harem, but a completely different kind in its regard.  The biggest difference between the \"harem\" in this season is that the girls, our main character interacts with eventually develop a crush towards him, not immediately like other harem shows do. The second season also brought many other character's life perspectives and love interests to the plot and it was done in such a way that it wasn't overwhelming. It flowed nicely with the story. This second season we also get to see the teacher's point of view as well which is great. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion: The return of Batman, the silent protector. I was extremely excited to continue this series. The second season had a more serious sort of feel to it compared to the first season which was something I appreciated. We see a bit more romance in this season and more complex situations. Overall, it is still thought provoking like the first season. At the end of the series it had me wondering who the main character was going to fall for, what is a genuine friendship, bond, interaction, or relationship? The second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun definitely ranks in my top five best anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. Sorry I felt I went too in depth with some of the philosophies that our main character spoke about or was curious about. I hope you guys find the second season as entertaining and thought provoking too! Also, if you guys ask me on my profile I could provide you guys with two reddit links that analyzes the romance throughout the series; I'm always open to discussion about this anime.  Once again thank you for reading and hope to see you guys on my next review!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10 extremely well done masterpiece",

            "content": "[This review accounts for both seasons of Oregairu]\r\nAs much as I'd like to give the prior season a higher rating, I just can't bring myself to do so for a number of reasons. First of all, the first season felt like it lacked exuberance in a multitude of different ways. A large majority of the characters seemed uninteresting, the animation felt languid in some places and even the dialogues of all things didn't feel all that special. While I do think the interactions between the main trio of characters had their share of redeeming qualities, namely the pseudo-intellectual prattle between our main protagonist, Hachiman andthe lass with a stark sense of noblesse oblige, Yukino, the rest of the dialogues, especially between the members of the supporting cast felt somewhat pointless and inane.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the situations in which our main trio are placed aren't really all that interesting to begin with. While some of them are worth noting, such as the looming onset of the cultural festival towards the end of the first season where our lovable dolts are coaxed into partaking in a series of discussions to unanimously decide on a list of festivities that would be brought to the attention of the student council, helmed by the notorious ice queen herself, others are far from having any semblance of actual significance as a fair chunk of them can be rather silly and asinine. On top of that, the show's inherent surplus of fanservice can be quite obnoxious as well. I loathe how almost every character with the sole exception of Hachiman is downplayed as vacuous and generic cutouts of their respective archetypes. You'd be hard-pressed to find a romcom MC as distinct and invigorating as Hachiman nowadays given how just about any light novel the industry manages to get its normie-infested hands on has the possibility to be greenlit for an anime adaptation. While this is certainly commendable in more ways than one, it also comes with its share of drawbacks.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, without batting an eye, I merrily continued my viewing of the series and moved on to its second season, expecting the same sort of hijinks to ensue. What I got in kind was something beyond my wildest expectations; a full-fledged character drama with plenty of characterisation to boot. The characters in this season felt more down-to-earth and fleshed out considering the development they received throughout the course of the previous season. What really appealed to me this time around, however, was the more solemn approach the show decided to take. The palpable absence of crude humour was a rejuvenating touch as the supporting cast was relegated to the background of the show's premise(and for good measure too). Besides that, the animation took a turn for the better as well, which came as a pleasant surprise as the studio behind the visuals this time around wasn't the same as before.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the visuals, I discerned that the sound design in this season had a certain distinctiveness to it, especially in the voice acting department. The VAs of Hachiman and the girls respectively put up a fairly visceral display of voice acting. As I mentioned hitherto, I abhorred how the characters in the season prior to this one were all stencils of already established archetypes of modern-day high school students. While that hot take holds true to some extent, my issues with their contemptible depictions were wholly disregarded this time around. As much as I would've liked to make a complete mockery of the aforementioned character archetypes in a show like this, I don't think that would've been feasible in any way considering the unquantifiable enjoyment I got out of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, this marks the end of my review of the show as a whole. It certainly had a bunch of things that kept me from enjoying it in its entirety, but, nevertheless, it was a worthwhile experience, with its plus points greatly outweighing the pitfalls that riddle it.",

            "content": "To anyone wondering why someone is writing a review for what is a 3 year old anime,\r\nAt this moment, Oregairu (or Yahari ore no seishun love comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku for the higher beings out there) is the anime that I love the most. And it has gone to an extent that it actually changed the way I look at people, as well as the way I watch anime. As of now, the only anime that I have watched in the 2 years after I watched Oregairu in 2016 was that shogi anime that I just started this week, and I am on episode 2of that anime. This series won't even let me watch other anime, it's that good to me. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I know that most people who walk around the reviews for this anime will find one thing in common with all the reviews, and that is that this is a very niche anime, only for the ones who have had social problems throughout their lives, and those who are perfectly happy with a large circle of friends will probably not enjoy this. And that is true, to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu, to me personally, is for people who are alone or with few people surrounding them, true. But at the same time, I know people(who I have a strong distaste for) who are the exact opposite of lonely and /or alone, but still enjoyed the experience. I am someone who would rather shy away from most human interaction and social gatherings rather than be given 500 dollars to attend. However, as the surprisingly forgotten yet common saying goes, this is just me. \\n\\n\r\nI am still in high school, and is someone who has no one I can call a friend, but I don't wish I was kidding. I find a lot in not being with people, and I prefer watching them as they go around their broken friend groups and laughing about the most useless of things(one group in particular laughs at me for no reason). I hate most people that I meet, and I never want to meet them ever again. If I need to talk, make it short. If people are coming to talk to me, then put in my earphones,and walk away. Ignore everything that people say, especially the numeral laughs that are against me. All of the memories that I have from school so far have been negative, from getting rejected, then someone exaggerating the story to being me harassing the girl in question, to people thinking that I was a creep because I wouldn't talk at all. Generally, I want school to end as soon as possible, or I just get forgotten by everyone in the school, and I go to a peaceful school life. \\n\\n\r\nAnd even though this sort of contradicts my previous paragraphs, I find it quite sad that I find it pitiful that I relate with Hachiman on a very personal level. I agree with most things that he says, and I find his attitude towards social relationships to be very true. But I did say 'most' and not 'all'. To me, his genuine speech is unrealistic, and almost stupid, because someone can dream of genuine, but it's never going to happen. And I think that sooner or later, if his group with Yukino(best girl) and Yui were real, it would break up by around the second year of college. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that perfectly segways into the characters, because I don't wanna spoil the story for you. All I will say is that it is less comedic than the first season, more drama heavy, and a bit more slow. But that should be expected from an anime adapted from a light novel, especially with Zoku starting around maybe the 7th volume out of what is currently 12 volumes. But the story still holds up, and to me, the pacing is just right. Just the ending is a cliffhanger, so for those who hate those, keep it in mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, to the characters. Most people have said that Hachiman is sort of make or break for viewers, as in the viewer's opinion of the show as a whole completely depends on how they view Hachiman, and I agree. Hachiman will be the reason why you either love this anime, or hate it. As I have stated, his very different views on social things and his cynical outlook on life will make some love and relate to him, or leave others scratching their heads as to why he is so bitter. Of course, as someone who relates to him, I love his character, and the way he grows in the anime from hating almost literally everyone who isn't his sister, to growing to care for others and himself especially. The whole reason why I loved Hachiman's character is because of how much his character was against the norm of anime and society, and I'm just as happy that the way that he changed wasn't just the normal \"Oh fuck, someone is slightly upset at me.\", but the anime made it seem like he was feeling the pressure, and that he genuine(HA)ly felt that he needed change. \\n\\n\r\nYukino, my waifu. Is there more that needs to be said? Well yes. Her character was much more fleshed out than in season 1, and I appreciate that, and the story seemed to lean towards the Yukino route as well. Yukino felt much more human, and  although she is the \"ice queen\", I liked that that was the direction taken for her character, and i don't really understand why people were so up in arms about it. It does break her character, but at the same time, when pressure is on someone, their persona starts to change, which is the case for Yukino, although some of it could be explained by her affection for Hachiman growing. Yukino was the character that I genuinely fell in love with. Then I remembered that I was in the 3D world and not in the 2D world, and felt slightly more than depressed than normal. In all seriousness, I fucking loved Yukino's character, and that's about all that I can say.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Zoku, all three main characters seem to be cracking under the pressure of their friend group and the service club in general. Not that they're all going insane, but just small things that make them feel like each of them need to do something. Yui is similar, considering that she is meant to be the glue that holds the service club together. Even Yui is cracking under the pressure that, if Yukino really does like Hachiman, there won't be a chance in hell that Yui will win the 8bowl. And, of course, this realisation gets to her head, and so she starts to be more confrontational with him, and is somehow more confrontational than the first season's almost confession. Even then, I feel like Yui's character was the least likeable out of the three. That doesn't mean that she is the worst or the least likeable in the series, my most hated character would go to Hayato. But out of the service club, I found Yui to be the least relatable. She is a great character, and I know why she exists in this group, and at least it's done well, unlike some other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another thing that people seem to be very hit or miss , especially with the change in studio. I thought that the art style was good for season 1, but season 2 was even better in my opinion. It's more detailed, which fits with how the season has to go into more detail(HA) about the characters, as the whole series is going into the climax. The soundtrack to me was amazing, Harumodoki(the OP) is one of my favourite openings of all the anime that I watched, and while Everyday World(the ED) is not as good, it still holds pretty good ground. Most if not all of the OST consists of piano, which is already a plus point, but the songs in the track are also amazing and fit the more serious tone of the season well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I fucking loved Oregairu Zoku. It was the kind of slice of life that felt like an actual slice of life, and not just harem simulator *insert year here*. It was realistic, with a small bit of cynicism that made all of the characters amazing, and relatable. The OST is one that I listen to literally everyday, and generally, it was amazing all round.",

            "content": "This anime, on the surface, seemingly gets right everything that its predecessor got wrong. The animation, once somewhat crude and simple, is now beautiful and seamless. The backgrounds, once uninspired, are now works of art themselves. Yet, within this transformation, the creators/directors lost what made this series (the light novel and the first adaptation) originally so riveting and masterful. \r\nThe centerpiece of the franchise, unquestionably, is its main character Hikigaya Hachiman. His indomitable introversion, his fierce pessimism, his wry humor, his witty sarcasm, and, perhaps most importantly, his awkward attempt at reconciling his wishes/desires with the world around him, make him the incredible character thathe is. Yet, these are the qualities that he seemed to have lost in this second series.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman\u2019s pessimistic monologues and somewhat vengeful critiques were replaced by quiet reticence. His once astute and cynical invectives were replaced by insipid observations. The moments where he would once be awkwardly flustered, he would now be expertly calm and cool. \\n\\n\r\nThis second season seems like a fatal misinterpretation of Hachiman\u2019s character and what made him so likable in the first place. It is true that he tries to embody the very definition of lazy. Nonetheless, he never really lacked in energy or spirit. Somewhat paradoxically, you could say he was in fact invigorated with the \u201cspirit of laziness.\u201d However, in this second season, he just acts and talks as if he is actually listless, tired, and uninterested. In short, the directors transformed Hachiman from a once thoughtful, pessimistic, and awkward character into someone who seems like he is \u201ctoo cool for school.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOregairu is one of my favorite series. The light novel is riveting, as is the first season of the anime. But in an attempt to beautify the art and the main character himself, this second season perhaps robbed him of what made him so wonderful in the first place: his personality. \\n",

But boy was I wrong, and I am glad I was. The first season had some drama in it and gave the characters some development, but in this season shit really hit the fan, allowing the anime to develop the characters a lot more and showing the depth of the characters. \r\nThis series follows Hikki's path to establish something genuine with Yukino and Yui. It is quite the treat to see how Hikki develops from an cynicalintrovert into a lovable person capable of compassion and love. Hikki puts on a facade and tries to act as if he doesn't care. But we know that is not true due to the thoughts he has. He clearly wants to have real friendship but his awkwardness and pride leaves him unable to convey his desires. He claims his indifference of other people's thoughts, yet it clearly has an impact on him. He yearns for a change in his life, yet he perpetuates the same old same old, afraid of what could happen. He acts like he doesn't care for other people, yet he goes out of his way and damages his own reputation for the sake of helping others. To put it simply, Hikki is not honest with himself. From years of being alone, he has set up walls to his true personality, which is capable of loving others, helping others, and making others laugh. In this series, his hard shell will begin to crack when he realizes what he truly wants.",

As a viewer, I see first that the character is good before I continue the series. But in this anime, I like every single character from minor to major roles. The anime is very refreshing and entertaining. This is the first time that I enjoyed watching anime that most of the episode the character always talk, though it made sense whatthey were talking about... Overall, I give it a 9. Why not 10? because I feel like that this anime can do more. I'm barely satisfied in the story, because I am expecting something that didn't appear in the anime. Overall, a great anime and highly recommended not only for anime lovers, but for everyone.",

            "content": "I feel like the best way to think about this show, at least for me, is in terms of Nic Pizzolatto's responses to critics regarding True Detective. (For those of you who don't know, Nic Pizzolatto is essentially the sole writer for the HBO show True Detective which has received mostly acclaim, but some very harsh criticism as well) Essentially Mr. Pizzolattto has responded to criticism by say something along the lines of \"I didn't write this to please anyone.\" This isn't about fan service, so to speak. \r\nObjectively speaking I don't think I can say whether My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU Too! is comparablewith the top 50 ranked anime series; that being said this was a 10, subjectively speaking. The ability to appreciate this animation hinges on a couple of things, you need to have watched and, to some degree or another, enjoyed the first season. Appreciating the humor in Hachiman, but also the very real nature of his self-defenses is paramount if you are going to develop empathy for him. Is empathy necessary to get the most out of this show, probably not, but it sure helps. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not a simple show. In the sense of the first season being much more intelligent than average comedy, but still mostly a comedy, perhaps there was some sense of simplicity. By the second second season, the bar had been raised in terms of the degrees of complexity of the social dynamics and the number of different ways to understand any given situation. \\n\\n\r\n I'm Not Actually Going To Spoil Anything, but some people may consider some of what comes next to be a spoiler despite my not actually spoiling anything.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\\n\r\nThe way the creators chose to end the series, was probably one of the least popular ways they could've decided upon. A person who wants more given to them and doesn't want to work for anything, in terms of understanding media, will likely be disappointed at the end. That being said given the nature of the show I would expected no more than I received in terms of closure, and I could easily have seen there being even less closure. Generally speaking we can count our blessings as it pertains to having some sense of closure at all.\\n\\n\r\nPeople like easy. My Teenage Romantic Comedy SNAFU Too! was everything but easy. Sure it's still ranked in the top 150, but it could drop. This is a masterpiece, more complex than many classical pieces of literature. The understanding of human interpersonal behavioral dynamics required to write this is profound; the writer/s could have a career of significant achievement in the field of social psychology, I'm sure. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this show was very meaningful to me, it wasn't fan service and it wasn't easy. I wouldn't change that. This being said many will watch and miss things or simply be unable to understand; when that happens poor reviews will be given and ratings will drop. The show will sink into the abyss and no one will watch it anymore, except for those of us that appreciated it the first time. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Delicate friendships grow gradually overtime when you first meet people who you may or may not get along. That is the case for the characters that inhabit Oregairu, or SNAFU. Disfunctional and down-to-earth to their inner characterization, it\u2019s an anime that is about as slice of life as one can get. With its surprising debut exceeding expectations for many people, me included, it was evident that we needed to see what was next in our journey through difficult, awkward friendships. I don\u2019t think anyone was expecting something this compelling for a sequel.\r\nI never expected much from Oregairu when I first came across it last year.My thoughts of it have been on the spectrum of the positive side on the critic scale. It was a nice refreshing take on the slice of life genre that explores many themes based on social interaction and alienation. They involved quasi-philosophical narrations by our unlikable hero, named Hachiman or his numerous other nicknames, and brought us deeper into the psyche of the loner that we might have became at some point of our young lives. With its sequel under the belt, it still has those same qualities we liked before but adds unprecedented development to our main characters that will make them unforgettable from here on out.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is driven based on character development since this is a \u201ccharacter story,\u201d meaning a story that focuses on how the characters grow in the story. So it would be logical to go through each character one by one and show how the writing improves from the previous season to this one. And by each character, I mean our three main protagonists, since they are the most important out of the rest, which will get their own critique.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be wise to start out with the new cultural phenomenon in the anime world in recent memory, Hachiman. It perplexed me how this character started to struck a chord for many people during the first season. Now that the 2nd season has happened, I can figure out why. Hachiman has become the new Shinji to this current generation of anime fans, although I would say Hachiman as more in common with another infamous outcast character before Shinji, Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye. Both are despicable in how they interact with people and how they interpret life in their own selfish line of thinking. This comparison is by no means a negative, in fact its a positive as I can push myself to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s great to see characters that fit into the description of being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201cegocentric\u201d when they are written well. By written well, I mean that they do have some characteristics to their selfishness that you find sympathetic to him. It makes the character strong and likable in this regard. Hachiman is no different from this description of a character driven into his or her own ego. This season is where we finally get to see his gradual growth come in full circle and is handled with delicate care and emotional resonance. I won\u2019t give away the specifics of what happens because it is one of those moments that has to be experienced in order to grasp it fully that words can\u2019t describe.\\n\\n\r\nOur two heroines, named Yukino Yukinoshita and Yui Yuigahama, have similar attributes to our main hero, although Yui is less so than Yukino. Yukino has a more dignified personality than Hachiman when dealing with other characters and situations that arise in her life and school. Yui is the most cheerful out of the bunch and cares deeply for people close to her. All three of these characters share a nice bond that continues to fuel up the charming chemistry they possess. Just like Hachiman\u2019s development, Yui and Yukino have the same amount of growth that continues on to season 2 that helps make them more three-dimensional than when you were first introduced to them. That ensures you\u2019re doing a great job in making these characters memorable after you\u2019re done watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is the new addition to the cast, named Iroha Isshiki. I did enjoy her introduction to the series, however I wasn\u2019t as engaged in her development as I did with our other main characters. Not bad in any way, just wasn\u2019t as up to snuff with the other characters. The supporting cast has the distinction of being just there to help develop our main characters with nothing special to add to their roles.\\n\\n\r\nMany complain about all of the characters being boring and bland than your typical slice of life anime. My response to this argument is by simply defending the \u201cdullness\u201d of the cast based on context to the show\u2019s atmosphere. It isn\u2019t your typical high energy slice of life anime that we are predisposed to getting used to over the years. Their aspects all amount to them just being dull human beings because the direction gives off a realistic view of social life between young adults maturing through the tough times of being a high school student in Japan. Not that this approach can\u2019t always be good, but with Oregairu it actually adds depth to the story in creating a naturalistic tone to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne noticeable change right off the bat is the art design of the characters. This I\u2019m really on the fence on whether I like this or not. While I do think the art itself is good, I still think the 1st season\u2019s art work was better in how colorful  the characters were and were not saturated with a bright white tone to their designs. Almost similar to To Love Ru Darkness\u2019s new art style change, except that was an actual improvement. Not a bad art style, just not the greatest decision for the studio\u2019s part to put into fruition.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll leave off this by saying, Hachiman is not the only thing that makes this series great. Many will just remember the series for his presence, which is not just what makes this series enticing. This sequel is just the icing of the cake that puts the series at one of the greats in the hierarchy of slice of life anime. Though it may borderline on melodrama, it isn\u2019t always forceful to the point where it seems fake. It\u2019s not the perfect portrait of high school life, but then again, nothing else will be.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

Where\u2019s the ROMANCE?! \r\n    Half the season was just air time wasted on the Student Council meeting that should have only taken two episodes to resolve. The other half was wasted on pointless fighting between characters that was never explained. While there were some thought provoking ideas nothing was actually accomplished in this season. It was just a mass of confused depression!The difference between seasons is like night and day, while season one was light and cheerful with lots of comedy and romantic suggestions season two was depressing and lacked humor and romance alike. \\n\\n\r\n    There was such a major lack of information during this series that I have to question whether the creators were even paying attention to what they were doing. \\n\\n\r\n    The OP and ED didn\u2019t match the mood of the series at all, nothing about this season was cheerful and lively. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe season wasn\u2019t all bad, it had a few redeeming factors, but only a few. The animation and artwork in this season was much more appealing and I much preferred the design of the characters, Hiki didn\u2019t seem like a \u201crotten fish eyed freak\u201d. I feel like they really tried to utilize the more profound serious nature of the series and I give them points for that but this is a RomCom and they utterly failed. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe level of enjoyment for this season was roughly 1/5 of the first season. Honestly I felt more depressed and annoyed than happy, which is the whole point of RomComs. If you\u2019re thinking about watching this season after finishing the first, I would suggest you don\u2019t especially if you feel happy and excited about a continuation of the story. You won\u2019t miss anything I promise, no romance and really no comedy in this season, it\u2019s basically a different series. \\n",

Yeah, a lot of blah blah blah.. scenes where the characters are just sitting, doin nothing and just another high school rom-com / cliche'.. that's why they say this is one boring show.  For me, i described it as \"ONE OF A KIND\" I just happened to appreciate the unique approach on this anime.  If Baby steps attacked the sports genre with a realistic approach, no supernatural powers, just tennis and a bit of romance, SNAFU gave me some human-ecosystemon social aspect and philosophical theme. really??  like some highly acclaimed anime like evangelion, monster, psycho pass, death note, etc.. that we dig in because of their depth.  What's impressive here is they applied it on such a fragile genre which is High School rom-com. Its a Hit or a Miss move for the producer of this show.  \\n\\n\r\nThey perfectly used the main characters, Hikigaya hachiman a proud loner, he never cares if he's not cool in the eyes of others.  He's very introspective which is very critical for this show, its a character who is loaded of counter thoughts before he even get the outcome from his actions.  Some of his arguments and opinions or thoughts were not delivered in a flashy way (he narrated only) .  Yukino on the other hand is like Hiki she's a loner because she's too smart and pretty, basically misunderstood for having an intimidating personality. While Yui is the cheerful girl, she's not as articulate like the other 2 mc's, but a person who's not afraid to express her care. We got characters here facing issues with their personalities which slowly changes or not? as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nMisunderstandings are common for rom-coms, so this anime dissected the thoughts of every characters, it allowed me as a viewer to see it and interpret the situations, then Hiki will surprise you with his practical, unusual and loner-way of problem solving.  Its not a perfect rom-com you may criticize the hiki-yukino-yui predictable love triangle outcome, the kind of service club they formed doesn't exist in real life, and its slow pacing. Its a type of anime that i can't give a perfect score but something special.",

            "content": "Oregairu is anime full of melanchony and bittersweetnes. Even if might not be meant to, it brought me a lot of feels and mostly because i could relate.\r\nThis show might seems mediocre to regular people, but for us, loners it's something we can find ourselves in. Not another show where two girls fight about one random guy, but story about lost fish that found soulmate in the eternal ocean of plain people.\r\nApart from the first season, this seems much more serious, but it didn't really reveal much, thus i rate with 8 points for story.\r\nArt was very good indeed, but this is one of theelements that first season was better at. 8 points\\n\r\nSound was great, brought nice or sad atmosphere just where it was required. Also the opening was one of the few i could not skip. 9 points.\\n\r\nCharacters were what made this anime so good. God i would have rated them at least with 12 points, but i sadly i cannot. Hachiman is loner and one young philosopher. Others are long dead to him.\\n\r\nRaised in the world where fakes are not accepted he adapted, hardened and build walls where only his little sister was allowed enter. He is genius in his own way, he knows how people behave, what do they think because everybody is so simple, yet even there are exeptions and he finds himself lost when trying to read certain girl.\\n\r\nYukinoshita is very beatiful girl, everyone admires her, yet she finds herself hated, bullied in the past just because of jealousy and her unability to fit between the fakes.\\n\r\nThere is it, the beauty and the beast, both excluded from society for many different reasons, but the one main reason remains the same - they weren't able to fit in to the society\\n\r\n10 points for totally outstanding characters (Still at least 12 in my head tho ^^)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - well not much to say about this what already haven't been said. I enjoyed this show very much, every episode kept me entertained. 10 points.\\n\r\nOverall - Characters are keeping this anime high above most of the shows i've watched, this anime deserves spot in my top anime list with it's 10 points.\\n\r\nNow there's nothing left but to wait for another season (well maybe if i get impatient i could read the VN, but i think that i'll wait for anime). \\n",

            "content": "OreGairu is pretty great season, sure. But if you wanted to dig in for more OreGairu stuff like this one, filled with a lot of funny moments and maybe a brighter tune, especially those who didn't read the LN and stick to the anime instead, well, I hate to break this up to you, but this season, everything gets serious.\r\nAs OreGairu.Zoku starts off with a melodramatic opening, you expect something like; maybe there's going to be a love chemistry is about to happen between Yui and Yukino because of what they've shown you at the Episodes 1 and 2 of the opening, and maybe Hachimanis going to decide who's, who is going to be his best girl. But it turns out, it's just a beta opening and the REAL OPENING VTR is actually on the episode 3, showing every single characters from the past recurring to this season.\\n\\n\r\n*HEAVY SPOILERS*\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but that was false advertising at the first two episodes of the opening. I was expecting more love stories like what it was depicted on the title of the anime. But I think I saw some glimpse of it, like when the whole students of Sobu High went camping on the last season, Tobe, Hayato's friend, asked who's Hayato's crush during that night before they went to sleep and after he agitated for his own purpose he finally just gave an initial \"Y\", putting another mystery who's Hayato's crush is. And there's also another glimpse when Yukino told Hachiman to save her when in doubt during their time in Destiny Land (AKA Disneyworld) and Yui was selfish on the last episode of the series, indicating that she's \"selfish\" and wants to get everything around her in the club. Which, of course led to a high-pitched cliffhanger when Yukino was about to said their \"Final Request\".\\n\r\n*SPOILERS END*\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really wasn't expecting that they've thrown more of it's comedy content to make it more melodramatic and emotional. And to make it more special, they've also added some love story hints in this newer season of OreGairu than the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it more off, this season just really depicts more on sociology than the last season. It talks more on how superficially the clique of Hayato has, how one simple confession will turn something worst for their group, and how Hachiman's sacrifices himself will come to an end. This whole series is pretty great when it comes to using the character development method, making it more useful to the whole storyline and make it more sensual to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for some great slice-of-life anime just go watch first the first season of OreGairu, then go for this one. You can skip the OreGairu OVA if you want, as it's just a very simplistic filler for the first season.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my review, I'd say, just go for it if you're interested to some deep Slice-of-life anime that talks more about the consciousness of the society and matter of friendship and trust. Some reviewers says that this anime depicts how it is in real life, but I'll leave that one as plausible.",

            "content": "I think some viewers have the wrong impression about Yahari. Or at least a misunderstanding.\r\nSome liked the first season for its presentation of Hachiman's ideology, his cynical outlook on life, while others liked the two girls, Yukinoshita Yukino's, and Yuigahama Yui's, character and personality. Some watched because they expected an actual romcom without reading the description.\r\nBut I think Yahari runs a lot deeper than most would look at it to be, and this becomes more apparent after having re-watched both seasons and read some of the light novel which the anime is adapted off. Technically I should be reviewing the light novel but for convenience'ssake we'll put that aside. I'll have the presumption that you've already watched the first season in this review.\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun LoveCome wa Machigatteiru. Zoku is the sequel to the first season of the same name minus 'Zoku'. (I'll refer to the anime as just Yahari from here on.). It continues where the first season left off, from the cultural festival which ended in success and Hachiman being hated by the students for reducing Sagami, the festival committee's head, to tears. Early in Zoku the Service Club once again encounter a new request by Tobe to help with his relationship with Ebina, the BL/yaoi fangirl. This arc I found more interesting to watch on the second time around, especially on Hachiman becoming hypocritical on his ideology. The anime progresses on the relationship and nature of the Service Club, how it starts influencing the others in Hachiman's class, and then Hachiman having to 'correct' or adjust his way of thinking. The side characters, who showed their faces now and then in the first season, become more important in Zoku, especially Haruno, Hayato and perhaps Komachi earlier on.\\n\\n\r\nI would naturally recommend Zoku to those who watched the first season a few years back, and would encourage others to start watching Yahari if you're looking for a refreshing school anime which doesn't have that unnecessary harem, ecchi, found in half of school anime out there. But then again, I'm assuming you've already watched Season 1.\\n\\n\r\n-------From here on are spoilers.-------\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I'd recommend you re-watch Yahari is because the original LN author, Wataru Watari's writing style is fairly cryptic and doesn't hand the plot and character to you on a silver plate. This is carried over to the anime quite well, and you'll notice what I'm talking about especially during shots of the trio during awkward situations, where you might be sitting there confused as to what she's/he's talking about. (e.g. Yukino's 'clearing up the misunderstanding' talk with Hachiman after the Cultural Festival slogan meeting) Watari might prefer that the reader (or viewer in the anime's case) figure the meaning behind it out for themselves, in which some people have written beautifully detailed analyses to try and clear up the confusion. My personal favourite (and probably the longest) would be this one: \\n\\n\r\nhttp://yaharianalysis.x10host.com/index.php\\n\\n\r\nas it goes into depth over Yahari's theme of something 'genuine'; what it means to be genuine and hence explaining why Hachiman's Love Comedy is Wrong as Expected. Give it a read if you've got the time - you wouldn't be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watched Zoku and ended up disappointed - because it started to contradict to whole premise/point of the series of Hachiman's lonership and cynicism, then I am afraid to say that you are looking at the anime in a far too idealistic light. \\n\\n\r\nIf you expected Yukino to remain the 'ice queen' beauty that she is known for, and Hachiman to present more monologues about his high school life, then this anime would go nowhere and join the rest of the niche school life anime out there. What sets Yahari apart from those is that the characters are comparatively realistic: outlooks/personalities are influenced by the actions and words of others, and characters attitudes change throughout the series (OK, maybe that one was a bit obvious...) Notice, for example, that the comedy in the anime isn't centered on Yukino's coldness, and insults to Hachiman; rather the comedy factor in the anime, as you might have guessed, isn't its key player. Pan-san and Yukino's love of cats doesn't get an arc because it doesn't need one. The characters are only human after all, and I think we shouldn't be projecting our ideal images onto each one of them, getting disappointed when they fall 'out of character'. And that 'ideal image' theme is present in the series around Yukino's relationship with her family. Could this be some form of irony to the disappointed viewer, who doesn't actually understand what goes on: forming their own conclusion and confirming it via confirmation bias?\\n\\n\r\nSure, I also like Yahari as I find Yukino to be 100% waifu material, there's no denying that among us. In fact, it makes me guilty to be seeing her in that way as that would go against the point of the series. Yui is maybe a bit meh, once you see the reason why she's attracted to Hachiman. I start seeing her interactions with Hachiman as clingy and superficial - exactly the opposite of what Hachiman desires. Iroha is technically a side character, and you'll notice the purpose of her as a character is mostly to push the plot forward, as well as re-strengthening bonds between Hachiman and Yukino in episode 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual romance, or more accurately the romantic feelings that the female characters have towards the protagonist/Hachiman is what made me like Yahari more than the typical anime. If you thought Yukino to be different from the other girls you'd probably be correct - she's the only character throughout the series who develops love for Hachiman for love's sake, rather than because Hachiman helps/saves girl --> Girl takes interest in Hachiman. (this includes characters like Saki and Ebina as well.) Every time Hachiman is presented with an opportunity to 'save' Yukino, he refuses to accept: quoting from the the last episode that 'Yukino ought to solve her own problems.' because '[she] is a strong girl.' despite the fact that Hachiman does want to help her - his interest in her is suggested since the first episode (Season 1), especially in the light novel - but he is likely subconsciously afraid that his independent and strong image of her will crumble if he does so. There is an alternate story where Hachiman does not discover the Service Club and ends up with Yui called ANOTHER but for purposes of the anime we'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\n------ RATING (of 100)------\\n\\n\r\nStory : 85\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is an adaptation of Watari's light novel, so most comments on the actual plot would be best directed to the LN review. Apart from that, I would say the animation studio has done a wonderful job in sticking to the original story, perhaps with some changes made to Iroha's arc, and has conveyed the descriptive text (as with most LNs) effectively to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 80\\n\\n\r\nArt wasn't mind blowing as perhaps Kimi no Na Wa as such, but bear in mind that it's not as if the studio had a million dollars to spend on each episode. Where it stood out, such as the color symbolism (Hachiman = green (later blue), Yukino = blue (later purple), Yui = pink), and the scene where Yukino assures Hachiman in that blue-lit tree-park thing, I found it to be quite pleasing on the eye. General animation quality is good, definitely above average and an improvement over the first season. Kind of tells us about the nature of the anime as well - isn't a comedy, but more... 'serious'.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 75\\n\\n\r\nSound, I found wasn't anything too special but to be honest the animation would be enough to compensate for it - not that the sound was poor in the first place. Voice acting, I would say is done well and carries sufficient emotion. But what I did like was the OP and ED for both seasons - if you read between the lyrics and understand that it actually makes suggestions on the plot, and the girls' personalities/attitudes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 95, if not 100\\n\\n\r\nI'd be repeating myself: this is explained in the wall of text above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 90\\n\\n\r\nThis was definitely an anime that stays in the back of my mind, and has probably affected my outlook on this world too (don't worry, it's for the better), and it was precisely because of the former that I decided to watch it again after about 18 months - something I don't do often, if ever. Those who understand the anime's ideas and themes more will generally enjoy it better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : I don't see why I shouldn't give Yahari anything below a 90. \\n\\n\r\nOf course individual taste would play a factor in the score you rate it, but Yahari is without a doubt the sort of anime that appeals to me:\\n\\n\r\n - The protagonist isn't an idiot or a naive harem MC. He has a strong personality that I can relate well to/agree with. If you hate Rito from To-Love Ru then you'll know what I'm talking about.\\n\r\n- There isn't excessive fanservice (although there were points in the first season; Komachi and her onii-chan, Hachiman walking in on the girls in episode 2 or 3, etc.) and the anime is very plot-focused, contrary to what some viewers might think.\\n\r\n- Relating to the last sentence above, the anime requires the viewer to actually think for themselves to comprehend what the characters are trying to say in the more ambiguous speech/monologues. 'Not for casuals', if I may be a little elitist - or the other hand it shows that anime as a form of communication isn't always so superficial.\\n\r\n- This sounds creepy, but I find Yukino very cute in Yahari Zoku. Even if she is nothing more than 2 dimensional lines on animation frames... It helps me to forget about the real world - where 3D women are a lot less attractive. And why I'll probably remain a proud virgin with that sort of mindset.\\n\r\n- This anime is the first I've watched has the protagonist not minding his self-deprecation, not caring whether others think highly of him or not. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that Yahari needs to get a overall ten would be big-budget animation quality; something I can't blame the studio for, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nFirst some overall comments. Once again time has passed since I watched s1, so I can't remember how different they are. Anyhow, this one I enjoyed a lot nevertheless. Aside how it tickles me a bit personally, its still a great anime.\r\n\u2726Story\r\nNot much to say than somewhat outcasts doing their club activities of helping people. This time around we get a bit more drama between the relationship of the club members and as well other relationships. Story is mostly about being pessimist or realistic about how worldworks. Whereas one side are the side of outcasts, who have their own thoughts but because of that lack of \"friends\", which somewhat makes them feel lonely. The outcasts have their own point of view. 1 is realistic and pessimist, while second is analytical and third is the cheerful who came from the \"normies\" . And the other side of story presents the societies clones where people put up facades , lies and fake feelings in other to fit in with others thus the stressful social standing of being fake. Anyhow, story moves between drama of 1 side of the people and the drama of inner circle. I find the dialogues and thoughts of main characters superb and relatable whilst having the disgust of society drones. Drama maybe didn't reach conclusion, but was given enough hints of what they tried to preserve. So hopefully next season will actually move the drama.\\n\\n\r\nAlso such type of relationships were felt throughout the anime. Very superficial and stressful, thus the stupid problems that came with such fake relationships and also the fear of changing things. Thus many wanted/attempted in order to not destroy what they had, to keep things unchanged without being true to self.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation isn't anything special. Its simple, good enough looking and fitting. That's all to say really.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Sound\\n\\n\r\nOpening and endings were mostly good, and soundtrack felt also fitting with just right amount of presence.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\\n\r\nI pretty much mentioned the idea of what the characters are in the story section, but all I can add that I understand main characters views. I myself am cynical regarding people, very pessimistic and tried as well in the past to \"fit in\", which in the end didn't end well and thus I pretty much became Hachiman.\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama is a really sweet girl, I really like her. She is someone who was with the people and untrue to self in order to fit in, but thankfully for the most part she got out of that type of \"friendship/society facade circle\".\\n\\n\r\nDrama conclusion between main characters, at least moved. But wasn't \"case closed\".\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\\n\r\nThus this anime had aspects that were understandable and relatable in my life. Also similarities I had/have with some of the characters. As well the conversations in here were really enjoyable. As well seeing how the main characters feelings slowly surfaced was also satisfying. But yeah, this is definitely anime that needs a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nDon't really have much bad to say regarding this anime. Most things that were missing would probably be solved in sequels. Seeing as where story was left off. It's intriguing anime of 2 sides. The unique outcasts who have given up on society and human relationships for the most parts and the disgusting side of society where people put up fake faces, feelings to group up/fit in with people just to keep their social standing. And similar aspects like that..\\n\\n\r\nProbably a bit messier review this time, tried retyping some of the ideas/thoughts, but can't figure a way to make more clearer them.  Slowly but surely will improve bit by bit.",

First season was spectacular but 2nd season by far is my favorite. \r\nOregairu Zoku is a bit more on the drama/romance side rather than the romcom that the first season provided but the plot is so well thought out and executed. I have many experiences in which when a romcom turns into a drama it sucks because it either is too melodramatic or the most cliche elements are used but in Oregairu, the development of the characters and theway that their perception changes is phenomenal. I love the art. The animation is subpar but the characters look fantastic. Way better than season 2. Overall, please if you want to watch a worth while anime please watch Oregairu, although it's not a tear jerker it really puts into perspective what friendship and love actually mean.\\n\r\nStory: It's nothing special but the meaning behind the story is what makes this anime different from others. The story tells of a simple \"genuine relationship\" that is so hard to accomplish. As I said before, it really puts into perspective what friendship and love really means.\\n\r\nArt: It's fantastic. I'm a sucker for this kind of art so I may be biased. The art is really slick and has that modern feel to it, the characters look really detailed and out of all the anime that I have watched I really like the character design of Oregairu the most(except maybe Kimi no Nawa).\\n\r\nCharacter: I LOVEE the characters in this anime. No one is really annoying and everyone serves a purpose to the story. Hachiman is my favorite MC because of his unique perspective on life and he always butts into situations that I would want my main MC to butt into. Yukino is also my favorite heroine. Her development throughout the story is really personal and she isn't a typical heroine where she's a full time tsundere/useless girl, she really is trying to make an effort to be part of a genuine relationship. Yui is also awesome. I can't say much about her without spoiling but she is just so realistic. She wants what she wants and notices little things here and there. \\n\r\nOverall I'm in love with this anime. It IS AWESOME. Definitely watch\\n",

            "content": "An anime going in my favorites. \r\nA really great anime to say the least. The story follows closely to the light novels, which is a great thing. The anime did leave out some/rushed through parts of the light novel, so if you enjoy this anime a lot go check out the light novel! Now into the review. \r\nStory(10/10) The anime picks right off from the first season. It shows the last few seconds of the last episode of the first season giving your a slight refresher to what had happened. Hachiman, a high school boy who is antisocial and seems to despise just about everyone.Even so he will sacrifice himself to help others. This creates conflict throughout this show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10) This is where the second season takes the cake. The three main characters develop much more in this season than the first season, especially Yukinon.  In terms of likable characters, this season we got a few new faces to add to the mix to make this season entertaining. Along with better development for the main characters people who previously disliked them now begin to like them.\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10) The characters look different! You will notice right away that the characters look different than previously. I like the new characters designs more than the previous season. When I watch a high school anime I do not have very high standards for the art compared to a Action anime such as Fate/Stay Night, therefore I find the art in this anime to be up to standards.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10) I have enjoyed this anime a lot. I had watched the first Season earlier this year and was ecstatic to find out another season was already on it's way! For those of you who felt the first seasons romance was lacking should have no fear, because it is VERY apparent in this season. Our lovable characters will change and become what we always wanted them to be.",

Basically being a loner or being depressed and being excluded from friends or whatever. That's what makes this anime amazing for those people. But people who are optimistic, happy and social, that watched this brought them down and most likely they never wanted to finish it. Some of the great things was the beautiful soundtrack and fluid animation. But mostly the character development. It was truly a beautiful anime. So for all the loners out there, this anime is for you, so you can finallybe understood.",

            "content": "This will be less of a full out review, but more so a non-spoiler list of sorts that let the watcher from season one come to understand some of the major developments with the new studio that produced this. In terms of what I would conclude in a review if I made a full one, it'd be that you should definitely watch this season of Yahari, it was to me much more memorable than the first.\r\n#1: The Com in Rom Com is no more. Although there are funny scenes still present within the season, with the new studio expect much less funny material and someof the animated tropes that are present throughout most anime. This season features several more serious, and important, although still heart throbbing and enjoyable episodes. \\n\\n\r\n#2: New animation style, and art. Studio feel removes the almost (for lack of better words) \"cartoony\" feel from season one, and introduces a much more smooth, beautiful art style that was missing from season one. It may be hard to adjust to at first, especially some of the character designs, although in due time you too will come to respect the new art direction with studio feel.\\n\\n\r\n#3: More faithful to the original source material. First of all, I MIGHT BE WRONG ON THIS! I only read the original light novel up to where season two started, making me recognize the discrepancies with season one, and the book. Straight off the bat at the start of the second season, I saw references to Hikigaya's famous \"Max Coffee\" and re acknowledging a scene pivotal to plot development, that was removed from season one. Although this may be the case, I will state again that it is not 100% the LN, and some stuff will be changed, leading us into part four.\\n\\n\r\n#4: IT CAN GET CONFUSING. This is true. It is not a matter of how smart you are to understand the story, but a reoccurring theme in season two is how ambiguous everyone is to each other when talking about sensitive subjects. You will notice that when a sensitive topic is brought about between the characters, they all become flushed and try and talk about the topic indirectly. At one point a character even says how they don't like how broken their discussions are sometimes! So with this point, I would suggest you use the made up skill I created just now, called, \"Watching Comprehension.\" Keep your eye out for those lines or important moments, remember them, and keep them in mind whenever the characters have these \"Indirect conversations.\"\\n\\n\r\n#5: PICK YOUR SUBS! I'll come out honest guys, I pirated this show. Which also means that the subs I got might not be the same as the ones you might watch. This ties well into the previous point in that it might be hard understanding what these folks are talking about with the certain subtitles. If you are watching the show and feel like something might be off with the subtitles, go test out another site, it might show what the characters have to say in a better way. And no, this does not apply to you if you can understand Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nAlright everyone, if you took the time to read all of this before you watch the show I hope you will understand what you are getting into a little bit more. I know I really enjoyed it, and I think you might too. Good luck you Otaku!",

            "content": "Season 2 starts with a great improvement in the animation, and a decrease in the quality of the story. What was supposed to be a slice of life of a club of students who helped others throught adverse life situations became a nonsense filler season.\r\nIn the season one finale, the three main characters seemed to have finally become friends, but their relation changes to the point that they don't talk. As for example, the students council election. Being the Volunteer's Club, it wouldn't make more sense they accepted the opportunity and worked together, but instead, Yukinoshita suddenly wants to do this on her own, whatcauses a divide in the group and makes Hachiman put the new character Iroha to win the elections. After that, they don't talk normally anymore, always act strange in front of each other and Yui and Yukinoshita, two main characters, and discarded.\\n\r\nThe middle of the season is full of nonsense episodes of Hachiman alone helping Iroha (who is an annoying character, by the way) in the presidency, enduring discussions and congresses that don't contribute anything to the story. In one of them, he finds his old school crush, and for some unexplained reason he still talks to her, giving her space to bully him. In one of the episodes, Hayato, a supporting character in season one, takes action and seems to avenge Hachiman by humiliating the girl in public, but that didn't change anything, as the episodes go on and she still bullied him.\\n\r\nI dropped in episode 7. The spoilers I got made the story look even worse and made me glad I quit. Yukino and Yui are back, Yukino suddenly develops a crush on Hachiman and Yui already had one since last season. The rest is basically one of those School Days games where you have to choose your favorite waifu to date, and he ends up not deciding.\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie and say I don't like this anime, because I loved it, but the story, my affection for most characters and my hopes for it were completely ruined. The only thing I liked was the beginning, when Hachiman stopped the breaking of a friends group, and Yui, who continued to be a good character and wasn't so ruined like Yukinoshita and Hachiman.\\n\r\nI seriously don't hope they make another season, just a remake, if the manga is not like this season. If it is, it should stay buried.",

            "content": "before start this review, I must say that first season was really dessapointing for me. Not bad, just not as much outstanding like people said. It was suppossed to be remarcabble, but instead was just a rom-com that actually had very little of romance and comedy on it, leaving behind nothing but an average slice of life. Probably I was expecting another thing when I started to watch it, and maybe that's why I found so hard to  completely enjoy the first season.\r\nHowever, second season gived to me a very different feeling. Now that I can look the entire picture, I can say thatfirst season was more like an introduction of the whole plot and characters, leaving the big story and characters development to second season.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nthe story and plot are really simple and generic. A group of friends with their own issues that help other students to solve their problems. Except for some chapters, the first season centered almost exclusively on this problems, and I really missed some major development from the main characters. Fortunately, second season was all what I was expecting, and you can see more emotional situations around the 3 mc and some genuine developments from them.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art of the second season was way better than the art of the first one. The design, color and contrasts improved alot, giving to the series a more serious tone. The light in the scenes was also better and there was some beautifull and detailed landscapes too. Nothing to complain about art. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was really appropiatte, specially in the emotionally charged scenes. The pieces of piano worked surprisingly well, creating a very good atmosphere around the events. Also, the opening and ending are really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nCharacters are the real strong point from this series. They are unique, different and really complex, to the point that we are still learning things about them by the end of this second season. Of course, hikigaya is the most remarcable character. His way of think and see the world is the most interesting thing about this series, even if he is wrong in many aspects. He considers himself like a secondary character, though he touches everyone around him and changes them and their lifes for good, even if some of them end up hating it.\\n\\n\r\nEjoyement\\n\r\nWhen I started to love the characters, I started to love the whole thing, so i must say i really enjoyed this series. Doesn't matter what you thinked of the first season, i recommend you to watch the second season. Though, i higly recommend you mentalize this like a slice of life anime and not like a rom-com",

            "content": "In a sense, this second season was something unlike the first. This season prioritised the romantic and dramatic parts of high school life, while also remembering that there does need to be room for some of the original content. In my opinion, that blend worked extremely well.\r\nStory: The story here follows like the first season, but this time with more of the requests being prevailent over the school events. This allows for the events to be more serious, as they deal with problems that students are having. This change allows for some major plotpoints to stand out compared to the first season. For instance, thestudent council election \"arc\" was one of the best in this series. You follow everyone's motives for running, and what drives them, while also being reminded of what the original problem was. In the beginning, it was just Isshiki being pranked, basically, and being forced to run in the election. This problem motivates others like Yukinoshita, Hayama, and even Yuigahama to start running. All their motives helped move this arc forward and to build up their characters, even going as far as to show some insecurities that the characters have. The last thing I'd like to talk about is the attention to detail in this anime. The story is driven by everything, and I mean everything. Even small talks are important to the story, which I appreciate. Things like that made this season stand out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art follows what the 1st season is, albeit with some updated visuals and smoother transistions. Colours are also still incredibly vibrant as usual.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound in this anime has always been great, and that's true for season 2. The background music fills in the rest of the pictures, and voice acting is on point. Emotions are genuine, and that shows. The voice actors all did an incredible job. Onto music now. The opening is still great, ed is also great. I think the true star though is the background music like I said earlier, though. The music varies, but the emotional scenes with the piano are what I find to capture my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This category is where the original first season shined, and where the second polished. This season is full of character. Relationships between characters build up, break down, then start again. These relationships are extremely realistic, and show the reality of how they work. Besides relationships, character in general is obviously well done. Hachiman is still about his old methods, sacrificing himself to make everything else better. This is what breaks the relationships betweem him down, creating problems for him. However, in the middle of the season, he seems to change this a bit, but not too much. The election with Isshiki was still dirty, but it ended up not hurting everyone. Transistioning into what the characters do directly, Hachiman's actions build up every character around him. His attitude of having blame go to himself eventually becomes reasoning that others use on him (i.e: your problem your solution). In the end, all the characters end up being not what they seem on the surface, and that adds a layer of reality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, Enjoyment was off the charts. Not only was I into the story and wanted to know what happened next like in other good anime, I actually watched 12 episodes of this in a day. So, you could say that I was pretty invested.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was a great 2nd season for me, wrapping things up with an end that ties up the story, and around the time of year of which I'm currently writing this review. This is something that overall was amazing for me, not just because of connections, but because it made me think. If you were debating whether to put off this season for your watch list, don't.",

            "content": "Given the overwhelming promise that season 1 of this show exhibited, I was looking forward to its continuation- but my expectations really fell flat. This is a prime example of a show that in my opinion went from hero to zero in the space of one season.\r\nThis show echoes Hyouka in a lot of aspects- I mentioned these in my review of S1, but we have similarly cynical protagonists who are also tasked to fulfil requests of some sort, their faithful female counterpart/s and hints at romantic interest in each other, beautiful art, and a propensity for using classical music as BGM. In place ofOreki (of Hyouka)'s unconventional genius, in Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru we've Hikigaya's deadpan humour and extreme pessimism which he conveys in a manner that can only leave the watcher shaking in tears of laughter. For S1's excellent humour which was seamlessly woven in with the inevitable slice of life/growing up scenes, it really ranked higher in my book than Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nThis season has destroyed all that.\\n\\n\r\n(spoilers ahead)\\n\\n\r\nThe comedic element, the major selling point, is zero. All gone. Burnt to a crisp like one of Yuigahama's cooking travesties. Hell, this whole season was a travesty in itself. I no longer understood the lesson he had supposedly learnt at the end of each episode or arc. The xmas festival arc dragged on for as long as Hikigaya dragged his feet. There was plenty of vaguely-worded self-angst that was probably intended to sound deep, but half the time I had no idea what he was going on about. I don't think he did either, which is probably why he devolved into tears around the time he made the request for 'something genuine'. I know I'm straying into petty sarcasm, but I wasted a good 3 days on this show and nearly quit watching it twice. Determined to stick it out to the end (and maybe hoping for some redemption at the end of it all), I was disappointed once again. I have no idea what Yuigahama's vaguely worded proposal was about at the end of their aquarium visit. Hikigaya gave another vaguely worded speech and devolved into tears again (I feel you, bro. They wrecked your character completely. Men do not cry.) Yukinoshita Yukino made a request we never got to hear, and then the writers probably thought that would be a suitably vague and faux-deep point to end the whole thing on.\\n\\n\r\nIn the inevitable battle between exasperation at this bullshit and sheer relief that the whole thing was finally over, relief won out in the end. Even if there is a season 3 for this show, I don't think I'll be picking it up. If you watched the first season and were hoping for an encore- just rewatch the whole of S1 again. You'll still waste less time than you would if you watched S2.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku continues where the first season left off however this season focuses on Hachiman's methods with which he solves problems.If you have watched the previous season then their should be no need to explain why this series is so good.This is one of the best romcom i have ever seen it breaks the cliches that are present in other romcom's to point that it feels like this series is a reflection of the social environment of the real world.The methods used by hiki are the most logical and fastest way to fix problems however fast solutions aren'tusually long lasting ones his methods may have solved the problems in the present but the issue will arise again in the future.Hikigaya's constant willingness to put himself in situations that hurt himself even though he himself may not be hurt are directly hurting the people around him who care for him.This is shown in the situation in hiyato's group where tobe's confession threatened to ruin the status quo of the group.Everyone wanted to keep the relationship between them the same but he couldn't hold back his feeling anymore and hiki had to step in thereby resorting to his quick and logical methods which hurt the people around him and placed a strain on his relationship with yuu and yukinon because they hated seeing him hurt himself.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9 The story is basically about the volunteer club who go around fixing the problems of their school mates.What more can i say about the story of this series this isn't a story driven series but a character driven one the story at this point isn't really important its just about the actions of the character's.The actions of the characters are what drive and further the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9 I gotta take some time to talk about the art of this series.The art of this very good and i love how it uses body language to express what the character's are feeling you don't even have to hear them talk about what their feelings but you can tell what they are feeling just by paying attention to their body language.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9 The sound of this anime is amazing i thoroughly enjoyed it every week the music and sound used during emotional scenes were superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:The characters are absolutely amazing hikigaya has become one of my favorite character's because of his ideals and his inner monologue's.His desire for something genuine reflects my own desire because many friendships are shallow and based on superficial things.We try so hard to maintain our superficial friendships and not try to understand what other people feel and only thing of ourselves.Their relationship looks very shaky at the moment and its only a matter of time until it breaks.They don't feel that they can fully trust each other.And until they do a genuine relationship will never be formed.I think it's pretty obvious at this point that both yuu and yukinon have some feelings for hiki however they try to not act on them because they want to maintain the current relationship that the three of them have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9 I really enjoyed this series because of how realistic it is.This series is above other romcom and deserves all the praise it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9 This is a very realistic series that i really enjoyed.This really got me to think about the relationships in my life and what i want from them. i hope in the near future a season 3 will come out so the greatness will continue.",

            "content": "I believe all the viewer here already watched Oregairu(short of Yahari ore no..)'s 1st season. So, ill review both season with some talk about comparation between each season\r\nSTORY- 6\r\nDont get me wrong here, but the story overall is a meh, there are no progression between hikigaya and any other girl, they still dont really understand each other UNTIL THE LAST EPISODE. Well they did a LITTLE and the ending is pretty much a cliff hanger or a promotion to watari's light novel. They did not accomplish anything, it really is dissapointing. The 1st season is much better in the story aspect.\r\nART- 9\r\nIf i would say,the art is above average, it is good, The art is great and give us sort of... calm atmosphere? Well maybe...\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- 8\\n\r\nThe OST is good, and the OP also cool.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 4\\n\r\nI know many of you might hate me for this but let me explain it 1st. The only good point in 2nd season is: Hachiman is still our calm and cool main character with many monologue, it is great. \\n\r\nBut..... Yukino become a character that need to be saved, and very complicated it became frustating at time, and the conclusion about that atitude is at the last episode. We dont see anymore of Yukino's cool side and always get beaten in every argument.\\n\r\nYuigahama, our cute and easy-going character become more and more melodramatic each episode.. oh god, it is not like i hate it but she was introduced to us as a good listener, a girl that could mediate when there's an akward moment or there's a fight... cmon she didnt even express her feeling and she become \"im not as nice as you thought\" character sometime GOD IT IS ANNOYING\\n\r\nOther side character, HAHA i love them more that the trio mentioned above, but i still hate em except haruno, she become my favourite. Why? because she pushed the protagonist trio to move forward in a hard way, but idk why many people call her a bitch? well nvm\\n\r\nOh i forget to mention i laughed very hard when the 1st season introduce the scientist- like character with white hait(i forget his name) and Sui, a boy that look like a girl. But in this season, their screen time are little to none, instead they give other side character that could've been better if they use this 2 instead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -6\\n\r\nGood.. Bad... good... bad again.... Well if the ending was better than THAT ending i'll give it a 7, but \"watari want to promote his light novel.. blabla\" SO FUCK IT the ending is complete bad but i pretty much enjioy epi 1,2,3,4 and 8 tho, when they solve the misunderstanding between protagonist trio after/before that it's bad...srsly. The joke was good, they added the joke even in hachiman monologue, it kinda funny. But again, the 1st season deliver it 100% better\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nMore like 5 huh but this anime deserve its 6 because it has no plothole. And the comedy part(that some ppl find it bad) i found it pretty funny , so yes this anime deserve the 6. If you are wondering, the 1st season is a 9 so this is an anime where the 2nd season is much worse than the 1st",

            "content": "I was not able to write a review directly after finishing this show. It took a good couple of weeks for everything to settle in, and even then I had trouble. Last week, I was reading through some reviews on this season, and was GENUINELY (get it?) disappointed. So here I am, a few months later, writing a review.\r\n(warning, very indepth and long - do not read if you have word-o-phobia)\r\nStory:\r\nFor some, the story progresses a bit too slow for their liking. For me, the pacing was also a bit slow. But I still enjoyed the ride. Others complain about the slow development between maincharacters. I felt that the slow development is intentional for such a realistic work. In many other romance animes, characters fall in love after such a short period of time. This anime uses the first season's development SO EFFECTIVELY, which gives it a backstory for any interactions between characters. Many people don't understand that the first season was a buildup of emotion and drama into the second season. They don't understand that INTENTIONALLY, there is less comedy in the second season. BECAUSE SHIT HITS THE FUCKING FAN. Comedy was NOT THE SELLING POINT OF THE FIRST SEASON (although a main part of it)! People are forgetting the deep monologues, the building tension, Episode 12's conclusion monologue which fucking killed me. The memories and feelings build on top of one another. It's a slow ride. But a damn good one. But not many understand that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt took a while to get used to the art in the second season. I enjoyed the new looks (it was more accurate with the Light Novel), but I just couldn't help but notice that the exaggeration of Hachiman's and other characters' looks in the first season highlighted their own roles extremely well. But Studio Feel did adapt them very well. Backgrounds were amazing as well. Kyoto, the school, StuCo room, the Service Club room itself, etc. All very well done. Lighting, too. As for animation, there were some sequences I felt a bit iffy about, (first 30 seconds of the first episode: I'm talking about you), and an extremely emotional scene where... Feel probably should have made Hachiman look a bit more anime-like instead of going for a more realistic style. (Not only for aesthetic purposes, the contradiction between his design and Yui and Yukino's designs really don't match up in that one scene, making it hard for viewers to concentrate on the emotional sentiment). Other than this, I loved the new art. I really did. It brought new light to the characters. Also the subtle changes in the OP's art really had me thinking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could give sound an 11/10, but sadly, I cannot. You need an explanation? Here: Go to YouTube and search up Oregairu OST. There's your explanation. Oh, look up Yukinoshita's theme, Yukitoki (piano vers.), and Hello Alone (Ballad vers.) I'm 100% sure you'll like them. The OST's are SUPERB. OP and ED were good, but I liked the first season's better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAhh... If you thought ART and STORY were long reads, it is time for an actual essay.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the animes I have watched, this has got to be one of the most emotionally sophisticated and realistic ones I've seen. Hachiman, the main character, is the most likable MC I have EVER seen. He is neither whiny or wishy-washy. He is blunt and unforgiving. He is also compassionate at times. Yet he has flaws, and he KNOWS he has flaws. 8man is batman. 8man knows he's a loser and accepts it. I could go on and on about 8man but I doubt anyone would want to read a review like that.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino is a character that everyone has seen before. The supposed \"Ice Queen\" who reigns supreme, doesn't have many friends, and has a cold attitude. Yet, underneath the surface, she has complex feelings and quirky and cute hobbies (Pan-san). Her banter with 8man is witty, funny, complex, and shows she enjoys their exchanges. Her backstory provides her with an excuse of how she acts sometimes. I will leave you with a quote from one of my posts: \\n\r\n\"Yukinoshita hates his methods. She does not hate him. Her whole philosophy of life is to help people solve their problems, and I quote the first few episodes of the first season, \"and help them stand on their own feet.\" She hates Hachiman's methods because 1. It is self degrading, 2. It is a temporary fix, although it is effective, and 3. It does not take into account others' feelings. She does things her own way, by being \"cold,\" she is trying to help Hikki. So no, she does not hate him. Otherwise she would not give him the time of day. That is the kind of girl she is.\"\\n\\n\r\nYui-mom is hot, wait what. Yui as a character, is one of my favorite. Her development from season 1 is astonishing. She went from cute but insecure and always matching the mood with others, to cute, still insecure but more aware of her own flaws and her strong points, having genuine friendships, and cute. Did I mention cute. The writer definitely placed her as the link between 8man and Yukino. Without her, their relationship between each other would have been strained. She's the lighthearted, slow-witted, but still intelligent girl. She's the foil to the ever-serious Yukino. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to touch base on three important side characters: Iroha, Hayama, and Hiratsuka-sensei\\n\\n\r\nIroha, introduced extremely late into the whole overall story, is still an important side character because she paved the path between Hayama and 8man. Not only that, she made him realize something - that he was doing what he was doing for himself, because 8man WANTED something. I won't go any further, but she is an important and cute(?) character.\\n\r\nHayama, is the most interesting side character. I disliked him, but as time goes on, I'm starting to understand his perspective more and more. He knows what 8man is doing to himself, and he KNOWS that 8man knows about everything (referring to the drama, sorry, no spoilers), but is feigning ignorance. He is an excellent foil to 8man, yet at the same time, viewers can't help but imagine what he's thinking. \\n\\n\r\nHiratsuka Shizuka. R.I.P. season 1 sensei (imo she was much prettier 1st season). \\n\r\nAlthough not much is said about her backstory, we can infer that she has had a rough childhood as well. Much like Hachiman, she was a reject, but she forged through it all. In one of the most important scenes of the anime, she is truly a \"sensei\" to Hachiman, on life itself, and influences his next decisions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the length of this review.\\n\r\nThere's still so many things to touch base with, the subtle ironies of the show, or the deep connotations of Hachiman's monologues, each and every one. I wish I could analyze each of them for viewers, a piece at a time, but my fingers already ache from typing this.\\n\\n\r\nThis review was a more practical one than an emotional one, explaining everything to the best of my ability. read MisterImouto's review for the emotional standpoint, and to understand why this anime would resonate so well with some viewers. I agree with every word they said, and did not feel that I needed to repeat their words, and thus made this review.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nThis is somewhat awkward. I rarely stand here before you and review that I actually consider one of the best anime I have ever seen, because hell, how am I going to justify such a massive claim? Yes, My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. Zoku is not, in my opinion, only one of the best sequels of all time, but is probably up there in my Top Ten list of my favorite anime ever, and to explain something like that is somewhat like explaining why I chose Tsubomi Kido to be my waifu(trust me, I'm going somewhere with this). I know whatI feel is strong enough to be justified, but the second I attempt to put it into words I can't quite seem to grasp the heart of the argument, or I feel I failed to explain it well enough to make the point I wanted to make. And that's frustrating. It's the reason why I sometimes shy away from reviewing the better spectrum of Eastern animation. It's easy to say why things that suck suck(because they suck), but explaining why something is truly great takes another whole level of mental organization and articulation to bring to fruition, levels likely more complex than my feeble mind can handle. But I've always wanted to give a shot to explain my adoration for one of my favorite anime. So today, I'm going to try my best.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you've had a wonderful today thus far, and welcome to a new anime review, and my, is it a big one. Today, My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. Zoku, the sequel to 2013's My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. Alright. Let me take a breath. And here... we... go. \\n\\n\r\nLet's take technical first. Zoku was animated by Studio Feel, who aren't exactly in a positive light when it comes to their reputation. They've made some alright stuff like Outbreak Company and Mayo Chiki, but mostly their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 consists of things like the softcore-porn OVA series KissXSis, the wincest epitome Yosuga no Sora, and the infamous ecchi So I Can't Play H!  Needless to say, seeing such an entry like Zoku into the medium from this studio is more than unexpected. Hopefully this means Feel is turning a new leaf in their time as a studio, but then I remember that Bikini Warriors aired in summer. So... this is probably just a one-time thing.\\n\\n\r\n      Kei Oikawa steps into the role of director for this season, doing a surprisingly good job too despite only having major directorial work in Outbreak Company and Minami-ke Okaeri. The writing was handled by Shoutarou Suga, who has done scripts for anime such as One Week Friends, and Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society, but also has done random episode scripts for many different titles, like Eden of The East, Nanatsu no Taizai, Eureka Seven and Blood+. Finally, the anime ran its 13 episodes from April 2nd to June 2th of 2015. Onto the plot, then. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nLife appears to continue as normal for Hachiman Hikigaya and the Service Club. They still receive requests from various members of the student body who need help with their problems. The relationships of all the students, including the Service Club appear to have gone unchanged, and the monotonous trudge of everyday life continues forward without change. But that couldn't be further from the truth.\\n\\n\r\n     Despite his sincerest efforts to avoid growing close to others, Hachiman finds himself stuck in between his own stubborn ideology and the threat of the unspoken words of the people closest to him pushing away the closest thing to true friends he has ever had. Standing at the crossroads of the purpose of youth and relationships, Hachimana, Yukino and Yui will all need to confront what is actually important to them, whether the things they feel are real, or just another byproduct of the superficiality that constantly surrounds their lives. The answer won't be easy to obtain, but as the Service Club watch the elements that make up the high-school experience in the students who walk in and out for their club-room, it might just be a lot closer and obvious than any of them think.\\n\\n\r\nI realize fully that that description doesn't exactly tell you what happens in the show, but that's because nothing truly different than anything else you'd see in any other rom-com transpires, at least as far as the basic set-up goes. But to get this out of the way now, it doesn't really matter. SNAFU has always been a character-driven show, and it's thanks to that aspect that the show is able to transform what would usually be cliches into little pockets of development between the relationships of the characters. Even something as basic as Hachiman randomly running into someone in a cafe serves some sort of purpose in the forwardness of the characters, and it's able to do this thanks to the great writing. While the interactions between characters in the first season were mostly just great because they were witty exchanges of dialouge, Zoku takes it to a whole other level. I don't simply mean that by the dialouge is extremely clever and intelligent(because it still is), but now there's always another layer of conflict running underneath the dialouge. There's always something being left unsaid in the conversation, or something that is implied to be really said when the characters interact, and this adds a fantastic window for the viewer for the what the characters actually think about one another and the situations they get themselves into.... and what it simply being said on-screen. Zoku doesn't just do this through cheap inner monologues, you can see what is really being stated from subtle glances, to the range of expressions on the character's faces, to certain silent actions that for one reason or another have some sort of meaning within the unspoken narrative. Hell, even the cinematography occasionally chips in to show either division between characters or something similiar. Trust me, I would love to show you some examples of this, but the examples I feel best encapsulate what exactly I'm talking about would spoil huge chunks of development later on. It's exceedingly rare to see something as tightly written as some of the best interactions in Zoku, and it's actually quite amazing just how much is packed into these 13 episodes, and simply put, that's because no time is wasted.\\n\\n\r\n     Okay, so the pacing is admittedly slow, especially in the first few episodes, but just because the episodes are slowly paced doesn't mean they aren't important. While there is a very good arc running in the background of the first few episodes, I think they were also meant to establish the overall tone of this season and how it differs much from the first, which I'll go into later when I talk about characters. The point is, this seemingly slow start is meant to establish the stakes for this season, and I think you'll find, as the episodes progress and so too does the remarkably complex themes, this little period of stupor is quickly forgotten when compared to how much else Zoku has to give.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's resolution is the only part of this entire equation that feels a bit incomplete. I don't mean the thematic resolution, but rather the one for the characters that Zoku had been building up to until that point. I don't know if 13 episodes simply wasn't enough for that, or the LN's haven't quite reached their conclusion yet, but as it stands, with 2 seasons and a grand total of 26 episodes, My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU hasn't been concluded, and that's a shame, because that would be the final piece to assure Zoku's dominance in the slice-of-life genre. All I can do now is sit back and pray that a season 3 will happen and conclude this story. If that season 3 doesn't happen, well... that... is a huge problem. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually going to take about the supporting cast first, mostly because I feel I should save the best for last, but also because I want to preface with some things first that will hopefully lead in later. Now, SNAFU as a franchise has easily one of the best supporting casts out there in anime, and I realize that's a huge change to how I felt in my first SNAFU review, but allow me to explain here, because it's only while I re-watched certain bits of Zoku that I realized just how vital the supporting cast actually is. Occasionally I think that the supporting cast is meant to represent various faucets of society and youth, acting as a sort of possible eventuality for our main cast who are still very much in the process of figuring their lives out, but I almost feel like that doesn't give them enough credit. Nearly all of the supporting cast has at least one aspect of development to them that adds somewhere to the boiling pot of themes, and even in the case of characters like Hayato: the seemingly stereotypical \"popular hunk\", Yukino's older sister Haruno(who I honestly sort of despise), Iroha, a fantastic new addition to the cast this season, or Hachiman's crush from middle-school Kaori, who reveals in this season just what kind of person she is, are so well fleshed out that they are able to rival the main cast in some aspects. Of course not everyone gets the spotlight, the cast is so big that that exists as basically an inevitability. Totsuka very much remains the one-dimensional trap who is inexplicably infatuated with Hachiman throughout, Kawasaki, who showed promise in S1 gets basically nothing, and the chuunibyo-infected Zaimokuza hardly even appears. But I hardly think that matters. Firstly, it's impressive enough that the anime was able to do as much with the rest of the cast as it did, and secondly, the three above roles in this season are so trivial that is hardly seems to matter; the anime instead focusing on characters that actually have potential. Is it still a problem? Yes. But it's also one that is but a leaf in front of a mountain of solid characterization and development from the rest of the supporting cast. And also this next part.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Hachiman, Yui, and Yukino are absolutely great characters in their own right is a severe understatement. This is easily one of the best main casts I've come across in the slice-of-life genre, and I honestly don't think I have enough time to describe just how great all three of them are individually, since we'd be here all day, so rather, let's go for some blanket statements.\\n\\n\r\n     To describe the main cast of Hachiman, Yui and Yukino, in one word, I'd think I'd go with \"human\". One of SNAFU's strong-points from the very beginning of the first season was to point how just how flawed real people are, and in a medium where \"perfect-waifus\" and \"moe-jesus\" female archetypes exist, it's exceedingly refreshing. Even Yui, who is by far the most moral person in the entire show, turns from simply an unassertive well-doer in something much more interesting by the end, even if admittedly, the show leaves it a little late for the development to start for her. Yukino also receives fleshing out, but this time, she's not just a more realistic take on a hackneyed archetype, she's a real character, and that almost seems to be a parallel between this season and the first. The first season of SNAFU was a parody if anything, and though I loved it for its realistic depiction of highschool dynamics, the author undoubtedly intended the satirical take of a typical romantic comedy to be the main selling point. Hell, it's even in the name: My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU(which is short for Situation. Normal. All. F*cked. Up.). Zoku takes a more straight-laced approach to the genre, and honestly it's for the best, because now instead of laughing at how the anime handles cliches, we can actually appreciate the great characters and storytelling. And speaking of great characters, I think I've put it off long enough.\\n\\n\r\n     To say Hachiman Hikigaya is the absolute heart and soul of SNAFU would be me holding back on a lot of words. SNAFU has always been pushed forward by the characters, the character are who initiate what little plot there is, and it's their actions which forward the thematic weight and relationship dynamics, unlike some other melodramatic highschool anime I could mention. Hachiman has always been the front of center of the anime: it's his inner monologues and viewpoints of life that brung the first season life, but in Zoku, we actually get to see that SNAFU is not just a relatible view of society through the eyes of a pragmatic loner, but rather an examination of human relationships. What I really love is that Hachiman's pessimistic view of life is by no means supported by the Zoku, if anything, it challenges it. By bringing in the viewpoints of Yui, Yukino and the rest of supporting cast, Zoku is able to paint an intricate tapestry of the viewpoints and experiences of one class in a random Japanese highschool, who are are trying to figure out this thing called life. As all of these separate strands entangle themselves around Hachiman's inner character arc, it resolves in a pay-off so absolutely brilliant that I can now say that Hachiman Hikigaya is one of the best goddamn main-characters, or hell, even characters I have ever seen brought to life by the anime medium. Seriously, I love this magnificent bastard.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation & Sound\\n\\n\r\nI don't have as much to say about the music of Oregairu Zoku as much as the animation, so I'll get the sound section out of the way first. Nothing really stands out from composer MONACA(known for Yuki Yuna is a Hero and Monogatari Second Season) quite honestly, the music acting as nothing more than a way to set atmosphere and not add to it. The heavy presence of the piano in nearly every song gives the OST somewhat of an identity; the notes punctuating the often slow and somber songs to great effect, even if nothing stands out. It's something I learn to appreciate more every time I listen to it, and maybe I'll grow to really love it in time, but for now, so much of the tracks sound so similiar to me (particularly the piano-centric ones) that it becomes hard to distinguish individual songs; the OST remaining a sort of singular entity of piano and slow-paced music. Let me just say it: it almost all sounds the same. Not that that is a bad thing when the offerings are good, it just isn't something I can get particularly excited about, though I won't deny it may be something I can listen to as I drift off to sleep. My mixed feelings about the OST aside, if there is one undoubted highlight, it's the OP: \"Harumodoki\" by artist Nagi Yanagi, a song that typically wouldn't be my kind of thing for its up-and-down precision, but yet I still really enjoy, particularly Yanagi's lovely voice and the meaningful lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the show was already a big controversy even before Zoku had aired its first episode, obviously because production was switching from the acclaimed Studio Brains Base to the less acclaimed Feel. And let's just get it out there, the entire style, composition and design of the show have completely changed from the first season, with new character designs and whatnot, but believe it or not, it's actually all for the better. SNAFU's first season is actually one of Brain Base's worst effort in terms of animation in my opinion, the show really looked rough and unpolished, further punctuated by the mediocre character designs and artstyle. Now I have similiar things to say about the majority of Studio Feel's works(seriously, In Search of the Lost Future is one of the ugliest things I have ever seen), but apparently they realized just what they had on their hands on here, because Zoku is probably the best looking anime they have ever produced. Everything is much more smooth and fleshed out, with the colors used actually being somewhat attractive to look at for once. If the animation was ever choppy or unpolished, I never once noticed. Throughout, Zoku looks wonderful, and I have absolutely no complaints, so let's take this opportunity to congratulate Studio Feel for the bang-up job they did here. I know many(including me) were complaining about the deviation from Brain Base's designs before this thing had even aired, but when you actually see the show and see all of the new pieces come together, I'd say without hesitation that in every category, if only in this particular case, Studio Feel have topped Brains Base here in every possible area. Good jobu guys. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably obvious, but I really have a deep attachment to this series, because it took something I already loved and made it better. Zoku manages to juggle the duties it already has to its pre-established universe by further developing the characters, but also by expanding the ideas to simultaneously give me experience that reminded me why I loved the original series in the first place: its authenticity. Zoku is able to dissect the heart-aches and anxieties of the human experience that hardly any anime has even attempted to tackle since the medium's conception; that seemingly invisible bridge between people that we all try to truly cross; not by the superficiality of modern culture that has perpetuated into the pores of society, but by seeking that sense of human connection, that understanding, that we all long for whether we want to or not. And for, not just an anime, but for any form of media, to actually address these fundamental/existential problems with not just accuracy but with respect borders on something goddamn revolutionary, and before you stop me, no, I don't think I'm overselling this at all, cause when Zoku is able to reach its dramatic peak of these questions, it really becomes that good, particularly in an incredible scene at the end of episode 8 so potent with the essence of human emotion that I'd put it up there with one of the single best moments ever conjured by Eastern animation. Am I getting ahead of myself? Maybe. But when an anime is able to so deeply bring to light the emotions and struggles that I have wrestled with throughout my life... I'd be damned if I don't form some kind of personal attachment to it that warrants this kind of exuberant praise.\\n\\n\r\n     So, I'm going to stop and catch my breath here after that harangue of passion, because I'm pretty sure I'm getting into the thematic fundamentals of Zoku way too much, maybe at the risk of spoiling it for you the viewer. But I feel it's the only way for me to justify just why this is \"one of the best anime ever made\", because truly great narratives don't just make you love them through the characters or story, but rather through that little something extra that makes it remarkable. Remarkable. I'm just going to leave that word dangling in the air for a moment. If there was ever one word to describe this show, that would be it. Truly, it is remarkable for something, anything, to remind us all, that all we ever wanted was something genuine.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Dammit. I just want Hachiman to be happy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "The one flaws i see in many people who doesn't understand the situation, the trouble, the repetitive, the logic, the subtle meaning in people's action, the misinterpretation about the reasons in the characters (they even uses their past to justify the character's behavior and reasoning to their contemporary life as well),  the hidden form of human nature in people who're clouded within their own zone of popularity and selfish needs, and predictable thinking about the young within this generation is just a holistic thinking. Which was display quite well within this anime. It shows us different form of subtle messages when a person, orprobably a character with personality that can fit itself well. There's... I guess alot of sophistry within it too. It's a great show if you're bad at catching a person who's going into sophistry just to deceived you within his or her argument or just simply dodge the main topic of discussion. (like how they would use sophistry to make themselves looks smart but ended up failing to come into the conclusion when their initial reasons were to do just that. Just like how it was presented in this anime's character discussion and interactions.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nAs far as we all know, all slice of life anime tend to have a pretty crude, mundane, and plain story line or progression that it can literally be seen as a cliche ones. Nevertheless, most of the story that we would ever get from this are usually the ones that are... I guess, a story or a challenge that can be pretty life changing to one's relationship, future, and human's life. I feel like, the story itself aren't really a story. But more like a series that talks about human's or high school's problems that tend to go unnotice to our generation of learners and wanting the viewers (especially teenagers) to notice these things at school, so that they wouldn't commit or be deceive by other's actions, or being misunderstood by others simply because girl did this to you or a guy did this to you. Unless you have a much more clearcut, or on point information that the person who's acting like this to you are actually interests in you. \\n\r\nP.S this is all Hikigaya thought process, which is a pretty reasonable with his background story too. It's just the author's way or subtle messages to the audience that, you and others should think about other people's feeling when you behave in a certain way towards them. Why? Every behavior in our daily lives's interaction are subjective to interpretation. So you may ended up forcing them to think about the positive things (and ignores the negatives) about them, others, or you. Which may ended up horribly if it were to be use for some development of that person's love interest or a mean of changing things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAs far as it goes, the art itself are as fitted and well drawn, specifically for an anime of this genre. The art itself aren't that extremely glorious or glamorous and amazingly drawn with an articulate details on the character's design, feature and shapes. But it fits this anime. The character's body language are well translated too. Which is rare for an anime to go to this details on it. In addition, Not every good story has to have the best art, with the best or welly drawn character and background pics. As long as you find it to be fit to the story itself. Then it's not troublesome for your taste of art. Unless you're one of those perfectionist that only like anime with a high quality art ones. And if you planned to use art as a way to evaluate the anime's quality than you're just committing a fallacy of appealing to beauty. Because these matter are subjective to the person's wants on how the art should be in a slice of life or within any other anime out there. But i would recommend you, sakurako san no ashimoto, fate zero, fate stay night unlimited, attack on titan, or some of the other old ones and possibly some of the upcoming anime in 2016 as well. If you want to see a high budget anime with an extreme investment on art, and animation (the number of the same images but not entirely, being display with the remnant of its high quality art per frame to make the movement looks smooth and with quality of the same level of the primitive art design of the initial scene. When it's being loop or being aired live)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nEvery music pieces or OST that you will hear are pretty well fitted for the mood of a specific scene. Like the ominous/sad/emotional sounding OST when you hear one of the character shutting other's opinion down, despite it being decided and ended up trying to sacrifice themselves into solving other people's own problems. While not being acknowledge for helping them in any way. And the voice acting are pretty perfect for each of the character's personality, and the attempt of the character of trying to condescendingly talks or mocks the other within this show. It sounded so real (due to the swaying of tone or its sound) to make you either get sick or piss off by them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWhile some of the character may seem pretty normal to us, and stereotypical for this generation as well. They do possess... something that this generation of children or teenager never has. And that's, critical judgement on relations, popular kids having a supreme jealously over how knowledge-able Hikigaya (the introverted but extremely willing to help others as long as he's being the one who's being hurt as a result of solving their problems) and he would always has a conversation or beg him for somethings in order to.... I guess, becoming closer to how he thinks. Or an extremely deep thinker, mature, adult like characteristic female teenager who's extremely rude, while considerate at times when she's within the situation where they can be considerate or in debt of a favor to them to make them to be considerate. They aren't innocent and human like basically for that age. They thought about things that no teenager would ever thought about. Especially Hikigaya and Yukino. But that's what makes their character interesting and fun to see. Them with a polar opposite opinion but mutually a loner before they apply into this volunteer club. For hikigaya case it's understandable, but not to this level of self awareness and observant type.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy this anime simply because it has a much different and a more deeper approach to human's behavior, body language, subtle ways of saying things while trying to make it positive just for the person's appearance, sophistry that we use, and methodology to solve a human's problem that may affect both parties or just the individuals. Simply put, the anime itself help us to understands human better. Relationship specifically and the way human behave or talks in a certain way. And i can solidify and make a confirmation about it base from my past experience to these high school life's dilemmas and other teenager's actions when they could be seen acting into this stereotype that portrays in this anime.",

            "content": "Favorite Quote: \"It's not empty words I'm after.  There was something else I desired all along.  Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship, or anything of the sort.  I don't care about being understood.  I simply wish to understand.  Understand, know, and rest easy in that knowledge, gain some peace of mind.  Because not understanding terrifies me.  Saying I want to understand everything is extremely self righteous.  It's a dictatorial and conceited wish.  It's shameless and repulsive.  And I'm absolutely disgusted at myself for wanting that.  But if we feel the same way, if a relationshipexists where we can force that ugly self consciousness upon each other and accept it, I know there's no way that can happen.  I realize that's completely out of reach.  But still I want something genuine.\"  -Hachiman Hikigaya\\n\\n\r\nThis is a long quote I'm sorry about that.  But honestly, it had me in tears.  There is so much truth to his speech it's almost scary.  I have alot of similar viewpoints as our main character.  In my opinion, what he means is friendships, relationships, and interactions simply out kindness, guilt, or mutual understanding is fake.  It has to be something that is real, something we always wanted not by maintaining an image of any sort.  Sorry that was just a few things I thought about after finishing this series.  So now let's get into the review without any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story in the Yahari Ore no Seishun Zoku is almost identical with the first season.  Not much has changed at all.  The writing and the plot is relatively similar.  The Service Club still regularly does it's duty by completing other people's requests.  However, the only big difference in this is that the plot becomes alot more complex and thought provoking as the series progressed.  The writing is done extremely well allowing audiences to be engaged.  It never bored me throughout the series.  Also, it contributed to the plot by making it very realistic.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: There were a few differences in the art.  There were obvious minor changes to the character designs of Yukino and Hachiman.  Nevertheless, this didn't distract me from enjoying the series.  The colors were also still done fantastically.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending themes were still top notch.  Although the opening changed significantly, it still captured the overall mood of the new season.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in the second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun continued to intrigue me.  I mentioned before in my first review that the main character was what set it apart from allot of romantic comedies, but the other characters contributed significantly.  Our main character is still very much the same except he begins to open up more than usual.  Towards the ending especially.  The character development of numerous characters made it very appealing.  This is especially true for Yukino whom we see begins to soften up significantly when she is around our main character.  In fact, the contribution of new characters also made it feel like a harem, but a completely different kind in its regard.  The second season also brought many other character's life perspectives and love interests to the plot and it was done in such a way that it wasn't overwhelming.  It flowed nicely with the story.  This second season we also get to see the teacher's point of view as well which is great.  \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion: The return of Batman, the silent protector.  I was extremely excited to continue this series.  The second season had a more serious sort of feel to it compared to the first season which was something I appreciated.  We see a bit more romance in this season and more complex situations.  Overall, it is still thought provoking like the first season.  At the end of the series it had me wondering who the main character was going to fall for, what is a genuine friendship, bond, interaction, or relationship?  The second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun definitely ranks in my top five best anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review.  Sorry I felt I went too in depth with some of the philosophies that our main character spoke about or was curious about.  I hope you guys find the second season as entertaining and thought provoking too!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10 extremely well done masterpiece.",

This is especially true for the main character, Hachiman. His quirky, dark, and dry humor as well as  philosophy is quite relatable, and his thought process is fun to follow. \r\nIn fact, all the characters, themselves, are also very unique and interesting to understand. The character development is integrated well in this anime. This is especially true in the second season, when events and relationships start to deepen, but change (for the better or worse?). \r\nIf youenjoy a nice romcom, light, yet slightly dramatic, then this anime is for you. If you enjoy growing with the characters in an anime, then this anime is definitely for you. (Less importantly, if you have a somewhat satirical, pessimistic view on life, this anime is also for you.) \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy!",

            "content": "\"I was stunned.\"\r\nYeah, that was like my initial reaction somewhere at the middle part of the series. It's nothing like the first season to be honest but I enjoyed it the way it is. Some anime are stagnant and sometimes that works for them but mostly, it doesn't. This anime has became quite a heavy one in the next season but then, that's something to be expected. As the distances between them grows closer, their characters changes and develops too. But I must say that I wasn't fairly happy on how yukino turn out to be at this stage. Her character became a bit dullin season 2. Dull in a sense that it's become the typical kind even though she had probably one of the most typical character in there. I liked her tho and find her relatable sometimes. Like that neko scene, I knew it! I wasn't the only one who's like that to cats U w U) and when it comes to body comparisons... she's a... A comrade T - T)b but tbh, she's not my favorite. Yui is great too. She somehow stole the spotlight a bit here and her change isn't really easily seen but she did. It was a good change. I like how emphatic she is. It's a blessing to have a friend like her. Although, if we're picking favorites--- I would definitely and surely pick Sensei and Komachi. Even though Sensei is just a supporting character and there's nothing to expect from her, she's pretty amazing. I hope she'll get married though cause that's somehow what she wishes there. A capable woman like her is perhaps a bit tough to handle for men at such age. I wish to say no more to this ^ x ^)b And Komachi is the besto little sister. I find her persona amazing.\\n\r\nAs for the animation, they made hachiman more plain and boring lol but it suits him. Although, tbh I like his s1 version more. Aside from that I loved it as much as I did on the 1st. It had minor changes but I guess if one pays attention to it, it's sth major---and hmm, I'm no elitist so I didn't bother xd Free stuff are always enjoyed.\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great anime but I gotta say that I enjoyed the 1st season more though. This got me a bit like \"Wew.\" but not in a sense that it was boring. It just became more serious but it turned out pretty well, imo. I guess it's cause they got too involved with each other and at this point, a lot of stuff would eventually and surely change. The 3 of them are looking for something genuine and in a vague sense, I think I know the answer but I don't think they are ready for it yet. Well, none of us is ever ready though so I liked hachiman's answer in the last ep. His way of thinking is truly amazing. And it's somehow shown that they all fear change and somewhere along the story, they forgot that change is the only constant thing on earth. Hayato's real identity is also coming out too. That makes him interesting now. The good thing here is that they didn't stick to their \"ideal\" characters but somehow showed that there's more to what someone seems like. It's pleasing how everyone is aware of it too. They know their faults and flaws but indulging in them is also wrong. Hachiman went to that phase but fortunately, he's also changing for the better. I know this isn't new in the slice-of-life genre but sometimes the hypocritical characters becomes a pain to watch. And most of such characters drags everyone that even the plot progression itself gets dragged too * - *) Oh well, going back to the topic on hand, I think they should \"feel\" more to balance it. Hmm, I could actually deem that logic alone won't really make you happy even feel contentment itself. It's like a \"been there, done that\" matter for me. Happiness is fleeting but then there's a degree to it. Of course, this is arguable on the case of everyone though, but no matter what kind of twisting or covering up you do this is the real deal. It's indeed difficult especially if you're indifferent as yukino and you possesses that apathetic trait from hachiman. Yui's happy-go-lucky nature isn't enough to suffice it either, but everyone will get it one day; in their own time and understanding. The question of haruno made me think. She said, \"Is anything truly genuine?\" I guess the answer would depend on your faith and trust to that person. We neither possess the power to know and control what they feel for us nor see and perhaps understand what their real motives are, but somehow we find ourselves believing on what they show us and tell us. I guess haruno got so used in pretending and living on that facade that she's forgotten what the word meant. \\n\\n\r\nA snowman (olaf xd) once said that, \"some people are worth melting for.\" Somewhere along the episodes, sensei said something similar to this. I agree with her. You can never guarantee that you wouldn't hurt anyone cause that's inevitable. In every opportunities that one gets there are sacrifices to be made. Even economics knows such principle too. You just gotta find people that are worth melting for and will be there to help you become another snowman again or perhaps melt with you too. It's a choice :''3 \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: WATCH IT. It's a great anime.",

            "content": "Since you're here, I assumed you have watched oregairu the first season, I'm gonnacompared some points form the first season to second season  while I gave you my review about oregairu second season, since it's will provide you a picture what to expect from second season. Ok let's jump straight into some of the points of this show :\r\nStory(9) - Oregairu zoku is focusing much more into the relationship and character development of Hachiman with the other main character and some of the supporting characters, while the first season is more of introduce you about all the available characters. So the story is muchmore progressing than the first season.\\n\\n\r\n I guessed the only problem is that they covered so much ground than the first season, that they only focused on the main characters and the side characters' screen time got cut mercilessly, it doesn't really affect the story and your enjoyment towards the show, but after some time you will notice that compared to the first season, oregairu zoku's main characters have way more screen time than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9) - I'll say relatively speaking it's definitely an improvement compared to the first season,the first season's art is not bad, It's unique and fresh and definitely captured the spirit of the character, while the second season is generally speaking, it's much more beautiful and the character look more mature(which is really nice in this context).\\n\\n\r\nSound(10) - Oregairu zoku has a lot of great music that played during great moment which make it really nice. It also included some of the great music from the first season. You will find yourself quite immersed into some of the scenes because of the appropriately timed great background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10) - If you have watched the first season carefully, you will love what happened with the characters in this second season. There are so much character developments towards the main and semi main characters. The great part is while there are character developments, it didn't completely change them to another person completely, they still have the basic characteristics that are the signature traits to each of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10) - Oregairu zoku is a great anime that I haven't enjoyed in a long time, I'm so happy that I gave this anime a chance, being a person who has faced some harsh reality, I found myself to be connected and enjoyed the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a person who always think positively or never face any harsh situations in you life before that your view about world has changed a little, I think you will having hard time to enjoyed these show(no offense, it's just that I think self experience do contribute to these show's enjoyment).\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10) - Overall I think this is a great anime, It's easily in my top three list for anime. It's a big improvement from the first season both in visual and plot.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This really is a fantastic romantic comedy anime. I usually don't enjoy romantic comedies because of how overused some of the cliches are, but the first season of Oregairu gave me a whole new perspective on the genre. Don't get me wrong, Oregairu is still filled with rom-com cliches, but watching how these characters grow and develop into people that have actual complexity and motivations makes up for it.\r\nThe first season kept me watching because of the great dynamic between Yukino and Hachiman. Hachiman's personality is a strange mix of self-deprecation and narcissism, and it plays really well off of Yukino's scathing insults and self-righteousness.The first season was more comedy based, and while it had its moments, everyone besides Yukino, Hachiman, and maybe Haruno felt like a cardboard cutout. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, even if the comedy is a lot more scarce, every character begins to become way more complex as the viewer learns more about their relationships. New conflicts force characters like Hayama and Ebina to show a side of themselves that they were originally determined to hide. Overall, the second season is focused on taking the characters established in season one and confronting them with harsh truths that none of them want to face. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes some people love this season and other people despise it is the astonishing amount of subtlety that cloaks the actual \"romance\". I know right, a rom-com anime that's subtle? Why?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I admit that sometimes the character's emotions are a little bit too ambiguous, this series quickly became one of my all time favorites because of the effort that the viewer has to put into fully understanding why the characters do the things that they do. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the last episode and have no idea what's going on, or you still don't understand why Yukino was mad at Hachiman for nearly this entire season, then you should be frustrated with the show's subtlety, not the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nBut before you declare that this show is terrible or something along those lines, you should be aware that you are NOT required to read one of those online analysis essays to understand what's going on. You can if you want to, but the keys to deciphering the character's feelings and true emotions are already there in the episodes, right in plain sight.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what I personally love about it. I've seen few other anime that communicate so much through body language, vague dialogue, and foreshadowing. Once you go back and take note of all of these small details, you gain an entirely new understanding of what this show's really about. Its not just a rom-com; its a coming of age story about high school students discovering the frailty of human relationships and trying their best to overcome it. \\n\\n\r\nSorry if that all sounds a bit pretentious, but I guarantee that I'm not extrapolating it out of nothing. I really hope that others can see these messages too and appreciate Hachiman's journey into adulthood, as well as his attempt to find something \"genuine\".",

            "content": "Oregairu Zoku produced some truly shocking and touching moments, but also, at one point around episode 7, made me lose hope and get so close to dropping it that I had to read future episode synposes to regain confidence in the series, and specifically to find reassurance that its glacial pace might yet lead anywhere worth going. In the end, it was worth the ride, but barely. And I got frostbite.\r\nThe second season changed studios from Brain's Base to Feel, which certainly added some pop and panache visually, especially in backgrounds, since BB seems incapable lately of producing anything but flat, boring colors. Episode 2particularly highlighted this, with vivid fall colors and the gorgeous bamboo walk scene. Those gushing over Feel for this anime, however, seem to have ignored the awful CGI cars and trains and the not-quite-fluid animation for the characters' movements and facial expressions. Hachiman's ahoge no longer moves to express himself, Totsuka isn't quite as cute (an unforgivable offense), and Komachi looks like every other little sister instead of a mischievous brat. But now we have hair shine! That makes it all worth it, right?\\n\\n\r\nIf the change in animation can be easily explained, the change in tone from season 1 cannot. Gone is the humor that made Oregairu worth watching in the first place, and we are instead treated to the sort of perpetual melodrama, purposefully unresolved tension, and willful misunderstandings that characterize the sort of mass-produced rom-com tropes that Oregairu can never really decide if it wants to parody, to lampshade, or to emulate. Its track record, then, is that of a show that can't decide what it wants to be or wants to do; the fact that this very question is a theme in the lives of our high school protags in the series is a strange sort of irony. They can't answer it any better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is very slow-paced for the main trio and, in the case of Yui, nonexistent. Side characters get it liberally, including outstanding scenes for Hayato and Ebina, and some touching Hikigaya household moments with Komachi, but Hikky's character arc is the most troubling. Just as Oregairu can't decide on its own tone, it also can't decide on its own message: Does Oregairu have a message of its own apart from Hikky's? Does Hikky need to change, or is he strangely fine just the way he is? These are questions I felt were unresolved in S1, and S2 continued to be uncertain for a surprisingly long time. Hikky's occasional \"I need to change\" moments are perpetually forgotten the next day, when he continues acting as he always has. This cheapens the emotional impact of the moments that preceded it, and eventually made me feel like I couldn't even trust the series anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes at the amusement park near the end feel more fleshed-out and self-aware as the series begins heading towards its climax, but is bogged down by perpetually annoying characters like Miura, whose goals are kept in obscurity for no real reason, and especially Haruno, who seems to exist only to torture her sister; the fact no one ever stands up to Haruno throughout the series is incredibly frustrating, and a missed opportunity at character development for Hikky, among others. The final episode is touching and well-considered, and the final scene does bring some amount of closure, but is too little too late to make this an actually good anime and is, in fact, a cop-out, even after you decipher the obscure language they used to cover up this fact.\\n\\n\r\nZoku is technically superior to its predecessor in several ways but loses most of its charm, all of its humor, and instead opts for cheap melodrama of the sort that the first season played for laughs. It forgets how to be funny, doesn't find anything deep to say, and meanders its way towards a forgettable finish.",

This is what Oregairu Zoku tries to do and present the appropriate answers for its viewers to those questions with the help of our characters:Individuality.\r\nIn this season the bond between our 3 main characters:Yui ,Hachiman and Yukinon was questioned. The atmosphere changed , their everyday life were they were getting along and helping others changed. Now it's time for them to be in the shoes of their clients , their inner struggles and relationship are exposed forits audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe show reveals to us that our main character is not a philosophy and self aware moralist who takes decisions based on logic only. It presents his human side too where his raw emotions are brought foward by thinking about all of his past actions and a memorable line that has a lot of weight behind:\"I want something genuine\".\\n\r\nIt also shows us that his methods are not always effective and that human relationships are not that easy to understand with the help of Rumi who despite receiving help in the past her current situation didn't change.\\n\r\nWe get to know a different side of Yukinon and her disconnected relationship with her mother and sister. Sometimes is not easy to meet the expectations that others have on you . This may lead to losing your own true self in the process.\\n\\n\r\nAgain Yui is one of the best support character who both Yukinon and Hachiman can depend on her help. Let's not forget Komachi who is always there for Hachiman when he is struggling with a decision to give him a advice.Finally the teacher is the best minor character who had the most influence across the series and on Hachiman's decisions.\\n\\n\r\nThe main themes are still the same about social relationship in different enviroment and human relationship just like in first season. What does better season 2 with those themes is showing us the progress and what influence time and different experiences has on them.\\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful symbolic theme about individuality is the association with the penguins and us humans from the last episode.\\n\r\nThe same problem this season has(like in season 1) is the lack of development for some characters. They are mainly used as plot devices to solve Hachiman's requests or comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu Zoku manages to create a harmony in his emotional atmosphere. Many anime fail to do that and it turns into a melodrama concert. But this show is different it uses that atmosphere for its plot and characterization (Hachiman's request episode, Penguin visit episode etc).\\n\\n\r\nTo end my review the show gives us a good conclusion. No one knows what will happen in the near future with our characters or what is right or wrong. You only can help yourself and solve your own problems and make a decision for your own future.",

            "content": "After finishing the first season of Oregairu in what felt like a blink of a second, a season packed with funny and cute moment, as well as special and beautiful encounters where romance would start to blossom, I waited patiently on second season where hopefully I would see some real mouth to mouth action, but was let down greatly. \r\nIn this second season of Oregairu, the makers pretty much chose to throw away most of the characters you meet in the first season and focus solely on the mains which I have no problem with. Season 1 did its job, its time for second seasonto do theirs, which honestly it didnt for me.\\n\\n\r\nRelax, I'm not telling you that it was bad, but just lacking, especially for me who had such high expectations of it, and heres why. \\n\\n\r\nI went into second season preparing myself for some real loveydovey drama/comedy etc because under genres it clearly says romance, right? If you thought like me and was also ready for some Yukinoshita x Haciman action, we were fooled. The romance in this show hardly moves forward and is hardly noticeable apart from the last episode where we see atleast some emotions, but cmon last episode? Really? Seems like I have to wait yet another year or so to see love truly blossom in this show...\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the romance super lacking, but the story too. As we follow Hachiman, Yukinoshita and Yuigahama through their super shaky relationship, filled with locked away and held back emotions, you start to wonder, is this even going anywhere? Cuz season 2 sure didnt amount to much. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how season 2 went for me: \\n\r\nMain characters have a problem, problem fixed, no problem is back. \\n\r\nMain characters deals with other peoples problems, problem fixed, no its back.\\n\r\nMain characters fixes first problem, a new problem develops, season 2 ends.\\n\\n\r\nSure there are more details to it then what I have written above, but thats pretty much how it goes. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also an unnecessary amount of work put into this other girl that hachiman helps, who seemingly towards the end grows feeling for Hachiman but is left unexplained and the creators leaves it at that. \\n\\n\r\nI also had the problem where I wouldnt understand a damn of what happened in for example episode 6 and had to rewatch it again before watching episode 7 because I literally couldnt remember what the hell happened, mostly because the problems that unfolds in this show are really hard to notice and takes place further back than you would initially think. \\n\\n\r\nThere is so much good in this show, that its a real shame that they use season 2 as mostly a build up for a season 3 ( there is going to be a season 3 right? ). The story is great, the art is great, the sound is great, the characters are amazing, but overall I was left with a hole in my heart. Lets hope a season 3 can fix the hole and bring me peace.",

            "content": "\"The past makes you wanna die out of regret, and the future makes you depressed out of anxiety, so by elimination, the present is likely the happiest time.\"\r\n- Hikigaya Hachiman\r\nThere are people who are destined to be popular - to be social butterflies and have a fruitful high school life. And then there's Hikigaya Hachiman. He is an introvert, a cynic, a snarky pragmatic. He is many things, but if we have to boil him down to one trait, it would be unpopular. \r\nThe story progresses through a central theme: change is inevitable. We see that romance and comedy takes a backseat to further explorethe drama (or perhaps melodrama) that ensues in Hachiman's life. Was the plot rushed? Slightly. Were some conflicts flimsily executed? Perhaps. But then again, doesn't the time we spent in high school feel rushed, melodramatic, and flimsily executed in retrospect?\\n\\n\r\nOregairu reveals Hachiman's insecurities at a greater depth. We can see the insecurities of a high school boy unable to fully trust people. Hachiman, who is quick to judge and scrutinize one's ulterior motive, is distrusting, plays the self-sacrificing martyr, and cynical of friendship. And yet he embeds himself in the frail friendship within the Service Club  with Yukinoshita Yukino and Yuigahama Yui. \\n\\n\r\nBut time moves forward and with time, people change. Hikigaya, throughout the series, grows, regresses, and grows again. He often finds himself at odds with his own ideals and the very trait that made his character stand out in the first season: his distrust of others. Little by little, Hikigaya opens up to those he considers friends and family. The closed-minded Hikigaya begins to expand his horizons. \\n\\n\r\nOregairu is a puzzling anime. As a romantic comedy, it centralizes on themes like the disillusionment of human relationship, the pressure of not fitting in, the fear of change. I found myself looking back at my own middle school and high school life. I wonder if I would have been friends with a \"Hikigaya.\" Maybe. Maybe not. But regardless: \"Life goes on regardless of whether you're laughing or crying, and your high school days will eventually draw to a close.\"",

Always having delusional thoughts after interacting with a girl, waiting for a girl to reply my msg, not having friends and being an outcast in the class, being bullied by classmates with higher social staus etc. Therefore, just like Hachiman, I am very pessimistic/realistic. The art in both seasons are great and the bgms are really catchy. The character development, especially hachiman and yukino in season 2, really stands out. This anime also doesnt rely on ecchi elements unlike many other rom coms as there is no fan service in this anime (except after theyplayed tennis).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are the kind of person that always hangs out with friends and was never alone at school, you probably wont like it. Many ppl i know in real life that have a \"normal\" school life did not enjoy this anime and could not understand hachiman's pessimistic views.",

            "content": "Um... okay. Not the stellar sequel series I was expecting, but still not bad. Apparently the ending of this season is a hot topic, so be prepared for a little bit of confusion as you try and decipher the abstract nature of episode 13.\r\nThe music is still good, as always. The art actually, in my opinion, got kicked up a notch this season. There were a few really gorgeous shots that didn't exist in the first season. The character growth is also a lot more prevalent this season than it was before, which is really nice.\r\nI really enjoyed the commentary on loneliness and what itmeans to be alone that we got in the first season, and I think this season really drives that point home. You get to see the main character go on quite a journey to figure out what he wants out of himself and the people around him. I think that this season shows him fighting with relationships and expectations very well.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said-- and this is the one negative thing I have to say about this season and the entire anime in general-- a romance did not belong in this story. In fact, I don't even think this anime should be classified as a romance. For one, it was way too abstract and convoluted. It was supposed to work in with each characters' hesitation to really speak about what they wanted, but it didn't come across well at all. Beyond that, it didn't feel organic or genuine regardless of the pairing. Again, this could've been done purposely to show that genuine relationships aren't that easy to obtain, but I don't feel like it was great direction for the story to take. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the last few episodes of this season turning into a romantic debacle kind of soured the experience for me. It was out of place, so hopefully, should this anime return or simply conclude in the novel, the creator will choose a more concrete path to go down. As it stands, it's much to unstable. \\n\\n\r\nI make it sound all bad, but that's because I have to criticize the things I see potential in, and this anime is one of them. It's still enjoyable to watch because you have the same relatable characters as before, so I'd definitely watch this season if you enjoyed the first one. Just don't watch it if you want to watch a romance. Hopefully that clears up some of the debate around this season and the ending without too many spoilers. I guess it's easier to watch it and decide for yourselves, though.",

            "content": "\"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku\" or \"My Teenage Romance Snafu\" or simply \"Oregairu\" by Wataru Watari is the second season of the anime and seriously one hell of an anime. \r\nFor all those who watched the first season, it definetly is a must watch. Maybe for those who didn't like the first season, the art signifcantly has got better due to another anime studio producing the second season (and more cash, lol). It has a more connected story which makes it more exciting once you finished an episode! So I definetly recommend it.\r\nFor all those who didn't watch the first season,I also recommend it but first of course start with the first season then ^^. This anime contains like all the stuff I like when it comes to romance/school life animes. First of all, Hikigaya Hachiman, our MC, isn't like your typical MC you know from these kind of animes (the guy who always stands around and stares out of the window and still gets all the chicks...), cause this guy has attitude. Our man is capable of dissing others and pointing out their little flaws and he does that in a somewhat hilarious way. Being honest, therefore he is also hated by almost all the other characters. Inner monologues are very often in this anime which mostly are really funny but somethings reaaally deep. For sure one of my favorite male characters.\\n\r\nSecond of all, many characters and side characters are introduced throughout the story, making the story and the dialogues very diverse. Many male characters other than the MC also play a significant role in the story and (thank god...) not all female characters are in love with the MC.\\n\r\nAother point is that various places other than the school are set as meeting locations in the anime, making it more refreshing and diverse.\\n\r\nAlso, the characters almost always act reasonable, not like in some romance animes where the females suddenly act like cold b****es or cry or run away because the MC talked to another living being. \\n\r\nAt last the characters (especially the female in the second season) are animated very very well, well you'll see when u watch it. \\n\\n\r\nMy Scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9/10\\n\r\nNice story, nice character development, deep plot in the middle of the story, bit complex in my opinion but still superb!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nScenery and character design was perfect, no more room for improvement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/7 \\n\r\nWell unless its a music anime, sound was always a bit unimportant for me but the Intro song is nice\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I already said, love the characters and especially love Yukino (like cats like friskies!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAlways has a steady curve in terms of funniness and never gets boring!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of my favorite anime indeed, and watch the OVA, you won't regret it ;)\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helped, and I hope you have fun while watching this :)!",

            "content": "I have to admit that the first season of OreGairu wasn't really what I was expecting when I read the synopsis and completed the anime. However, it had a certain charm/quirkness that the second season lacked. That doesn't mean this season isn't funny or entertaining. No! In fact, I much prefer this second season for being imho an upgrade in basically every way.\r\nCharacters:\r\nI'm pretty sure everyone knows this already but being a rom-com, good characters are a must to be able to pull off chemistry. OreGairu Zoku enhances all the personality of our cast and brights in all to light on this second season.\r\nThe finalepisode fully confirmed and made for a perfect cliffhanger. It personified all the main characters traits and thankfully did not went OoC in order to get a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is what I was talking about in my first paragraph. The first season's art while very lacking visually protruded a certain charm that endeared me to the Service Club's antics. Zoku however was able to use its much better visuals in order to show us more nuanced expressions with fuller depth of emotion especially in the characters' smiles which conveyed a well of deep-seated emotions that really made me feel for them.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI really didn't feel the soundtrack and in my eyes that was alright. Zoku did not need melodic tunes to amplify a scene because it was already good though good music could make some scenes be better executed. The OP and ED were fantastic actually. The visuals that came with it were very good and offered some cool shots.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSome people might complain that OreGairu has forced drama. Those people are completely wrong. I guess that some characters kinda seem to have backstories that you know will cause drama in some future arcplot. For the most part though, every single character is indistinguishable from a normal person. This makes the story seem very real and not some kind of soap opera.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime looks to be catered to loner people however that is just not the case. If you're looking for a superior rom-com which shows how people would actually behave like in real life then watch OreGairu. Be warned however, once you start, you'll binge through the end and be left wondering if the author would actually finish this novel because it seems like he doesn't know how to end this without upsetting a huge portion of his fanbase. -)",

            "content": "Hopefully, if you're reading this, you read the review I made for the first season. To summarize, while season 1 was really good... Season 2 is far, far better. And here's why.\r\nStory: I found season 2 of Oregaru to be a lot deeper than the first season. Season 1 had deep moments for sure, but season 2 really delves into many characters' personalities - their best traits and their worst traits. The storytelling improved quite a bit, too, and it really actually started feeling like it was a romantic comedy... \r\nArt: Right here is the biggest difference. I wrote this review after watching the seriesa second time, and somehow, the first time I watched both seasons I never noticed this... Season 2's art improved drastically. Almost as if it had new artists or something. Each character's features, especially Hikigaya's, are far more detailed than they were before. A good example would be Hikigaya's hair and eyes. He actually looks like a human being now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Even the sound improved a lot in the second season. Don't assume that I think that season one had bad qualities, because it was great, it's just that season 2 is that much better all around. I'm fairly certain various characters, including Hikigaya, have new voice actors. Hiki's new voice actor definitely portrays the pessimistic personality perfectly. The music's also improved quite a bit, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, season 2 is far better than season 1. I love the show as a whole, natural, and obviously wouldn't recommend just skimming through season 1 or anything. You need to watch the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd please, please join me in prayer. Pray that we'll get a season 3 soon. God, I hope we get a season 3.",

            "content": "Started Oregairu because of the romantic comedy that you were expecting? Good for you. Snarky Hachiman and his interactions with everything around him was indeed enjoyable to watch in the light-hearted comedy with a little bit of romance in the first season.\r\nSay goodbye to that to Zoku though. If you want comedy, don't watch this. It's pretty much Charlotte all over again. Basically, it's the drama of dealing with the frustrations of reality caused by Hachiman's personality.\r\nThe plot is frustrating. Stuff seems like forever to finish, I mean it was probably to increase and sympathize with the frustration of the characters having to deal withthe problem, but it was those that made me drop the anime back then (only finished now because the OVA came out).\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the characters in the first season got sidelined or outright almost removed. The more interesting ones that gave life to the anime's first season are basically nowhere to be found in this one. Instead we get focus with the more frustrating characters, old and new. The new girl is great though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and the relationship between the main cast are great, but the romance... There's a lot of damned teases but without much progress. I mean with a title like that you'd expect romance though... Instead you get the problems of the realities of life and all that stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was great as a conclusion for the second season, but it was also not well done. It totally doesn't seem like a finale. After the frustration of watching the season with the disapppointment of it being different from the first season's tone... At the very least you'd expect to get a great ending, or a cliffhanger for the third one, but you get neither of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as someone who liked the light-hearted comedy of the first season, the second was just a disappointment for me. It has Hachiman's snarkiness, but instead of the comedy it causes with his interactions with people, it's now the negativity that it brings that's here.",

We gain a lot more insight into the 3 main characters, plus others like Hayato, Haruno, Shizuka, and Iroha.\r\nThe change in the artwork is noticeable but not distracting. It comes down to personal taste, but I enjoyed both season 1 and this season.\r\nThe only real problem is the plot- there's so much where they just go to meetings to plan events. We get to see some character development through that, but they really should've done better.\r\nThe banter between Yukino and Hikigaya is also greatly reducedwhich is a shame.",

            "content": "Oregairu series is the only one series that deserves a 10 based on romantic comedy genre, in my opinion. Here I will share my thoughts with you.\r\nThis is a story about Konibyo. Why is it called \"Konibyo\"\uff1fIt's because at this period, our views of world, value and philosophy are different from the self-expansion during the Chunibyo period. Instead,they are based on your real experience. These experiences constantly strengthen certain opinions in your heart, or we even consider these experiences as our belief of life. However, someday, you suddenly find the belief is wrong, and there is something that your belief can't explain. This kind ofconflict makes you feel tangled and at a loss. This situation is the actual pain of Konibyo.\\n\r\nThe belief of Hachiman are \"people can't truly understand each other\" and \" it's a shame that you personally think yourself knowing other people's thoughts\".\\n\r\nThe belief of Yukino is \"if you want to be successful, then you will have to overcome all the difficulties you meet (her model is her sister)\" and \"it's a shame to escape from the challenges\".\\n\r\nThe belief of Yui is \"in interpersonal communication, harmony is the most precious\" and \"it's a shame to cause conflicts\".\\n\r\nYou will find that their annoyance all come from their previous experiences. They believed certain beliefs, and one day, the belief was suddenly destroyed.\\n\r\nHachiman feels the love from the two girls, it's so sincere, so obvious. But he can't believe that. Because \"it's a shame that you personally think yourself knowing other people's thoughts\". Yukino probably can't manage to do things as well as her sister, but \"it's a shame to escape from the challenges\". Yui suddenly realized that if herself doesn't take an action, then Hachiman will become Yukino's girlfriend, however, \"it's a shame to cause conflicts\". \\n\r\nThey all want to find something genuine. However, the cost of it is that they have to admit the beliefs they previously believed were all fake things. In other words, to admit how stupid they were. It's simply not easy. And that why after Hachiman tell the girls that he wants to find something genuine, he goes home and cries painfully on the sofa. He is thinking \"How could I fucking confess myself in front of the two girls? How could I fucking trust them so much? How could I be so fucking opinionated that thought they could understand me?\" He still doesn't want to admit that the belief he firmly believes is wrong.\\n\r\nIt's very interesting, isn't it? All of us used to think our own beliefs were very correct, very firm. But soon, the world slapped us right on our faces. And we already know our beliefs were wrong. We already know that if we continue to believe it, we are gonna miss important things and people. However, we still don't want to change it. Because how can we admit we were stupid? How can we change our beliefs so easily? We spent years, experienced countless pain, and finally established our beliefs. How can they be wrong?\\n\r\nCan't people truly understand each other? It's probably very difficult, but sometimes, we can really understand each other deeply.\\n\r\nCan't people escape from the challenges? You probably will get stronger if you don't escape from the challenges, but is that what you want?\\n\r\nIs it important to not cause conflicts? It might be good, but there are something we just can't give up.\\n\r\nThe world is complicated. The people are complicated as well. So annoying! However, if we use simple cogitation to consider the society and the people around you, then you will simply get the wrong conclusion. Admit our mistakes, admit the compliance of the world, admit everything is possible to happen, then we will truly grow up.\\n\r\nAnd Oregairu is the story of young people struggling to grow up.\\n\r\nReally, Oregairu is the only masterpiece of school anime I ever seen. Watari Wataru is a master.\\n\r\nDo you agree with me?",

            "content": "Not only could i relate so much with this anime but it also helped me develop my mental thinking along with making me more considerate and understanding in my day to day life.This anime definitely had a unique aura to it as its not what you would expect from a typical romcom anime based on highschool lives.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nAs of now i am someone who doesnt watch an anime based on how amazing its story was, tho obviously i wouldnt watch it if its horrible, so i didnt focus much on the storyline of the anime but if i had to judge it i would say itwas pretty decent and interesting as we followed the continuation of the voluntary club helping their school members along with fighting agaisnt their own problems and desires.If you are someone who watches anime solely on the bases of the storyline then i honestly dont think so you will find this anime anything amazing or a masterpiece in that sense but you could still give it a try.\\n\r\nArt and Animation:10/10\\n\r\nSo the animation was a HUGE step up from the previous season as the character's art and design looked so much more smooth and beautiful.What's more is that character's body movement and emotional expressions perfectly synched in along with the timing and pacing.In my opinion i would regard the animation as one of my fav of all time as it was really soothing just to watch the characters and as this anime has a tendency of putting in a lot of emphasis on character expressions the studio handled it perfectly.\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here other than that they used some of the previous seasons ost which perfectly synched in with the atmosphere and also lined up perfectly with the timing of the incident.\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nThis is the part were the anime takes it all for me.I would regard oregairu's character and character development as my all time fav since i have yet to see an anime where they outstand oregairu's character development or characters for that.The characters which i am specifically referring to are hikigaya and yukino.As someone who had a somewhat of a same outlook on society as hikigaya i was able to understand why he acted the way he did in some of the incidents.Hikigaya proved that its not always good to be popular/outstanding in life as that could backfire on you.In fact he even proved that people who like to stand out in society usually have to lie to themselves which ends up turning lying for them  as normal as breathing.I for one can agree with this as i witnessed this first hand.In my school everyone wanted to make themselves look like they were above others and werent ready to accept defeat when they were wrong.They would always regard those who didnt talk much in class as 'dumb' and 'non-attentive kids' who were to be used as pawns for their own benefits.And yes as you might have guessed it i was the most silent kid in my class so i was subjected to this a lot.90% of the times they would try to keep a good image of themselves infront of me to have an impression that they were better than me in life. leaving me alone,they would even lie to their own peers of being some kind of perfectionist.For this reason i never wanted to befriend them and would always stay away from them as one could define them as 'hypocrites'.\\n\r\nSince the start for school i never was good at studies and would usually be in the top 5 lowest achievers however this changed when i got into highschool.As i developed an interest in studies due to certain reasons i become one of the best in academics and those who previously held this title werent ready to accept this.I was subjected to bullying and would usually be called a nerd or 'someone who studies for 24/7' for this reasons as i didnt have many friends so i would usually be seen studying or reading a book.So i pretty much understood yukino's point of view and not to mention that i had very limited interest and was somene who couldnt get along with others so my parents would force me to change that attitude which wasnt something i wanted to do as i preferred being alone.To sum it up the characters of oregairu are amazing and one could relate with them.The way the character development was handled was by far the best i have seen in any anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nAs someone who watches an anime on the bases of how enjoyable it is (and arguably its animation) i could say this with certainty that oregairu was really enjoyable.The comedy was straight up funny and savage.Along with that were also some heart soothing scenes which relieved me of all my worries and kept me wanting to watch more of it.\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nOregairu would definately be classified as one of my fav anime of all time tho if i had to give some cons it would be that the ending was a cliffhanger and at the time of writing this we shouldnt expect a s3 anytime soon(Actually their are chances of it not at all having a s3 since 3 volumes wouldnt result in much content).Also those who have yet to attend highschool or have graduated from highschool might find it boring and lame.",

            "content": "I like this series.  I think it created an interesting situation between a trio of students who complement each other well.  Unfortunately, I think the writing dropped the ball.\r\nRight off the bat, the second season of this show is noticeably smooth and stunning, with a really catchy art style.  It almost feels wasted though.  So much of the show is fairly slow-paced and conversational, that if seems like Feel would better spend their time doing something a bit flashier.  Still, there are some moments that really take full advantage of the high production values.\r\nThe story is really pretty lackluster thisseason.  Much of the season has the main three characters separated from each other, which isn't bad by itself, but they're not really doing anything in that time either.  Conflict happens between characters in almost imperceptible ways, and conversations are so thick with obfuscated implications that it's a struggle to even follow what on earth everyone is so upset and conflicted about.  There are a few scenes where someone's crying and the other two wide-eyed and stunned, and it's not very clear what any of it is about.  The scenes still work, even though they really shouldn't, simply because the production values are good enough to make you feel sad without really knowing why.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of the vague conversations makes the characters especially opaque.  Aside from the main three opening up a bit, you don't really learn much of anything about anyone, and it's hard to see character growth happening.  One side character seems to go well out of his way to support the protagonist early on, then becomes his enemy without very clear motivates, aside from declaring \"I'm not a good person\".  Yukino's older sister seems to exist for the sole purpose of antagonizing Yukino at every available opportunity, yet the viewer gets no justification for this behavior.  Overall, it feels like the writers are afraid to let the plot move somewhere, or to establish anything concrete.  Instead, the story is just sluggishly trudging along in circles. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to see another season of this, but only if the writing improves.  I enjoyed the time I was watching it, but the show didn't hold up well upon reflection.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve learned a lot from the people who never existed.\r\nHikigaya Hachiman, is an apathetic high school student with narcissistic and semi-nihilistic tendencies. He firmly believes that joyful youth is nothing but a farce, and everyone who says otherwise is just lying to themselves. \r\nAnd this Hachiman changes my way of seeing the world. He\u2019s an apathetic high school student, and at the same time he\u2019s still a normal human being just like the other. He desires  something deep down in his heart, he hate being deceived, he want something genuine. He\u2019s fine being hated as long that\u2019s what people really felt about him. I\u2019vereally learned a lot from him.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve just finished this show recently, even though I had finished the first season long time ago. I didn\u2019t read the novel of this show, so I can\u2019t tell whether the anime\u2019s plot of this show was lacking from the novel or not. But for me, this second season of Oregairu is just great. It\u2019s way too great than my expectation. Even though I didn\u2019t mean that the first season\u2019s not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu first season and Oregairu second season have a different focus. In the first season, the anime was just focusing on the way Hachiman\u2019s solve cases. Hachiman's epic way of thinking and see the world from his perspective. With a slice of comedy and few drama that could makes us enjoy the first season so much.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, I never expect the second season would turn into a serious drama anime. The second season has fewer cases, and comedy. And the second season is more focus to the plot story. In this second season Hachiman changes everyone near them, Yukino, Yui, Iroha, Hayato, and he even changes himself. It\u2019s way too different from the first season, though this show became even better than before.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the second season just gave us few cases that Hachiman solves. It still makes me satisfied, the way Hachiman solved the cases still as great at the first season (especially Ebina Hina case). And that case leads us to the plot of this show. I won\u2019t spoil any further so you still could enjoy this show as I am.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art quite different with the first season, because the whole staff of Oregairu changed in this second season. But that wasn\u2019t so bad, because for me Yukino looks cute in this second season when in the first season she looks so cool. \\n\r\nAnd for me Hachiman in the second season looks more handsome and cool. His eye is bigger in this season when in the first season his eyes look like dead fish. At first I think it was a horrible change for Hachiman, until I realize it wasn\u2019t that bad because the intensity of the drama in the second season.\\n\r\nAnd I love Yuigahama Yui from the first season. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me or not. Yui looks more adorable for me in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good, I\u2019m glad they keep Yanagi Nagi, and Yui Ballade as the singer of the opening and ending theme even though they changed the whole staff of Oregairu. I really enjoy this series, and I didn\u2019t think that the changed staff would ruin some anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe character, In this second season there\u2019s some new character that never mentioned in the first season. And I don\u2019t think additional character like Iroha is needed in this season. Because even though someone else replaced her role, it\u2019s no big deal  at all. Example, if Iroha\u2019s role taken by Ebina Hina. The story would be fine, and they didn\u2019t have to add a new character out of the blue.\\n\r\nAnd the other character is Orimoto Kaori. Not like Iroha, Kaori still has a relationship with the main character so it\u2019s fine for adding her in the second season.\\n\r\nThe rest of the character was great, especially the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is just simply great. I highly recommend it to all of you. If you watched the first season then you absolutely have to watch this second season. And if you haven\u2019t watched the first season then you must to watch it, and continue to the second season. And after you watched the whole season you might be the one who will wait the third season just like me. *Even though I don\u2019t think there would be a third season\\n",

            "content": "Now, I have done a review on Season 1 of Oregairu, and I gave it a good score. This will be no different, as the scores are different, but some have their own reason. \r\nStory - 7\r\nThe second season takes off after the end of the festival arc, where he becomes a sacrificial lamb and helps everyone. With the continuation of exploring the relationship with the 2 main girls, whilst having a more heavier drop of romance then it did in first season. Now, for the first season, I gave a high score than this was because although the plot was repetitive, with the clubsolving issues from others while fixing their own, it still was enjoyable to watch because of the comedy it had with the club's interactions. This season however, focused more romance then comedy, which was one of it's strong points. It was one of the reasons why I had enjoyed the show so much. The romance was sure there more then it was in the first season and it was a little nice for the author to give that like I wanted, but with the cost of it's one of it's biggest assets? The romance was also not as enjoyable as I thought, as the characters had less of the interactions in this series, which had urked me. It was also more vague and harder to understand what each character was thinking, and the amount of exposition given did not suit the series, as the comedy elements had been drained, only having what seemed to be 3 episodes worth of comedy. I enjoyed the more vagueness of the characters, but sometimes, it was hard to figure out what they are saying, I had to watch it a few times over or had to ask other people what he/she meant, that slightly put me off.  That is why the Story in this series gets a lower score. The cliffhanger of an ending, with the series ending so abruptly did irritate me quite a lot, but within due reason because of the lack of source material, that I had over come quickly. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nI am not sure why I gave the series a 9 instead of an 8, then it would've been more clearer as to why I gave them the same score. The second season's art style, made my Studio Feel, previously by Brains Base was a good idea, as they improved the art style, color and animation that was not exactly Unlimited Budget Works like, but it was excellently in contrast to Brains Base which had just got the work done. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this series was great, not only adding from the previous season, but adding new ones into the new series. There is even piano version of 'Hello Alone Ballad' that was greatly implemented during a scene with Yui that was done really well. The Opening 'Harumodoki' was also a great way the introduce us back into the series, thanks to the job of Nagi Yanagi, who also sang the previous OP in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe character are still there, and I cannot say much more but I will try my best.\\n\r\nIn comparison to Season 1, I didn't slightly enjoy it as much as I thought I would, with the characters developing more, more screen time with the side characters that everyone liked, and just more comedic moments to witness alongside Hikigaya, to which who were, may be disappointed. As said previously, the comedy in this season has switched around with the romance, with the comedy being more the underlying part and the romance being more prominent, which I did hope for a little more of, wasn't as done as well as I thought. The characters also did not evolve as much as I thought, although they did explore more and did bring out more of Hikigaya's personaility, which was good, but his witty banter and pessimistic thoughts on society were replaced with exposition and his thoughts about the girls. But, the characters did turn out more realistic then before, as they had become more realistic, and their intentions were more humane, as you get to see more of the underlying mask of each character, including Yui, Hayama and Yukino. It made me go back to that scene and think about what they were thinking, which is ambiguous throughout the series, which may or may not what the auidences want. I personally liked it however, with the characters turning out more humane, more dark, and more weaker than I thought, which fleshes out the character more. My thoughts stay generally the same about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it as much as I did with Season 1, with maybe with the anime being more ambiguous, the comedy wasn't as there as much in Season 1, or the characters chemistry meshing together had not what it was in Season 1, but it still did made me come back for me, and even me watching the episode again to understand the characters, which was what I had done previously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nThe series still holds a place in my heart, both seasons having their own flaws and strengths, but no matter what, they remain as one of my favorite seasons to watch, and I would take Season 3 into open arms.",

            "content": "So, this is going to be a weird review, and it's going to read more like a stream of consciousness, but it's the only way i can think of to convey my thoughts on this show. If you want to skip down to my final summation, just ctrl-f search for \"tl;dr\".\r\nI'm going to preface this by saying part of the reason this show is so highly rated by me is because it hits so squarely in my wheelhouse. For those whom this is not the case, i would not blame them for loathing this show. This is a biased, subjective review (as are all reviews).\\n\\n\r\nBut still, there's something here. Something strong and weighty and I can't help but keep turning it over and over in my mind because it keeps sticking with me. \\n\\n\r\nThe three central protagonists of this show are desperate for intimacy, for a connection, for something real and meaningful, but they're not sure what that means. They're desperate for a connection but they don't know how to say that, and then when there's something there, something real and potentially strong, they are afraid to act and ruin what they have. Or what they think they have. Or what they know they don't have but want to pretend they do. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does something incredibly interesting, by acknowledging, through subtext, that each of the characters knows the state of their relationships and what is distancing them. Hikigaya understands, despite his self-loathing and self-doubt, that there's something that Yui feels for him. and that Yukino feels something for him as well. And that he has emotional connections to both of them, and that he can't quite navigate how he feels about he two of them, but there's something there that will inherently change the relationships established in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nOr rather, it already has. A large part of this season is dedicated to the acknowledgement that things are not as they seemed to be in the first season; it's a deconstruction of those relationships and how trying to continue on, maintaining the status quo is false and dishonest. The characters eventually slip back into their mannerisms from the first season- teasing one another, clever word play and insults, but there are these hesitations that make it clear there's something else that needs to be said. Or wants to be said. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show where every character is desperately searching for the words to say something, anything, and half of the meaning is in finding the subtext, recognizing the things they don't say, the things they can't understand. \\n\\n\r\nI'll restrain myself from writing a full essay on relationships and communication; despite my degree, this is not the place for that. Instead, what I'll say is that this show manages to take it's time and explore the ways in which we communicate beyond the verbal, beyond explicit declarations, and the ways that selfishness and kindness can blur into one another. \\n\\n\r\nIt's ambitious in its ambiguity, willing to let that be part of its weight. I hope there's a third season, really, I do. But if it were to end here, I think there's something powerful and interesting here. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr- This is a show that is full of ambiguity, complex relationships, and struggles navigating them and communication. If you're looking for something with a definite ending, with clear final relationships, with a happy ever after, this is not the show for you. If you're looking for something rough and perhaps unpolished but interesting and complicated, this is a show worth looking at. It will give back what you're willing to put into it, even if it won't rest easy in the pit of your stomach. \\n\\n\r\nIf the first season was more comparable the less masturbatory, more comedic parts of Bakemonogatari, then this season is closer to the parts lightly brushed on in Bakemonogatari- those rough, complex, and genuine relationships. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a 9 out of 10, if we're ascribing numbers to it, but I feel weird doing so; that means nothing to anyone else but myself, and even then, only myself in this precise moment. Take that as you will. If nothing else, I do recommend this show, but I understand if you don't enjoy it. There's a scene that's simply 15 minutes of a single meeting. A lot of times, 'nothing really happens' because all that's happening is people talking. But that's where we see these relationships play out, because it's a show all about talking, and not talking. This is something i loved, but definitely not for everyone.",

The technical (sort of like philosophical) approach to understanding life is what makes this anime stand out.\r\nHe's a guy who knows how life works. He knows how to solve problems alone by hurting himself. Because he's a nobody, no one would lose anything if he solves a problem by becoming an enemy. And trust me, the story is so touching because a couple of lovely girls DO lose something when he hurts himself.\r\nHe might sitin a corner and avoid interaction, but he's more smart than most other people of his class. The best thing about this anime is that you'll learn a lot. The romance finally makes its appearance in this second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very beautiful and thoroughly, extremely realistic. Hikki, in fact, is one of the finest characters ever crafted for a romantic, realistic slice of life anime.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN MY RATING* \r\nBased on the MAL rating system,\r\nStory: 9\r\nArt: 7\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nOverall: 9\r\nBased on my personal rating system, my overall rating is: 8.64\r\n\"Think, writhe, struggle, and agonize. If not, what you're going through isn't genuine.\"\r\nThis anime has to be one of the most serious non-serious stories that I have experienced. The second season continues with the adventures of Hikigaya and crew, solving the problems of fellow students who come to them for help.\r\nThe first season can be described as the build-up for the crux of the story as told in the second season. Each member ofthe service club deals with problems in their own ways, leading to both conflict and accomplishment; failure and success; questions and answers. \\n\\n\r\n\"There's stuff others won't get unless you say it out loud.\"\\n\\n\r\nYui challenges Yukino and Hachiman to talk about and discuss their feelings more. While it is true that it is hard to understand people without speaking up, it is also true that we might not be able to completely understand somebody just because they told us about how they feel. Is it the height of arrogance to try to say you understand how somebody feels, or a kind expression of compassion? Even if we could understand how somebody feels, is it possible to measure the extent and intensity of those feelings? \\n\\n\r\n\"You kept talking as if nothing was wrong.\"\\n\\n\r\nYukino challenges Yui, using Yui's own argument against her. Because Yui spoke as if nothing was ever wrong, Yukino was willing to sacrifice her own feelings in order to uphold the facade that she thought Hachiman and Yui wanted. \"So I thought if that's what you both wanted...\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Sometimes you can't get through to people even if you spell it out.\"\\n\\n\r\nHachiman is challenged by the problem of always trying to understand people by reading between the lines and psycho-analyzing them, but never being able to do so. He understands this and feels trapped by this, leading to him abandoning his usual tactics of individual social suicide in an attempt to achieve something greater. If you want the real thing when it comes to relationships, you have to be prepared for adversity and to sometimes hurt the ones you love and care about. \"Think, writhe, struggle, and agonize. If not, what you're going through isn't genuine.\" And so Hachiman wishes for something genuine and asks for the help of Yukino and Yui.\\n\\n\r\n\"I want it all.\"\\n\\n\r\nWith some characters being ashamed of their past, and other characters being anxious about the future -- and still some other characters feeling both shame of the past and anxiousness about the future -- seizing the present for all of the value that it is worth is important. Things are going to change. People grow and mold into different human beings as the present evolves into the future. With all of the characters going to change and with the future uncertain, where do the feelings of the girls towards Hachiman stand? Will the friendship of the group last forever?\\n\\n\r\nThese are some of the questions that were on Yui's mind when she attempts to confront the Service Club about another unspoken issue that each member faces: Love, friendship, the present, the future, and how all of these interconnect. Is it possible for Yui to have it all, or for Yukino to have it all, viz. one girl having a romantic relationship with Hachiman while at the same time being really good friends with the other girl and the integrity of the club undamaged? Is such a thing achievable, let alone possible? \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters seem to think that it is not, but might act on this in different ways. \\n\\n\r\n\"She just didn't say one specific thing. If she said it out loud, that would set it in stone.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat would happen if you were put into a position where you had to make a choice about not only an immensely personal and sensitive topic, but also on an issue in which you have not completely reconciled your feelings? If you were forced to explain how you feel, but weren't completely sure how to put your feelings into words, wouldn't the end results be something artificial? If one is unable to face themselves when it comes to their feelings, facing other people with those feelings would necessarily lead to something being conveyed that is very different from what you feel and might actually think on a deeper level.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is put into such a position, and just like when she was willing to sacrifice her feelings for the Service Club earlier, she is prepared to suffer a blow that would inevitably damage her relationship with either Yui, Hachiman, or both.\\n\\n\r\n\"If I chose something because I had no other choice, I couldn't call it my own decision.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe words of Hayato resonate with Hachiman and his experiences, leading to him saving Yukino from having to make a choice that she was not ready to make. If Yukino had either set aside her emotions or tried to elaborate on emotions that she was unable to face, what would have been conveyed would not have been real. \\n\\n\r\n\"Even so, I want us to think, writhe, struggle, and find...\" - something genuine. For Yukino to find something genuine out of her own feelings, she, too, needs to think about them and struggle with them and make her own decisions when the time is right for her. \"I don't want any vague answers or superficial relationships.\"\\n\\n\r\nAs a tear rolls down Yui's face and meets her smile, Yukino affirms that \"this is not the final anything\" and promises to carry out Hachiman's request for genuineness, in which Yui happily agrees with.\\n\\n\r\nYukino offers a request of her own to the Service Club, which is left to the audience's imagination until the next light novel is eventually released. While the ending contained a light cliffhanger, it can also be considered satisfactory since the crux of the story can be deduced with a little thought. Although it is disappointing to not see where the characters would eventually end up, it can also add to the beauty of the story if you pay close enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very good and the coloring on the art was wonderful, but I think the characters and story are the highlights that deserve the most examination. The show is also a great comedy between the range of characters and their various dynamics, but an outsider looking in might not have guessed that solely reading this review. Hence the claim, this anime has to be one of the most serious non-serious stories that I have experienced. It was highly enjoyable and well-worth my time. I look forward to purchasing the next light novel whenever it is released, with fingers crossed for a movie that resolves Yukino's request and offers more conclusion relating to where the characters end up.",

            "content": "I'm gonna try to simplify my opinions and critiques since there are already plenty of reviews that go far more in depth. So much so that I decided to type up my own rather than read them lol \r\nCharacters/Cast: \r\n1) The discussions between teens is unnatural at times. It's like they met that one Student President and now they can't STOP pretending to know wtf they're saying or should do; \r\n2) There was very little depth to any of the established cast. S1 got away with it because of the tone it carried, but S2 decided to go a different tone towards the end. Thismeant the lack of further character intel beyond one tidbit per main character made any drama pointless and hard to be invested in; and \\n\r\n3) As much as I love Isshiki, there was zero point to adding her. Her addition was mostly unnecessary and wound up creating events that didn't have to happen or felt prolonged. I get it, it's a new season and they gotta keep the novels interesting ... but it completely made no difference whether she existed or not. Her entire being felt forced FAR beyond her dang public facade. \\n\\n\r\nWriting/Story: \\n\r\n1) The unrealistic dialogue was immensely worse in S2, and hardly existing in S1. I'm unsure whether that's the writer's fault or the anime staff's, but it's something that should've been at least touched-up on some; \\n\r\n2) The alluding was amazing. At times, it felt \"absent\" of something. But I'm pretty sure it was because it was likely trying a tad too hard to foreshadow themes and events. But in hindsight, pretty much everything the main cast encountered in the season led them to think differently. At least be able to see another perspective; and \\n\r\n3) It was a clusterbomb towards the end of the second season. Time was moving steadily, then suddenly, V-Day lasts ten years. This not only messed with the flow of the story, but it forced all this drama unto the end of a final season. It's seriously a waste for a series that managed two whole seasons. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: \\n\r\n1) I'm not super picky about sound and music. But the sfx was insanely loud. Hachiman's bike sounds like it's in both your ears and nearly as loud as the those speaking quite loud, Komachi's footsteps fading out but sounding far too inhuman to be her stomping on (likely) hardwood floors without wearing hard soles. It was distracting. Music was fine and suited things well enough so I pretty much paid no heed to it; and \\n\r\n2) The drawing and animation in general are tons better in S2. My main issue is the eyes became less emotive. While I prefer the style, suddenly their lines no longer reflected their eyes. S1 was just that much more expressive with them. And, yes, it bugged me every single scene in which there was emotion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\n1) Okay, so I really like things in which there is a proper overarching theme. And where at LEAST the main character is seriously established to whoever's writing them. Even if the writing failed the characters, it's very clear that Hachiman never steered off of the sort of person he is. Even as he grew as a person (albeit hardly); \\n\r\n2) I appreciated that not everything was spelled-out. But at the same time, I despised the writing in which literally nothing is. Oh, X has a crush on A. And now Y has a crush on A! Wait, who else is crushing on A!? ... So regardless of crushes etc, S2 failed completely in making a simple arc of this kinda theme actually matter whereas S1 achieved it as if effortlessly; and \\n\r\n3) idk, I've honestly experienced far worse shows. This story at least TRIED to tell a story - tho it failed hard in at least one core aspect - and there was no caving. There pretty much wasn't any proper resolution made despite all the drama effect towards the end, but at the same time, it didn't change the characters needlessly in order to create a tone shift for it. It's just a shame I wasn't able to care about even that. Beyond being peeved.",

            "content": "This is not fully spoiler free.\r\nNo, just no. Zoku has been nothing but a chore to watch because of my love for the first season. For the first season I had no expectation at all to it, thus with my expectation already lowered for Zoku when I had to put it on-hold, yet coming back to find myself enjoying it even less. \r\nI felt like I could be bias now for hating on Zoku and some will probably think I am. Therefore my biased score: 4, with two episode of the season in which I could enjoy, being the last episode and Ebina's speech. \r\nIreally don't know what the reason for my  this is but I have a few theories;\\n\\n\r\na) Brain's Base misinterpreted Oregairu thus me having wrong image of what Oregairu really is.\\n\r\nb) Studio feel. having reading issues and lack human behavior understanding. (Or me being the one who's wrong.)\\n\r\nc) The LN author decided, \"NOPE, let's not have a good progress because I lack social skill just like Hikki\".\\n\r\nd) I'm a bitch.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nStory, 6:\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair I have not read/seen many of SOL+comedy genre but from the most I've seen, they're mostly mediocre, with the only thing keeping it interesting is its exaggerated characters. There are gems out there in which succeeded its genre that I would like to take up. Although I will only end up side tracking (plus not well rounded with this genre enough to pull a good example). \\n\\n\r\nSo I'll use the first season to compare it with. The writing in this story was a mess, it's as if the author does not know what to do with the character. There are elements that has such a potential, with Ebina's and Tobe's situation. Ebina's will was sort of unique and showed somewhat originality in the show. The thought of Hikki's wish and how the upcoming situation will help him realize it was so 10/10 until they dropped it to only come up in the last 2 episodes, which was mention like 4 times. \\n\\n\r\nWhy would Hikki want something \"genuine\" when he thinks of it like once a year? Was \"genuine\" even a thing he wanted?\\n\r\nIt's like playing a game in which an idiot decides to only do the side task and never finish the story. Remaining in the same town wondering why the game sucks. Now to the characters side of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 6:\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to give it a higher score due to its well thought out character. They're all anime trophies, sad to say, yet they were all thought out and give enough presence of a person who actually exist. BUT, Zoku has failed me on this one. The new character was not \"exploited\" well. A person evolves all the time more or less, maybe even evolving back. We all have time when we retreat. Yet, where is my explaination on Hikki actually becoming more quiet? First season with Yukinon surprised that our boi, Hachiman is actually more chatty than she thought. He snaps people with his harsh comments, people be hating but Hikki is still proud of his voice. \\n\\n\r\nIn Zoku, I get that after an event in which people would be disappointed in him would lead in to be more quiet. When he talked was as if he was forced to talk. Yet he spends time a with a lot of chatty people as if he was forced to. As if it's not a big deal, whom I hang out with doesn't change me, only conflict does... In Zoku's case? By marginal. The first season's conflicts outcome was handled good enough to not be considered dumb.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all Zoku shows is these teenager staggering and wavering like idiots for THIRTEEN episodes, WHOLE FKING SEASON. The conflicts are just side task! The real plot here are finding out what \"genuine\" is. Just kidding! That's also a side task, the real one being collecting a harem. (With Totsuka as best gal)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end all Hikki wanted was just to be truth to himself and be a kind person whom he is. I just don't know why the author just don't add more interaction between the characters instead of side quest. This is when my hopes went down and me hurling up inside, whenever I try to watch the show. The other characters could have pulled out so much from him and him moving them along. Yet, requiring an kouhai in which fits all the statement he hated about Yuki's sister or was at least bothered by. He just somehow came over it.\\n\r\n As I said all staggering and wavering...\\n\\n\r\nArt, 5:\\n\\n\r\nFrom the production value it's fair. From the story's point of view it's decent. From my point of view? It can suck duck all day long. \\n\r\nIt remind me to 70% of the time of a harem. This is a second point in which made me want to hurl. The glossy and light air-ish contrast our boi in so many ways. The directing value fell. The first season had good more or less, that's why people could stand it but no matter how fancy the art looks like if it's handled bad, it's bad. It couldn't choose whom to focus on and details it chose to focus on was so bad that I couldn't even read between the line or interpreted it myself. \\n\\n\r\n\"Here's Yuki flinching! She's feeling bad!\"\\n\r\n\"Here's Yui flinching! She's feeling bad!\"\\n\r\n\"Here's Hikki flinching! He's feeling bad!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd when these are shown, they're shown all over the screen, nothing subtle and definitely not realistic. Yuki as a stoic character to flinch as visible as a scared cat. And the animation except the mouth was really not fit to the character. It felt awkward and less to the character trophies they are. There is much character one would draw out yet there is so little being presence in them through out. The girls are glimmering while boys (except Totsuka) was dull. If that is how Hikki sees it then it's understandable but what's with the overly soft fluffly world? Is that how Hikki see's it? Someone explain, I might be a retard.\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack not being the best but at least it delivered to its style!\\n\r\nDidn't liked any of them. But hey if you did I rated 5 for you! (Anyways the first seasons was a bit better, some was catchy and fitted its art style a lot.)\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's like playing a game in which an idiot decides to only do the side task and never finish the story. Remaining in the same town wondering why the game sucks.\\n\r\nCharacter: Teenager staggering and wavering for THIRTEEN episodes, THE WHOLE SEASON.\\n\r\nArt: Art and animation value is decent but frame and directing made me hurl. Not the worst, I'm just bias cause I like first season.\\n\r\nSound: Good enough.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it?? XdXDxDDD \\n\r\nNO. I just wanted to rant I guess...sorry for the grammatical wrong if there are.\\n\\n\r\nYuixYuki 4 lyfe, (+I wanna see more Ebina and Hachiman tho)",

Though the anime was very well made and thought out, it kinda stayed in the shadow of the first season.\r\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVED the character progression and how they exposed the characters to different situations to further develop them. \r\nThough there was a point where things started to get outta control and left my head spinning. Even up to now i don't understand the ending and I still hope for a next season.\r\nBut overall it was a very good season and i definitely recommend you towatch",

It makes me think about things that are hard for me to think about and think about things I haven\u2019t really given much thought to.

Hachiman is basically like the first season this person who is a loner and doesnt want any interaction over the course of the season he does tend to open up. Yui is honestly the exact same as season 1 shes a happy and go lucky girl honestly read my review of season 1 than you understand her more. Yukino is basically a almost same loner  as Hachiman and also most like him she really starts to open up more in this season compared to last all the characters (main wise) really improved from last\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: now yes i did enjoy this more than last season the comedy was better cause too me last season had none of that drama was so better than last season and the romance was better glad they had it out more than just having it hide away\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ill give this a 8 yes i so loved this season more compared to last season it was better in so many level the comedy, the drama and also the romance just in every aspect it was better even too the point of even out sighing the first season",

Sadly this show was buried too deep.\r\n Since I'm a big fan of Yahari Ore no Seishun, I will give a sharp criticism not on how good it is, but rather on how good it should've been compared to the first season.\r\nCharacters:\r\n At first, things were flowing into the right direction which was set by the first season, but as I kept going something felt wrong. And when I neared the end I started to wonder, where did the cleverly sarcastic Hikigaya, Hachiman disappear? The one who would always hit the truth. Wheredid the confident sharp tongued Yukinoshita, Yukino? And how did she turn out this way? It's as if the best two characters were replaced out of notice and ruined the main flavor of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n Both the story and the plot were fogy and unclear. The climax left me unconvinced.\\n\r\nThe first two chapters were going great, even better than the first season, but suddenly things turned awkward between the three club members, with no good reason at all. After that everything went down, and the events developments were too sudden and unrealistic. As well as the dialogues became empty and the drama was forced, or you can say, it was over-dramatic for nothing. In general literature, every story must have a plot,  and every plot must end with a conclusion, which I couldn't find any of that at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art & sound:\\n\r\n The art was as good as ever. As for the sound, the characters voice actors are well placed, as well as the opening soundtrack is awesome!\\n\\n\r\n In the end, I still enjoyed the show to some extent, but this disappointment was only because of the high expectation I built after the first season.\\n",

            "content": "Ah SNAFU. I missed you so much. During these 13 weeks I enjoyed this series a lot. It actually improved and got way better than the unexpected personally. But let me get the straight on that the finale left with one thing that really made me feel like it needs a third season. It's a Romantic Comedy show, this season showed something greater. So let's begin with the series review of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU season 2.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story starts off from where we were left off last season, which personally I think it was good that they added that scene to make usremember. The story revolves on our characters facing some bit of problems, in which the story also develops some of our characters as well, including our cynical character Hachiman, or 8man to be called (because Commie subs made something at the end that made me laugh) from an anti-social character, he started to learn bits of things along the way. As the story progresses there were more conflicts around our three cast, which revolves on trying to find a solution to every possible problem they are facing. The story also shows that you cannot do everything on your own, and the consequences of sacrificing yourself to solve an issue. Try to find the solutions to resolve everything in one go and try to find an answer to your issue. Finding the right answer to a path that doesn't affect anyone in a bad way. Unfortunately, the ending of the show wasn't that entirely satisfying, but I'm very fine with how it ended. The thing is though, this show needs a third season right away. Or at some point around.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nLet's just start off with the cast of our characters.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman, we all know and love, and our cynical character, started once again to do things that were kind of a problem revolving around our cast, as the story progressed, he slowly learns his actual mistakes, and tries to also socialize as well. We see him at the second season that he changed more. He became an even more likeable character for me.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita, one of our two female leads, also develops and changes bit by bit as the show progressed. From what I can see, she's the one who disagrees with Hachiman's own methods, she's the sort of the opposite side of what he does. The story progresses and hints our a lot of things that for me were that she's having issues with her sister, in which her sister Haruno stated that she never began to take her own decisions/path in the first place. Learning from this, Yukinonshita tries to break free from this, unfortunately in the end the request she wanted so say, was also apart of the ending. But overall I guess you can see she's learning along the way.\\n\\n\r\nYui, the second girl of the two, participates as well revolving our two characters Yukinoshita and Hachiman. She's the one character that cares about the group greatly, and she wants the three of them together. She even wanted to sacrifice herself in order to maintain their friendship and the club itself, and that's something that I personally like about her. Caring about the club like it was her own family place... its sweet.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, me personally they didn't got that much development but they got them. We see them around at the very least so they don't become very forgettable for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series has been taken over by the one and only Studio Feel, and at first I thought they were actually going to drastically degrade the art/animation for the show because of their fall season's anime series. Unfortunately, I was wrong. They kept the consistencies rather very well done, comparing to the first season's art/animation, this was much better in my opinion. The art is not that level of masterpiece, but they kept the consistencies of the facial expressions and far frames rather very very well.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe other strong part is the music and the sound department. For the music, for the most part me personally are beautifully well made, especially for the emotional parts of the series. The happy ones, the comedic ones, to the depressing ones. For the Opening and the Ending songs, both of them are very well done.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show brought up the most high expected enjoyment among all of the shows from the spring season. That's just a personal thing though. I enjoyed everything from the series. It executed the emotions rather well and smoothly, the comedy is good as well. I like everything from the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nSuggested to watch the second season! It's a very good show, enjoyed it, and love it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Who knew that the second season of SNAFU (Oregairu) could surpass the almighty first season of SNAFU? The second season, is by no means an outstanding and perfect second season due to flaws that simply cannot be ignored but it was very close to being one. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (9/10) (SPOILERS)\r\n\"Comedy aside, Realistic teenage-drama kicks in\"\r\nThis is the second season of \"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO\" created by a new studio called \"Studio Feel\". The second season picks up immediately right after the events of the first season, continuing the adventures of the Service Club. \r\nAt this point, I'm prettysure that most of us were expecting a romantic pay-off because this is the second season and it was the right moment to just show us who's the best girl..In other words, who's the girl Hikki's going to end up with. Unfortunately, that's not the case. It still kinda deals with the members of the Service Club taking requests from other students but there's a difference. A huge difference, in fact. \\n\\n\r\nYou remember the last 3 episodes from the first season (Not including the extra episode.)? Where Hachiman played the role of a villain to help Yukino? The second season basically takes the dark atmosphere of the last 3 episodes of the first season and continues with that same atmosphere. The hilarious moments that you saw in the first half of the first season are reduced to ashes. There are still some funny moments but the amount of drama in this season outweighs the amount of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on from my first paragraph..Like I said, there's a difference. Each requests that comes up is like a story arc and each story arc explores the main characters like Hiki's ideal or Yukino's relationship with her family (especially her bitchy annoying older sister), the issues that they have, the on-going love triangle (which happens in the 2nd half), and etc. I'm going to use the outer/inner layer example again. The outer layer are the requests from the characters. They're like a disguise...How should I put it....An excuse to explore the main characters which is the inner layer of the show...Yea, that's the right explanation. Without the outer layer of the show then the inner layer simply wouldn't exist. You get what I'm saying? \\n\\n\r\nI probably shouldn't have complaint when I said that the previous season movies at a snail pacing because this season's pacing is a bit rushed. It's only a minor issue though. The pacing is not really a big issue because it's not rushed to the point where the show would have time skips and confusing-ass episodes due to rushed explanations or something. \\n\\n\r\nI really have no idea whether I should be extremely mad or be ok with the show's inconclusive ending. In my first paragraph, I said that the show did not have any romantic pay-offs. None of the main characters end up with each other and there's still no \"direct\" confession from the girls or Hikki. I said \"direct\" confession because Yui \"indirectly\" confessed her feelings to Hiki. Though, she said it in a way that isn't too obvious. \\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with inconclusive endings but I do have problems with inconclusive endings when an anime does it. The problem with the anime industry is the producer or the studios barely creates a 3rd Season due to its niche market. Let's say that the show really ends here..Do I have to read the LN just so I can get a conclusive ending? No way in hell..What's worse is the fact that the story is almost over on the source material. Meaning there probably wouldn't be enough episodes for the 3rd Season. I also want to point out that the show ended on the worst possible moment, where the characters are starting to reveal and realize their feelings towards each other. *sigh*. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\n\"Studio Feel giving us the feels\" \\n\\n\r\nI really want to laugh every time I see a person claiming that the first season's animation is better...Please tell me how. The S1's character design looks like it was rushed and the animation looked like an A-1 Picture's anime but slightly worse. Thank god they handed the show to someone else..Someone who can produce a high-quality animation like......like Studio Feel. Studio Feel did an amazing job with the animation, especially the character designs. The character design looks neat, clean, they look more matured, and they all look normally drawn.. Hell, even Hachiman doesn't look like a \"dead fish eye\" person anymore which is great. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, the show's soundtrack are recycled from the first season. Not that I'm complaining or anything..They were great from the start so I'm glad they didn't replace most of them. Now the OP and ED theme song(s).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Harumodoki\" by Nagi Yanagi and the ED theme song is \"Everyday world\" by Yukino and Yui. The ED theme song has 2 variants. First is the Ballade version by Yui and the second one is the Ballade version by Yukino. In my most honest and biased opinion, the OP theme song for this season is miles better than the first one. The song has that calm atmosphere that somehow fits the romantic drama atmosphere the show has. On the other hand, the ED theme song is also a lot better than the first ED theme song. The song also has that same tone the OP has. I also love Yukino and Yui's voice, making these 2 characters a perfect singing duet.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (10/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\n\"I want something genuine\" -Hikigaya Hachiman\\n\\n\r\nNever before has an anime made me want these characters to not get together but at the same time making me want to see them get together. Sounds confusing? Let me explain and I did put a \"Spoilers\" tag so here's the spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, there was one scene where Yuki and Yui started noticing or have already noticed their feelings towards Hiki. If one of them reveals their feelings to Hachiman then the friendship between these 3 characters might or will most likely fall apart. What if Yui and Hiki got together? What will happen to Yukino? She's already in a terrible state. Let's say the situation is flipped around, what will happen to Yui? It will just end up in a love triangle. There's also the fact that Hachiman might have \"feelings\" for Yukino based on what I've seen on the second half of this season. If that is true then what's going to happen to Yui?  Either way, their friendship is f*cked unless Yukino is happy with Hiki and Yui's new relationship and vice versa or they could try polygamy. I need to kill myself just for suggesting the latter option. I really don't want to see their current relationship to fall apart. On the other hand, I signed up expecting Romance and by god's name they will give me goddamn Romance. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this so different from other love triangles out there that you mainly see in Romantic Comedies? This scene was a lot more realistic in terms of potential love triangle that could break their friendship apart. Just look at the ending episode again..Yui didn't want to confess her feelings to Hiki immediately because she cared for Yukino's feelings. But if Yukino doesn't make a choice then she will make a move on Hikki. Yukino's feelings was taken in for consideration but at the same time, she didn't want to give up her own feelings or else she might regret it later on. When was the last time you see a character doing that sh*t?\\n\\n\r\nIn most Rom-Coms out there, the best girl always wins and the \"third wheel\" girl always and I mean ALWAYS gives up her own feelings just so the \"man of her dreams\" and the \"best girl\" can get together. It's predictable and that's not how it always works in real life. That \"third wheel\" girl can't just give up on her feelings that easily. You finally met the man of your dreams and you're just going to give it up to some girl you probably don't even like?! It's like the \"third wheel\" female character's feelings wasn't taken into consideration and she's just like \"Oh, you can take my prince charming anytime..I'm cool with it\". Bitch, you're not and you need to stop lying to yourself. Anyways....\\n\r\nIn SNAFU's case, it's unpredictable. To this day, I still have no idea whether Hiki will pick Yui or Yukino.  \\n\\n\r\nNow this is what you call a developed characters. I mean, the characters were already developed in the first season but the second season further developed these characters making me want to care for these people's relationship. Most noticeably is Hiki, Yui, Yukino and most of the side characters in the show. Hell, even Ebina..one of the most useless side characters (and also extremely funny) got a development in this season and it was a good one. I'm talking about Ebina's true personality and why she doesn't date boys. \\n\\n\r\nI really want to talk about the character progression from first season up to the last episode of the second season. The progression was like an immature bully kid to a grown man who now works at a Children's Aid. Just compare Hikki from the first season and this season. It's like night and day. The guy hated everyone, including Yukino and now he pretty much sacrifices himself for the good of the others and he also cares for Yukino and Yui. It's the same case for Yukino and Yui. I'm not going to provide examples for Yukino and Yui's progression because you get my point. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing that I want to talk about are the new characters introduced for this season. First is Iroha Ishiki...She is one of my new favourite characters in the series because of the way she acts. She's like a hybrid of Hikigaya Hachiman. She maintains a cute appearance and has an image of an \"innocent girl\" but on the inside, she's a rotten girl. She doesn't care what other people think of her except her appearance. I also love the running gag between Hiki and Ishiki where Ishiki keeps rejecting Hiki...as a joke, of course. One more character that I want to talk about is Kaori Orimoto..All you need to know about her is she's a Class A scumbag. However, there is no other girls that's worse than her other than Haruno, a Class S bitch that deserves to be hanged on a public street. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the second season way more than the first season. I really did and I wouldn't mind watching it for the 3rd time. That's right, I watched the show for the 2nd time just so I can write this review. However, what prevented me from enjoying the show to the fullest is that goddamn \"Mother of all Cliffhagers\" at the end. They ended the show on the worst possible moment. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO\" is a perfect example of a perfect sequel. It has a very well-written storyline, complex and almost realistic characters, and a perfect romantic drama that contains little to no romantic cliches. This is a must watch if you have seen the predecessor. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.6/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n+Example of a Perfect Sequel\\n\r\n+Realistic Teenage-Drama\\n\r\n+Great Storyline\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Outstanding OP and ED theme songs. \\n\r\n+Characters have depth and almost realistic/complex characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Inconclusive Ending\\n",

In fact i am kind of glad that it lacked development other wise it would have felt rush and that would have seriously irritated me.\r\nThe art is true to form i like the color schemes and backgrounds \r\nSound was good though i dont really care much for sound cause i do not understand much japanese. \r\nCharacters Are great they are true to life i guess is what id call it.Let just say they are extremely relateable. They have depth and color and add something to the story \\n\r\nI got quite a bit of enjoyment out of the anime as a whole it kept me coming back. \\n\r\nOverall it was a great anime sure the first season was better i still think this anime is one of the better rom coms",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nWith the total failure of Date a Live and utter disappointment of Suisei no Gargantia, it\u2019s a good thing there were other decent shows. While I lost interest in Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru in the middle of its airing, the amazing cast really brought this anime home.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nSo while the premise of the show really interested me, most of the content was just boring in my honest opinion. The show follows Hachiman, Yukino, and later on Yui as they help fellow classmates with their problems. While the cast interactions really made this show work, I wasunfortunately just bored with what was going on. Essentially Hachiman and Yukino are somewhat reserved people who kind of have to be forced into situations in order to open up at all. This provides some really interesting banter between them but I did not like how other characters in the anime looked down on them. On the socially opposite side of the high school spectrum, you had the \u201ccool\u201d kids headed by Hayato and Yumiko who I despised immensely.\\n\\n\r\nIn pertaining to the actual plot of the anime, essentially it boils down to the club Hachiman is part of taking on different tasks set forth either by fellow classmates or the club monitor Shizuka. While some interesting moments come up in the show, it was overall pretty boring and average stuff. The final episode was pretty interesting and enjoying but overall the whole show just really felt like clever conversations with blandness in between.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the animation quality was entirely dependent on which ever character was on the screen. While the animation itself was fluid and good, the quality of each character was not. Characters Yukino, Shizuka, Haruno, Saika (I don\u2019t care if he is a trap), and some others had great character models and looked great while on screen. Hachiman and Yui though each had certain things I completely disliked and was annoyed by. Hachiman had a very fish like appearance (which was probably on purpose but I still didn\u2019t like it) and I found that in a lot of scenes his character didn\u2019t animate as fluid as the others. Yui while very pretty in appearance had some serious hair issues. This might be an extremely superficial gripe but there was just no detail to her hair; it just looked like a mangled knot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors deserve a 10/10 but the generic soundtrack really brought this anime down quite a bit. Starting with the bad, the soundtrack really just felt out of place and not adding what so ever to the anime. It was just uneventful and average at best. Now for the good; like for all the \u2013monogatari series, dialogue plays a huge role in this anime. The back and forth bantering between characters was very well done and the voice actors did an excellent job. Both Hachiman and Yukino were awesome from episode 1-13.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHands down the best cast of this season and possibly last year as well. Both this show and Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko had really well knit characters that made whatever was going on extremely funny and/or interesting. In Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru the stars of the show was Hachiman and Yukino. Every single conversation that was focused on them was either funny, interesting, exciting, and/or cute. Hachiman while not a very interesting person to begin with was a pretty good male lead. He worked well with all the characters including the super cute and super trap Saika. He really made whatever situation the team was in better due to his \u201cunique\u201d insight. Yui (while a complete ditz) had a pretty big heart and served as a medium between the club and the \u201ccool\u201d kids. The club teacher Shizuka also had a huge impact on how the show turned out. Her constant meddling provided most of the situations the club got into.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast overall just felt so in-sync with each other. Even though some of the episodes really felt like there was no direction, the conversations between each character made it somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile boring in some parts, I have to recommend this anime to everyone looking for some laughs and enjoyment in the slice of life realm. The characters just make this show so interesting to watch and while the animation and sound isn\u2019t overly great, they are good enough to help you enjoy what this anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "9 all across the board, hey! What's not to like? Couple of characters you don't like? A little bit boring sometimes?\r\nCharacter:\r\nVery well developed. They're consistent in what they say and do, so by the end of it you have a very good feel of who they are and what they're like. Many of them harbor strange philosophies, but it should be remembered that these philosophies belong only to the characters, not the show. They change subtly at a micro level and drastically at a macro level, and it's quite nice to see these characters adapt themselves to the things and people that begin to surroundthem. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nMuch more dramatic than the first season, be warned. It's still funny, but not as often and not as much. Things that have only just begun to simmer in season 1 will here burst to a boil. The story details the three main characters' relationships with each other and observes their slowly changing group dynamic. As you know, many of the characters in the series are very self aware about themselves and the rules governing their friendships, which adds an extra, very complicating dimension to the way in which they interact with one another. The story investigates what happens when these self-aware, awkward, philosophizing people begin to collide and form relationships. It's quite charming to watch. And above all, the show investigates this single question: what makes a relationship genuine?\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAnimation is a big step up from season 1, and the lighting adds so much to the show. People often underestimate the power of visuals, editing, pacing. This new art style and quality allows for so much depth of emotion. And the way the whole show is put together is enchanting. Time is given where time is required. There is a shot where the main character walks alongside a girl under the fading, egg-yolk sun, glowing just above the horizon. There's no swelling music or anything, just them walking. He reaches over and holds her grocery bags for her, and the whole thing takes perhaps 20 seconds, and I felt contentment just watching it. It's exactly the show it tries to be.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGreat voice acting, pleasant music. Fits the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nFantastic show. It's deep, and it asks big questions not for the sake of asking them but in service of the characters. Everything is in service of the characters, and their changing eyes as they slowly adjust to the world around them. I really loved the show. For some reason I gave it an 8, because that's how it feels to me now, I'll probably change it to a 9 soon. Not only is the story great, the animation, the directing, the editing and sound -- it all fits together like pieces of a puzzle.",

Just like the first season, the plot is carried by the interesting characters. They are also basically the only reason this anime is worth a watch.\r\nOther than that the art is pretty good and compliments the show rather well. The soundtrack is fairly forgetful however, although it does the job just fine.\r\nIfyou're expecting any real development of the story or a progression in the plot you will be somewhat disappointed, but the experience overall can still be rather enjoyable. If you enjoyed the first season, this season will most likely not disappoint.\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD (sorta)\r\nThe second season practically screams - character development!!! When I think back on how the characters were on season 1, I can't even recognise them anymore.\r\nFor starters, Yukino Yukinoshita. In the season 1, she was an ice cold beauty blah blah blah, with literally no friends and bad past.\r\nIn season 2, she still has bad past and still is a beauty but now she has friends (and even the 'cool squad' - Hayama and Yumiko etc talks with her) and she even talks about herself - seems like Hikigaya and Yui have finally broken her shell... a little. She even starts showing atsundere side of her.\\n\r\nWHICH I DON'T REALLY LIKE. My opinion only but the 'real' Yukino sort of annoys me. In season 1 she was an interesting character with mysterious attitude (which she still has by the way) but now she's sorta... meh. Except for some weird moments (like Haruno pointing out that her 'trust' isn't trust at all).\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya has changed too. Like some people, I miss his 'lone wolf inner monologue' from season 1.  Even so, I am really happy for his character development. The thing I like the most is that now he's able to speak up when he thinks something is wrong. In season 1 we saw him struggling to stand up for his friends and himself... That has changed now.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yui - she's my favorite character in the whole show. She's sort of the 'social glue' for the group and same as Hikigaya, she can finally speak up and help her friends not keep quiet. I especially love how she sort of proves (at least with her words) that she's not the 'nice girl' Hikigaya thought she was.\\n\\n\r\nAS FOR MY MOST MOST FAVORITE CHARACTER IT'S OBVIOUSLY SHIZUKA HIRATSUKA. She's wise and cool and UGHHH her advives to Hikigaya and the way she looks out for the group just gets me everytime.\\n\\n\r\nLiked the way Komachi became important in this season. While I'm on it, I seriously hate Isshiki. She's annoying and gets in the way and ugh.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nAs for the plot - it's no more a 'rom com'. I first got into this show while looking for rom coms. In the season one there was less rom and more com. In season 2 there's more tsundere rom and no com at all.\\n\r\nI loved the depth of the show and how it made me think. I lvoe that this show portrays completely realistic things and people and shows humans as they are - sometimes selfish, sometimes not, with a tendence to hurt each other and push others away. I think this show does a beautiful job of capturing ACTUAL reality and making you see it from different perspectieves. I won't lie saying that almost every episode made me cry.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I definitely didn't enjoy was the art. Ok, now I finally understood why everyone is in love with Hikigaya - the new style really makes him sorta hot. As fo0r the rest, Yukino looked 'too nice' and those pink cheeks really pissed me of... But that's just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nBack to characters, I really love them all. This is one of few shows (actually only one so far) that show that 'popular guys' aren't all that bad. Yumiko, who has the 'classical bitch' atitude and looks is actually pretty nice. \\n\r\nHayama suprised me the most of them all. At season 1 I saw him as a douche and then he proved himself nice. At season 2 he proved that he's NOT NICE AT ALL but he's polite enough and HUMAN!!! His hate for Hikigaya isn't because Hikigaya is a loner or whatever, but because he feels inferior to him.\\n\r\nEbina also proved herself as really nice, so did Tobe and well, you got it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, THIS ENDED WITH A CLIFFHANGER AND I HATE CLIFFHANGERS. I really hope we get an season 3, because I really need that.\\n\r\nSorry for the review being mostly about characters, I really had to.\\n",

            "content": "I am writing this review as part of my first anniversary in MyAnimelist.\r\nMINOR SPOILERS\r\nIf you are reading this review and have already watched season 1, I advise that you skip to my scores and review.\r\nIf you are reading this review and you are looking for reviews into this series I advise that you should go and read reviews for the 1st season (which is great by the way). I will provide a light description for the series. It is about the anti-social high student, who became very against having friends because of social trauma and he creates his own ideology about everything. He questions aboutnormal things that young people do like hanging out with each other and just ENJOYING youth. It is the reverse of \"Be yourself and society will accept you\" and somewhat a deconstruction of harem.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs the word \"outstanding\" suggests the story in Zoku is very different than that of S1. In Zoku, it develops more of its side characters and develop what is really happening in the lives of our main characters. Like how you will know why Yukino is acting the way she does. The question that arises in Zoku penetrates deep into thought. It shows more empathetic and sympathetic views in the perspective of Hachiman. As for the flow of the story, it flows well after Hachiman's social suicide at the end of S1 and as the progress goes on we on the watcher's side learn more about the social environment we live in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nIn Zoku the art was more consistent and shows more smoother flow in animation. Other than consistency the mood and the tone of the show was more favorable to the new character and background design. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was the same fluffy tune as it was in S1. No changes in there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the story, the characters are more developed. However not all from the original source were used in the anime, some minor character development were omitted but don't worry about that since you can read the light novels soon. That's just the missing part of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nFor this part you may need to rewatch S1 read the Light Novels and somewhat intrigued by Hachiman's ideology. You may also somehow need to understand Hachiman's point of view and to learn why he does the things. Somehow understand the tropes and jokes Wataru Watari (the author) is throwing at you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful series and it is still needs to be finished. The show wants you to think about your social environment and also about the story. (that is at least for loners and for those who have friends as well) It greatly follows through what the 1st season had accomplished and really makes a great adaptation Light Novels. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This assumes review overall references the first season due to the contrast of these two being very vital to the scoring/reviewing*\r\nThe first season had no glaring flaws, some of the characters were ununique, and some things were questioned by the viewer, but the characters and plot were still fun and went smoothly. This was especially apparent with the primary trio of characters where Yuigahama was a very ordinary anime character being a bit dimwitted (atleast in comparrison to the other 2) but still got her shine and moments which made us the viewer like her. \r\n*spoilers in the themes of the ending of s2*\r\nThe problemthat arises in this season, is primarily in the ending and what the ending tries to tell us. This being that the main character who we have followed as he pessimistically went through many problems and situations was completely wrong in his actions. Now in season 1 they showed that he may of overlooked some aspects/situations that may not bring his whole idea to fruition but he still solved things, and many times quickly and well. But the ending underminds all that and basically just has the same old theme of FRIEND POWER and it just felt like a huge slap in the face to myself who enjoyed his different outlook and actions compared to many main characters.",

            "content": "My first review! (Please go easy on me >__Yui's confrontation with Hachiman and Yukino in the final episode. Even after the series, I did not have a very clear idea what the \"genuine thing\" Hachiman wanted was. I did not know if the author intended it to be this way, or if I missed something, but that was something that bothered me when I was watching this show. Other than that, I found the development of the story to be quite very enjoyable. My personal favourite part of the series was its use of dialogue and monologues to express the character's feelings and attitudes. Unlike many other series which bases its character relationships on friendship, many are which are quite superficial and phony, this series uses dialogue to analyse some of its more troubling aspects, along with themes of romance, dependency, and trust. The ending leaves the resolutions on an open note (in this case, a cliffhanger) which may leave many people dissatisfied. I can see why it is controversial, but in my opinion, I thought the ending concluded quite nicely. Even with some of its minor problems, the realism this show exhibits and the passion the characters have to struggle and understand these issues really pushes it above most other shows of this caliber and should be considered a sui generis masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIn the announcing of the new series, I was quite surprised by the change in animation studio, and was a bit apprehensive to see how the series would turn out. Since I really enjoyed season one's art (especially Hachiman's design), I didn't actually know if I would continue watching this season if the art didn't fit my tastes (and the storyline). When the show started, I had a hard time adjusting to the sudden change in character design, but over time it grew on me, so it wasn't too bad. The designs for the characters and background became more crisp, and the colouring became more sophisticated, with warmer colours used in more light hearted scenarios, and cooler colours used in the more melancholic moments (such as near the end of EP 7.)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe series introduces a new opening and ending, both of which are honestly quite catchy and refreshing (I really like the song choices for this series; they are really nice to listen to). Also, the solo ballads sung by the voice actors for Yui and Yukino that replaced the endings were some of the most beautiful Japanese songs I have heard (why can't they get Hachiman's VA to do one too.... sigh). Most of the OST they used in the series are reused from the first season, which is nice because it helps the series retain the atmosphere that made Oregairu unique and enjoyable as a show. Also, as the series became more 'drama' driven than 'comedy' driven, the importance of the supporting background music also increased to intensify some of the more emotionally charged moments. I think the music was used very well in such situations, such as Hachiman's confessions about his feelings; the music really did help to amplify the emotional aspects of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the previous characters, the cast is also expanded to include many new ones, most notably the underclassman Isshiki Iroha, Orimoto, and the members of the partner school for the Christmas event. However, the main focus remains on the relationship between the three members of the Service Club, and how they overcome some of the more troubling obstacles in their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman:\\n\\n\r\nOur favourite misanthrope is back! Hachiman is one of my favourite characters in all the shows that I've seen In addition to his hilarious cynicism and pessimistic view on life, his observation skills and adept problem solving abilities really make him an enjoyable character to watch. When he is not in his antisocial mode, he plays the villain and is always ready to sacrifice himself for the sake of the wellbeing of his fellow classmates. His accomplishments usually goes unnoticed and he usually becomes the scapegoat, but he doesn't care as long as his objectives are met. In short words, he can be described as the kind of person who is indifferent to the process as long as he can reach the goal, even if it results in him hurting himself. What he doesn't realise is that as he strengthens his relationship with Yukino and Yui, his actions result in not only pain for himself, but also the pain in others. In Oregairu Zoku, Hachiman and his epiphany and the acknowledgement of his wrongs play a significant role in the progression of the story. Throughout the first part of the story and even in Season 1, Hiratsuka-sensei gave many warnings to Hachiman, saying that although his objectives are being met, his actions are hurting those around him. He notices that many of the actions he has taken are temporary and does not solve the problem at its roots. With the acknowledgement of wrongdoing and the struggle for change in EP. 8, Hachiman begins his search for something genuine. This serves as the turning point of the story and also the beginning of change in the four main characters. Hachiman serves as the catalyst for this change, and his willingness to do so makes me respect him more as a character.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino:\\n\\n\r\nThe cool, strong, levelheaded, and stubborn girl seen in the first season has quite a dramatic change in character in the second season. With her views on Hachiman's actions and ideas as unacceptable, the two come into odds in a very serious manner, which, at many times, threatened to break apart the club. Yukino makes it very clear during Hachiman's \"confession\" in EP 2. that she does not approve of his actions, yet she cannot articulate why she thinks that way. I think through the various bonds that Yukino has created with both Hachiman and Yui, she has started to care for both of them, which causes her to feel hurt when she sees Hachiman's self abuse. When Hachiman talks about the failures of his actions and his goal to reach something \"genuine\", Yukino backs off in shock. In the next episodes, her character starts to warm a bit, and she becomes more \"dependent\" on Hachiman (I used dependent here because \"trust\" is questioned by her sister Haruno in the later episodes, and to me I think that needs a bit more clarification to fully understand).\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama Yui:\\n\\n\r\nYui serves as the \"glue\" between Hachiman and Yukino with her light-hearted \"nice girl\" personality. Her character is sort of the opposite of Yukino and Hachiman, with her already having many friends at school and being quite popular among those that know her. However, because she is seen as the \"nice girl\", she actually feels quite distant from the other two. In addition, the fact that she is seen as a \"nice girl\" makes that a facade for her. The other characters, even the analytical Hachiman, did not see until the very end until she gave him the cookies and said that she will take everything because that is what she wants. I had a hard time analysing Yui's character in the last episode, because she never gave a specific answer to what she wanted (which Hachiman noted), so I can curious to find out what she meant.\\n\\n\r\nIroha Isshiki:\\n\\n\r\nThe newly introduced character of this season who becomes the student council president. Seemingly a platonic character, she is actually a very cunning and dynamic girl.  From my perspective she hides her true personality in order to prevent herself from being seen in bad light by other people, as she holds her reputation quite high. However, after listening to Hachiman's \"genuine\" speech, she strives to change herself. This is exemplified in her confession to Hayato and her rejection, as the Hachiman's words gives her the strength to toss aside her facade, and aim for what she wants.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend it as it was my personal favourite series of Spring 2015. With unique dialogue and characterisation, this show deserves the numerous accolades that it gets from viewers.  It is a 9/10 series for me. Thank you so much for reading, and if possible please give me some constructive suggestions so that I may improve the next time I write. I hope you have a wonderful day wherever you are!",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nSo this is my first review and it ain't gonna be like how other professional reviewers write them. I'll start with this. I'm a die hard fan of Oregairu and re watched the first season like uncountable times cause of the humor and the light atmosphere and storyline. That being said, I'll now move on to the second season. I'm probably too late to warn anyone from what they're about to see in this anime but hopefully whoever sees this braces themselves before they watch this, reasons to be mentioned. \r\nSo the art, story and sound are nothing much to review about,I truly felt it was all very well done like the previous season, except the story which was a tad bit more darker and dramatic which kind of made me a little frustrated because as the title says, it's a romantic comedy, I don't know about anyone else but for me, the story was a bit dramatic and dark compared to the first season which was humorous and not so much drama. \\n\\n\r\nNow we'll begin with character, honestly I was annoyed by 2 characters which I really really liked from season 1. Firstly, Yukinoshita Yukino. She was awesome and wonderful when I first met her in the first season, however over season 2, it just seems like she's having never ending mood swings. The title says this contain spoilers but it's only if I accidentally spoil it, as much as I can, I will try not to. So yeah, the mood swings never stop, in s1 she's okay with Hikki's methods but suddenly she's not? What? Why? Well apparently, watch the anime to find out why. Secondly would be none other that Yukinoshita Haruno, the more hotter version of her younger sister. Her character in season 1 was purely mentor-typed and comedy relief, but somehow in this season, she shifted into like a semi-antagonistic villain who can make anyone into her enemy anytime. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, I still rate character highly as there are some additions of nice characters. For instance, my number one favorite female character throughout this season, Ishikki Iroha. Honestly, somewhere in the middle of the season, I gave up on Hikki x Yukino and went for Hikki x Irohas. Well this technically is a spoiler as those who haven't watched will not know her, sorry about that, I just had to mention that I really enjoyed the show basically cause of her appearance, she was comedic, at the same time, dramatic, but not too dramatic either, just the right balance. I would mention more characters, but for now this is enough. \\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, well as described by character and show, I think that says it all. Plus minus the good and bad altogether, I give it a 6. I still enjoyed it but not as much as the previous season. To all the hardcore fans of Oregairu, I say this not as a hater but as a fan myself, that this was a tad bit too dark and dramatic for what seems to be a romantic comedy. Hope this helps people who have not watched it but would read this anyways.",

I know). \r\nYukinoshita Yukino... if you're a younger sibling and you're always compared to your older and more popular and more successful sibling... it does feel bad. In most cases, if you have close friends... at least you'll have them to treat you asan individual. However in Yukino's case, she's a loner... then obviously she finds Hachiman and Yui where her life takes a dramatic turn. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Yuigahama Yui... admit it... there are many who change themselves just to be accepted. And once they are accepted, they can't change back as it will cost them their popularity. Yui goes along with everything Yumiko says and does just so at the end of the day, she can be friends with someone as popular as her to gain popularity as well. Trust me, more people exist in today's world than you think who are just like Yui. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Hikigaya Hachiman... my all time favourite character... not only in anime but in all fictions. And let me tell you... I've watched/read most popular fictions/anime. He deserves so much respect as a character. Admit it, if you're a loner... you develop a certain mindset towards society. But in most cases... if not all cases, you don't express that mindset because that just makes everything worse for you. Hachiman on the other hand, isn't scared. He stays true to who he is and understands the conventions of society better than anyone else. Most loners would half the first half of Hachiman's character i.e. having a certain mindset towards society. However not many... if any loners can be like Hachiman. In that way, he is truly an inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nYes I'll admit that the whole setting and some other characters and some other things are sort of cliche and not realistic like the main characters. However if you're able to ignore that just like me then you'll find this anime amazing. In other words, this is a real-life show school show that is still an anime. Another way to sum it up would be that it's the closest thing you can get to a realistic school anime whilst still being entertaining. The only thing that can beat this anime if someone does something similar but instead they make the setting and other things more realistic. All whilst still making it entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow to why some people hate this. In my opinion, you can only like this anime if you understand it fully. Some people would see the name 'My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU' and think to themselves that it would be just a romantic comedy for them to watch without using their brain too much. These people try not using their brain and so they think to themselves \"wtf was that\". The other reason that some people might dislike this is maybe because they aren't too aware of how things truly are in the current generation. These people could either be the really popular school children who don't know how much a loner is socially smarter than them so they would find it annoying at how the loner disrespects the popularity created in school. Or these people could be the older people who have a mentality set towards their days in high school instead of the modern high school. This makes them say stuff such as 'this anime is just trying to be too philosophical' or 'it's boring' or 'nothing really happens throughout the anime' and so on when at the end of the day, it's a very entertaining and helpful portrayal of high-school society of TODAY... not earlier.",

            "content": "YAHELLO!!! I saw the first season of this anime and really enjoyed it and was hoping for a second season, and to see the continuation of the story. I also really loved the dynamic between Hikigaya and Yukinon, and I just really liked the character Hikigaya. He was the antithesis to most other main characters of romance anime and I really liked that.  However I feel that the second season, in my opinion, declined in quality. Spoilers ahead of this point, be aware. Hikigaya became a lot more emotional and lost his overall character development that was created in the first season. He wentfrom being antisocial, never shows any emotion type of guy to a guy that openly cries and can't take being alone anymore. I know this changed because of his growing relationships with Yui and Yukinon but to me it seemed like his character completely changed from how he was in the first season. Also Yukinon's character completely changed from the first season to the second. She went from being a strong, didn't take shit from anyone type character to a very emotional and easily swayed by Haru's words and actions. Haru uses loaded language and I was very confused by it.  Yui remained pretty constant from season to season so I enjoyed that. I also didn't understand what was happening in the story from the middle of the season onward. All of their problems were all confusing and none of their problems seemed significant. The reason I didn't enjoy this season as much as the last season is because of the ending. This is a romance anime and so I hoped that Hikigaya would end up with one of the girls. (Team Iroha). However that didn't happen, nothing really happened at all. Overall though I did enjoy it, just not as much as the first season, and I also thought it was a lot more confusing. LASTLY, that greeting \"yahello\" was annoying as hell and they said it so much...",

            "content": "Being new to the whole Anime environment and storytelling, I want to state that this is what I felt watching this show, and not me telling you guys that this show is bad. It's my opinion and nothing more.\r\nThis show is definitely for people who find Hiki, Yui or Yukinoshita reliving things from your time in school. It\u2019s a snail-progressed story-driven idea about how you learn to understand yourself and put trust into others eventually making friends. Though this series is tagged with drama, comedy, and romance it's almost far from it. The confrontations and drama are not as you'd expect from a slice oflife series, small-romance indeed, but nothing major or anything for you to care about since it's not regarding the characters you're following throughout the series. The comedy in this show? Yeah, it's mostly set in the first season. Season 2 is a steep mountainside that lets you end up in the bottom furious to the point where every episode works as a (1 step forward, 3 steps back ) show. This show is not meant to end happily regardless since the 3 protagonist never gets to the root of (!their!) problem. They don't talk about it with each other, after continuously helping other students helping or fixing their problems. They end up as it started, Hiki and Yukinoshita rotting whilst savoring their pride. Oh and Yui not wanting to let go of them, their club and their \"friendship\"\\n\\n\r\nOther than that its a bland story dwelling on the \"lonely, shy, unpopular, not-understood\" guy or girl, that needs to learn to navigate socially by attending meetings in a volunteer club where a random request from fellow students is to be completed. To guide them is a teacher that herself are facing problems finding anyone to marry her basically struggling socially as well.  She is trying to help Hiki and Yukinoshita, by understanding feelings and showing them, learning them to be vulnerable and that its okay to feel and express. Most importantly to ask for help.\\n\\n\r\nI don't get this series since I can't see myself or any similarities in these characters nor the scenarios they're going through. It's downright depressing, where nothing but the very club they're part of is the only functional thing in this series, where completion exists and is the goal. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score 3/10 - poor\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this show for not replicating my time in school, I'm not forcing or anticipating that every slice of life anime would, and I'm not anticipating that any of the animes I'm watching needs to awaken some kind of thing I can relate to, for me to rate it higher than what've done to Yahari Ore no. But this one for me is indeed sad to a whole new point. I'm sorry this did not favor my tastes after watching other long reviews that by quickly reading them shares common ground with the watcher. it sure seems that many found their holy grail within this one. I'm sad I didn't\\n",

            "content": "The second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru (referred to from here on as just \"Love Comedy\" for brevity's sake) was absolutely worth watching. While I don't think it's as good as the first season, (by kind of a wide margin...) there are a few moments scattered throughout that struck me hard enough to make me glad that I saw it. The show has some pretty glaring issues that make it hard to recommend to anyone else wholeheartedly, but there's still so much to like about it.\r\nOne of my favorite things about \"Love Comedy\" is that it's a show about smalltragedies. The stakes of any given situation presented in the show are pretty low in the grand scheme of things - nobody's lives are going to be ruined if the school festival for one year isn't impressive, or the cookies they make don't taste good. But \"Love Comedy\" is very deliberately not focused on the \"big picture\" that puts those kinds of things in perspective. It's focused on the things that matter to us in spite of their insignificance. \\n\\n\r\n\"Love Comedy\" presents those moments with the weight of genuine tragedy. I know that makes it sound like it's melodramatic, and it is, but... it's believably melodramatic. The show's drama comes from the way people feel, not the things that happen to them, so it doesn't matter how small the stakes are. The climactic moments of the series don't happen when a conflict is reaching a breaking point; they come when a character is reaching a breaking point. So yeah, it's melodramatic, but it's melodramatic because human beings are kinda melodramatic.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is clearly more interested in the small details more than it is in the grand scheme of things, which makes the style of writing in the second season feel at-odds with the story it wants to tell. Everything the characters say to each other is suddenly extremely vague; they say all these grand-sounding things that don't seem to actually mean anything when you analyze them. In a show focused on small conflicts, it's strange that all of the dialogue expresses emotion in a way that only makes sense if you look at the overall tone of the writing rather than the words themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say it's all bad. There is a line in the fourth episode that resonated so strongly with me that I had to pause the show so I could give it time to sink in. It's a line that can only come out of something this small-scale; it's a moment that wouldn't be important to show if the conflict were any larger. It's a one-sided realization that is happening only for one person, and is more meaningful because everyone around the person realizing it is totally oblivious to it. It's a conflict that feels resolved because the character simply becomes comfortable with the fact that it's not really going to be resolved.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the rest of the season fails to hit that high-water mark. The stakes are gradually raised over the course of the season, and that small moment of self-reflection doesn't really happen again. There are bigger moments of self-reflection, sure, but they don't manage to feel as meaningful as the smaller ones do. And the writing continues to be vague in a way that makes the relatively simple plot actually hard to follow. There are times when it feels like nothing's happening and the characters are just talking in circles and saying nothing. Which is ironic, considering how there is an entire arc of the second season criticizing that style of self-important, circular talk.\\n\\n\r\nI think I could look past the cryptic dialogue and frustratingly rising stakes if either of those actually paid off in any meaningful way. Instead, the series seems to build up to something big, reaches a climax of sorts, then has four episodes of things seeming to settle into place before jumping out with another big climax at the very end. And I mean the VERY end. This season ends on an incredibly unsatisfying cliffhanger that would be more forgivable if there were more episodes to come. And even then, the plot this cliffhanger sets up points in a direction I'm just not all that interested in seeing play out. \\n\\n\r\nThe last glaring issue I have with the second season of \"Love Comedy\"is that there's really not that much comedy in it anymore. The first season had frequent moments of levity that helped relieve some of the tension and put the conflicts back into perspective. The second season takes the occasional jab at humor, but that mostly consists of the characters repeating some \"quirky\" behavior or dialogue over and over. It's always the same joke, they just tell it multiple times. This season severely lacks anything to contrast its melodrama against, which actually serves to make it feel less real and grounded overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season of \"Love Comedy\" has issues. The dialogue is vague and hard to parse the meaning of, the comedy is completely missing, and it all builds to a moment it never even attempts to pay off. All that said, I struggle to score it anything lower than a seven because the high moments were so important to me, and because it does still carry some of the spirit of the first season with it. It probably deserves a little lower, but I'm a sentimental person, and this is a very sentimental series, so I personally liked it quite a bit in spite of its issues. It's probably worth watching if you liked the first season, but don't expect it to surpass it any way.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free Review\r\nI am...confused. I watched through the first season just to get to the \"Oh so fabulous and wonderful\" Second season. 8 episodes in, and I keep repeated finding myself asking the questions: Why? Why is she crying? Why is she so mad? Why is HE crying? What is going on? Who is this person? What does that even mean? What the fuck did he even do to trigger her?\r\nI ask these questions to myself about 5 times in each episode. I just don't understand how what they say to each other makes sense, sometimes I even pause the anime tryingto interpret what they say, but after doing that a couple of times, I stopped and I know that Animes like these shouldn't be interpreted.\\n\\n\r\nYes, many of my friends who enjoyed this anime tells me, don't question the motives or the plot, just watch it and let the drama come to me. How the hell am I supposed to enjoy the drama when I spend half the episode wondering what the fuck happened in the last episode for this episode to make this less sense. This anime needs to be interpreted to be fully enjoyed, however, there isn't enough dialogue to fully let the audience know what the fuck is going on. It might be because I watched it in subbed, but I haven't had a problem with Kissanime's subs that much.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very like 5 Centimeters per Second, where the plot makes sense and the audience knows where you're trying to go with the plot. But there not enough dialogue for the audience, and they are left confused rather than seeing the motives behind what the characters feel and say.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifics:\\n\r\nStory: Is a 5, it very normal and somewhat boring, just reading the synopsis makes me not want to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It is very solid, it is an 8 because I feel like there surprising a lot of beautiful animation clips in an anime that doesn't really have any actions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Is an 8, makes a story a little better, but I tend to like music from all animes, so it might be a little biased.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If there is any reason to watch this show, it is simply to watch the complexity and general emotions that the characters feel. The main protagonist is what I would call a four-dimensional character, not only does he have a motive, which makes a character three dimensional, but he actually tells you a motive but hides the real motive away from everyone, including the audience, including even himself. Almost every character, from the sensei to Kaori to Komachi, they are all multi-dimensional. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5, maybe even lower, I was just triggered half the time I was watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but hey if you like to interpret and analyze classic Japanese visual Literature, be my guest.",

            "content": "Fine if it were a new series, failure as a sequel.\r\nThere's two big problems I have with this sequel and one minor problem. Let's start with the minor one.\r\nEntire art style changed. Lots of bloom everywhere for no reason. It's like watching a sequel to a video game, if you know what I mean. Character art remained the same with the exception of a few key characters. The main male character had a minor makeover which is totally okay but other characters started suffering from sameface syndrome and there was a time in the anime where I wasn't sure who a character was and wasin doubt between 3 different characters with one of them being a main heroine. Obviously a very bad direction for the art but it did get a bit better towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one of the big problems - The character of the previously mentioned main heroine was completely changed. Used to be a witty and cold girl but in this season was presented as spineless and seemingly on the verge of crying all the time. Why this direction was taken, I will probably forever fail to comprehend.\\n\\n\r\nThe last problem is the story itself. A major conflict arose from a main character doing something bold that solved the problem pretty much perfectly and in addition the other side was basically in on it. This action, however, requited harsh criticism from the other main characters. I was completely dumbfounded at this point and failed to understand what all the fuss is about. This was nothing out of the ordinary for the character and as previously mentioned, worked as a solution. This was also one of the only cool solution, which the character was known for in the previous season, that was used. The rest of the season, the character seemed rather useless.\\n\r\nMuch of the emotional dialogue between the three main characters was utterly incomprehensible and made little sense. I really don't understand where they were going with this and this more than foolish plot ruined the anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nNot all is lost, however, the Iroha x Hachiman scenes were pretty good. :)\\n\r\nBut other than that, major disappointment and I don't understand the high scores.",

            "content": "I'll be continuing the review from the first season so if there's something that you don't understand, take a look at the previous review I made for the first season. \r\nWell.. after that different kind of experience from season one, I was hoping I could get more out of this one but sad to say that I was kind of disappointed. Same old stuff I guess and same old story progression. Well.. I hope that no one felt the same as I did watching this show. The fact that I feel this way is because I kind of have a similar situation with the maincharacter back in grade school. I was always left out and unnoticed and all I could do that time was think. Though bitter as life may be, I try to enjoy it because I know that I can't keep sulking for the rest of my life and I'm sure time will come when things might turn the right way. The main character here however, is as hopeless as he can get. Though not your usual dense main characters from other series, this one is sensitive about it though he pretends or wishes to be dense about the issue in the title. The rollercoaster of emotions from the first season happened to make its way into the second one too so there's still some of that. The story is most likely just a continuation of the first season because the first episode picked up where it left off. The art style has changed because the series switched studios and now I don't know if the art has improved but however the animation has become more fluid and the backgrounds are way better this time. The opening sequence fit the show better than the first season's. The background music seemed to have improved also. The characters are still the same though developed maybe just a bit. I think the only thing that stands out is that they look a bit different. I can't say I enjoyed this season that much in fact, I was somewhat bored and disappointed that it was just a repetition of the first season but with a different aspect. Though it stirred up a lot of emotions and the drama seem a bit heavier, I honestly wasn't able to relate at all. The ending is somewhat reasonable but I think it was left by a cliffhanger there. I don't know if I can handle another season of this and I'm sure as heck not gonna read the manga because I think that this series wasn't really for me. Still, I'm glad I finished this anime and maybe I'll think about recommending this to people who haven't seen it yet. I gave this decent anime a decent rating and I think that's what it deserves.",

            "content": "(I AM WRITING THIS PRESUMING YOU HAVE WATCHED THE FIRST SEASON)\r\nThis anime is hard to depict in a few words. For me to summarize it shortly i would say it is a break-down of social hierarchy and social standards. The greatness of having friends or being a loner. Hikigaya in the first season has not resolved whether these two girls surrounding him are pleasant or unfortunate. In this season he has come to the conclusion that these people are great people. The 2nd Season starts off where the first one ended with Hikigaya hated as he does not realize the consequences of his self-sacrifice. Ifeel like they take this at the correct speed and do not just rush for him to think that he matters. He does this by realising his flaws and  This 2nd Season focuses more on genuine friendships and relations with other than the first. As quoted by Hikigaya \"The things handed to you on a silver plate are never genuine, and never everlasting\". This explores the sociological idea of relationships are built over time and cannot be gained instantly. Friendships on Commercial Society: Eighteen-Century Social Theory and Modern Sociology by Allan Silver says \"commercial society sharply distinguishes self-interested from sympathetic relations and is therefore necessary for the spread of personal relations based on sympathy and sentiment\". Ok, ok you might be a bit confused but what this article is trying to say is that social interactions can be categorized into : Sympathetic or Self-interested. What this means is that you are either trying to get something out of the relationship or you are speaking to someone of lower class and you are using 'sympathy' (as used in this article). This is showcased in Oregairu with their depictions of social hierarchy. It can also be interpreted as challenging this view as one of the main themes of this season is Hikigaya's desire for 'something genuine'. You could interpret this as wanting friendship that is not influenced by social hierarchy. You could also say this is achieved by the end of the season. One thing i have not talked about is the introduction of Iroha the new 'potential love interest' but with this anime I saw that this was going nowhere. She adds some diversity to cast and is also a very real character as she might seem cunning and deceiving but she truly is a good girl.\\n",

After 13 episodes I feel like nothing happened and wasted a few hours of my life. Show tries way too hard to be philosophical or make it seem like there's always tension but fails miserably because like I said nothing really happens. This series could have worked a lot more as a standalone 13 episodes show, 24+ episodes plus a possible 3rd season/ovas is just too much.\r\nI don't think there's anything else to add since people watching a sequel already knows what's about.imo it's not a terrible show in any way but personally it was a borefest and doubt I'm coming back for a next season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate 7/10 mainly because of the good animation and yanaginagi's opening",

            "content": "These days, I rarely do anime reviews, but when I do, it's for a \"Must Watch!\" type of story. \r\nWhen you learn a lesson from a story, it is rare for that lesson to actually change your life/become applicable to the real world. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku did a great job at emphasizing the fact that it's impossible to understand other people 100%. The story of this anime is meant to be confusing, not in the sense that it has plot holes, but rather that the meaning is so implicitly well-hidden, that the viewer has to decipher each episode, maybeeven rewatch them because this anime is just that deep. Is youth a lie? What is genuine? I highly recommend this anime, especially for teenagers as they try to find themselves. The main character, Hikigaya Hachiman, is quite possibly the most relatable anime character there is. \\n\\n\r\nStory= 10/10 (Outstanding). It is very rare to find a story that is as well-written as this one. On the surface, this anime may appear like any Rom-Com or Harem story, but I highly advise you to think otherwise and be prepared for anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10 (Outstanding). As this 2nd season is made by a different studios than the 1st season, the visuals have been vastly improved, and, dare I say that this might be among the top 5 best-looking anime ever. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10 (Outstanding). Music speaks for itself, as it can be a powerful emotional tool that is difficult to explain. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9/10 (Great). There is one questionable line in episode 8 that Yukinoshita Yukino said that left me confused. Other than that, the characters are very diverse in terms of their social situations ranging from cynical or cold loners like Hikigaya and Yukinoshita to the \"fake\" or \"superficial\" extroverted Hayama Hayato to the adults that give our two main characters some advise when they need it such as Hiratsuka Sensei. All in all, the cast of OreGairu is very entertaining and they always leave me with a \"What's going to happen next?!\" vibe, a rare feeling that very few anime actually are capable of. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 (Outstanding). While there are comedic situations involving our favorite loner, there are also moments of tension between characters; this anime made me enjoy deciphering the deeply encrypted story in a way that no other story could. \\n\\n\r\nOverall score= 9/10 (Great). \\n\\n\r\nNow, can we please get a season 3 already?",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku. \"I want something genuine\", ...... \"I don't understand\". These two quotes can summarize the entire second season.\r\nThe story picks up right after the first season. A new request is made to the volunteer club, which is still operated by our three main characters. This request is the catalyst for a 13 episode plunge into a pool of forced, petty, and rather pseudo intellectual drama.\r\nI don't want to come off as a snob, however anime drama tends to lean this direction a lot. Whether you agreed or disagreed withstatements or actions made in the first season it didn't really matter. The show never tried to preach or to seem sophisticated. This season however is filled with dialogue and weighty scenes with no substance at all. To top that off they just vomit it at you. There isn't a break in the drama and it comes from all angles. Making it feel like the story was either rushed, or non existent. We even end on a cliff hangar.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the driving force of the show, and as such are given and equally low score. Each character changes, almost to their exact opposite of what they were in the first season. We get a new character who was actually rather enjoyable. Aside from her however we lose a great character in Hachiman as he barely does anything except be the drama thorn. Yukino's personality becomes that of a rag doll for the other characters to rip and tear at. Yui doesn't change much until the end of the show when she suddenly grows large and hairy balls. In fact this season its hard to call our main characters the main characters. Iroha steals most of the time and has the most depth and interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe first time I watched this show, I was torn. Its hard to not like a second season of a show that you love. However after watching it again, this season was really terrible. It felt tailor made for the Jaden Smiths of the world to enjoy and to feel smug about as they pretended to follow along with it. All of the drama revolved around poorly constructed sequences and lack of communication. The real hard hitting moments like the romance, or the family troubles of Yukino are hinted at but not followed up on. Maybe it was actually good, and like Hachiman I forced my own ideals onto the show and when that was changed I felt betrayed. Though I doubt that to be the case.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After the first season, I expected, if nothing else, more of the same. An enjoyable show that was funny, witty, and occasionally harsh. A sequel to a show that felt like it stepped outside of the expectations of the \"love comedy\" shows that we've come to know, love, or loathe.\r\nThis, on the other hand, felt like a combination of a standard love drama and something that just wasn't really that good. It dragged on for half of it, and its message just wasn't clear a lot of the time either. While the point of the show is that its characters are \"real,\" or so somesay, when there are points where the love interests are made out to be completely lacking in empathy or common sense multiple times over, yet the narrative insists they are in the right, we have a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe first bout of drama was the result of one such event. One love interest encourages the protagonist to take action, knowing full well what he's like. She says she's relying on him. He takes action in the way he does, and she proceeds to tell him she hates how he does things and leave. This is followed by the other love interest telling him to think of the feelings of others (a tad hypocritical really) and also leaving, and then half of the show is spent slowly dealing with the fallout. \\n\\n\r\nWhereas the first season made sharp commentary, this one chooses to be pointlessly and annoyingly vague far too often, and avoids addressing what's going on too much of the time, leaving viewers to wonder what any of the characters are talking about or feeling more often than a show has any right doing, much less one that's following up this one's first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of it is when it's not dragging out and forcing this drama is that the cast of characters really can be a breath of fresh air - with the exception of the main heroine and the drama the author insists on packaging her with and forcing on us, that is. I can't help but think the story would be much, much stronger if it could be written without the fear of cancellation, as many Japanese works so clearly are, because that love triangle and tease to keep begging readers and viewers to keep coming back could be scrapped for something more focused and genuine.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty ironic when you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe core problem of Oregairu that rears its head in the second season over and over again is that it's trying to do two things simultaneously that conflict a lot with each other. The first is that it's trying to have a flawed, human protagonist that is coming to terms with his issues and damages. It's showing us a person who is cynical and who doesn't understand and can't work with people, but is getting there.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is that it's still trying to abide by a lot of stereotypes of stories within this genre/setting. In the end, the narrative is set up so that this protagonist can still be a hero and save these girls and be there for them. In a way, it's pandering to the mindset of the viewer/reader that wants these girls to be their \"waifus\" in this respect. It's not inherently a bad thing to do that, but as it's presented, it conflicts with the first thing it's trying to do somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nFor a lot of the show, the protagonist himself is clearly someone in need of helping. Towards the end of this season, a point is reached where the protagonist owns up to how he's done a lot of wrong and comes asking for help. \\n\\n\r\nThis results in a reminder of how another character also needs saving, some drama, and eventually what seems like a resolution. In itself, this would have been a good way to close the series - but that's not how things work. Despite the show's commentary on the status quo, these types of shows are all ABOUT the status quo, it seems.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately after this event, the next episode opens with \"that was so embarrassing I want to die\" from the protagonist, and the genuineness of that resolution is called into question throughout the rest of the season and never even really resolved. This is the third problem with it. Unlike the first season, this one seemed very intent on getting viewers more invested in the source material than just being a standalone product, and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this leaves something that can very easily leave viewers unsatisfied. It does create a \"real\" seeming story, but the show doesn't pace these things nearly well enough for it to be effective - and that's assuming this story would work if paced well to begin with.",
