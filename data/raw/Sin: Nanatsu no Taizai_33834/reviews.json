            "content": "Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai \u201cThe Seven Mortal Sins\u201d\r\nBackstory and Information:\r\nHobby Japan has finally delivered and now this year Spring of 2017 with the help of TNK the studio behind \u201cHigh School DxD\u201d alongside with Artland. This series being far older than the now widely known Netflix\u2019s Seven Deadly Sins, Hobby Japan responsible for series such as Queen\u2019s Blade, Hyakka Ryouran \u201cSamurai Girls\u201d and Demon King Daimaou or \u201cIchiban Ushiro Daimaou, Whatever it is you have seen, Hobby Japan has a history with high tier Ecchi andwho can forget their amazing figurines that radiate quality.\\n\\n\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai being a series that had over the years been teased to the fans on multiple instances as this series is from a Video Game, It has left us waiting many years because of dilemmas. Whether this series could be delivered in shorts or OVA\u2019s it remained to be seen.  With a Manga introduction in August 29th of 2016, Published by Hobby Japan it brought forth light to the people who were getting tired of holding their breath and later confirmed when Visuals once again teased a incoming anime series. The issue grew deeper whether the anime would adapt the video game or the new fresh manga, Categorized \u201cShounen\u201d and on February 2017 a \u201cSeinen\u201d version is being put out by \u201cMedia Factory\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nPlot + Pros:\\n\r\n\u201cThe prideful archangel Lucifer disobeys God and is cast into the lowest level of hell as a fallen angel. On her way to hell, Lucifer happens to meet a high school girl on Earth named Maria, who helps her. In hell, Lucifer meets Leviathan, and Leviathan explains to Lucifer about The Seven Deadly Sins, the seven demon king rulers of hell. After The Seven Deadly Sins seal Lucifer's powers, Lucifer goes on a journey with Maria and Leviathan to defeat them.\u201d Courtesy of Anime News Network\\n\\n\r\nIt seems pretty cut and dry, as one can guess the story here is one of revenge with juicy details native to Hobby Japan\u2019s Ecchi ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). \\n\\n\r\nThe Question now becomes what will the anime reflect, One of the two manga or the video game?. The answer is a little of all three and this series approaches the viewer with more visual appeal rather than complex storytelling as the series holds to present a simple point and questions the tittle of the sins and whether if any of the seven should be indeed be worthy of pulling a human soul towards Hell.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the main character isn\u2019t on full out display as of yet, due to we have a duo of Lucifer and the human Maria leading the show, This show is executing a learning process between human and Lucifer as they unravel sin by sin and accept that nature isn\u2019t sinful as it make up each one of us. While showcasing high tier ecchi for the delight of many of us to see, It is well accompanied by doubt and self-discovery of each of the demon lords as they learn from their defeats that their existence isn\u2019t anything to be ashamed about and shows us growth from a Lucifer who sees herself as one cast out for not belonging to the herd and being an individual thinker.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series advances it pseudo - parodies \"Dante's Inferno\" in the Journey of Lucifer in place of Dante to recover her powers, Become head of the 7 Deadly sins and hold a goal of holding Heaven, God and the Archangel Michael accountable for kicking her out of heaven for simply having a opinion and most of all, for being individualistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Con:\\n\r\nWhile the series is visually stunning here and there and has a lot going for it, It mirrors another series in one aspect. This series is leaning more towards an original work and like Dragon Ball Super there is a lot of improvisation and often things fit in on rather rushed ways, As the Manga both put out by Hobby Japan and Media Factory don\u2019t have as much content for the series to draw from, So it often does fill in the blanks in a anime only format. \\n\\n\r\nExcept for the whole Dante's Inferno references from here and there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis series has a rather somewhat unique animation and has a lot of vibrant colors, Other series that count with the same type of animation is the anime \u201cYuushibu\u201d or \u201cI couldn\u2019t become a hero, So I reluctantly decided to get a job\u201d. The bad though, Is that it seems that to rise the amount of BD sold, the uncensored version of this show airing on AT-X is using rather high end brightness which tend to render many of the beautiful screen captures found of this show too bright and useless to many.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is great, The voice actors are top notch and we are joined by Rias Gremory Voice actress \u201cYoko Hikasa\u201d, So far I haven\u2019t been disappointed with the choice of OP & ED either.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to two sorts of people, The first are the ecchi veterans who can appreciate the series and the second are the folks that don\u2019t mind women\u2019s bodies and are up for a cold beer or soda chill and let the visuals stimulate you and do the talking for the first hit of 2017 on Ecchi goodness.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re anal and don\u2019t like Ecchi anime, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this anime at all costs.  It is most like not your coup of tea. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well its been a while since i've seen something with this much uncensored glory... Just kidding. but it is one of the few new seasonal anime that fulfill this desire of mine. Basically this anime is a ecchi, uncensored fanservice oriented anime. And thats all there is to it. If it were rated my my own standards it would get a 10 just because uncensored stuff is so hard to come by in 2017. But of course... it ain't my standards you wanna see so here goes. \r\nSTORY:\r\nIts honestly not that bad. Yea it's redundant (sorta), yea it replays some very overused elements from otherecchi animes, but If it were a standalone plot not considered in context of the anime's before it, then yea its a good story. Its not executed super well like some other amazingly ecchi animes with great plots, but plot wise this does make the cut of a fairly good plot. It has a storyline, it has a a protagonist and an antagonist, as well as a twist at the last episode so its not entirely trash. But then again keep in mind this was made to be fanservice, so cut the plot some slack. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nOkay, I originally was going to give it a 10 just because... well things... okay just because of the uncensored tits, but then I looked past that (wow, so uncharacteristic) and i did have some complaints with it. First off, a solid 9/10 for uncensored titties and good quality art that comes from new technology and such. One point off for 1 thing: cutting corners/getting lazy. I dont know why, but the animation as the anime progressed got worse and worse. less actions were being animated, and it was pretty clear that the producer/animator wanted to get this over with. It was annoying and a small thing, but it was still persistent enough to bother me, especially in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGave it an 8, I don't really watch anime to listen to sounds. The voice actors were good I guess, nothing was really bad about it. It was more the ending song that bothered me. Its a personal preference but I just didn't like the way it sounds, and who was singing it. Other than that though...it was good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell... its good and bad. On the good side, there is a certain degree of character development for most of the characters, all the main ones as well as a good few side characters. Designs were great with the suits and stuff. On the other hand, the character development is pretty short, and not exactly well written to a point where it is believable. But what do you really expect with an anime geared toward fanservice? what? no one cares? yea i thought so... sadly\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed it. There are alot of things that could have been improved, there are alot of things that could have been done better, but overall, I enjoyed watching it. Again, a big factor in this is the uncensored-ness. It wasn't executed in a way that the great ecchi animes were, so I didn't enjoy it perfectly, and also the laziness at the end really bothered me. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I didn't like how there wasn't a male protagonist, or even a male sub-character to bask in the glory of all that uncensored goodness. I would like for that to be there\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWatch it for fanservice and you will like it. Watch it for plot and you probably won't. It's one of those kinds of anime. Personal grading is pretty much 3 for ecchi plot+ 2 for fantasy genre+ 5 for uncensored titties (ahem, i mean art) makes a good 10/10. but yea realistically, 1 for plot+ 1 for character +2 for art +3 for ecchi = 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nThis just isn't an anime for everyone, and certainly not one you want to watch with your parents. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "This is a paragon example of a great concept with amazing execution. It may seem like a generic ecchi anime on the surface, but it quickly evolves into a deep and thrilling story-driven work of art.\r\nStory:10 The story itself is one of the best of all time, it manages to use elements from both Catholic and Demonic mythologies to create an action-packed fight for power. But action isn't all this anime has to offer, the story focuses more-so on the characters' own development as individuals and how the different characters try to initiate and prevent the overtaking of hell. It's about a fallen angel strategicallyplotting her next move to go against the odds and find the place where she truly belongs.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10 The art is appropriately vibrant. The setting and characters both have near-top-tier design which are suiting to their respective roles/personalities. Their proportions and detailing are both great. You can really feel the chillyness of frost areas, and the oompf of magic attacks. To generalize, almost everything is above average, it's major eye-candy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a problem which affects most anime- The airing version has a couple bad frames that look out of place. These are usually fixed when the BD comes out though. *The censored version's censorship is somewhat abundant too.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10 The girls' voices come across as being clear and they all sound like they fit their respective bodies. The SFX all pop up at the right times and there aren't really any times where it feels like they've missed a sound opportunity. I'm being a bit humble in saying that there wasn't anything wrong with the sound; rather, it is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10 Each of the main and sub characters have aesthetically appealing designs as well as really nicely fleshed-out archetype personalities. How characters react to each of the twists and turns is somewhat predictable because of this though. The creators did a stellar job of implementing personalities based around the Seven Deadly Sins without making the characters too overboard or eccentric. Their attitudes make it that much easier to get involved with the serious feeling of the story.\\n\r\nTheir costumes are all on the skimpy side, but they still manage to reflect and reinforce the characters' personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10 This has been an absolute rollercoaster of fun so far, and it looks like things are just getting started! The story and characters are amazing.  The art and sound are absolutely delicious. It's hard to find anything about this anime which can't be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10 This anime is above par in all of it's aspects. It wouldn't be an overstatement to say it is an absolute masterpiece that's easily one of the top 10 anime to have ever aired. \\n\r\nEven if someone dislikes a certain aspect of this show whether it be demons/angels, fight scenes, ecchi, ect...- There are still tons of other high-quality features which can be enjoyed.",

            "content": "Every media, every anime has it's sins. In this anime...seven isn't enough...\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai, not to be confused with Nanatsu no Taizai the shounen anime, is a fanserviced up to quite literal hell about the Seven Deadly Sins, more specifically how Lucifer became the Leader of the Seven Deadly Sins and the Demon Lord of Pride by tagging along and more or less torturing an innocent church girl by the name of Maria Totsuka.\r\nBefore LA gets to sinning this anime, LA would point out the few, albeit \"good\" things Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai did. For one, the anime has shown it's research into Hellin many aspects, from the Demon Lords as to how the Demon Lords of Melancholy and Vanity are even here which calls back to Eight Evil thoughts by Evagrius Ponticus and why Envy isn't a Demon Lord yet and the most obvious artistic liberty Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai did is with Dante's Inferno by referencing Cocytus as well as the Gates of Hell a la Circles of Hell. Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai's artistic liberties and referencing of Christian Hell is by in a ways a good alternative look into Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai's world and this draw adds into some of the Demon Lords. As such the Demon Lords Satan, Belphegor and Astaroth are probably the best character developed focused episodes as well as the most likable characters as they kinda followed suit to their symbolism to their sins respectively with Astaroth being LA's favourite character just from her likable personality as well as the best episode focused on her in this entire series however...she has her flaws but that a bit later.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sinning this anime. This anime is inconsistent as hell pardon the pun, but from episodes where yes they focused on the Sin of the Week, the inconsistency arises the quality of the episodes in question from outright horrible viewing experience to all-round good episodes and this affects the Sins in question as well. The Sins to fall victim to this are Asmodeus (Lust) because yes...the Lust episode is EXACTLY what you think to happen in a TNA anime, Mammon (Greed) for it's quality control broken (mainly the rigid fight scenes and plot stupidly off putting) and Mammon's development is rushed to all hell and Beelzebub (Gluttony) for being the reverse symbolism of her sins lore and being a rather fillery episode for her. Next sin and this is more obvious to a certain character and that's Maria, the tag along character and one of the main narrative-focused characters in the anime, she's a plain Mary Sue, that's kinda a problem in the outset but the biggest problem lies in the fact that she's tagged along for the ride and her motivations or development only concerns Lucifer nothing else...a perfect definition of a one-note character and she stands like this for the majority of the anime. Next sin goes obvious to the TNA part of this anime and it's all over the place, what's worse?...it's censored with these spinning red glyphs that gets in the way of it, LA gets WHY they did it, to make people buy the uncensored Blu-ray vers. of it but this practice pretty much needs to stop even in these ecchi-fest anime, as there is just no point when ohhh LA doesn't know, how about when we see violence here such as someone being stabbed in major detail (with blood pouring out of the stab wound) to some torturous BDSM imagery and fetishes shown in \"subtle detail\" <LA looks at Charon & Circles of Hell> and THAT isn't censored yet TNA is, but yeah it's for the sales right?...geez this anime's censorship has Greed's prints all over it.  Next sin would go to Leviathan (Envy), she's the psycho lesbian of the anime and is completely in love with Lucifer but has to contend with Maria thus her envy, she is just an annoyance every scene she's in and she NEVER changes (though her psycho lesbian tendencies goes from yandere to tsundere), nonetheless one of the most annoying characters in the series. Next sin would go to Belial (Vainglory) and her motivations and backstory of her really, she's a one-note villain much like Maria is a one-note main protagonist, her motivations are just soo one-note it just makes her villainy all the more apparent and just to say \"I'm the MAJOR VILLAIN...right?\", her backstory feels half-assed in many aspects though some of the symbolism \"saves\" her but not enough, if you think Maria is bad as a bland character, LA thought Belial was much worse. The last sin would go to the ending in some ways, as much as it wanted to go out in a bang, the anime just found new ways for LA to question this notion, as such making us pity Lucifer to Belial and even Maria but was kinda undone by the finale anyways in many aspects and worst off was make Astaroth be a yes man to Belial but LA won't put THAT against her as again \"symbolism\" saved her from the disdain LA had towards the ending...NO the pure scorn LA had for this ending came in form of Maria and that \"miracle\" of an ass pull ending.\\n\\n\r\n In terms of animation by TNK and Artland, the animation has it's high points with very exotic character designs (sans Belial's Gnosis outfit) and some of the backgrounding was very well done in some areas. Where the animation fell flat is in it's non-impactful battles as they mostly rely on beam-spamming to perspective-focused shots when some battles needed a wide-angel view of the impact, it is in a ways cutting corners for the battle scenes and probably next to the censored TNA, the battle scenes were lacking. To say the least, LA wanted to end the animation talk a bit more gracefully as it was mediocre to slightly above average at times but from what LA heard, Artland filed for bankruptcy, making this their last spurt...saddening but inevitably due to the reception Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai got.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, ok so for Spring 2017, you know how LA had been hinting on Akane Fujita's voice acting, well her as Leviathan was probably the worst LA has seen her as, yes her annoying tendencies were THAT bad, but the worst voice actor would go to quite easily Megumi Toda as Maria, she was just straight up bland in most of her performance in which LA doesn't blame the voice actor as she didn't have much to work with but nonetheless. Ohh Shizuka Ito, LA wanted to like Belial and Shizuka Ito's prima donna villainy vocals weren't enough for LA to say that this is one of her most narmy and displeasing roles LA had seen from her (right next to her role as Suzuna Hiiragi from Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou (anyone remember that atrocity?)). On  the brighter note, Azusa Tadokoro as Astaroth, Eri Kitamura as Lucifer, Arisa Sakurada as Satan and Ai Kakuma as Belphegor were all great as their characters with Azusa Tadokoro being LA's favourite voice actor no matter how little screentime she got. Overall as much of a mixed bag of voice cast this anime has, the vocal work was ok if you withstand the \"moaning\" if you know what LA means...\\n\\n\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai is as much of an inconsistent mess as much as it's plot and as much LA likes the symbolism of this anime to the few likable characters given, it's \"symbolism\" and it's few developed to likable characters are NOT enough for LA to give it the grace LA would had given it. To be frank this anime like it's inconsistency fell into lots of titles for LA, from one of LA's guiltiest pleasures of Spring 2017, to one of the Top 3 worst animes of Spring 2017 to just \"meh ecchi series\" and really the fatal blow to Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai was it's ending that caused LA to say that Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai belongs in the Top 3 Worst Animes of Spring 2017 for LA, it has glimmers of a good TNA guilty pleasure anime with some Dante Inferno Sin lore but ultimately those glimmers were not enough for the mess of a plot, bland to annoying to lacking character development to half of it's cast, unnecessary censorship, lacking animation, how mean spirited it is and that asspull of an ending. \\n\\n\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai tries to be an anime with fanservice FIRST before having a plot to go with it, which is odd considering all the research they did to make the Seven Deadly Sins lore as well as the fanservice being obviously marred by the stupid censorship and \"crossing the line twice moments\". But you just can't expect much from an anime where the focus is primarily on the forced TNA and Blu-ray sales.\\n\\n\r\nWhich Circle of Hell would Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai be best put in? Fourth or Fifth?",

But if you love hot girls with supernatural powers fighting it out while stripping each others' clothes off, this anime is for you, at least the first half.\r\nThe underlying concept of an all girls anime with extremely lewd, erotic scenes and yet no explicit sex has rarely been done before, and Nanatsu no Taizai was so well executed I was really amazed by it at first. The lewd outfits and erotic scenesincluding tentacles and aphrodisiacs rivals hentai anime, indeed, this anime turned me on more than any hentai ever has.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the animation, story, and even erotic content decreased in quality as time went by, and ended with disappointment. I don't know much about directing anime and storyboarding, but the poor animation and still frames in the last few episodes really stuck out. I loved the erotic content so I didn't care for the story, but because even the erotic content was lessened, there was nothing to save the anime in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI was a big fan at the start, and I still love the erotic scenes in the first few episodes that are even better than hentai, and so I still recommend watching the first few episodes, but watching until the end might not be worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nI still give it a high rating of 8/10 for the first few episodes, because I had never seen anything else like it.",

After the first two episodes nobody keeps watching for anything other than the nudity since that's the only enjoyable thing you've seen at that point but then you've already seen half the nudity of the season because it starts trying to lean onthe story instead of the one thing that made it worth watching at all.\\n\\n\r\nAh this story is hard to describe... after the first episode I wanted to rate the story minus 5 billion because it was just randomly thrown together scenes, however after some time it is made clear that underneath it is an actual plot. Around 20% of what happens is actually somehow related to the plot, even if it's done in absolutely retardedly incoherent, inconsistent and illogically roundabout ways. The characters are beyond saving because every action they perform is to either get caught in tentacles that somehow dissolve their clothes or they attempt to do something related to the story. I do give a single point for the actual plot but it's buried beneath a mountain of idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice: Just go watch hentai instead, many of them have a story that is at least coherent and the scenes go those important 3% further.",

I was not planning to write a review for MAL, it's the first (And I hope the last for a months) But, seeing what happens, I feel the need to do so.\r\nI apologize in advance for my horrible English.\r\nOk, in first place we have something that alredy all people who had watched ecchi of all types knows: An ecchi yuri anime with more \"plot\" than plot.\r\nIt's something not so usual than a harem, but normal, nothing special.\r\nIn that case... What's the problem? Nothing. It's only other anime like Queen's Blade. But the people doesn't stop to hate. They hate something that praise inother series. Too hypocritical. And there's the people who think this is the NNT shonen, it's fun.\\n\\n\r\nReturning to my \"first impressions\", the design is the best of this show, excellent art, 9/10.\\n\r\nThe story and characters personality is normal. The sound... same.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy this type of anime, go ahead, you'll like it. And a fact that I like it's... they don't have a principal male character (Who sometimes ruins the story trying to \"steal the show\")\\n\r\nDon't wait so much of this Nanatsu No Taizai, only give it a chance and enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Saludos\"",

As she fights against the top demons of hell known as the sins. The over all anime has great animations and colours the sounds and music choice is impeccable, the characters are so deep and constantly changing that you feel instantly coneccted to them. The story isso deep and rich with twists and turns as well as many trials for lucifer as she changes because of them to become the most powerful demon in hell. Overall this anime with its amazing character development and plot it definently is one of the more enjoyable anime being released at the moment and can't wait to see where the story goes.",

Those wrap up the plus points. Trying to find negatives you will find tons. If want to watch this one-time watch show,keep your mind away from you while watching as there is no logic to it at all!! Very bad representation of the Ecchi genre. Moreover a confusing tile. Many viewers confused it for Seven Deadly Sins (Nanatsu no Taizai) a shonen anime which is really good as this series was in Japanese was called (Sin - Nanatsu no Taizai). The English translation did all it could to the title to avoid confusion with the other series. If you wanna watch this series, watch it in one go, or you'll be simply wasting your time!!",

            "content": "When I first heard about this anime, I thought that it would be an interesting take on Christianity and Hell Fire with anime girls. I was sort of right. All I got was fan service with some of what I expected. I mean the best way I can describe this that I got what I wanted and nothing more.\r\nStory: Honestly this one is a mess as it goes all over the place. If it wanted to be monster of a week, fine by me. Instead there were some stuff shoehorned last minute in the last few episodes and some confusing motivations. Not only that, therewere way too many cop outs and cheap endings from an anime that should of have some action which makes the experience not that exciting at times. Though it is a meh, don't watch this anime for the story and only the concept.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Again meh. When I first saw the concept art, I thought it was okay until I saw the actually anime which is less appealing in my taste. I thought that it would look cutesy and all but instead it is way too detailed and not that moe. The animation is a big meh with some exceptions as the budget seemed to have gone to some other aspects. When it does get good, it's good but it barely happens. I have heard that it went over budget so that might be the case.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Meh. I did like some of the songs, mostly the cute ones. The voice acting however is really good at least. Just want to point out that the English dub acting is funnier as some of the actresses really put some personality either it be better than the sub or something new.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'll start with the good. When they act like demons, it's very sexual but it is what I expect. One of the few things I want to see in this series is to see demons getting all hell fire up on yo ass. This series did have some of those moments. Each demon character represent their own sins pretty well in addition of having an interesting interpretation of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws is that they did not take advantage of this. There is the fact that they are one dimensional, the fan service gets in the way, and they are suppose to be the good guys. See, I'm okay with demons or bad people being heroes, but it does not work here for many reasons. Their motivations made no sense at times so what is the point, they are way too evil for that, and also they are freaking demons! It's their job to torture people in hell, but nope. The only real demon is into torture while the others are not into it. Ladies, it's your job.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have the main human character, Maria, who is for the most part is bland but her character development is Stockholm syndrome. Also the worse character in my opinion is that demon with blue armor that barely covers her. I just find her annoying, bratty, and not that appealing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: When it delivers, it delivers. When it doesn't, it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It just gives us what we ask for. That is it. It doesn't do more and sadly less. Do I recommend it, you may need to have some tolerance and not take the series seriously. I ended up comparing this series to Spongebob. Kind of personally enjoy this series despite some of the issues and I don't really care for the fanservice unless I joke around.",

At times felt like anime parody, other times tried to hard to be serious/emotionally.\r\n#Starts fine but you lose interest rather fast\r\n#Infinite Deus ex machina\r\n#Yes it has lots of nudity, but eventually you become accustomed to it andthe rest of the show has nothing to offer so\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThis will definetly be a show that I wont remember for long. Always on the lookout for nice yuri I saw this show and immediatly gave it a try. I am a fan of sexy and appealing art and at first glance this seemed promising. And hey, the first episode wasn\u00b4t even that bad, but what followed didn\u00b4t have much to offer. \\n\r\nAt times I even thought that I am watching a parody. Some episodes do have a certain theme. So without further spoilering just to give you an example one episode was about music and idols, another ep. about games. \\n\r\nWell I can live with that, because we also have to take in account that this show provides you with ecchi and nudity all the time. But then again there are scenes where the anime is trying way to hard to be emotional and serious and that didn\u00b4t click for me.\\n\r\nI didn\u00b4t like the female lead much. She was a lil bit of a badass, but not very feminine. You could have swapped her with a male mc and it wouldn\u00b4t have made any difference I guess. \\n\r\nI  didn\u00b4t understand what this show wants to be. IMO it\u00b4s just plain bad and boring. And that one phenomen that people call \"Deus Ex Machina\", it happend A LOT.\\n\r\nIf you\u00b4re here for ecchi only, that\u00b4s okay, but I bet there are better shows with greater value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n+++ So then tell me Kokosnuss who would you recommend this for? +++\\n\r\n#Well if  you look more for a visual appeal than an actual story. (-> fapshow, character designs are pretty good)\\n\r\n#If you like all girl shows (<- This is me. Cuz fuck those whiney ass male mcs) \\n\\n\\n\r\n- - - I would not recommend this to you if you look for yuri - - -\\n\r\n#Yes it has affection between characters, yet it\u00b4s not about romance.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Hopefully it will get better as it goes on but watching this anime really does ruin my fucking day.\r\nStory - 2 : Crap at best, uninteresting and confusing. Am I missing something? I feel like there is a hell of a lot to be explained, everything just happens for no reason in this anime. People who can enjoy this story must really be dull upstairs. Perhaps more of EVERYTHING will be explained later on, and it better do well.\r\nArt - 7 : Industry Standard, cant really complain,good tiddies, although they're all massive. (Flat is justice)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 : Once again, industry standard, can't complain, everything goes nicely and matches up etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2 : I get they're physically 2D characters but did you have make their personalities so 2 dimensional as well? The most interesting character was levi, and she was shit. Every other character I've seen so far are of typical tropes and obscene body figures, with no personality and no clear motive in what the fuck they're doing. Just a shit waifu-fest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1 : There's a reason I dropped this. See above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was going to be a good anime, but for once I'm saying that obscene fucking fan service has got in the way of a good plot and decent characters and their development, which is odd because I love the ecchi series, but this one just really isnt doing it for me.

            "content": "That moment you realize you've been rooting for Hell to win....\r\nI'm surprised that i'm only now watching this. I enjoyed this.\r\nThe art is awesome, Especially when you realize this is very echi material in this and shows like that tend to be very low budget and very lazy art. If i had one complaint then i'd say its turn the fucking lighting down ffs. There are some scenes it can be hard to see anything. \r\nI like all the characters and all but one of the Seven Sins.\r\nLucifer ( Pride) :\r\nShe being the main character means that she should be a fun character to haveon screen. For the most part she is. I can't really recall anytime i found her to be annoying or have any flaw in her character really. I don't like how defenseless she can be. Especially when she is meant to be the strongest Angel ( Now Demon Lord) The amount of times she could've been killed but wasn't because of the villain is a ton. Also i got really confused with her name. Cause she is called Lucifer when that is the name of the Devil aka Satan. So i thought we were getting some alternate version of the bible that has the Devil/Satan start out in the modern day and some type of weird crap happens with time and even though it starts out in modern day it also affects the past or some dumb crap. But nope cause later we find out that a character named Satan is in this. Doesn't explain shit and i guess it's for the best. \\n\\n\r\nLeviathan ( Envy ):\\n\r\nShe is one of the two companions that Lucifer has. She can get annoying at times i'd say but for the most part she is a good comic relief character. Kind of sad that she doesn't have some ultimate form where when she is pissed she turns into some type of Leviathan that you'd find in old stories.\\n\\n\r\nAstaroth ( Melancholy ) : \\n\r\nNot much to say about her. She was the first Sin we are introduced too that isn't all that rude. Makes sense cause her name is melancholy. Not the most interesting character but she isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSatan ( Wrath ):\\n\r\nHaving someone named Satan and not having their attribute be Wrath is just plain wrong. Only other thing that would work for someone with such a name would be Slyness. I like her. Defiantly up there with my favorite. I especially like her character design. Her job of guarding the Gates of Hell also seems to be a very fitting position.\\n\\n\r\nAsmodeus ( Lust ) :\\n\r\nShe's a whore, Not much else to say...... Well i guess i do like her character but is one of the more forgettable conquest that Lucifer has to overcome and as a result not leaving much of an impact on the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nBeelzebub ( Gluttony ) :\\n\r\nIt'd figures that Japan would give the sin with the biggest reputation of being gross over indulgence to a cute and petite looking loli. She's also 1st or 2nd best girl and if you disagree then you're wrong. Also the only normal character among the group of sins. \\n\\n\r\nBelphegor ( Sloth) :\\n\r\nThe fuck is that tail ? That shit bugs me and i'm not even sure why. But the girl is fun and probably has one of the funnest conquest that Lucifer has to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nMammon ( Greed ) : \\n\r\nNow for Greed i'm not sure why but i like'd her character. Even with her having a forgettable Conquest. I don't know what it is about her. Also her putting people into dreams to take care of her babies by breast feeding the victims is an interesting power....\\n\\n\r\nBelial ( Vanity ) :\\n\r\nWith her it's just... She isn't all that exciting or interesting of a villain. The plot with her is so obvious that other characters start calling her out on not noticing it. For her to be the incarnation of Vanity she's also not all that special looking. You'd think she'd be more beautiful like a Princess then looking like a discount slut. She's also just not that great of a character overall. I guess she's not as bad as i make her out to be but i feel that they could've made her better.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the one human character in this.\\n\\n\r\nMaria ( She's a human so obviously this spot is N/A)\\n\r\nI like her and she is an awesome partner for Lucifer. I ship them and even the show does. I just wish we got more of her on the screen and i'd even love for us to see her interacting with her friends and family that have no idea where she went and see their reactions to Lucifer being around her.\\n\\n\r\nReally the plot where God and Heaven are wanting to destroy earth is something i find to be dumb. It's like they had God just be a cliche typical villain that want's to destroy Humanity for X reason. We don't even see him. \\n\\n\r\nI kind of wish we got a ending with both Maria and Lucifer together. I feel it'd be better. \\n\\n\r\nShow also has some pretty awesome music, Especially that ED.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a pretty fun show that i'm not sure why has such low reviews. If it's because you are watching the censored version then i feel that's not much of a reason and just find it somewhere else to watch. I defiantly see this being more at a position around a 7.4 - 8.0.",

            "content": "I firstly wanna open this review up by asking why this anime had such low ratings? Sure there's much better out there but its not half bad and over average if you ask me.\r\nThere's something you gotta understand about this show before you go into it, it's more or less a hentai anime with a plot, kinda like Highschool DXD but with the added yuri element. Yep that's right this has yuri, infact that was my main reasons for giving this one a shot.\r\nMy favorite character in this show was Levi, she actually made it into my top ten characters. Levi is the one whomakes the magic happen in this show, my that i mean she pretty much wants to f**k the main character who happens to be a bad ass chick. \\n\\n\r\nThere's more to it than yuri though. If you can get past the titties and booty its got a decent plot, the summery on MAL is pretty dull so i'll round it up for ya. Basically without spoiling anything, the main girl Lucifer is cast out of heaven for disobeying gods will, and so she wants revenge but ends up getting tricked by the primary antagonist Belial. So one by one Luci has to defeat each deadly sin which Belial controls in order to free herself from the curse placed on her. Each fight is different and pans out pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending sucked alittle for me due to the fact i know it probably wont get a season 2. But its early days so i guess we'll see.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot ya pervert!",

And that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it a favorable review. The characters are unique and...healthy and the show delivers on what it offers. If one liked shows like FREEZING, MAKEN-KI or SEKIREI then you are in for a treat. It\u2019s better than all three of those shows! It tells a better storywith better characters in a better setting. The action is fierce and tense. It\u2019s a home run for what it offers. I\u2019m scoring it lower than it deserves because I watched a censored version and because I can understand some people will be put off, if not outright offended by this title. That\u2019s kind of where I stand. If you like this sort of thing, you\u2019ll like this title. If you don\u2019t then you won\u2019t.",

I\u2019m only protecting what he will destroy.\u201d\r\n- Lucifer, the Demon Lord of Pride \r\nSin: Nanatsu No Taizai or Seven Mortal Sins follows the story of Lucifer, the proud fallen angel from Heaven, on her mission of becoming the Leader of the Seven Mortal Sins of Hell.\r\nThere a few types of anime fans that have seen this; the onewho watched it and hated it, the one who have mistaken this from the Nanatsu No Taizai/Seven Deadly Sins anime, the one who finished it because of the ecchi genre and the one who finished it because of the plot. And I belong to the latter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was good because we\u2019re talking about the Seven Deadly Sins, considering there was a lot of fan service given. Many would say, \u201cThis should have been made a hentai.\u201d Yes, maybe, but if you are an anime-nerd like me loves binge watching a lot of anime; then you can give this a shot. But beware of the ecchiness right from the beginning. Though there was less of the fan service in the later end of the series. If you loved the story and logic of the Deadly Sins of humans, then I recommend you give this a shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good enough to satisfy the fan service shown to us. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme suited well the ecchi genre of the anime. And the soundtrack was lit. It suited well the action scenes of the anime. Considering the fan service, the soundtrack gave light in the story and fight scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply lovable. Fan service aside, each mortal sin and their side stories are simply relatable. Well maybe because we are all sinners which why we can relate to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the enjoyment of this anime would be what type of anime fan are you? Are you the one who watches because of the genres? Or are you the one who finishes because of the plot? Everyone has their own tastes in watching an anime. And I\u2019m one of those who liked this because of its plot. And I also hope there would be a season 2 because the plot really picked up the story in the last episode. It\u2019s not that good but is enough to satisfy your anime cravings.\\n",

The main objective for Lucifer is a little more complex than what it seems at first. There are some plot twists. \r\nWith echi as the driving element, I cannot recommend this to anyone really, but if you get past that element, its actually kinda decent. \r\n(I rate the characters themselves very high because they each stand out in their appropriate areas of personality. So it seems fitting. \r\nSPOILER:\\n\r\nIt is an interesting spin to basically put heaven as the bad guys in the end and the demon lords as the good guys.",

            "content": "This is definitely not kid's material.\r\nThis anime is... incredibly odd. It has high amount of erotic content and its quality is all over the place. Erotic content that it isn't your usual \"ecchi\" anime, but that there's a LOT of on-screen nudity and generally almost nobody makes a big deal of it. However despite that it is not porn/hentai title. The story quality also varies wildly and is all over the place. Basically it can be anywhere between \"This is actually kinda cool\" and \"this is actually fairly bad\".\r\nThe cast is all-female, and the show deals with angels/demons.\r\nDetailed breakdown below.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story is somewhat similarin execution to Queen's Blade, Valkyrie Drive and Masou Gakuen HxH. Except it is better than \"Valkyrie drive\", and worse than Queen's Blade, and has smaller amount of heavily erotic content than Gakuen HxH.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality is all over the place, and same applies to story. For first 7 or 8 episodes the anime can't decide what it is supposed to be, and in each episode tries completely different thing/genre. In the last episodes it turns into some sort of nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nThe story actually has its moments on occasion, where you see something related to heavenly or demonic realms and you could actually think this is sorta looks cool. Next moment, however, the anime decides to introduce a scene that is a tad too far into bondage territory for comfort. This happens a lot. Episodes at the beginning also have very different themes, and some of them are actually onto something. For example, rather than focusing on nudity the anime can suddenly concentrate on music, or on almost shounen-style fights. It is actually quite odd, but makes certain episodes more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, speaking about wildly varying quality, the stuff protagonists do to Earth/humanity can be quite grim.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10:\\n\r\nThe art actually looks good, backgrounds and characters designs are interesting. I liked certain costumes a lot due to color/design choices they made, and one of the \"7 sins\" looked actually interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nI actually liked some of the tunes, when they introduce Organ into the mix, soundtrack starts sounding quite interesting. However, the's a huge problem with a voice actress that voiced Lust. She speaks in stereotypical \"sexy mature woman voice\", which will probably tick off most of the people, because there are episodes where she talks a LOT.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10:\\n\r\nCharacters are not good. The human girl in the cast (I think she is supposed to be the main character) is incredibly whiny, annoying and useless. Everybody else pretty much acts according to their fairly rigid :role\", meaning there won't be that many surprises, and a lot of characters have little personality. Then again I saw worse characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10:\\n\r\nIt was interesting enough, although first 7 or so episodes were much more interesting that the rest of the show. Closer to the end it became messy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10:\\n\r\nIf you're offended by nudity, don't watch it. \\n\r\nThe main reason to check this out is if you watched Masou Gakuen or Queen's blade and wouldn't mind something somewhat similar to them -- meaning with erotic/ecchi content, but not porn, and with a story that is not fully brain-dead.\\n\\n\r\nFor this niche the anime is not bad.",

It's not about the theme or characterization which has done maybe little bit below the standard and maybe somewhat better than that anime. But, they still using female characters' overly-curvaeous body as their main selling value and too much fanservice. Even I who like big oppai like Ai-chan's or Jeanne's so much just feel disgusted by this anime.\r\n(In myopinion, maybe only Leviathan and Asmodeus which only could be a woman, others? Nope, how about Maria? Okay, maybe that's acceptable. Lucifer and other devils should be a man. Why? I see the potential if they did like that.)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has so many potentials that not used properly and they just like selling almost being hentai anime. Well, the studio did their job not properly and maybe the director is drunk when working on this. \\n\\n\r\nCongrats, Artland, you failed on your 'saving yourselves from bankruptcy' project, which I mean, this anime. You keep falling to the hole of bankcruptcy just for this anime, well, to be exact, you should handle another anime rather than this, or at least, modify it so, it's just not always about 'showing whores in an anime'.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting animation is so bad until i want to say 'What the f**k', and this anime's graphic is standard. I am surprised that the seiyuu of Rias Gremory, Emi Yusa, Mio Akiyama, and Seraphim (Yoko Hikasa), Chtolly and Ruru(Azusa Tadakoro), Sagiri and Sistine (Akane Fujita) casted here and making a bad reputation for them due of this anime is the worst of the season.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I should say, this anime has a ruined potential, if this anime wasn't created for almost hentai purpose, I would give a thumb up. Want to beat DxD? Still way too far from it, unless you talk about the ecchi-fanservice content.\\n\\n\r\nEven DxD, Asterisk, Saijaku, Rakudai, and some similiar ecchi anime give a decent plot, and rather watch those anime than this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that make the plot and else was good is only they characterizise themselves, same as the mythology said but kinda of ecchi. Only perverts that who consumed by their lust who enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai \u201cThe Seven Mortal Sins\u201d\r\nBackstory and Information:\r\nHobby Japan has finally delivered and now this year Spring of 2017 with the help of TNK the studio behind \u201cHigh School DxD\u201d alongside with Artland. This series being far older than the now widely known Netflix\u2019s Seven Deadly Sins, Hobby Japan responsible for series such as Queen\u2019s Blade, Hyakka Ryouran \u201cSamurai Girls\u201d and Demon King Daimaou or \u201cIchiban Ushiro Daimaou, Whatever it is you have seen, Hobby Japan has a history with high tier Ecchi andwho can forget their amazing figurines that radiate quality.\\n\\n\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai being a series that had over the years been teased to the fans on multiple instances as this series is from a Video Game, It has left us waiting many years because of dilemmas. Whether this series could be delivered in shorts or OVA\u2019s it remained to be seen.  With a Manga introduction in August 29th of 2016, Published by Hobby Japan it brought forth light to the people who were getting tired of holding their breath and later confirmed when Visuals once again teased a incoming anime series. The issue grew deeper whether the anime would adapt the video game or the new fresh manga, Categorized \u201cShounen\u201d and on February 2017 a \u201cSeinen\u201d version is being put out by \u201cMedia Factory\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nPlot + Pros:\\n\r\n\u201cThe prideful archangel Lucifer disobeys God and is cast into the lowest level of hell as a fallen angel. On her way to hell, Lucifer happens to meet a high school girl on Earth named Maria, who helps her. In hell, Lucifer meets Leviathan, and Leviathan explains to Lucifer about The Seven Deadly Sins, the seven demon king rulers of hell. After The Seven Deadly Sins seal Lucifer's powers, Lucifer goes on a journey with Maria and Leviathan to defeat them.\u201d Courtesy of Anime News Network\\n\\n\r\nIt seems pretty cut and dry, as one can guess the story here is one of revenge with juicy details native to Hobby Japan\u2019s Ecchi ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). \\n\\n\r\nThe Question now becomes what will the anime reflect, One of the two manga or the video game?. The answer is a little of all three and this series approaches the viewer with more visual appeal rather than complex storytelling as the series holds to present a simple point and questions the tittle of the sins and whether if any of the seven should be indeed be worthy of pulling a human soul towards Hell.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the main character isn\u2019t on full out display as of yet, due to we have a duo of Lucifer and the human Maria leading the show, This show is executing a learning process between human and Lucifer as they unravel sin by sin and accept that nature isn\u2019t sinful as it make up each one of us. While showcasing high tier ecchi for the delight of many of us to see, It is well accompanied by doubt and self-discovery of each of the demon lords as they learn from their defeats that their existence isn\u2019t anything to be ashamed about and shows us growth from a Lucifer who sees herself as one cast out for not belonging to the herd and being an individual thinker.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series advances it pseudo - parodies \"Dante's Inferno\" in the Journey of Lucifer in place of Dante to recover her powers, Become head of the 7 Deadly sins and hold a goal of holding Heaven, God and the Archangel Michael accountable for kicking her out of heaven for simply having a opinion and most of all, for being individualistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Con:\\n\r\nWhile the series is visually stunning here and there and has a lot going for it, It mirrors another series in one aspect. This series is leaning more towards an original work and like Dragon Ball Super there is a lot of improvisation and often things fit in on rather rushed ways, As the Manga both put out by Hobby Japan and Media Factory don\u2019t have as much content for the series to draw from, So it often does fill in the blanks in a anime only format. \\n\\n\r\nExcept for the whole Dante's Inferno references from here and there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis series has a rather somewhat unique animation and has a lot of vibrant colors, Other series that count with the same type of animation is the anime \u201cYuushibu\u201d or \u201cI couldn\u2019t become a hero, So I reluctantly decided to get a job\u201d. The bad though, Is that it seems that to rise the amount of BD sold, the uncensored version of this show airing on AT-X is using rather high end brightness which tend to render many of the beautiful screen captures found of this show too bright and useless to many.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is great, The voice actors are top notch and we are joined by Rias Gremory Voice actress \u201cYoko Hikasa\u201d, So far I haven\u2019t been disappointed with the choice of OP & ED either.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to two sorts of people, The first are the ecchi veterans who can appreciate the series and the second are the folks that don\u2019t mind women\u2019s bodies and are up for a cold beer or soda chill and let the visuals stimulate you and do the talking for the first hit of 2017 on Ecchi goodness.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re anal and don\u2019t like Ecchi anime, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this anime at all costs.  It is most like not your coup of tea. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well its been a while since i've seen something with this much uncensored glory... Just kidding. but it is one of the few new seasonal anime that fulfill this desire of mine. Basically this anime is a ecchi, uncensored fanservice oriented anime. And thats all there is to it. If it were rated my my own standards it would get a 10 just because uncensored stuff is so hard to come by in 2017. But of course... it ain't my standards you wanna see so here goes. \r\nSTORY:\r\nIts honestly not that bad. Yea it's redundant (sorta), yea it replays some very overused elements from otherecchi animes, but If it were a standalone plot not considered in context of the anime's before it, then yea its a good story. Its not executed super well like some other amazingly ecchi animes with great plots, but plot wise this does make the cut of a fairly good plot. It has a storyline, it has a a protagonist and an antagonist, as well as a twist at the last episode so its not entirely trash. But then again keep in mind this was made to be fanservice, so cut the plot some slack. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nOkay, I originally was going to give it a 10 just because... well things... okay just because of the uncensored tits, but then I looked past that (wow, so uncharacteristic) and i did have some complaints with it. First off, a solid 9/10 for uncensored titties and good quality art that comes from new technology and such. One point off for 1 thing: cutting corners/getting lazy. I dont know why, but the animation as the anime progressed got worse and worse. less actions were being animated, and it was pretty clear that the producer/animator wanted to get this over with. It was annoying and a small thing, but it was still persistent enough to bother me, especially in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGave it an 8, I don't really watch anime to listen to sounds. The voice actors were good I guess, nothing was really bad about it. It was more the ending song that bothered me. Its a personal preference but I just didn't like the way it sounds, and who was singing it. Other than that though...it was good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell... its good and bad. On the good side, there is a certain degree of character development for most of the characters, all the main ones as well as a good few side characters. Designs were great with the suits and stuff. On the other hand, the character development is pretty short, and not exactly well written to a point where it is believable. But what do you really expect with an anime geared toward fanservice? what? no one cares? yea i thought so... sadly\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed it. There are alot of things that could have been improved, there are alot of things that could have been done better, but overall, I enjoyed watching it. Again, a big factor in this is the uncensored-ness. It wasn't executed in a way that the great ecchi animes were, so I didn't enjoy it perfectly, and also the laziness at the end really bothered me. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I didn't like how there wasn't a male protagonist, or even a male sub-character to bask in the glory of all that uncensored goodness. I would like for that to be there\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWatch it for fanservice and you will like it. Watch it for plot and you probably won't. It's one of those kinds of anime. Personal grading is pretty much 3 for ecchi plot+ 2 for fantasy genre+ 5 for uncensored titties (ahem, i mean art) makes a good 10/10. but yea realistically, 1 for plot+ 1 for character +2 for art +3 for ecchi = 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nThis just isn't an anime for everyone, and certainly not one you want to watch with your parents. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "This is a paragon example of a great concept with amazing execution. It may seem like a generic ecchi anime on the surface, but it quickly evolves into a deep and thrilling story-driven work of art.\r\nStory:10 The story itself is one of the best of all time, it manages to use elements from both Catholic and Demonic mythologies to create an action-packed fight for power. But action isn't all this anime has to offer, the story focuses more-so on the characters' own development as individuals and how the different characters try to initiate and prevent the overtaking of hell. It's about a fallen angel strategicallyplotting her next move to go against the odds and find the place where she truly belongs.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10 The art is appropriately vibrant. The setting and characters both have near-top-tier design which are suiting to their respective roles/personalities. Their proportions and detailing are both great. You can really feel the chillyness of frost areas, and the oompf of magic attacks. To generalize, almost everything is above average, it's major eye-candy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a problem which affects most anime- The airing version has a couple bad frames that look out of place. These are usually fixed when the BD comes out though. *The censored version's censorship is somewhat abundant too.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10 The girls' voices come across as being clear and they all sound like they fit their respective bodies. The SFX all pop up at the right times and there aren't really any times where it feels like they've missed a sound opportunity. I'm being a bit humble in saying that there wasn't anything wrong with the sound; rather, it is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10 Each of the main and sub characters have aesthetically appealing designs as well as really nicely fleshed-out archetype personalities. How characters react to each of the twists and turns is somewhat predictable because of this though. The creators did a stellar job of implementing personalities based around the Seven Deadly Sins without making the characters too overboard or eccentric. Their attitudes make it that much easier to get involved with the serious feeling of the story.\\n\r\nTheir costumes are all on the skimpy side, but they still manage to reflect and reinforce the characters' personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10 This has been an absolute rollercoaster of fun so far, and it looks like things are just getting started! The story and characters are amazing.  The art and sound are absolutely delicious. It's hard to find anything about this anime which can't be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10 This anime is above par in all of it's aspects. It wouldn't be an overstatement to say it is an absolute masterpiece that's easily one of the top 10 anime to have ever aired. \\n\r\nEven if someone dislikes a certain aspect of this show whether it be demons/angels, fight scenes, ecchi, ect...- There are still tons of other high-quality features which can be enjoyed.",

            "content": "Every media, every anime has it's sins. In this anime...seven isn't enough...\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai, not to be confused with Nanatsu no Taizai the shounen anime, is a fanserviced up to quite literal hell about the Seven Deadly Sins, more specifically how Lucifer became the Leader of the Seven Deadly Sins and the Demon Lord of Pride by tagging along and more or less torturing an innocent church girl by the name of Maria Totsuka.\r\nBefore LA gets to sinning this anime, LA would point out the few, albeit \"good\" things Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai did. For one, the anime has shown it's research into Hellin many aspects, from the Demon Lords as to how the Demon Lords of Melancholy and Vanity are even here which calls back to Eight Evil thoughts by Evagrius Ponticus and why Envy isn't a Demon Lord yet and the most obvious artistic liberty Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai did is with Dante's Inferno by referencing Cocytus as well as the Gates of Hell a la Circles of Hell. Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai's artistic liberties and referencing of Christian Hell is by in a ways a good alternative look into Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai's world and this draw adds into some of the Demon Lords. As such the Demon Lords Satan, Belphegor and Astaroth are probably the best character developed focused episodes as well as the most likable characters as they kinda followed suit to their symbolism to their sins respectively with Astaroth being LA's favourite character just from her likable personality as well as the best episode focused on her in this entire series however...she has her flaws but that a bit later.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sinning this anime. This anime is inconsistent as hell pardon the pun, but from episodes where yes they focused on the Sin of the Week, the inconsistency arises the quality of the episodes in question from outright horrible viewing experience to all-round good episodes and this affects the Sins in question as well. The Sins to fall victim to this are Asmodeus (Lust) because yes...the Lust episode is EXACTLY what you think to happen in a TNA anime, Mammon (Greed) for it's quality control broken (mainly the rigid fight scenes and plot stupidly off putting) and Mammon's development is rushed to all hell and Beelzebub (Gluttony) for being the reverse symbolism of her sins lore and being a rather fillery episode for her. Next sin and this is more obvious to a certain character and that's Maria, the tag along character and one of the main narrative-focused characters in the anime, she's a plain Mary Sue, that's kinda a problem in the outset but the biggest problem lies in the fact that she's tagged along for the ride and her motivations or development only concerns Lucifer nothing else...a perfect definition of a one-note character and she stands like this for the majority of the anime. Next sin goes obvious to the TNA part of this anime and it's all over the place, what's worse?...it's censored with these spinning red glyphs that gets in the way of it, LA gets WHY they did it, to make people buy the uncensored Blu-ray vers. of it but this practice pretty much needs to stop even in these ecchi-fest anime, as there is just no point when ohhh LA doesn't know, how about when we see violence here such as someone being stabbed in major detail (with blood pouring out of the stab wound) to some torturous BDSM imagery and fetishes shown in \"subtle detail\" <LA looks at Charon & Circles of Hell> and THAT isn't censored yet TNA is, but yeah it's for the sales right?...geez this anime's censorship has Greed's prints all over it.  Next sin would go to Leviathan (Envy), she's the psycho lesbian of the anime and is completely in love with Lucifer but has to contend with Maria thus her envy, she is just an annoyance every scene she's in and she NEVER changes (though her psycho lesbian tendencies goes from yandere to tsundere), nonetheless one of the most annoying characters in the series. Next sin would go to Belial (Vainglory) and her motivations and backstory of her really, she's a one-note villain much like Maria is a one-note main protagonist, her motivations are just soo one-note it just makes her villainy all the more apparent and just to say \"I'm the MAJOR VILLAIN...right?\", her backstory feels half-assed in many aspects though some of the symbolism \"saves\" her but not enough, if you think Maria is bad as a bland character, LA thought Belial was much worse. The last sin would go to the ending in some ways, as much as it wanted to go out in a bang, the anime just found new ways for LA to question this notion, as such making us pity Lucifer to Belial and even Maria but was kinda undone by the finale anyways in many aspects and worst off was make Astaroth be a yes man to Belial but LA won't put THAT against her as again \"symbolism\" saved her from the disdain LA had towards the ending...NO the pure scorn LA had for this ending came in form of Maria and that \"miracle\" of an ass pull ending.\\n\\n\r\n In terms of animation by TNK and Artland, the animation has it's high points with very exotic character designs (sans Belial's Gnosis outfit) and some of the backgrounding was very well done in some areas. Where the animation fell flat is in it's non-impactful battles as they mostly rely on beam-spamming to perspective-focused shots when some battles needed a wide-angel view of the impact, it is in a ways cutting corners for the battle scenes and probably next to the censored TNA, the battle scenes were lacking. To say the least, LA wanted to end the animation talk a bit more gracefully as it was mediocre to slightly above average at times but from what LA heard, Artland filed for bankruptcy, making this their last spurt...saddening but inevitably due to the reception Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai got.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, ok so for Spring 2017, you know how LA had been hinting on Akane Fujita's voice acting, well her as Leviathan was probably the worst LA has seen her as, yes her annoying tendencies were THAT bad, but the worst voice actor would go to quite easily Megumi Toda as Maria, she was just straight up bland in most of her performance in which LA doesn't blame the voice actor as she didn't have much to work with but nonetheless. Ohh Shizuka Ito, LA wanted to like Belial and Shizuka Ito's prima donna villainy vocals weren't enough for LA to say that this is one of her most narmy and displeasing roles LA had seen from her (right next to her role as Suzuna Hiiragi from Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou (anyone remember that atrocity?)). On  the brighter note, Azusa Tadokoro as Astaroth, Eri Kitamura as Lucifer, Arisa Sakurada as Satan and Ai Kakuma as Belphegor were all great as their characters with Azusa Tadokoro being LA's favourite voice actor no matter how little screentime she got. Overall as much of a mixed bag of voice cast this anime has, the vocal work was ok if you withstand the \"moaning\" if you know what LA means...\\n\\n\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai is as much of an inconsistent mess as much as it's plot and as much LA likes the symbolism of this anime to the few likable characters given, it's \"symbolism\" and it's few developed to likable characters are NOT enough for LA to give it the grace LA would had given it. To be frank this anime like it's inconsistency fell into lots of titles for LA, from one of LA's guiltiest pleasures of Spring 2017, to one of the Top 3 worst animes of Spring 2017 to just \"meh ecchi series\" and really the fatal blow to Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai was it's ending that caused LA to say that Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai belongs in the Top 3 Worst Animes of Spring 2017 for LA, it has glimmers of a good TNA guilty pleasure anime with some Dante Inferno Sin lore but ultimately those glimmers were not enough for the mess of a plot, bland to annoying to lacking character development to half of it's cast, unnecessary censorship, lacking animation, how mean spirited it is and that asspull of an ending. \\n\\n\r\nSin: Nanatsu no Taizai tries to be an anime with fanservice FIRST before having a plot to go with it, which is odd considering all the research they did to make the Seven Deadly Sins lore as well as the fanservice being obviously marred by the stupid censorship and \"crossing the line twice moments\". But you just can't expect much from an anime where the focus is primarily on the forced TNA and Blu-ray sales.\\n\\n\r\nWhich Circle of Hell would Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai be best put in? Fourth or Fifth?",

But if you love hot girls with supernatural powers fighting it out while stripping each others' clothes off, this anime is for you, at least the first half.\r\nThe underlying concept of an all girls anime with extremely lewd, erotic scenes and yet no explicit sex has rarely been done before, and Nanatsu no Taizai was so well executed I was really amazed by it at first. The lewd outfits and erotic scenesincluding tentacles and aphrodisiacs rivals hentai anime, indeed, this anime turned me on more than any hentai ever has.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the animation, story, and even erotic content decreased in quality as time went by, and ended with disappointment. I don't know much about directing anime and storyboarding, but the poor animation and still frames in the last few episodes really stuck out. I loved the erotic content so I didn't care for the story, but because even the erotic content was lessened, there was nothing to save the anime in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI was a big fan at the start, and I still love the erotic scenes in the first few episodes that are even better than hentai, and so I still recommend watching the first few episodes, but watching until the end might not be worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nI still give it a high rating of 8/10 for the first few episodes, because I had never seen anything else like it.",

After the first two episodes nobody keeps watching for anything other than the nudity since that's the only enjoyable thing you've seen at that point but then you've already seen half the nudity of the season because it starts trying to lean onthe story instead of the one thing that made it worth watching at all.\\n\\n\r\nAh this story is hard to describe... after the first episode I wanted to rate the story minus 5 billion because it was just randomly thrown together scenes, however after some time it is made clear that underneath it is an actual plot. Around 20% of what happens is actually somehow related to the plot, even if it's done in absolutely retardedly incoherent, inconsistent and illogically roundabout ways. The characters are beyond saving because every action they perform is to either get caught in tentacles that somehow dissolve their clothes or they attempt to do something related to the story. I do give a single point for the actual plot but it's buried beneath a mountain of idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice: Just go watch hentai instead, many of them have a story that is at least coherent and the scenes go those important 3% further.",

I was not planning to write a review for MAL, it's the first (And I hope the last for a months) But, seeing what happens, I feel the need to do so.\r\nI apologize in advance for my horrible English.\r\nOk, in first place we have something that alredy all people who had watched ecchi of all types knows: An ecchi yuri anime with more \"plot\" than plot.\r\nIt's something not so usual than a harem, but normal, nothing special.\r\nIn that case... What's the problem? Nothing. It's only other anime like Queen's Blade. But the people doesn't stop to hate. They hate something that praise inother series. Too hypocritical. And there's the people who think this is the NNT shonen, it's fun.\\n\\n\r\nReturning to my \"first impressions\", the design is the best of this show, excellent art, 9/10.\\n\r\nThe story and characters personality is normal. The sound... same.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy this type of anime, go ahead, you'll like it. And a fact that I like it's... they don't have a principal male character (Who sometimes ruins the story trying to \"steal the show\")\\n\r\nDon't wait so much of this Nanatsu No Taizai, only give it a chance and enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Saludos\"",

It's set in a fantasy world and follows the tale of lucifer from when she's thrown out of heaven and her struggle to become number one in hell. As she fights against the top demons of hell known as the sins. The over all anime has great animations and colours the sounds and music choice is impeccable, the characters are so deep and constantly changing that you feel instantly coneccted to them. The story isso deep and rich with twists and turns as well as many trials for lucifer as she changes because of them to become the most powerful demon in hell. Overall this anime with its amazing character development and plot it definently is one of the more enjoyable anime being released at the moment and can't wait to see where the story goes.",

If all you want to is sexy girls wearing skin exposing outfits, and having mediocre stuffs which they termed as fights!!! A softcore porn lesbian hentai it was!!! It was all about the EXPOSE!!! The art style was was good. They wasted a lot of time on character designing, because t was nice but it had no plot or story to back it up!!! The surround sound was good too!!! Those wrap up the plus points. Trying to find negatives you will find tons. If want to watch this one-time watch show,keep your mind away from you while watching as there is no logic to it at all!! Very bad representation of the Ecchi genre. Moreover a confusing tile. Many viewers confused it for Seven Deadly Sins (Nanatsu no Taizai) a shonen anime which is really good as this series was in Japanese was called (Sin - Nanatsu no Taizai). The English translation did all it could to the title to avoid confusion with the other series. If you wanna watch this series, watch it in one go, or you'll be simply wasting your time!!",

            "content": "When I first heard about this anime, I thought that it would be an interesting take on Christianity and Hell Fire with anime girls. I was sort of right. All I got was fan service with some of what I expected. I mean the best way I can describe this that I got what I wanted and nothing more.\r\nStory: Honestly this one is a mess as it goes all over the place. If it wanted to be monster of a week, fine by me. Instead there were some stuff shoehorned last minute in the last few episodes and some confusing motivations. Not only that, therewere way too many cop outs and cheap endings from an anime that should of have some action which makes the experience not that exciting at times. Though it is a meh, don't watch this anime for the story and only the concept.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Again meh. When I first saw the concept art, I thought it was okay until I saw the actually anime which is less appealing in my taste. I thought that it would look cutesy and all but instead it is way too detailed and not that moe. The animation is a big meh with some exceptions as the budget seemed to have gone to some other aspects. When it does get good, it's good but it barely happens. I have heard that it went over budget so that might be the case.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Meh. I did like some of the songs, mostly the cute ones. The voice acting however is really good at least. Just want to point out that the English dub acting is funnier as some of the actresses really put some personality either it be better than the sub or something new.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'll start with the good. When they act like demons, it's very sexual but it is what I expect. One of the few things I want to see in this series is to see demons getting all hell fire up on yo ass. This series did have some of those moments. Each demon character represent their own sins pretty well in addition of having an interesting interpretation of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws is that they did not take advantage of this. There is the fact that they are one dimensional, the fan service gets in the way, and they are suppose to be the good guys. See, I'm okay with demons or bad people being heroes, but it does not work here for many reasons. Their motivations made no sense at times so what is the point, they are way too evil for that, and also they are freaking demons! It's their job to torture people in hell, but nope. The only real demon is into torture while the others are not into it. Ladies, it's your job.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have the main human character, Maria, who is for the most part is bland but her character development is Stockholm syndrome. Also the worse character in my opinion is that demon with blue armor that barely covers her. I just find her annoying, bratty, and not that appealing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: When it delivers, it delivers. When it doesn't, it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It just gives us what we ask for. That is it. It doesn't do more and sadly less. Do I recommend it, you may need to have some tolerance and not take the series seriously. I ended up comparing this series to Spongebob. Kind of personally enjoy this series despite some of the issues and I don't really care for the fanservice unless I joke around.",

At times felt like anime parody, other times tried to hard to be serious/emotionally.\r\n#Starts fine but you lose interest rather fast\r\n#Infinite Deus ex machina\r\n#Yes it has lots of nudity, but eventually you become accustomed to it andthe rest of the show has nothing to offer so\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThis will definetly be a show that I wont remember for long. Always on the lookout for nice yuri I saw this show and immediatly gave it a try. I am a fan of sexy and appealing art and at first glance this seemed promising. And hey, the first episode wasn\u00b4t even that bad, but what followed didn\u00b4t have much to offer. \\n\r\nAt times I even thought that I am watching a parody. Some episodes do have a certain theme. So without further spoilering just to give you an example one episode was about music and idols, another ep. about games. \\n\r\nWell I can live with that, because we also have to take in account that this show provides you with ecchi and nudity all the time. But then again there are scenes where the anime is trying way to hard to be emotional and serious and that didn\u00b4t click for me.\\n\r\nI didn\u00b4t like the female lead much. She was a lil bit of a badass, but not very feminine. You could have swapped her with a male mc and it wouldn\u00b4t have made any difference I guess. \\n\r\nI  didn\u00b4t understand what this show wants to be. IMO it\u00b4s just plain bad and boring. And that one phenomen that people call \"Deus Ex Machina\", it happend A LOT.\\n\r\nIf you\u00b4re here for ecchi only, that\u00b4s okay, but I bet there are better shows with greater value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n+++ So then tell me Kokosnuss who would you recommend this for? +++\\n\r\n#Well if  you look more for a visual appeal than an actual story. (-> fapshow, character designs are pretty good)\\n\r\n#If you like all girl shows (<- This is me. Cuz fuck those whiney ass male mcs) \\n\\n\\n\r\n- - - I would not recommend this to you if you look for yuri - - -\\n\r\n#Yes it has affection between characters, yet it\u00b4s not about romance.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Hopefully it will get better as it goes on but watching this anime really does ruin my fucking day.\r\nStory - 2 : Crap at best, uninteresting and confusing. Am I missing something? I feel like there is a hell of a lot to be explained, everything just happens for no reason in this anime. People who can enjoy this story must really be dull upstairs. Perhaps more of EVERYTHING will be explained later on, and it better do well.\r\nArt - 7 : Industry Standard, cant really complain,good tiddies, although they're all massive. (Flat is justice)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 : Once again, industry standard, can't complain, everything goes nicely and matches up etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2 : I get they're physically 2D characters but did you have make their personalities so 2 dimensional as well? The most interesting character was levi, and she was shit. Every other character I've seen so far are of typical tropes and obscene body figures, with no personality and no clear motive in what the fuck they're doing. Just a shit waifu-fest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1 : There's a reason I dropped this. See above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was going to be a good anime, but for once I'm saying that obscene fucking fan service has got in the way of a good plot and decent characters and their development, which is odd because I love the ecchi series, but this one just really isnt doing it for me.

            "content": "That moment you realize you've been rooting for Hell to win....\r\nI'm surprised that i'm only now watching this. I enjoyed this.\r\nThe art is awesome, Especially when you realize this is very echi material in this and shows like that tend to be very low budget and very lazy art. If i had one complaint then i'd say its turn the fucking lighting down ffs. There are some scenes it can be hard to see anything. \r\nI like all the characters and all but one of the Seven Sins.\r\nLucifer ( Pride) :\r\nShe being the main character means that she should be a fun character to haveon screen. For the most part she is. I can't really recall anytime i found her to be annoying or have any flaw in her character really. I don't like how defenseless she can be. Especially when she is meant to be the strongest Angel ( Now Demon Lord) The amount of times she could've been killed but wasn't because of the villain is a ton. Also i got really confused with her name. Cause she is called Lucifer when that is the name of the Devil aka Satan. So i thought we were getting some alternate version of the bible that has the Devil/Satan start out in the modern day and some type of weird crap happens with time and even though it starts out in modern day it also affects the past or some dumb crap. But nope cause later we find out that a character named Satan is in this. Doesn't explain shit and i guess it's for the best. \\n\\n\r\nLeviathan ( Envy ):\\n\r\nShe is one of the two companions that Lucifer has. She can get annoying at times i'd say but for the most part she is a good comic relief character. Kind of sad that she doesn't have some ultimate form where when she is pissed she turns into some type of Leviathan that you'd find in old stories.\\n\\n\r\nAstaroth ( Melancholy ) : \\n\r\nNot much to say about her. She was the first Sin we are introduced too that isn't all that rude. Makes sense cause her name is melancholy. Not the most interesting character but she isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSatan ( Wrath ):\\n\r\nHaving someone named Satan and not having their attribute be Wrath is just plain wrong. Only other thing that would work for someone with such a name would be Slyness. I like her. Defiantly up there with my favorite. I especially like her character design. Her job of guarding the Gates of Hell also seems to be a very fitting position.\\n\\n\r\nAsmodeus ( Lust ) :\\n\r\nShe's a whore, Not much else to say...... Well i guess i do like her character but is one of the more forgettable conquest that Lucifer has to overcome and as a result not leaving much of an impact on the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nBeelzebub ( Gluttony ) :\\n\r\nIt'd figures that Japan would give the sin with the biggest reputation of being gross over indulgence to a cute and petite looking loli. She's also 1st or 2nd best girl and if you disagree then you're wrong. Also the only normal character among the group of sins. \\n\\n\r\nBelphegor ( Sloth) :\\n\r\nThe fuck is that tail ? That shit bugs me and i'm not even sure why. But the girl is fun and probably has one of the funnest conquest that Lucifer has to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nMammon ( Greed ) : \\n\r\nNow for Greed i'm not sure why but i like'd her character. Even with her having a forgettable Conquest. I don't know what it is about her. Also her putting people into dreams to take care of her babies by breast feeding the victims is an interesting power....\\n\\n\r\nBelial ( Vanity ) :\\n\r\nWith her it's just... She isn't all that exciting or interesting of a villain. The plot with her is so obvious that other characters start calling her out on not noticing it. For her to be the incarnation of Vanity she's also not all that special looking. You'd think she'd be more beautiful like a Princess then looking like a discount slut. She's also just not that great of a character overall. I guess she's not as bad as i make her out to be but i feel that they could've made her better.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the one human character in this.\\n\\n\r\nMaria ( She's a human so obviously this spot is N/A)\\n\r\nI like her and she is an awesome partner for Lucifer. I ship them and even the show does. I just wish we got more of her on the screen and i'd even love for us to see her interacting with her friends and family that have no idea where she went and see their reactions to Lucifer being around her.\\n\\n\r\nReally the plot where God and Heaven are wanting to destroy earth is something i find to be dumb. It's like they had God just be a cliche typical villain that want's to destroy Humanity for X reason. We don't even see him. \\n\\n\r\nI kind of wish we got a ending with both Maria and Lucifer together. I feel it'd be better. \\n\\n\r\nShow also has some pretty awesome music, Especially that ED.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a pretty fun show that i'm not sure why has such low reviews. If it's because you are watching the censored version then i feel that's not much of a reason and just find it somewhere else to watch. I defiantly see this being more at a position around a 7.4 - 8.0.",

Sure there's much better out there but its not half bad and over average if you ask me.\r\nThere's something you gotta understand about this show before you go into it, it's more or less a hentai anime with a plot, kinda like Highschool DXD but with the added yuri element. Yep that's right this has yuri, infact that was my main reasons for giving this one a shot.\r\nMy favorite character in this show was Levi, she actually made it into my top ten characters. Levi is the one whomakes the magic happen in this show, my that i mean she pretty much wants to f**k the main character who happens to be a bad ass chick. \\n\\n\r\nThere's more to it than yuri though. If you can get past the titties and booty its got a decent plot, the summery on MAL is pretty dull so i'll round it up for ya. Basically without spoiling anything, the main girl Lucifer is cast out of heaven for disobeying gods will, and so she wants revenge but ends up getting tricked by the primary antagonist Belial. So one by one Luci has to defeat each deadly sin which Belial controls in order to free herself from the curse placed on her. Each fight is different and pans out pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending sucked alittle for me due to the fact i know it probably wont get a season 2. But its early days so i guess we'll see.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot ya pervert!",

But I can\u2019t help but deduct a point for it, is my nature. Next I want to also knock off a point because this one shall offend a certain percentage of the population. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it a favorable review. The characters are unique and...healthy and the show delivers on what it offers. If one liked shows like FREEZING, MAKEN-KI or SEKIREI then you are in for a treat. It\u2019s better than all three of those shows! It tells a better storywith better characters in a better setting. The action is fierce and tense. It\u2019s a home run for what it offers. I\u2019m scoring it lower than it deserves because I watched a censored version and because I can understand some people will be put off, if not outright offended by this title. That\u2019s kind of where I stand. If you like this sort of thing, you\u2019ll like this title. If you don\u2019t then you won\u2019t.",

I\u2019m only protecting what he will destroy.\u201d\r\n- Lucifer, the Demon Lord of Pride \r\nSin: Nanatsu No Taizai or Seven Mortal Sins follows the story of Lucifer, the proud fallen angel from Heaven, on her mission of becoming the Leader of the Seven Mortal Sins of Hell.\r\nThere a few types of anime fans that have seen this; the onewho watched it and hated it, the one who have mistaken this from the Nanatsu No Taizai/Seven Deadly Sins anime, the one who finished it because of the ecchi genre and the one who finished it because of the plot. And I belong to the latter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was good because we\u2019re talking about the Seven Deadly Sins, considering there was a lot of fan service given. Many would say, \u201cThis should have been made a hentai.\u201d Yes, maybe, but if you are an anime-nerd like me loves binge watching a lot of anime; then you can give this a shot. But beware of the ecchiness right from the beginning. Though there was less of the fan service in the later end of the series. If you loved the story and logic of the Deadly Sins of humans, then I recommend you give this a shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good enough to satisfy the fan service shown to us. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme suited well the ecchi genre of the anime. And the soundtrack was lit. It suited well the action scenes of the anime. Considering the fan service, the soundtrack gave light in the story and fight scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply lovable. Fan service aside, each mortal sin and their side stories are simply relatable. Well maybe because we are all sinners which why we can relate to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the enjoyment of this anime would be what type of anime fan are you? Are you the one who watches because of the genres? Or are you the one who finishes because of the plot? Everyone has their own tastes in watching an anime. And I\u2019m one of those who liked this because of its plot. And I also hope there would be a season 2 because the plot really picked up the story in the last episode. It\u2019s not that good but is enough to satisfy your anime cravings.\\n",

            "content": "OK, I have mixed feelings on this one. \r\nMost people are probably watching this for the soft porn basically. Super ecchi. \r\nHOWEVER, the second half of the series actually becomes somewhat enjoyable and dare I say.... good. The main objective for Lucifer is a little more complex than what it seems at first. There are some plot twists. \r\nWith echi as the driving element, I cannot recommend this to anyone really, but if you get past that element, its actually kinda decent. \r\n(I rate the characters themselves very high because they each stand out in their appropriate areas of personality. So it seems fitting. \r\nSPOILER:\\n\r\nIt is an interesting spin to basically put heaven as the bad guys in the end and the demon lords as the good guys.",

            "content": "This is definitely not kid's material.\r\nThis anime is... incredibly odd. It has high amount of erotic content and its quality is all over the place. Erotic content that it isn't your usual \"ecchi\" anime, but that there's a LOT of on-screen nudity and generally almost nobody makes a big deal of it. However despite that it is not porn/hentai title. The story quality also varies wildly and is all over the place. Basically it can be anywhere between \"This is actually kinda cool\" and \"this is actually fairly bad\".\r\nThe cast is all-female, and the show deals with angels/demons.\r\nDetailed breakdown below.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story is somewhat similarin execution to Queen's Blade, Valkyrie Drive and Masou Gakuen HxH. Except it is better than \"Valkyrie drive\", and worse than Queen's Blade, and has smaller amount of heavily erotic content than Gakuen HxH.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality is all over the place, and same applies to story. For first 7 or 8 episodes the anime can't decide what it is supposed to be, and in each episode tries completely different thing/genre. In the last episodes it turns into some sort of nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nThe story actually has its moments on occasion, where you see something related to heavenly or demonic realms and you could actually think this is sorta looks cool. Next moment, however, the anime decides to introduce a scene that is a tad too far into bondage territory for comfort. This happens a lot. Episodes at the beginning also have very different themes, and some of them are actually onto something. For example, rather than focusing on nudity the anime can suddenly concentrate on music, or on almost shounen-style fights. It is actually quite odd, but makes certain episodes more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, speaking about wildly varying quality, the stuff protagonists do to Earth/humanity can be quite grim.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10:\\n\r\nThe art actually looks good, backgrounds and characters designs are interesting. I liked certain costumes a lot due to color/design choices they made, and one of the \"7 sins\" looked actually interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nI actually liked some of the tunes, when they introduce Organ into the mix, soundtrack starts sounding quite interesting. However, the's a huge problem with a voice actress that voiced Lust. She speaks in stereotypical \"sexy mature woman voice\", which will probably tick off most of the people, because there are episodes where she talks a LOT.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10:\\n\r\nCharacters are not good. The human girl in the cast (I think she is supposed to be the main character) is incredibly whiny, annoying and useless. Everybody else pretty much acts according to their fairly rigid :role\", meaning there won't be that many surprises, and a lot of characters have little personality. Then again I saw worse characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10:\\n\r\nIt was interesting enough, although first 7 or so episodes were much more interesting that the rest of the show. Closer to the end it became messy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10:\\n\r\nIf you're offended by nudity, don't watch it. \\n\r\nThe main reason to check this out is if you watched Masou Gakuen or Queen's blade and wouldn't mind something somewhat similar to them -- meaning with erotic/ecchi content, but not porn, and with a story that is not fully brain-dead.\\n\\n\r\nFor this niche the anime is not bad.",

It's not about the theme or characterization which has done maybe little bit below the standard and maybe somewhat better than that anime. But, they still using female characters' overly-curvaeous body as their main selling value and too much fanservice. Even I who like big oppai like Ai-chan's or Jeanne's so much just feel disgusted by this anime.\r\n(In myopinion, maybe only Leviathan and Asmodeus which only could be a woman, others? Nope, how about Maria? Okay, maybe that's acceptable. Lucifer and other devils should be a man. Why? I see the potential if they did like that.)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has so many potentials that not used properly and they just like selling almost being hentai anime. Well, the studio did their job not properly and maybe the director is drunk when working on this. \\n\\n\r\nCongrats, Artland, you failed on your 'saving yourselves from bankruptcy' project, which I mean, this anime. You keep falling to the hole of bankcruptcy just for this anime, well, to be exact, you should handle another anime rather than this, or at least, modify it so, it's just not always about 'showing whores in an anime'.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting animation is so bad until i want to say 'What the f**k', and this anime's graphic is standard. I am surprised that the seiyuu of Rias Gremory, Emi Yusa, Mio Akiyama, and Seraphim (Yoko Hikasa), Chtolly and Ruru(Azusa Tadakoro), Sagiri and Sistine (Akane Fujita) casted here and making a bad reputation for them due of this anime is the worst of the season.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I should say, this anime has a ruined potential, if this anime wasn't created for almost hentai purpose, I would give a thumb up. Want to beat DxD? Still way too far from it, unless you talk about the ecchi-fanservice content.\\n\\n\r\nEven DxD, Asterisk, Saijaku, Rakudai, and some similiar ecchi anime give a decent plot, and rather watch those anime than this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that make the plot and else was good is only they characterizise themselves, same as the mythology said but kinda of ecchi. Only perverts that who consumed by their lust who enjoy this anime.",
