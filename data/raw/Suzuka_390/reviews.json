            "content": "I have to say after seeing the whole series even though a lot of people said it sucked..it kinda left an impression on me. \rThe general audience should be the one that likes romance, drama, and/or \"slice of life\" anime. Or simply someone who just wants to give it a try. So if you're looking for something funny with a bit of fanservice and a couple of action, I suggest you try other anime's out there. XD I recommend this anime to those who watches realistic anime under the romance-drama genre. Oh, sports anime fans may have a little something to enjoy here. \rEven thoughthe premise seems to come directly from Love Hina, this is hardly a harem anime (like anime with a lot of girls who all want this one guy, such as the titles Love Hina, or vice versa). The anime revolves around the relationship between Yamato and Suzuka. \\n\\n\rThere isn't much to complain about the aesthetics of the series. The character designs are pretty good and the music is okay. I love the piano background music when the characters are in somewhat not good situation. The areas where this anime truly shines are within the characters, their interactions, and their development throughout the series. \\n\\n\rThroughout the anime, you are guided by the narration of Yamato (lead male character, who's far less wimpy than Love Hina's Keitaro XD) The character interactions and development is done very well and very realistically. (I could almost relate to Suzuka) \\n\\n\rThe narration by Yamato really provides some great insight into what goes on in the mind of a guy who has a crush on a girl. I was giggling everytime Yamato tries not to make a fool of himself everytime he's with Suzuka. XD There aren't any other interesting characters because there are quite a few. Although I find the supporting characters very useful especially towards to developing relationship between Yamato and Suzuka.\\n\\n\rAnd Miss Suzuka here, our main lead female character, is my favorite character in the series. XD She's simple, nice with a cool attitude. I wonder why most of the people who decided to watch this, hated her guts. I mean, ok, she tends to be bitchy and bossy but she has her reasons. >:E\\n\\n\rAll in all, its a good series. I enjoyed watching it. ^^ Especially the ending episode.\\n\\n\rThe continuation of the series can be read through its manga. Go read it if you want to know what happened to them after the series. ;D\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The story is fairly simple - a young man moves from the country to Tokyo to start a new life at highschool, and falls in love at first sight with a promising athletic student (the titular character of the show).  In short it's a love story, and while the premise sounds bland, so do those of some of the very best animes.  \r\nSuzuka, however, is not one of them.  It's often described as \"character driven\" but this is a terrible thing because the majority of the characters (including the two main ones) are barely likable and have few redeeming qualities.  Yamatoand Suzuka both play to archtypes almost to the letter and this is incredibly frustrating to watch.  Although the entire series is based around their romance, you are left with an overwhelming idea that this romance only exists because the writers said it does.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is ridiculous in his submissiveness, but there are certain points where you can at least feel some empathy and sympathy for him (those these are rare) - he also demonstrates a desire to try, which everybody likes to see.  However, Suzuka is intolerable for basically the entire series, and since you as a viewer weren't written to love her like Yamato, you end up spending 26 episodes wondering why you're watching an anime that is literally about her.  Quite a few of the side characters are far more likable, but they have almost no backstory and screentime, and can't carry the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is also fairly poor - I'm not sure when the series was adapted, but it is low quality and not very good.  The music is also uninspiring and sometimes I felt it was extremely dissonant.  Apparently the sound switches between mono and stereo inbetween certain episodes.  I'm not sure if this causes any of it, but the soundtrack as a whole isn't a strong point.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the entire show you are just left with a sense of pointlessness as the characters advance nowhere, widdling away screentime with obvious and drawn out internal monologues.  It quickly becomes obvious how the show is going nowhere and how easily all of the development could have fit into a series half its length.  From what I have read of the manga (which progresses far beyond the anime) things sound like they get quite interesting - but the anime adaptation is very stale.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't believe the scores this show is getting - but I know there are other people like me out there who are unable to drop a series once they start it.  I hope that those people read this review - and instead of starting Suzuka they find something better to watch.  That wouldn't be very hard to do.",

            "content": "One of the main problems of romantic anime is that you can always predict how it will end. Just look at the DVD-cover and read the title and you don\u2019t need to watch it. So the plot itself is not what we watch romantic anime for, we watch it for interesting characters, their development and feelings.\r\nBut \u201cSuzuka\u201d was rather unusual experience for me; it kind of reminded me of \u201cMacross\u201d, because of the complicated love-triangle. First, we have Asahina Suzuka. You may call her tsundere, but the way she acts, thinks, feels makes her very realistic. At the times she can be very cold (hername actually means \u201cCold wind\u201d) and uneasy to handle with but her warm, caring side is very touching. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have Yamato Akitsuki. There is nothing special or unique about him, just your simple shounen hero. Luckily (for him, maybe) he manages to be not so stupid and irritating as other male heroes, like the ones from \u201cKimi ga Nozomu Eien\u201d, \u201cSchool Days\u201d and \u201cElfen Lied\u201d for example. Speaking of \u201cMacross\u201d, Yamato reminded me Hikaru, the way he couldn\u2019t handle his own feelings was sort of the same.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka, the second main heroine of the \u201cSuzuka\u201d is a caring, kind and cute girl who had a crush on Yamato for a long time. I can\u2019t say that she is unusual type of character, but I glad that they didn\u2019t make her as clich\u00e9d as Suzumiya from the \u201cKimi ga Nozomu Eien\u201d (yes, I\u2019m talking \u2018bout it again and, yes, I don\u2019t like this anime). \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I have to say one thing and don\u2019t mention it again: sports theme plays no big role in \u201cSuzuka\u201d except the last 6-8 episodes.\\n\r\nThe show starts rather slow and weak because nothing really happens; it\u2019s like a long introduction to the characters. There are some times when romance goes completely away and we watch a typical mediocre shounen slice of life. But the second of the anime is just brilliant. We get to know Suzuka much more and Yamato changes dramatically.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most about \u201cSuzuka\u201d is that every character behaves naturally. The way their feelings for each other were developing was almost life-like. Yes, it\u2019s of course not perfect, but it definitely was great to not see in \u201cSuzuka\u201d any standard and over-used romantic clich\u00e9s and exaggerating. And I must mention one more thing: usually, a main hero\u2019s friend in this kind of show is an air-headed fool who thinks only about girls and tries to give stupid advices. But Yasunobu is nothing like that; he is calm and seems lot more mature than Yamato. In fact, in general all supporting characters were well-made.\\n\\n\r\nThis all good, but one of the main flaws of the series is a lack of those things which make you \u201cfeel\u201d the show more: good music, animation and graphic. The animation of the show is quite poor: sport sequences look rather bad due to low budget (not sure, but I got a feeling that it IS a low-budget anime) and the whole visual style of the show is simple. I took a look at the manga and I think that black and white pages look much better. And the soundtrack is uninspired and mediocre. There are some nice tunes (like the second ending), but that\u2019s just not enough for me. I can\u2019t say anything about the opening because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to listen to it even for a single time.\\n\\n\r\nStill, all these flaws didn\u2019t ruin the entertainment. The last 6-7 episodes of the show were very interesting and breathtaking; I was completely in to the story. I think that \u201cSuzuka is a great example of how romantic anime should be made in terms of character development and depiction difficulties of their relationships.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSuzuka is a romantic comedy anime about a quirky doofus who moves into a girl's dormitory run by his aunt. He then develops a crush for an obnoxious and abusive bitch who constantly beats him. So...this is Love Hina right? WRONG! This is something far, FAR worse!\r\nBackground:\r\nRomantic comedies have always followed a similar formula. In the Western world this formula was created during the Commedia dell'arte in 1500s Italy. In Act 1 the male and female lead both dislike each other and seem to be opposites. In Act 2 the male and female discover common ground and grow closer together. In Act 3 there isa conflict and the male and female break apart, generally this is due to a misunderstanding. Finally in Act 4 the male and female reconcile and end up together. This is basically the plot of EVERY Shakespeare comedy with the exception of Love's Labour's Lost.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka decides to create a new formula. In Act 1 the male likes the female and she is an absolute bitch to him. In Act 2 the same thing happens. In Act 3 the same thing happens. In Act 4 they wind up together despite ZERO chemistry and it makes no sense. Suzuka is simply put one of the most frustrating and difficult to watch anime that I've ever sat through. It is just painful shit from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode our hero Yamato sees Suzuka passed out in the sauna after the door jammed and she was locked in. He rips open the door and manages to save her life! She just hits him and yells at him for breaking the door instead of calling someone who could unjam the door and open it properly. This is despite the fact she would likely be dead by the time that person arrived! The next day, Yamato waits 5 hours after school in the freezing cold for Suzuka to finish her athletics practice and help her with her heavy bags. She is completely unappreciative of this help and treats him like a slave. Yamato catches a cold waiting for Suzuka and she completely neglects him during his time of illness. Yet she is jealous when another girl named Honoka takes care of him. Yamato tries to impress Suzuka during gym class, but she simply makes fun of him and insults him for not being the most athletic guy in school. Yamato trains hard and manages to break the school record for the 50 meter dash, but Suzuka is still dismissive and refuses to even give him a simple compliment! Some asshole tells Suzuka that Yamato likes her, so she does the logical thing and punches Yamato in the face! She then agrees to take Yamato on a date, leads him on, then suddenly rejects him hard! She then tries to convince the track team to not let Yamato join. He goes into a deep depression and she continues to act like a sociopath and do NOTHING to try cheer him up. This is all in the first 12 episodes! Yamato then decides to start dating the actually likeable Honoka, only to dump her and wind up with Suzuka for no reason!\\n\\n\r\nIf you managed to read through that plot summary without cringing yourself to death, you will notice this is less Love Hina and more \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" made into a shitty shonen anime!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nYamato is the stupidest and most irritating doormat cuckhold to ever grace a shonen anime. Suzuka has managed to gain entry into my Top 10 most hateful anime characters of all time! She does this in a PG rated anime without ever killing or raping anyone.\\n\\n\r\n Seriously! Try to think of a character that reaches the very top tier of hatefulness while meeting all of the following criteria: 1. The show or movie is G or PG. 2. The character must never successfully kill anyone. 3. The character must be absolutely loathsome to ALL demographics and not just jaded older viewers that find a kids' character annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI thought about this for an hour and honestly had a hard time. Scar from Lion King and Frollo from Hunchback are hateful G villains, but both are murderers. Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the  Cuckoo's Nest never kills anyone (directly) but that is an R rated movie. The Carebears and Jar Jar Binks are annoying as fuck, but children don't hate them like adults do. Biff Tannen from Back to the Future and Ace Merill from Stand By Me both have too many comedic moments to achieve true hatefulness. Even Akinator the character guessing genie would have a tough time finding another character in Suzuka's category. The only other I can conjure up off the top of my head would be...Gmork from Neverending Story?! Since few people born after 1990 were big fans of that early 80s German children's movie and it has faded somewhat into obscurity, this is Gmork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOPAW7Em8mE\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, but never great. I love that the cover art on the DVD is Suzuka sweating profusely and spreading her legs wide. This is false advertisement because the smell of sweaty vagina in your face is still WAY more appealing than any moment of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI watched this series on a dare from a buddy who takes a perverse pleasure in collecting the very worst anime. The thing is that Suzuka isn't an enjoyable \"so bad it's good anime\". Suzuka is like watching a burning bag of garbage roll down a hill while getting repeatedly punched in the throat!\\n\\n",

            "content": "- - - [ Suzuka :: Eps: 26 ] - - -\r\n- [Intro] -\r\nI was casually surfing the net, looking for new animes to watch when my eyes caught Suzuka. After reading the brief, I thought I would give it a try, since I wanted a break from action-packed series after Full Metal Alchemist. Anyways, I got the first episode. It was not bad but I thought the story was a bit uncool. But that was only a first impression, and a wrong one at that! At the end, it finished nicely, although not to my total liking.\r\nOn with the brief! Suzuka tells the storyof a boy named Yamato that went to live with his aunt who owns a set of appartments to avoid paying rent. One day, on his way to school, he sees a beautiful young girl clearing a high-jump bar. He was both amazed and love-struck! However, what he didn't know was that the girl was also living in his aunt's appartment block!\\n\\n\r\nWhile clearing the public bath, he (accidentally) compromises his position when Suzuka caught him between the breasts of Saotome Yuuka while Matsumoto Megumi was on the ground, her skirt nearly up. Suzuka immediately believed that Yamato is just a pervert and distances herself. However, after Yamato saves her from the Sauna after she kinda exaggerated the stay-time, they start becoming friends. Yamato finds that Suzuka is a very talented high-jumper and inspires him to enter the Track club to enroll as runner later in the anime. Can't say more without spoiling, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe you guessed, but Suzuka is a romance/ecchi/sport kind of anime. However, there is not much ecchiness throughout the anime. Another point to note is that Suzuka Manga is still going, while the Anime completed. This means that the Anime is incomplete in a way, which is noticeable at the end of the last episode. More on that later..\\n\\n\r\n- [ Animation ] -\\n\\n\r\nMany people defined the animation in Suzuka as \"crappy\" or \"not worth it\". Personally, I don't think the animation is so bad. There may be a few glitches and wrong drawings, but they are not too noticeable. The characters are well drawn, specially Suzuka and Honoka who comes later in the series. The backgrounds were well-drawn and some special ones were very well illustrated. The character motions were dynamic and fluid, not robotic like in some series. I don't know why the animation got such a bad rating, but according to me, it's fine. However, do not expect to see lots of different places. Most of the time, it's just the same places: school, home, sports ground, cafetaria and Honoka's place. You could consider this as frame re-use, something which is not very liked among anime fans. There is not much to say here, so we move on to sound.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound ] -\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I do not pay much attention to music and sound in anime. What interests me is the story, characters and animation. Suzuka does not contain any special music track which deserves attention. The sound and music do not leave a lasting memory. If you ask me, I've pretty much forgotten everything about the sound but not the story and characters. I got nothing more to say..\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story ] -\\n\\n\r\nThe story, at first glance, looks really ecchi, with lots of scenes in baths, boob-shots and upskirts. But that's only at first, unless you mean Suzuka (Manga)! Anyways, the story is a basic romance plot, with a boy-sees-girl, boy-loves-girl-at-first-glance, girl-is-reticent. As the story develops, so does the bond between Suzuka and Yamato. Yamato is a real noob when it comes to love. He knows nothing and is shy like hell. But his passion for Suzuka drives him to do inimaginable things.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to me, the story is nice and light. The plots are stupid sometimes and you will stare blankly at the screen, wondering what that baka of Yamato is doing when he should be doing this or that. However, the story has a good flow, neither too fast, nor too slow. There are some love-triangles and some love-conflicts which will finally resolve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is good, with nothing special. It's a good romance plot for casual watching and for people who like the genre. No katanas, no blood and gore and no nudity. It's just a clean story that could be watched among family members, or at least with teens.\\n\\n\r\n- [Enjoyment and Value] -\\n\\n\r\nI think I can say I enjoyed Suzuka. It provided what I was looking for: No violence, just calm and serene scenes. I liked it, liked the story but HATED the ending. More on that in a bit. Suzuka could earn a rewatch from me, but not now. Just when I seriously need a break from my regular anime styles. But if you like the genre, that is sports and romance, Suzuka is for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the ending. Without spoiling, the ending is kind of an unfinished one, considering that the anime ends almost in the middle of the manga. We do not get to see the end of the real story of Suzuka. It just ends there, in the middle of the good parts. You will be left with a \"what will happen to these two?\" sensation at the end and you will probably want to read the manga (which is tough to find). However, let me tell you that the focus switches dramatically in the manga after the time when the anime stops, turning more to the secondary characters. I will stop here since I wanted to justify my hatred for the ending, not to write a review for Suzuka (Manga).\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.. Hope my review is helpful to you.",

            "content": "Great  teen dramas are a rarity. It is hard to find a teen drama that transcends the heavy melodrama that envelops most shows of the demographic. This is especially disconcerting considering how prominent they are in the world of anime. Shows like Toradora and Hanasaku Iroha manage to be exceptions, and they are gems for that very reason. Unfortunately, Suzuka only serves as a reminder of just how rare shows of that quality are.\r\nThe story is pretty standard; boy moves to Tokyo and a girl immediately catches his eye. The boy in question is Yamato Akitsuki, a laid-back carefree high school student; the girlwho he fancies is the athletic perfectionist, Suzuka Asahina, and of course out of his league. Luckily for Yamato, Suzuka is his neighbor in the apartment complex owned by his aunt. However, as much as he tries to get close to her, she does a bipolar act of being kind to him one moment and brushing him off the next. As it turns out there is something in the guarded girl's past that makes her hesitant to enter a relationship.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth, there is plenty of good that could have come out of this material. However, like Yamato and Suzuka's relationship, it is one step forward and two steps back. There are a decent amount of twists and relationship shifts to keep the plot from going completely stale. Some moments even manage to capture the hardships of adolescence fairly well. The problem is, however, that the show is rife with the contrived melodrama we already see all to often in this kind of show. Every action the characters make seems to solely serve the purpose of  making things as dramatic as possible. There is not a minute of subtly, as the show goes out of its way to spell out everything for the viewer, including things they could (and likely have) figure out on their own. This really spoils the fun for anyone who likes their drama refine and subtle; while doing nothing particularly special for fans of melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nYamato's internal monologues are particularly irritating; he spends his time wondering how to impress Suzuka or what will make him a good boyfriend. While this might seem to make him easy to relate to in theory, it is spoiled by the fact that he rarely makes responsible (or rational) decisions, and he NEVER shuts up! His infatuation with Suzuka goes well beyond the border into obsession, turning the sentiment from sweet into grating. Suzuka, for all the effort into making her sympathetic, is little more than a glorified plot device. Sure, her back story does invoke sympathy, but her mood swings come at the convenience of  the plot. Whenever things seem to be moving smoothly for Yamato, Suzuka has one of her mood swings and throws a monkey wrench in things; ensuring maximum drama.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the supporting characters more likable, though not anything great either. The one exception is Honoka, the quite girl with a crush on Yamato. Honoka brings some much needed, well-deserved emotion. Her endeavors to catch Yamato's attention are the sweetest moments of the show; her character revelations are the most heartbreaking. The rest of the cast, while more tolerable than the leads, are pretty run-of-the-mill. From Yamato's lady's man best friend, to the nosy track team girl, to the drunken residents at the apartment complex; all the characters are there to lighten the mood, or explain situations. None of them develop beyond one dimensional archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Suzuka is exactly what you would expect from a slice-of-life. Not really bad, but not good either; it definitely looks cheap. Character designs and backgrounds are more of the same, doing little if anything to differentiate from other series. Animation fluctuates from completely static to just enough to be believable movement. The show pretty much gets the standard slice-of-life treatment; the animation acts as a visual aid for what would otherwise be a radio drama. The soundtrack fairs better, but it still is pretty much what is expected. Composed entirely of either sappy orchestrated pieces for dramatic moments, or bubbly music for the lighter moments; the soundtrack is really nothing special, though it is used adequately.\\n\\n\r\nPlain is the word to describe Suzuka, or would be if it did not raise the melodrama to a nauseating level. The show offers up nothing special, everything is done by numbers. Unfortunately, it is also so rife with melodrama it is actually off-putting. Perhaps some fans of teen melodrama would appreciate this, but for a more casual viewer the drama is layered on too thick. And even for those who have an appetite for melodrama, satisfaction can be found elsewhere.",

I couldn't stand Suzuka half the time and Yamato wasn't my favorite character in the later part of the series either. \r\nMy major disliking for theshow is Suzuka. One second she was warm and then she was cold and you never got to know her well enough to understand. You know next to nothing about her but that she's mourning over someone that she can't let go of. And yeah I can understand that but she had mood changes that made me want to just give up. Yamato was childish and ended up hurting people. He was also selfish and even though he said he got it he never really did. I didn't like the plot. I didn't like the characters, and by the end I was totally disintrested. Maybe this show is for some people but it's not for me.",

            "content": "A crush is a strange thing. It can start when someone shows kindness or sympathy for you, or it could happen with no more than a glance. \"Love at first sight\" they say. But in the same breath, they say \"Love is blind\". When you fall for someone, there's not much you can do, even if they are a complete and utter b@#ch. Enter Suzuka, a sports/\"romance\" anime that will take you on emotional ride. That is, if that ride were on a unicycle over a long, gravel road...\r\nSuzuki is supposed to be a high school romance drama, but...was it supposed to be romantic? Everyepisode felt like I needed something happy to happen before I could go to bed, and 26 episodes, 5 cups of coffee and one broken portable dvd player later I was no where near satisfied. Now, I'm not saying nothing good happened, but the sad and depressing HEAVILY out-weighed the other, and not in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nYamato Akitsuki is a little bit better than your average harem-idiot, but not much better. The thing that made him better was that he is somewhat realistic. However, when it comes to be being a high school boy obsessed with his crush, he's a little too realistic. His actions made me go \"Come on dude, really?\" more times then I care to count. He even joins his high school track team so he can spend more time around her. Why track? Well, she happens to be a promising talent in the world of high jumping. Who you ask? Well, the title says it all. \\n\\n\r\nSuzuki, one of the rudest, coldest, and despicable heroines you'll ever see in an anime. Now, there ARE characters like Taiga and Shana who are quite the same way, but they actual care for their men, and they admit to themselves that they have feelings for them. Suzuki on the other hand never ONCE admits she likes him to anyone, including herself, until the very end. And by end I mean the last five minutes. That would be okay with me if there was actually some hints or signs that she cared for Yamato, but it ends up being the opposite. In fact, she is so cold to him at points it becomes hard to watch, and makes you wonder why he is even trying. This in itself makes it hard for the viewer to want Yamato to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Honoka. Oh, Honoka. The only reason I continued watching, and probably why others did to. Honoka is the sweet, caring, and cute childhood friend character, and is genuinely in love with Yamato. I honestly wanted her to succeed, but this in itself led to another reason that the series became hard to watch. We all no there's no hope. Its named Suzuki. Its named after the one character that we want to succeed the least. Its heart-wrenching to watch her try only to get her heart broken.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was upset with the way the story turned out, but I can't ignore the fact that it got me talking about it. It definitely succeeded in bringing out the emotions in the viewer, so for that reason I didn't believe it was below average. and at some points was quite impressed with how the drama was done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand was BAD. This is sad to me, because it starts with a promising scene with Yamato walking down the sidewalk looking through the fence. It looked very good. And....that was the last I saw of those scenes. Still frames were used, ventriloquism was performed, and a scene was created where Suzuki looked like she was 7 feet tall.  These affected the drama at points because I didn't trust the art. What I mean is how can I trust that Suzuki's emotions are being portrayed correctly when Yamato turns his head only to have his hair stuck in the fabric of space for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I was humbly surprised by the soundtrack. Very pretty piano track accompanied the dramatic and \"romantic\" scenes, and was a big reason I kept watching. It added an element that was important to the drama itself, and if the soundtrack were poor, there is no doubt I would've dropped the series.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you want to take your chances on an unpleasantly heavy drama with very little satisfying moments, by all means go for it. It has fans for a reason, so it may very well be what your looking for. But personally, besides heavy drama and an above average soundtrack, it isn't worth sitting through 26 episodes.\\n",

            "content": "I recommend this series. It has well written characters (both lovable and unlovable) and I found it to be funny. \r\nThis series perhaps has some of the best supporting characters I have seen yet terrible leads. Let me explain:\r\nBoth Akitsuki and Suzuka are terrible leads for this series. Both of them have no respect for their friends and they both behave in ways that would be unappealing to the opposite sex. \r\nAkitsuki is essentially an obsessive stalker, doing things like peeping into her apartment and screaming at her door that he's never going to stop loving her even though she already rejected him\r\nSuzuka is essentiallya try hard and a bitch. Whenever someone is nice to her, she goes on a lecture-esque rant talking down to them and whenever someone does something weird or mean to her, she acts normal. She has an obsession with track and field, and also with \"having to be right\". \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I give this romance story a 7 you ask? Well, aside from these characters, everyone else is pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nYasunobu is Akitsuki's self proclaimed friend and he sort of knows how to act with the ladies...or at least thinks he does. He has a lot of good scenes, is funny, and offer's Akitsuki advice which Akitsuki manages to mess up. He also acts as great wingman and generally talks Akitsuki up in front of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka Sakurai is the pinnacle of girl next door. She is shy, kind, eager to please, and tries really hard to get the guy she loves (Akitsuki). Every other male character except Akitsuki knows this and I don't blame them. She tries to take care of Akitsuki and even joins the track team just to be with him. \\n\\n\r\nOf course there are more support characters and they all seem well done and likable, especially compared to the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is good if you don't take it at face value. It's funny, and I found myself watching it more to see how everyone around Akitsuki and Suzuka act than those two characters themselves. I think it's a good series that everyone should give a shot watching.",

In the beginning I believed that he was actually too good for Suzuka because he would put in effort without getting much in return, but aftera while I just gave up on him as well. There were no characters that stood out from the others in a good way either.

            "content": "\"If you stand still nothing changes.... but... if you take even a step forward....I have a feeling something will change, and something good will happen!\"\r\nHere's the thing about the romance genre... usually when I watch a romance anime, I'm able to guess what will happen and get it right, like which character will get with another or what's about to happen in the story. Now, here's Suzuka, what appears to be a typical romance anime at first glance, but once you get further into the story, everything starts to make you have a different opinion about this anime. There are multiple instances where a rugwas pulled out from under me unexpectedly. I thought one thing was going to happen, but it turns in a different direction and something else happens instead. While that can be good for those who like being surprised and hate it when they can guess everything, in Suzuka's case, this isn't always a good thing. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nMmkay, so the story goes like this... Enter Yamato, your typical 16 year old who moves to Tokyo to live with his Aunt and Cousin as he enters his first year of high school. His Aunt is the owner of an all-girls apartment complex and bath house, but seeing as he has no other relatives in Tokyo, he has to live there. Lucky break, right? Well... as he's cleaning the bath, some pretty bad stuff happens to him in a short period of time, and then, at the worst time, enter Suzuka, who happens to walk in on him as he accidentally tripped on top of a girl, and that left a pretty bad impression on her. They later talk about what happened, it's written off as a misunderstanding, and that's where their relationship in this series starts off. Pretty typical first episode, but after each episode, more things started to happen that made me think differently about this show. It had some clich\u00e9 moments like most romance animes do, but at the same time there was quite a bit uniqueness to the story, and that upped my opinion about this show.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka was brought to you by Studio Comet, the same company who brought other titles like School Rumble and Initial D, and it was directed by Hiroshi Fukutomi, who shouldn't really be known for anything huge. The anime was made in 2005, so about 8 years ago... and if I had to state my honest opinion, I'd say that the art style was mediocre overall... it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that I'd get hyped up over.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Suzuka on DVD, so I watched it dubbed. The cast selection was pretty good, with Todd Haberkorn and Leah Clark playing the lead roles, and Laura Bailey, Jamie Marchi, and Robert McCollum playing some of the supporting characters. They did a good job playing their roles, usually with a lot of seriousness to their tone which fit the mood of the show most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are usually what I spend the most time on talking about when I'm writing reviews, but in Suzuka's case, there isn't actually a lot to write about... but for starters, let's talk about Yamato, the main protagonist of Suzuka. I feel like he is your typical anime character, if not a little more clueless. A lot of the time, I'm wondering if he thinks before he speaks, and when he is speaking, if he actually knows what he's saying or if he's being controlled by someone who lives to ruin his life. A lot of the things he says or does makes me think that he isn't very considerate to others, and that made me want to shake him until he realizes what exactly is wrong. Now let's talk about Suzuka, the cold hearted love interest of the series, the one that this anime's name is based off of. Like I just said, she's cold hearted. At least 3/4 of the time, she is either ignoring Yamato (understandable at times...) or being a complete jerk to him. As for the other 1/4 of the time, she's either nice to him or worried about him, or she's not even in the scene. At points I wonder what Yamato sees in her, but I guess that's love for you. As for the minor characters, I can't really say that I had a favorite, due to the fact that there were almost no characters that I didn't want to strangle at some point. Asahina may be cute, shy and perfect, but she has some serious trust issues. Hattori might have given Yamato some relationship advice, but at least half of it got him slapped. Out of all the characters on this show, the one I liked most was Miki. She seemed like she was the most helpful and genuinely worried about people in Suzuka, and in my mind, even though I knew it wouldn't happen but was hoping for another rug pulling, I was rooting for her to get with him in the end. She had some minor flaws, like everyone else, but she was my personal favorite. But overall the character development wasn't exactly what I would call awesome. Like the art, it wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't good either.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal view on the show is that this isn't your typical romance anime. Once in a while, you'll come across a romance anime such as Say I Love You, or Itazura na Kiss, animes that actually fall under the romance slice of life category, because in reality, they are realistic if anything else. Suzuka is one of those animes. While I didn't necessarily care for most of the characters or art style, the story development and voice acting made up for it. There were moments that I felt super mad at people, and others that I felt bad for them, but overall this was a pretty good anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "Suzuka is not your typical anime romance/drama, whereas with a lot of anime romance it is either a harem or some magical tale, Suzuka stands apart as being a more realistic tale. The serise is based around Yamato and the girl of his dreams, Suzuka and all the trials and tribulations surrounding being round her. This series does take a panning from some people about the characters decisions during the series and how obvious it is that it is not the right thing to say, but for me that is the beauty of this anime, the fact is when you are in love you dosay things that you don't mean and are too stubborn to take back, I found myself cringing watching events unfold as have happend to me in real life, and looking to see how the characters got through those difficulties. \\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to critise artwork and sound in anime, the artwork in Suzuka is not up to the standard of modern Gonzo series, but it works and is true to the manga artwork, the characters are all very well done and as for the sound, the characters all feel right, there isn't an out of place cast member so it all works well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are all developed throughout the series and you do get to know the characters and their manerisms throughout the series, as I said earlier the characters come in for some abuse from some people, but isn't that the point? That the charcters are flawed like everyone else and can produce the reactions that make us want to go and rant on the forums about how stupid they have been? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, even all the bits that made me watch it from behind the chair and pause to get the courage up to watch the next bit, I thought I was alone in doing this but I gave this series to a friend and he did the same thing. Its a must watch in my opinion.",

That said Suzuka is an acquired taste and older viewers may like it more than younger viewers who will likely expect early payoffs in the story to keep them interested.\r\nThe series also doesn't quite fit the mould of a highschool drama and cannot be easily categorized.  It has the elements of a harem, mixed with a sports drama, but neither are fully developed.  Instead, we get a story of imperfect people leading imperfect lives.As a result, this may  lead some to become frustrated with the show, especially if they are conditioned to expect certain plot development and arcs from other stories in the same general genre.  \\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the next point.  The main leads can become quite grating in their stubbornness and imperfections as human beings.  Yes, Suzuka can be a real B*** and Yamato  is a doofus many times.  But this is a much better narrative mechanism that your typical high school drama where coincidences, misunderstandings, unrealistic situations and other unlucky happenings become a recurring theme  to keep the two lovers apart and drag the story on.  In Suzuka, the conflict is internal and the hand of the author is less apparent as an intervener.\\n\\n\r\nI did go ahead and read the summary of the 70 or so chapters the anime didn't cover, and in a way, it ends in a much higher note than so many other high school dramas where the mangaka pushes ahead with a bad ending after the anime has run its course.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good story with mediocre art and sound design. The unconventional mechanics will keep some interested, while the leads may frustrate others.   \\n\\n\r\nRecommended.",

Yamato doesn't help either he's supposed to be the guy you support, but his decisions were stupid and he never keeps his mouth shut especially when he needed to it was so annoying.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters were actually ok hell I was supporting Honoka until she eventually went out with Yamato and then they broke up over stupid reasons but luckily the breakup scene actually felt mutual which was alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance in this anime went up and down throughout the show whenever it concentrated on Yamato and Suzuka it was just awful I didn't want to support the relationship at all, it's funny how a love triangle made things better for this area.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a Sport aspect which is the saving grace of the show and it was actually interesting seeing Yamato improve his time on the 100m sprint and seeing his rivalry with Arima Emerson actually spiced things up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good Romance with Good characters look somewhere else because this isn't the place, but if you're interested in Love triangles and Sport then you might actually find something here, but for me this was just one painful journey.",

            "content": "Suzuka often reminds me of a contemporary piece of artwork. It's sloppy in a few ways and you don't really understand what's going on in some places. But most of all, it gives you a unique experience and an enjoyable piece of art to look at. Once the artwork's motive or story behind it is revealed, you often come to a different perspective of what it is on the surface.\r\nIts story really left an impact on me in some ways. It reminded me of, well, me. Trying new things, and ultimately coming to like what your doing. The path of love is harsh, bumpy, andoften belligerent as you trudge your way through to find the one that you want to be with, as I tried to do myself. With every action you take, life has to throw you for a loop and send you spiraling through emotional hardships that you must confront and handle the best possible way you can. Yamato frustrated me because of the way he tried, and that is why I respect its plot. Because not everyone is perfect, and criteria must be met and your heart tested to know the truth about yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good. I've seen anime similar to the style and better. Some of the kissing scenes were awkward and facial expressions were weirldly misshapen at times. The high jump that Suzuka did seem realistic, but at the same time they over do it and it ineptly represents what would really happen. Overall, improvements could have been made, but it played off averagely through the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh, the sound. I crapped my pants when silly scenes would come on because the background music sounded so hilarious. My brother and I often joke around with it and say that a bunch of drunk guys got together and played on a synthesizer and decided that it sounded awesome, so they put it in with an anime. Voice acting was patchy in some scenes and presented itself stiffly, but on occasions the acting was over par. Luckily, well played endings and an inspiring opening came to save the day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were fun to watch, and I often enjoyed seeing them unfold. I frequently expected little from the cast, and they always came up surprising me. The decisions they make (especially Yamato's, in my opinion) seemed unorthodox and fresh. Suzuka is always changing her mind and confused, and as a result, she comes off rough. She's the \"variable in the equation\" that could change at any moment. The supporting cast was good, too. Yasunobu played an amusing role as the bro that looks after you and hands out advice here and there, and Honoka had some unforeseen surprises that came along with her fragile and innocent character. \\n\\n\r\nI usually enjoy watching anime, and gladly this one didn't deprive me of that privilege. It was one of the first ones I watched, so what could I say? It was the right choice for \"a first show.\" It had me hooked and kept me that way for most of the show. There is something about watching others trying to figure out what to do with their lives and what they want that grabs the attention of my eye. Plus, it was during a stage in my life where romance was a problem, so I had something to concur with.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall experience was pleasurable. The story and characters stood out and made the enjoyment spring highly for me. Art and sound could be improved. I would highly recommend this show to anyone new to the world of anime as a must see, but veterans may think differently about an anime that is often looked down upon. To me, it was an adventurous and great anime!",

            "content": "Sick and tired of romances in anime that don\u2019t go anywhere? Wish to see something that dares to break the status quo and tell a story rather than appease the otaku-culture? Take a gander at Suzuka, a romantic triangle-drama with earnest character-development and constructive messages. \r\nWe follow our oblivious main character, Akitsuki, in his struggle to get through to the hard-headed Suzuka. We witness as he screws up, yet learns by taking advice from friends and by simply by being tenacious. The main couple are flawed characters that repeatedly mess up, sometimes to the point of annoyance, although the growth they go through gives itpurpose. With a good supporting cast the show manages to stick out and feel like a fully fleshed out community of people, one that feels varied and natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the weaker aspects of the series, as it is very much done by the numbers, letting the characters\u2019 interactions drive the plot rather than the visuals. The series does not try to be too open to interpretation and is very on the nose with its dialogue, never using any particular symbolism or creative visuals to tell the story. The artwork is very simple in that regard, never bad, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka holds a special place in my heart for catching me at a very important time in my teen-life, and to this day it is among the few animes that I\u2019ve walked away from feeling like it changed me as a person, giving me some perspective. As a teenager I was one of those self-appointed \"nice guys\", and a bitter one at that. When I finally was confessed to by a truly kind girl, I decided to give her a chance, despite not being attracted or romantically interested in her at all. Over time I regretted the decision as a relationship built on dishonest feelings would lead nowhere. I had my circumstances and simply happened to run into this series while in a similar situation that was presented in the story. I\u2019m certain that the messages that mattered to me might seem obvious to others, but none the less important for everyone to hear at least once. To be brutally honest with yourself, how to be more responsible, and that trying to please yourself by acting like a \"nice guy\" can sometimes in fact be most disrespectful thing you can do.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aspiring writer myself, my greatest wish is for my work to one day effect the people that read it. To make a difference is truly the best way to immortalize yourself. Despite its flaws, Suzuka managed to effect me for the better, and I am grateful to everyone involved that created this series. I must give this series the highest score there is.",

            "content": "I have to say after seeing the whole series even though a lot of people said it sucked..it kinda left an impression on me. \rThe general audience should be the one that likes romance, drama, and/or \"slice of life\" anime. Or simply someone who just wants to give it a try. So if you're looking for something funny with a bit of fanservice and a couple of action, I suggest you try other anime's out there. XD I recommend this anime to those who watches realistic anime under the romance-drama genre. Oh, sports anime fans may have a little something to enjoy here. \rEven thoughthe premise seems to come directly from Love Hina, this is hardly a harem anime (like anime with a lot of girls who all want this one guy, such as the titles Love Hina, or vice versa). The anime revolves around the relationship between Yamato and Suzuka. \\n\\n\rThere isn't much to complain about the aesthetics of the series. The character designs are pretty good and the music is okay. I love the piano background music when the characters are in somewhat not good situation. The areas where this anime truly shines are within the characters, their interactions, and their development throughout the series. \\n\\n\rThroughout the anime, you are guided by the narration of Yamato (lead male character, who's far less wimpy than Love Hina's Keitaro XD) The character interactions and development is done very well and very realistically. (I could almost relate to Suzuka) \\n\\n\rThe narration by Yamato really provides some great insight into what goes on in the mind of a guy who has a crush on a girl. I was giggling everytime Yamato tries not to make a fool of himself everytime he's with Suzuka. XD There aren't any other interesting characters because there are quite a few. Although I find the supporting characters very useful especially towards to developing relationship between Yamato and Suzuka.\\n\\n\rAnd Miss Suzuka here, our main lead female character, is my favorite character in the series. XD She's simple, nice with a cool attitude. I wonder why most of the people who decided to watch this, hated her guts. I mean, ok, she tends to be bitchy and bossy but she has her reasons. >:E\\n\\n\rAll in all, its a good series. I enjoyed watching it. ^^ Especially the ending episode.\\n\\n\rThe continuation of the series can be read through its manga. Go read it if you want to know what happened to them after the series. ;D\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The story is fairly simple - a young man moves from the country to Tokyo to start a new life at highschool, and falls in love at first sight with a promising athletic student (the titular character of the show).  In short it's a love story, and while the premise sounds bland, so do those of some of the very best animes.  \r\nSuzuka, however, is not one of them.  It's often described as \"character driven\" but this is a terrible thing because the majority of the characters (including the two main ones) are barely likable and have few redeeming qualities.  Yamatoand Suzuka both play to archtypes almost to the letter and this is incredibly frustrating to watch.  Although the entire series is based around their romance, you are left with an overwhelming idea that this romance only exists because the writers said it does.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is ridiculous in his submissiveness, but there are certain points where you can at least feel some empathy and sympathy for him (those these are rare) - he also demonstrates a desire to try, which everybody likes to see.  However, Suzuka is intolerable for basically the entire series, and since you as a viewer weren't written to love her like Yamato, you end up spending 26 episodes wondering why you're watching an anime that is literally about her.  Quite a few of the side characters are far more likable, but they have almost no backstory and screentime, and can't carry the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is also fairly poor - I'm not sure when the series was adapted, but it is low quality and not very good.  The music is also uninspiring and sometimes I felt it was extremely dissonant.  Apparently the sound switches between mono and stereo inbetween certain episodes.  I'm not sure if this causes any of it, but the soundtrack as a whole isn't a strong point.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the entire show you are just left with a sense of pointlessness as the characters advance nowhere, widdling away screentime with obvious and drawn out internal monologues.  It quickly becomes obvious how the show is going nowhere and how easily all of the development could have fit into a series half its length.  From what I have read of the manga (which progresses far beyond the anime) things sound like they get quite interesting - but the anime adaptation is very stale.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't believe the scores this show is getting - but I know there are other people like me out there who are unable to drop a series once they start it.  I hope that those people read this review - and instead of starting Suzuka they find something better to watch.  That wouldn't be very hard to do.",

            "content": "One of the main problems of romantic anime is that you can always predict how it will end. Just look at the DVD-cover and read the title and you don\u2019t need to watch it. So the plot itself is not what we watch romantic anime for, we watch it for interesting characters, their development and feelings.\r\nBut \u201cSuzuka\u201d was rather unusual experience for me; it kind of reminded me of \u201cMacross\u201d, because of the complicated love-triangle. First, we have Asahina Suzuka. You may call her tsundere, but the way she acts, thinks, feels makes her very realistic. At the times she can be very cold (hername actually means \u201cCold wind\u201d) and uneasy to handle with but her warm, caring side is very touching. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have Yamato Akitsuki. There is nothing special or unique about him, just your simple shounen hero. Luckily (for him, maybe) he manages to be not so stupid and irritating as other male heroes, like the ones from \u201cKimi ga Nozomu Eien\u201d, \u201cSchool Days\u201d and \u201cElfen Lied\u201d for example. Speaking of \u201cMacross\u201d, Yamato reminded me Hikaru, the way he couldn\u2019t handle his own feelings was sort of the same.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka, the second main heroine of the \u201cSuzuka\u201d is a caring, kind and cute girl who had a crush on Yamato for a long time. I can\u2019t say that she is unusual type of character, but I glad that they didn\u2019t make her as clich\u00e9d as Suzumiya from the \u201cKimi ga Nozomu Eien\u201d (yes, I\u2019m talking \u2018bout it again and, yes, I don\u2019t like this anime). \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I have to say one thing and don\u2019t mention it again: sports theme plays no big role in \u201cSuzuka\u201d except the last 6-8 episodes.\\n\r\nThe show starts rather slow and weak because nothing really happens; it\u2019s like a long introduction to the characters. There are some times when romance goes completely away and we watch a typical mediocre shounen slice of life. But the second of the anime is just brilliant. We get to know Suzuka much more and Yamato changes dramatically.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most about \u201cSuzuka\u201d is that every character behaves naturally. The way their feelings for each other were developing was almost life-like. Yes, it\u2019s of course not perfect, but it definitely was great to not see in \u201cSuzuka\u201d any standard and over-used romantic clich\u00e9s and exaggerating. And I must mention one more thing: usually, a main hero\u2019s friend in this kind of show is an air-headed fool who thinks only about girls and tries to give stupid advices. But Yasunobu is nothing like that; he is calm and seems lot more mature than Yamato. In fact, in general all supporting characters were well-made.\\n\\n\r\nThis all good, but one of the main flaws of the series is a lack of those things which make you \u201cfeel\u201d the show more: good music, animation and graphic. The animation of the show is quite poor: sport sequences look rather bad due to low budget (not sure, but I got a feeling that it IS a low-budget anime) and the whole visual style of the show is simple. I took a look at the manga and I think that black and white pages look much better. And the soundtrack is uninspired and mediocre. There are some nice tunes (like the second ending), but that\u2019s just not enough for me. I can\u2019t say anything about the opening because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to listen to it even for a single time.\\n\\n\r\nStill, all these flaws didn\u2019t ruin the entertainment. The last 6-7 episodes of the show were very interesting and breathtaking; I was completely in to the story. I think that \u201cSuzuka is a great example of how romantic anime should be made in terms of character development and depiction difficulties of their relationships.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSuzuka is a romantic comedy anime about a quirky doofus who moves into a girl's dormitory run by his aunt. He then develops a crush for an obnoxious and abusive bitch who constantly beats him. So...this is Love Hina right? WRONG! This is something far, FAR worse!\r\nBackground:\r\nRomantic comedies have always followed a similar formula. In the Western world this formula was created during the Commedia dell'arte in 1500s Italy. In Act 1 the male and female lead both dislike each other and seem to be opposites. In Act 2 the male and female discover common ground and grow closer together. In Act 3 there isa conflict and the male and female break apart, generally this is due to a misunderstanding. Finally in Act 4 the male and female reconcile and end up together. This is basically the plot of EVERY Shakespeare comedy with the exception of Love's Labour's Lost.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka decides to create a new formula. In Act 1 the male likes the female and she is an absolute bitch to him. In Act 2 the same thing happens. In Act 3 the same thing happens. In Act 4 they wind up together despite ZERO chemistry and it makes no sense. Suzuka is simply put one of the most frustrating and difficult to watch anime that I've ever sat through. It is just painful shit from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode our hero Yamato sees Suzuka passed out in the sauna after the door jammed and she was locked in. He rips open the door and manages to save her life! She just hits him and yells at him for breaking the door instead of calling someone who could unjam the door and open it properly. This is despite the fact she would likely be dead by the time that person arrived! The next day, Yamato waits 5 hours after school in the freezing cold for Suzuka to finish her athletics practice and help her with her heavy bags. She is completely unappreciative of this help and treats him like a slave. Yamato catches a cold waiting for Suzuka and she completely neglects him during his time of illness. Yet she is jealous when another girl named Honoka takes care of him. Yamato tries to impress Suzuka during gym class, but she simply makes fun of him and insults him for not being the most athletic guy in school. Yamato trains hard and manages to break the school record for the 50 meter dash, but Suzuka is still dismissive and refuses to even give him a simple compliment! Some asshole tells Suzuka that Yamato likes her, so she does the logical thing and punches Yamato in the face! She then agrees to take Yamato on a date, leads him on, then suddenly rejects him hard! She then tries to convince the track team to not let Yamato join. He goes into a deep depression and she continues to act like a sociopath and do NOTHING to try cheer him up. This is all in the first 12 episodes! Yamato then decides to start dating the actually likeable Honoka, only to dump her and wind up with Suzuka for no reason!\\n\\n\r\nIf you managed to read through that plot summary without cringing yourself to death, you will notice this is less Love Hina and more \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" made into a shitty shonen anime!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nYamato is the stupidest and most irritating doormat cuckhold to ever grace a shonen anime. Suzuka has managed to gain entry into my Top 10 most hateful anime characters of all time! She does this in a PG rated anime without ever killing or raping anyone.\\n\\n\r\n Seriously! Try to think of a character that reaches the very top tier of hatefulness while meeting all of the following criteria: 1. The show or movie is G or PG. 2. The character must never successfully kill anyone. 3. The character must be absolutely loathsome to ALL demographics and not just jaded older viewers that find a kids' character annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI thought about this for an hour and honestly had a hard time. Scar from Lion King and Frollo from Hunchback are hateful G villains, but both are murderers. Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the  Cuckoo's Nest never kills anyone (directly) but that is an R rated movie. The Carebears and Jar Jar Binks are annoying as fuck, but children don't hate them like adults do. Biff Tannen from Back to the Future and Ace Merill from Stand By Me both have too many comedic moments to achieve true hatefulness. Even Akinator the character guessing genie would have a tough time finding another character in Suzuka's category. The only other I can conjure up off the top of my head would be...Gmork from Neverending Story?! Since few people born after 1990 were big fans of that early 80s German children's movie and it has faded somewhat into obscurity, this is Gmork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOPAW7Em8mE\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, but never great. I love that the cover art on the DVD is Suzuka sweating profusely and spreading her legs wide. This is false advertisement because the smell of sweaty vagina in your face is still WAY more appealing than any moment of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI watched this series on a dare from a buddy who takes a perverse pleasure in collecting the very worst anime. The thing is that Suzuka isn't an enjoyable \"so bad it's good anime\". Suzuka is like watching a burning bag of garbage roll down a hill while getting repeatedly punched in the throat!\\n\\n",

            "content": "- - - [ Suzuka :: Eps: 26 ] - - -\r\n- [Intro] -\r\nI was casually surfing the net, looking for new animes to watch when my eyes caught Suzuka. After reading the brief, I thought I would give it a try, since I wanted a break from action-packed series after Full Metal Alchemist. Anyways, I got the first episode. It was not bad but I thought the story was a bit uncool. But that was only a first impression, and a wrong one at that! At the end, it finished nicely, although not to my total liking.\r\nOn with the brief! Suzuka tells the storyof a boy named Yamato that went to live with his aunt who owns a set of appartments to avoid paying rent. One day, on his way to school, he sees a beautiful young girl clearing a high-jump bar. He was both amazed and love-struck! However, what he didn't know was that the girl was also living in his aunt's appartment block!\\n\\n\r\nWhile clearing the public bath, he (accidentally) compromises his position when Suzuka caught him between the breasts of Saotome Yuuka while Matsumoto Megumi was on the ground, her skirt nearly up. Suzuka immediately believed that Yamato is just a pervert and distances herself. However, after Yamato saves her from the Sauna after she kinda exaggerated the stay-time, they start becoming friends. Yamato finds that Suzuka is a very talented high-jumper and inspires him to enter the Track club to enroll as runner later in the anime. Can't say more without spoiling, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe you guessed, but Suzuka is a romance/ecchi/sport kind of anime. However, there is not much ecchiness throughout the anime. Another point to note is that Suzuka Manga is still going, while the Anime completed. This means that the Anime is incomplete in a way, which is noticeable at the end of the last episode. More on that later..\\n\\n\r\n- [ Animation ] -\\n\\n\r\nMany people defined the animation in Suzuka as \"crappy\" or \"not worth it\". Personally, I don't think the animation is so bad. There may be a few glitches and wrong drawings, but they are not too noticeable. The characters are well drawn, specially Suzuka and Honoka who comes later in the series. The backgrounds were well-drawn and some special ones were very well illustrated. The character motions were dynamic and fluid, not robotic like in some series. I don't know why the animation got such a bad rating, but according to me, it's fine. However, do not expect to see lots of different places. Most of the time, it's just the same places: school, home, sports ground, cafetaria and Honoka's place. You could consider this as frame re-use, something which is not very liked among anime fans. There is not much to say here, so we move on to sound.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound ] -\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I do not pay much attention to music and sound in anime. What interests me is the story, characters and animation. Suzuka does not contain any special music track which deserves attention. The sound and music do not leave a lasting memory. If you ask me, I've pretty much forgotten everything about the sound but not the story and characters. I got nothing more to say..\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story ] -\\n\\n\r\nThe story, at first glance, looks really ecchi, with lots of scenes in baths, boob-shots and upskirts. But that's only at first, unless you mean Suzuka (Manga)! Anyways, the story is a basic romance plot, with a boy-sees-girl, boy-loves-girl-at-first-glance, girl-is-reticent. As the story develops, so does the bond between Suzuka and Yamato. Yamato is a real noob when it comes to love. He knows nothing and is shy like hell. But his passion for Suzuka drives him to do inimaginable things.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to me, the story is nice and light. The plots are stupid sometimes and you will stare blankly at the screen, wondering what that baka of Yamato is doing when he should be doing this or that. However, the story has a good flow, neither too fast, nor too slow. There are some love-triangles and some love-conflicts which will finally resolve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is good, with nothing special. It's a good romance plot for casual watching and for people who like the genre. No katanas, no blood and gore and no nudity. It's just a clean story that could be watched among family members, or at least with teens.\\n\\n\r\n- [Enjoyment and Value] -\\n\\n\r\nI think I can say I enjoyed Suzuka. It provided what I was looking for: No violence, just calm and serene scenes. I liked it, liked the story but HATED the ending. More on that in a bit. Suzuka could earn a rewatch from me, but not now. Just when I seriously need a break from my regular anime styles. But if you like the genre, that is sports and romance, Suzuka is for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the ending. Without spoiling, the ending is kind of an unfinished one, considering that the anime ends almost in the middle of the manga. We do not get to see the end of the real story of Suzuka. It just ends there, in the middle of the good parts. You will be left with a \"what will happen to these two?\" sensation at the end and you will probably want to read the manga (which is tough to find). However, let me tell you that the focus switches dramatically in the manga after the time when the anime stops, turning more to the secondary characters. I will stop here since I wanted to justify my hatred for the ending, not to write a review for Suzuka (Manga).\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.. Hope my review is helpful to you.",

            "content": "Great  teen dramas are a rarity. It is hard to find a teen drama that transcends the heavy melodrama that envelops most shows of the demographic. This is especially disconcerting considering how prominent they are in the world of anime. Shows like Toradora and Hanasaku Iroha manage to be exceptions, and they are gems for that very reason. Unfortunately, Suzuka only serves as a reminder of just how rare shows of that quality are.\r\nThe story is pretty standard; boy moves to Tokyo and a girl immediately catches his eye. The boy in question is Yamato Akitsuki, a laid-back carefree high school student; the girlwho he fancies is the athletic perfectionist, Suzuka Asahina, and of course out of his league. Luckily for Yamato, Suzuka is his neighbor in the apartment complex owned by his aunt. However, as much as he tries to get close to her, she does a bipolar act of being kind to him one moment and brushing him off the next. As it turns out there is something in the guarded girl's past that makes her hesitant to enter a relationship.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth, there is plenty of good that could have come out of this material. However, like Yamato and Suzuka's relationship, it is one step forward and two steps back. There are a decent amount of twists and relationship shifts to keep the plot from going completely stale. Some moments even manage to capture the hardships of adolescence fairly well. The problem is, however, that the show is rife with the contrived melodrama we already see all to often in this kind of show. Every action the characters make seems to solely serve the purpose of  making things as dramatic as possible. There is not a minute of subtly, as the show goes out of its way to spell out everything for the viewer, including things they could (and likely have) figure out on their own. This really spoils the fun for anyone who likes their drama refine and subtle; while doing nothing particularly special for fans of melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nYamato's internal monologues are particularly irritating; he spends his time wondering how to impress Suzuka or what will make him a good boyfriend. While this might seem to make him easy to relate to in theory, it is spoiled by the fact that he rarely makes responsible (or rational) decisions, and he NEVER shuts up! His infatuation with Suzuka goes well beyond the border into obsession, turning the sentiment from sweet into grating. Suzuka, for all the effort into making her sympathetic, is little more than a glorified plot device. Sure, her back story does invoke sympathy, but her mood swings come at the convenience of  the plot. Whenever things seem to be moving smoothly for Yamato, Suzuka has one of her mood swings and throws a monkey wrench in things; ensuring maximum drama.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the supporting characters more likable, though not anything great either. The one exception is Honoka, the quite girl with a crush on Yamato. Honoka brings some much needed, well-deserved emotion. Her endeavors to catch Yamato's attention are the sweetest moments of the show; her character revelations are the most heartbreaking. The rest of the cast, while more tolerable than the leads, are pretty run-of-the-mill. From Yamato's lady's man best friend, to the nosy track team girl, to the drunken residents at the apartment complex; all the characters are there to lighten the mood, or explain situations. None of them develop beyond one dimensional archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Suzuka is exactly what you would expect from a slice-of-life. Not really bad, but not good either; it definitely looks cheap. Character designs and backgrounds are more of the same, doing little if anything to differentiate from other series. Animation fluctuates from completely static to just enough to be believable movement. The show pretty much gets the standard slice-of-life treatment; the animation acts as a visual aid for what would otherwise be a radio drama. The soundtrack fairs better, but it still is pretty much what is expected. Composed entirely of either sappy orchestrated pieces for dramatic moments, or bubbly music for the lighter moments; the soundtrack is really nothing special, though it is used adequately.\\n\\n\r\nPlain is the word to describe Suzuka, or would be if it did not raise the melodrama to a nauseating level. The show offers up nothing special, everything is done by numbers. Unfortunately, it is also so rife with melodrama it is actually off-putting. Perhaps some fans of teen melodrama would appreciate this, but for a more casual viewer the drama is layered on too thick. And even for those who have an appetite for melodrama, satisfaction can be found elsewhere.",

One second she was warm and then she was cold and you never got to know her well enough to understand. You know next to nothing about her but that she's mourning over someone that she can't let go of. And yeah I can understand that but she had mood changes that made me want to just give up. Yamato was childish and ended up hurting people. He was also selfish and even though he said he got it he never really did. I didn't like the plot. I didn't like the characters, and by the end I was totally disintrested. Maybe this show is for some people but it's not for me.",

            "content": "A crush is a strange thing. It can start when someone shows kindness or sympathy for you, or it could happen with no more than a glance. \"Love at first sight\" they say. But in the same breath, they say \"Love is blind\". When you fall for someone, there's not much you can do, even if they are a complete and utter b@#ch. Enter Suzuka, a sports/\"romance\" anime that will take you on emotional ride. That is, if that ride were on a unicycle over a long, gravel road...\r\nSuzuki is supposed to be a high school romance drama, but...was it supposed to be romantic? Everyepisode felt like I needed something happy to happen before I could go to bed, and 26 episodes, 5 cups of coffee and one broken portable dvd player later I was no where near satisfied. Now, I'm not saying nothing good happened, but the sad and depressing HEAVILY out-weighed the other, and not in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nYamato Akitsuki is a little bit better than your average harem-idiot, but not much better. The thing that made him better was that he is somewhat realistic. However, when it comes to be being a high school boy obsessed with his crush, he's a little too realistic. His actions made me go \"Come on dude, really?\" more times then I care to count. He even joins his high school track team so he can spend more time around her. Why track? Well, she happens to be a promising talent in the world of high jumping. Who you ask? Well, the title says it all. \\n\\n\r\nSuzuki, one of the rudest, coldest, and despicable heroines you'll ever see in an anime. Now, there ARE characters like Taiga and Shana who are quite the same way, but they actual care for their men, and they admit to themselves that they have feelings for them. Suzuki on the other hand never ONCE admits she likes him to anyone, including herself, until the very end. And by end I mean the last five minutes. That would be okay with me if there was actually some hints or signs that she cared for Yamato, but it ends up being the opposite. In fact, she is so cold to him at points it becomes hard to watch, and makes you wonder why he is even trying. This in itself makes it hard for the viewer to want Yamato to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Honoka. Oh, Honoka. The only reason I continued watching, and probably why others did to. Honoka is the sweet, caring, and cute childhood friend character, and is genuinely in love with Yamato. I honestly wanted her to succeed, but this in itself led to another reason that the series became hard to watch. We all no there's no hope. Its named Suzuki. Its named after the one character that we want to succeed the least. Its heart-wrenching to watch her try only to get her heart broken.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was upset with the way the story turned out, but I can't ignore the fact that it got me talking about it. It definitely succeeded in bringing out the emotions in the viewer, so for that reason I didn't believe it was below average. and at some points was quite impressed with how the drama was done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand was BAD. This is sad to me, because it starts with a promising scene with Yamato walking down the sidewalk looking through the fence. It looked very good. And....that was the last I saw of those scenes. Still frames were used, ventriloquism was performed, and a scene was created where Suzuki looked like she was 7 feet tall.  These affected the drama at points because I didn't trust the art. What I mean is how can I trust that Suzuki's emotions are being portrayed correctly when Yamato turns his head only to have his hair stuck in the fabric of space for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I was humbly surprised by the soundtrack. Very pretty piano track accompanied the dramatic and \"romantic\" scenes, and was a big reason I kept watching. It added an element that was important to the drama itself, and if the soundtrack were poor, there is no doubt I would've dropped the series.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you want to take your chances on an unpleasantly heavy drama with very little satisfying moments, by all means go for it. It has fans for a reason, so it may very well be what your looking for. But personally, besides heavy drama and an above average soundtrack, it isn't worth sitting through 26 episodes.\\n",

            "content": "I recommend this series. It has well written characters (both lovable and unlovable) and I found it to be funny. \r\nThis series perhaps has some of the best supporting characters I have seen yet terrible leads. Let me explain:\r\nBoth Akitsuki and Suzuka are terrible leads for this series. Both of them have no respect for their friends and they both behave in ways that would be unappealing to the opposite sex. \r\nAkitsuki is essentially an obsessive stalker, doing things like peeping into her apartment and screaming at her door that he's never going to stop loving her even though she already rejected him\r\nSuzuka is essentiallya try hard and a bitch. Whenever someone is nice to her, she goes on a lecture-esque rant talking down to them and whenever someone does something weird or mean to her, she acts normal. She has an obsession with track and field, and also with \"having to be right\". \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I give this romance story a 7 you ask? Well, aside from these characters, everyone else is pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nYasunobu is Akitsuki's self proclaimed friend and he sort of knows how to act with the ladies...or at least thinks he does. He has a lot of good scenes, is funny, and offer's Akitsuki advice which Akitsuki manages to mess up. He also acts as great wingman and generally talks Akitsuki up in front of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka Sakurai is the pinnacle of girl next door. She is shy, kind, eager to please, and tries really hard to get the guy she loves (Akitsuki). Every other male character except Akitsuki knows this and I don't blame them. She tries to take care of Akitsuki and even joins the track team just to be with him. \\n\\n\r\nOf course there are more support characters and they all seem well done and likable, especially compared to the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is good if you don't take it at face value. It's funny, and I found myself watching it more to see how everyone around Akitsuki and Suzuka act than those two characters themselves. I think it's a good series that everyone should give a shot watching.",

There were no characters that stood out from the others in a good way either.

            "content": "\"If you stand still nothing changes.... but... if you take even a step forward....I have a feeling something will change, and something good will happen!\"\r\nHere's the thing about the romance genre... usually when I watch a romance anime, I'm able to guess what will happen and get it right, like which character will get with another or what's about to happen in the story. Now, here's Suzuka, what appears to be a typical romance anime at first glance, but once you get further into the story, everything starts to make you have a different opinion about this anime. There are multiple instances where a rugwas pulled out from under me unexpectedly. I thought one thing was going to happen, but it turns in a different direction and something else happens instead. While that can be good for those who like being surprised and hate it when they can guess everything, in Suzuka's case, this isn't always a good thing. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nMmkay, so the story goes like this... Enter Yamato, your typical 16 year old who moves to Tokyo to live with his Aunt and Cousin as he enters his first year of high school. His Aunt is the owner of an all-girls apartment complex and bath house, but seeing as he has no other relatives in Tokyo, he has to live there. Lucky break, right? Well... as he's cleaning the bath, some pretty bad stuff happens to him in a short period of time, and then, at the worst time, enter Suzuka, who happens to walk in on him as he accidentally tripped on top of a girl, and that left a pretty bad impression on her. They later talk about what happened, it's written off as a misunderstanding, and that's where their relationship in this series starts off. Pretty typical first episode, but after each episode, more things started to happen that made me think differently about this show. It had some clich\u00e9 moments like most romance animes do, but at the same time there was quite a bit uniqueness to the story, and that upped my opinion about this show.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka was brought to you by Studio Comet, the same company who brought other titles like School Rumble and Initial D, and it was directed by Hiroshi Fukutomi, who shouldn't really be known for anything huge. The anime was made in 2005, so about 8 years ago... and if I had to state my honest opinion, I'd say that the art style was mediocre overall... it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that I'd get hyped up over.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Suzuka on DVD, so I watched it dubbed. The cast selection was pretty good, with Todd Haberkorn and Leah Clark playing the lead roles, and Laura Bailey, Jamie Marchi, and Robert McCollum playing some of the supporting characters. They did a good job playing their roles, usually with a lot of seriousness to their tone which fit the mood of the show most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are usually what I spend the most time on talking about when I'm writing reviews, but in Suzuka's case, there isn't actually a lot to write about... but for starters, let's talk about Yamato, the main protagonist of Suzuka. I feel like he is your typical anime character, if not a little more clueless. A lot of the time, I'm wondering if he thinks before he speaks, and when he is speaking, if he actually knows what he's saying or if he's being controlled by someone who lives to ruin his life. A lot of the things he says or does makes me think that he isn't very considerate to others, and that made me want to shake him until he realizes what exactly is wrong. Now let's talk about Suzuka, the cold hearted love interest of the series, the one that this anime's name is based off of. Like I just said, she's cold hearted. At least 3/4 of the time, she is either ignoring Yamato (understandable at times...) or being a complete jerk to him. As for the other 1/4 of the time, she's either nice to him or worried about him, or she's not even in the scene. At points I wonder what Yamato sees in her, but I guess that's love for you. As for the minor characters, I can't really say that I had a favorite, due to the fact that there were almost no characters that I didn't want to strangle at some point. Asahina may be cute, shy and perfect, but she has some serious trust issues. Hattori might have given Yamato some relationship advice, but at least half of it got him slapped. Out of all the characters on this show, the one I liked most was Miki. She seemed like she was the most helpful and genuinely worried about people in Suzuka, and in my mind, even though I knew it wouldn't happen but was hoping for another rug pulling, I was rooting for her to get with him in the end. She had some minor flaws, like everyone else, but she was my personal favorite. But overall the character development wasn't exactly what I would call awesome. Like the art, it wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't good either.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal view on the show is that this isn't your typical romance anime. Once in a while, you'll come across a romance anime such as Say I Love You, or Itazura na Kiss, animes that actually fall under the romance slice of life category, because in reality, they are realistic if anything else. Suzuka is one of those animes. While I didn't necessarily care for most of the characters or art style, the story development and voice acting made up for it. There were moments that I felt super mad at people, and others that I felt bad for them, but overall this was a pretty good anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "Suzuka is not your typical anime romance/drama, whereas with a lot of anime romance it is either a harem or some magical tale, Suzuka stands apart as being a more realistic tale. The serise is based around Yamato and the girl of his dreams, Suzuka and all the trials and tribulations surrounding being round her. This series does take a panning from some people about the characters decisions during the series and how obvious it is that it is not the right thing to say, but for me that is the beauty of this anime, the fact is when you are in love you dosay things that you don't mean and are too stubborn to take back, I found myself cringing watching events unfold as have happend to me in real life, and looking to see how the characters got through those difficulties. \\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to critise artwork and sound in anime, the artwork in Suzuka is not up to the standard of modern Gonzo series, but it works and is true to the manga artwork, the characters are all very well done and as for the sound, the characters all feel right, there isn't an out of place cast member so it all works well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are all developed throughout the series and you do get to know the characters and their manerisms throughout the series, as I said earlier the characters come in for some abuse from some people, but isn't that the point? That the charcters are flawed like everyone else and can produce the reactions that make us want to go and rant on the forums about how stupid they have been? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, even all the bits that made me watch it from behind the chair and pause to get the courage up to watch the next bit, I thought I was alone in doing this but I gave this series to a friend and he did the same thing. Its a must watch in my opinion.",

That said Suzuka is an acquired taste and older viewers may like it more than younger viewers who will likely expect early payoffs in the story to keep them interested.\r\nThe series also doesn't quite fit the mould of a highschool drama and cannot be easily categorized.  It has the elements of a harem, mixed with a sports drama, but neither are fully developed.  Instead, we get a story of imperfect people leading imperfect lives.As a result, this may  lead some to become frustrated with the show, especially if they are conditioned to expect certain plot development and arcs from other stories in the same general genre.  \\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the next point.  The main leads can become quite grating in their stubbornness and imperfections as human beings.  Yes, Suzuka can be a real B*** and Yamato  is a doofus many times.  But this is a much better narrative mechanism that your typical high school drama where coincidences, misunderstandings, unrealistic situations and other unlucky happenings become a recurring theme  to keep the two lovers apart and drag the story on.  In Suzuka, the conflict is internal and the hand of the author is less apparent as an intervener.\\n\\n\r\nI did go ahead and read the summary of the 70 or so chapters the anime didn't cover, and in a way, it ends in a much higher note than so many other high school dramas where the mangaka pushes ahead with a bad ending after the anime has run its course.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good story with mediocre art and sound design. The unconventional mechanics will keep some interested, while the leads may frustrate others.   \\n\\n\r\nRecommended.",

Yamato doesn't help either he's supposed to be the guy you support, but his decisions were stupid and he never keeps his mouth shut especially when he needed to it was so annoying.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters were actually ok hell I was supporting Honoka until she eventually went out with Yamato and then they broke up over stupid reasons but luckily the breakup scene actually felt mutual which was alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance in this anime went up and down throughout the show whenever it concentrated on Yamato and Suzuka it was just awful I didn't want to support the relationship at all, it's funny how a love triangle made things better for this area.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a Sport aspect which is the saving grace of the show and it was actually interesting seeing Yamato improve his time on the 100m sprint and seeing his rivalry with Arima Emerson actually spiced things up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good Romance with Good characters look somewhere else because this isn't the place, but if you're interested in Love triangles and Sport then you might actually find something here, but for me this was just one painful journey.",

            "content": "Suzuka often reminds me of a contemporary piece of artwork. It's sloppy in a few ways and you don't really understand what's going on in some places. But most of all, it gives you a unique experience and an enjoyable piece of art to look at. Once the artwork's motive or story behind it is revealed, you often come to a different perspective of what it is on the surface.\r\nIts story really left an impact on me in some ways. It reminded me of, well, me. Trying new things, and ultimately coming to like what your doing. The path of love is harsh, bumpy, andoften belligerent as you trudge your way through to find the one that you want to be with, as I tried to do myself. With every action you take, life has to throw you for a loop and send you spiraling through emotional hardships that you must confront and handle the best possible way you can. Yamato frustrated me because of the way he tried, and that is why I respect its plot. Because not everyone is perfect, and criteria must be met and your heart tested to know the truth about yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good. I've seen anime similar to the style and better. Some of the kissing scenes were awkward and facial expressions were weirldly misshapen at times. The high jump that Suzuka did seem realistic, but at the same time they over do it and it ineptly represents what would really happen. Overall, improvements could have been made, but it played off averagely through the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh, the sound. I crapped my pants when silly scenes would come on because the background music sounded so hilarious. My brother and I often joke around with it and say that a bunch of drunk guys got together and played on a synthesizer and decided that it sounded awesome, so they put it in with an anime. Voice acting was patchy in some scenes and presented itself stiffly, but on occasions the acting was over par. Luckily, well played endings and an inspiring opening came to save the day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were fun to watch, and I often enjoyed seeing them unfold. I frequently expected little from the cast, and they always came up surprising me. The decisions they make (especially Yamato's, in my opinion) seemed unorthodox and fresh. Suzuka is always changing her mind and confused, and as a result, she comes off rough. She's the \"variable in the equation\" that could change at any moment. The supporting cast was good, too. Yasunobu played an amusing role as the bro that looks after you and hands out advice here and there, and Honoka had some unforeseen surprises that came along with her fragile and innocent character. \\n\\n\r\nI usually enjoy watching anime, and gladly this one didn't deprive me of that privilege. It was one of the first ones I watched, so what could I say? It was the right choice for \"a first show.\" It had me hooked and kept me that way for most of the show. There is something about watching others trying to figure out what to do with their lives and what they want that grabs the attention of my eye. Plus, it was during a stage in my life where romance was a problem, so I had something to concur with.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall experience was pleasurable. The story and characters stood out and made the enjoyment spring highly for me. Art and sound could be improved. I would highly recommend this show to anyone new to the world of anime as a must see, but veterans may think differently about an anime that is often looked down upon. To me, it was an adventurous and great anime!",

            "content": "Sick and tired of romances in anime that don\u2019t go anywhere? Wish to see something that dares to break the status quo and tell a story rather than appease the otaku-culture? Take a gander at Suzuka, a romantic triangle-drama with earnest character-development and constructive messages. \r\nWe follow our oblivious main character, Akitsuki, in his struggle to get through to the hard-headed Suzuka. We witness as he screws up, yet learns by taking advice from friends and by simply by being tenacious. The main couple are flawed characters that repeatedly mess up, sometimes to the point of annoyance, although the growth they go through gives itpurpose. With a good supporting cast the show manages to stick out and feel like a fully fleshed out community of people, one that feels varied and natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the weaker aspects of the series, as it is very much done by the numbers, letting the characters\u2019 interactions drive the plot rather than the visuals. The series does not try to be too open to interpretation and is very on the nose with its dialogue, never using any particular symbolism or creative visuals to tell the story. The artwork is very simple in that regard, never bad, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka holds a special place in my heart for catching me at a very important time in my teen-life, and to this day it is among the few animes that I\u2019ve walked away from feeling like it changed me as a person, giving me some perspective. As a teenager I was one of those self-appointed \"nice guys\", and a bitter one at that. When I finally was confessed to by a truly kind girl, I decided to give her a chance, despite not being attracted or romantically interested in her at all. Over time I regretted the decision as a relationship built on dishonest feelings would lead nowhere. I had my circumstances and simply happened to run into this series while in a similar situation that was presented in the story. I\u2019m certain that the messages that mattered to me might seem obvious to others, but none the less important for everyone to hear at least once. To be brutally honest with yourself, how to be more responsible, and that trying to please yourself by acting like a \"nice guy\" can sometimes in fact be most disrespectful thing you can do.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aspiring writer myself, my greatest wish is for my work to one day effect the people that read it. To make a difference is truly the best way to immortalize yourself. Despite its flaws, Suzuka managed to effect me for the better, and I am grateful to everyone involved that created this series. I must give this series the highest score there is.",

The anime was predictable, but believe there couldn't have been a better ending. This anime is the type of anime that will keep you screaming to your computer screen \"WTF\"\r\nI believe it is anime that is worth a shot.  The Anime will keep you entertained from episodes 1-26.

            "content": "Overall\t\r\nThe very start of this anime makes you believe it's gonna be yert another lame \"Love Hina\" style harem. Luckily that quickly turns out to be false. There is no \"girl of the week\" syndrome, and all in all \"Suzuka\" is actually a really nice love story.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nNot brilliant. The characters look a bit boring and the animation is stiff and at times awkward. \r\nThere is no fan service at all, but at least they don't censor the kissing scenes, as otherwise is common in anime.\r\nSound\t\r\nIntro and outro tunes are good. No top 10 material, but at least worthy of being in my \"listenable anime themes\"folder.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is ok, not bad but nothing great either.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nOk, 26 episodes is plenty, and it would certainly be possible to compress it into 13. But still, there are no fillers and every episode actually contributes to the story. So I don't really mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nAll of the characters are likeable and behave rationally (or at least realistically) most of the time. Suzuka is a complicated girl, but unlike for example Narusegawa from Love Hina, she actually has a reason for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is well thought out and fits well into the story and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nTotally re-watchable, but a bit long to be a re-occurring thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Lunaranime fansub was great.",

            "content": "i have to say i was honestly disappointed with the turn out of this anime.  The original manga is one of my top 3 overall, but as an anime it failed completely to live up to it's name.  \r\nStory:  To start with, ya the story was there, but it was missing all the wrong things.  Obviously scenes needed to be cut to get as much into it as they could, but frankly they cut all the wrong things.  The two big things about the story that bugged me the most, is#1 Every scene using the whole in Yamato and Suzuka's wall was excluded which was a very bad thing to take out in my opinion, those scene's where some of the ones that really made the manga shine, and i went into watching this hoping to see them, and was really disappointed when they weren't there.  That said, there where other little things what where missing but that's the big one to me.\\n\r\n          #2 THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY FINISH IT.  Only going to to the point when Yamato and Suzuka get together the first time was a huge disappointment to me.  I wanted the whole thing not just the first half of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Nothing about the art here stuck out to me.  There was a few times when i just went, well that's pretty of nice, but nothing was just eye popping wow to me.  It seamed like the character's where dull, bland basically.  They just never really seemed animated, like only the bar minimum was put into getting them finished.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery wasn't bad, it was detailed enough, and some scenes really looked like they had some effort put into them, but those where only the defining scene, all the just normal scenes where just eh! at best, nothing really special at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  This is an area where i'll say i was rather surprised.  Sure it was mostly your typical mushy romantic soundtrack, but there where times when it was just beautiful, perfectly placed, and other times where they did a great job of substituting the soundtrack with the actually characters singing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  I was actually decently happy with the characters.  They where pretty much spot on with the manga, and overall i just felt like i could relate and knew them when i was watching, the emotion and the little signs here and there where very nicely done.  The small side glances, and blushing looked great and did a perfect job of portraying how a specific character was feeling or thinking at the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Well first off like i said I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE MANGA, so in relation the anime wasn't bad as a comparison.  BUT i am very disappointed with it, I just didn't feel \"IT\" when i was watching.  Sure there where scenes that i laughed, cried a little, and felt i could sympathize with, but \"It\" just wasn't there, the thing that made the manga great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Basically if your a fan of the manga, watch it for nothing other than the nostalgia of it.  If you've never read the manga it's prelly a waste of time for most, and it drops half way through the actual manga, so you only get half the story.  It was a huge disappointment and to be perfectly honest i'm going to have to reread the manga now to remind myself of how good it really is.",

Yamato has just found out that he's attracted to Honoka since they kissed and he couldn't stop thinking about her lips and that kind of stuff just makes me wanna cry!!!!

            "content": "\"Suzuka\" has certainly made a lasting impact on myself.  Enough of an impact to actually post an online review.  \r\nWhat I liked most about this anime was how real it felt, how I sometimes was despising a character at one time and then sympathizing with them at another time, and how even though I have finished the anime series it still occupies a large portion of my daily thoughts.  I would never have guessed an anime series could stir up such feelings inside of me(I am not a very colorfull person, though, I am a total sucker for drama, ironically).  Anyways,on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nThough &quot;Suzuka&quot; does not stray far from the few locations of the story, the crux of the story falls solely on the characters and their relationships to one another.  Even more engrossing are the backstories some of the characters have, which further complicates the advances of one to another.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, I hated some of the characters for their actions and obesessions, but I can't help but take those feelings positively.  Raising such feelings, good and bad, is what makes anime shows like &quot;Suzuka&quot; so impressive.  And, though, I don't have an arsenal of anime experience, I believe &quot;Suzuka&quot; is a top notch drama/slice of life story.\\n\\n\r\nI gave &quot;Suzuka&quot; a rating of 9 because anything higher makes me feel like im cheating the anime community out of a heart written review.  Personally,  &quot;Suzuka&quot; has left a mark on me that is much more than just a number.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the anime series has convinced me that the manga will be just as great because the story has left such a lasting impact on myself and I plan on purchasing the last half of the manga chapters.",

            "content": "Never have i been so frustrated at a main protagonist. Self centred,naive and oblivious are some of the characteristics i would best discribe Yamato,a high school first year student who in order to \"chase\" a girl he likes (Asahina), joinned his school's track and field team. The reason i called him oblivious is that he fails to read suituations and react like any normal human being would do. Case in point,which guy in his right mind while giving his current girlfriend her birthday present, actually says while getting that said present,had such a good time with the girl that he used to like.Even though headmitted lying that he had an appointment with someone else,rejecting a date with the girlfriend (Honoka) in the process, one has to be pretty naive that he doesn't realised the reason why the Honoka might be angry and sad after what he had just said.There are also other instances where Yamoto doesn't know why his friends are reacting in the way they did,like Yasunobo getting angry for making Honoka sad yet Yamoto thinks he is wrong (self centeredness).I think that the writers of this anime is trying to portray Yamato as someone who is ernest but its to the point of making him look fake.This is the first time i actually felt that the male lead in an anime should just fail in everything he does so that i can see him cry. Even though the main protagonist is irritating,what saved this anime was the supporting cast like Yamoto's good friend Yasunobu and also Asahina's friend Miki whose views of the suituation involving the two main charactors,are level headed and often giving good advices. Overall,this is pretty ok given that it has sports element incoperated into a rommance anime but i think the writers could have done better with the way how Yamoto should have better closure with Honoka. 6/10 (would have been higher if not for the main protagonist)",

            "content": "Okay here's the thing out of all the RomCom/Drama animes i have watched, i have never seen such a shitty anime that left a really pathetic impression like this one. This is by far the worst RomCom drama i have ever seen.\r\nSuzuka is about a boy, yes, it is about a boy, and not a girl, i know, i know the title and the picture of Suzuka all covered in sweat are misleading but believe me a pussy drench in sweat is tastier than this, it should be titled \"Akitsuki's Love Conquest\" not Suzuka. So it's about a boy goes in the big city, filledwith hopes and dreams, meets girl, love at 1st sight, unrequited love, blah blah blah! In the end, they Ended up together with no chemistry at all! WTFFFFF!!!??? How did that happen?\\n\\n\r\nSo here's the deal why i really hate this anime i'll explain it 1 by 1.\\n\\n\r\nFirst the \"Plot\" yes the plot is shit, it is pure garbage! I felt so much hatred towards the whole anime and the people behind it. At first it was okay i kinda laugh a bit, but, as the story progresses, it degrades itself further and further away to the point that it doesn't make any sense at all. A boy falls madly in love to a girl whom he just met, who doesn't even love him back, but still never gives up, but to what reason? wtf? Who does that? Are you willing to give all you've got to a woman you just met? Come on! I know love at first sight is sometimes real, but there are steps! There are boundaries! Now a beautiful girl who actually cared came up and what happened? Yeah the ship sank! It did not only sank but it got destroyed! I can't seem to understand the reason why or how it happened. And of course, the only reason why he joined sports it's because of that girl, and that girl is the only motivation why he competes so that he can confess to her. Talk about a low blow in Sports! The spirit of sportsmanship and competitiveness towards your team and competitors is not there at all, because of a selfish motivation! Clearly the people behind this did not think it through. The plot is very weak it didn't leave any good impressions at all only bad ones.\\n\\n\r\nSecond! Ah! Here's my favorite part, the Characters! Lets talk about the Male Mc! Good ol Akitsuki! Talk about annoyance in GODLIKE MODE! I have never ever been annoyed like this in my entire life! This character is annoying as FUCK! He is so annoying and irritating that i almost punch and smashed my TV only because of his face! He's so fucking Annoying that everytime his face pops up i pause the TV and put my middle fingers up to his face and curses him for 10 mins! He is probably my most hated character ever! He's like a leech stuck to my brain! He is like a fucking dog! All he barks about, is Asahina this Asahina that! I thought i was going crazy!\\n\r\nIt's not only him though, Asahina too, her tsundere attitude is like none other! Talk about queen of tsunderes! Damn that girl is really hard to crack! (Actually tsunderes are easy to crack with the right timing and correct approach which clearly the main character lacks the most).\\n\r\nThe only 2 persons i only like are Hattori and Miki, they seem to be mature they give alot of advice and support.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nThe Arts is mEh! though i wish they could've made the girls a lil bit cuter\\n\\n\r\nWell i guess that is all for today i give it a 1/10!\\n",

But the thing that makes me feel weird is that, I feel like I want a second season to see what kinda happened after the ending.

            "content": "kouji seo is by far my favourite author, he has an ability to emit emotions through his art which can be described as being a mixture of old schoold manga with new school techniques.Suzuka was the first ever romance that truly caught my attention not only because the themes are realistic and the plot is consistent but the art style is not you're typical cutesy anime style that we get a lot of nowadays the style is very mature in nature and suits the themes well.In order to appreciate this anime you must also read the manga believe it's worth the time Suzuka gives Yamatoa run for his money which makes his character go through a lot of changes which we do see at the end.I would recommend this anime to anyone that is into romance this is a must have in you're manga and anime list,this anime is not heavy at all in fan service and the story focuses in the perspective of Yamatos quest to conquer suzukas heart, the has a very interesting choice of characters which clash with each other rather than complimenting each other as opposed to more modern animes, the story is not overwhelming at all and is as realistic as it can be. This anime is a love story and a beautiful one. the sequel to this beautiful story continues in the new manga by Kouji Seo called Fuuka.",

            "content": "A few years ago i found out about Suzuka and I always wanted to see it out of curiosity because i heard from a lot of people that it's more mature than other romance anime out there so i finally gave it a shot and i was ultimately disappointed\r\nFor me personally there where 2 major issues with this show\r\n1) Suzuka is a story that could have been easily told in 11 to 13 episodes and as you\r\nmay already know the show has 26 which means that there is a lot of unnecessary filler \r\nNow that wouldn't be a huge problem if....\r\n2) The characters weren't soirritating . Suzuka while i didn't hate as much as other people i felt that her shtick got old really fast and Yamato is without a doubt one of the worst protagonists i have ever seen in an anime like this . \\n\\n\r\nYou are supposed to take him seriously and feel for him and i did in the first 10 episodes or so but after that i got really REALLY tired of him . No personality , no pride and most importantly he always wanted to appear like a nice guy than actually being one . \\n\\n\r\nI think it all goes back to the show being way too long for it's own good because at the first 10 episodes you tolerate him but after he finds himself in the same situations over and over and over again you get sick and tired of him and to a lesser extend Suzuka because at least she had a traumatic experience that made her that way , Yamato did not . He is just your typical insecure teen which makes the show kinda realistic? ...I guess? ....\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters go they are your standard anime tropes . The lady's man best friend , the overly helpful teamate that eats a lot but has a nice body anyway etc.\\n\r\nThe only character i kinda liked was Honoka's famous friend\\n\\n\r\nAlso i want to mention that if Track and field isn't your thing at all you are going to be very bored . The show took a nose dive for me the moment Yamato started training so be aware of that as well .\\n\\n\r\nIn closing should you watch Suzuka? I honestly don't know since these things are very subjective but here's what i can tell you . If you are in high school i think you are going to like it more than me because i think that that's the target demographic for this show\\n\r\n If you are curious seek out the manga because it continues the story after high school which is always nice\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day it was your average teen romance story that was unfortunately longer than it had to be .\\n\\n\r\n5/10 ( Average)\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! This was my first review and English isn't my first language so i hope that i didn't mess up that bad . Have a nice day :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "To be honest,I don't watch a lot of sports anime.The only sports anime I have watched were the awesome show, Bamboo Blade, that abomination called Wanna Be the Strongest in the World, and the OVERhyped recently aired show Yuri on Ice. Sports isn't my niche, since every sports movie I have watched ever had to do with either some team losing and then winning or some person being crap at sports and then getting better. But, this show is NOT a sports anime, its a really subpar romance\"dramedy\" with a stupid protagonist and probably the most insufferable girl to ever come across as a loveinterest.\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to make this as quick as possible to save your time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about this boring guy named Yamato who falls in love with this track star Suzuka and pretty much falls head over balls for her and you think she would get the message but I guess it was her job to act like a bitch for the sake of the plot.Thus we have dumb characters making even dumber decisions that affect the other characters who don't get even a quarter of screen time as these two idiots.:oh and also there is some track sports introduced too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre which doesn't make sense at all since this is a sports show.It has that budget that would be right for a romance but not enough to make a sports anime. BEGRUDGINGLY, the art really looks gorgeous during those scenes that take place at night with fireflies.(which happens like once in the whole show).\\n\\n\r\nThe highest point of the show is it's soundtrack because believe it or not, its actually not bad, the Suzuka theme is nice to listen to, and the opening was really catchy.But that part only lasts for a moment before the insufferable characters,\\n\\n\r\nspeaking of which......The characters,\\n\\n\r\nthe main character, Yamato, is an idiot.He immediately falls in love with this girl jumping over a pole bar for some reason.And every time he makes a move, Suzuka acts like a bitch towards him either it being drama or being comedic.There is a whole reason why she acts like that and it's explained eventually but its so unbelievable and makes no sense.Then around the middle of the series , Yamato turns into Mokoto from School Days for some reason, and there are other characters but lets face it... you don't really care about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole reason I watched this show was because it fitted in one of my favorite niches: slice of life. but I had no idea what I was in for when the back of the dvd said \"love is not a spectator sport\" but the way this show depicts love as American football in which two teams spend their time running into each other to achieve something but goes nowhere and leave everyone else hurt for nothing.\\n\r\nOh and that freaking stupid ending......the show STRUGGLED soo much to have this romance happen between these two idiots and Suzuka decides to act like a bitch at the wrong time and that chemistry just evaporates.It may not sound like it, but i do not completely hate this show.it was just disappointing. No matter how bad a show is, i am a musically inclined person so this show was lucky to have good music otherwise i would have crucified this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\\n\r\nI think the romantic tension between Taiga and Daiki from Kuroko no Basket is more interesting to see\\n\r\nso, watch that instead. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

However, as the slow, repetitive episodes lingered and the characters followed suit; I realized that the characters themselves began to mean more and more. Usually character development and change is the inciting factor for the overall and continued endearment of a character, but in Suzuka, the impervious resolution of the characters to stick to who they are, is actually their most charming characteristic. \r\nIf you are into love/drama/comedy (there seems to be intended and even more unintended comedy throughout), and you can stick around through the rough andfrustratingly stubborn characters; you may eventually see that sometimes what someone is made out of is polished through repetition, and that foolhardy, passion does mean something. There are easier ways to do things but Yamato Akitsuki and Suzuka do not understand the easy route. Sometimes, 'there is no right and wrong in love, and a person is neither wrong nor right.' If legitimate and sincere love is there, it is very difficult to replace or cover it up.",

            "content": "With Suzuka you will either love/like it or hate it.  The show starts rather unimpressive in the beginning episodes but begins to find its stride around the 5th and 6th episodes.    \r\nAt first I really didn't think much of Suzuka but by the end I knew it had an some kind of impact on me.  Suzuka's magic comes from how people builds walls around themselves that prevent them moving on with their lives and it's this message that the show conveys in a way that doesn't totally browbeat you over the head with it.\r\nThe story is your basic boy meetsgirl.   Yamato a boy from the country moves to a new city to find a new life and there he meets a beautiful track star named Suzuka.  Little does he know the girl he likes lives right next door to him.  Yamato and Suzuka quickly develop a friendship and start to develop feelings for one another kept in the safe land of vagueness of friendship, then Yamato confesses to Suzuka at the park and he gets rejected and it's after this rejection the real story begins.  Little does Yamato know why Suzuka rejected him even though she had sadness and regret in her eyes when she did.  The whole story revolves around Suzuka why she is the way she is.  Now I don't want to spoil it but there is a lesson in the last episode that saying anything more would give away too much.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka tends to get a lot of hate because many people who watch it have no idea the characterizations of the two main characters are based on reality.  In reality there are people like Suzuka and Yamato and even worse.  So whether or not you can relate to the main characters depends highly on your own maturity level and awareness of the kinds of people in the real world around you.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said there are some problems with the characterization however where the characters do some things that don't make sense.  Particularly with Suzuka and her past and the way she seems unrealistically fickle towards the end of the series with Yamato which tends to drag out the conflict between them.   Yamato on the other hand tends to be the most realistically rendered character - he begins as your typical indecisive teenager but starts getting serious about having goals in his own life and grows as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story can be problematic.  The show tries to juggle too many things.   Between doing sports, the conflict between Suzuka and Yamato, and how the anime flirts with side relationships with the other girls besides Suzuka.  There were simply not enough episodes to make sure other side characters got enough screen time to be characterized correctly.   In short, the anime directors couldn't figure out what they wanted to focus on so Suzuka tends to drag out its conflict between the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you can get over the fact this anime drags something out a little too long and don't mind your anime with some flaws and you dig a more realistic take on romance then Suzuka is right up your alley.",

If this doesn't bother you too much, Suzuka is definitely worth checking out.\r\nSuzuka is a fine romance anime but it would b A LOT better if it didn't have one of the worst male leads ever. Seriously, if we are going to spend 80% of the show following Akitsuki Yamato's actions and thoughts, then it sure as hell would be a whole lot more enjoyableif Akitsuki wasn't a total bitch. If you look at the motiviation of ANY of his actions through the first few episodes, you'll see they all revolve around himself and what he wants. Any little thing Suzuka does he automatically thinks she did it because of him because he is full of himself and thinks everything is about him (which sadly it is) I cannot decide if the creators of this anime were trying to make this character likeable, and if they were, then it was a complete failure and it makes Akitsuki all the worse of a male lead.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Akitsuki Yamato literally being a whiny crybaby, the rest of the show was good, altho the enjoyment factor does go down bcuz no1 can enjoy a show if the lead is a pussy.\\n\\n\r\nBe warned! I know that there are a lot of shows where all you wanna do is hate the lead character, and personally i find it hard to enjoy following the stories of those douchebags. And thus, this review is to let you know that Suzuka can be one of those shows! If you don't like that in a show, don't watch it!",

            "content": "Be Honest, I'm really glad that my very first anime when I first enter watching anime career is Suzuka. It really is a blast, an anime strong enough to lit up the spark encourage me to look for more animes...\r\nFirstly, for a little reminder, Suzuka is a basically slow-pace romance anime, with comedy, school life, and sport is just act as setting to bring the characters closer into certain events.\r\nBy far, still in my heart one of top 3 favourite romance animes that I have ever seen. The story begins with MC having one-sight love with female MC, witnessing her long jump...\r\n Ok, about characters,Suzuka Asahina is Ace of long jump and was scouted in full scholarship. She is practically less socializing with people, serious about how high she jumps but still the type hard-to-talk-to in the outside but still care and eager for someone stay aside, I like scenes when her smiles (it's very pretty and how they drew the background, accompanied with amazing bgm, Oh My God, the feels, how the winds blow her hair, blushing slowly as breeze lifting up some of her hair~ Just imagine it) Akatsuki has optimistic, active, determined, yeah he is brave ( i mean the all things he did even after being rejected, he still tries (& never gives up), and at track& field he really did his best ...Why? for Asahina surely...\\n\r\nEvery anime has a bad guy, well arrogant handsome blonde who is highlighted as champ ( well girls like him though~), Honoka- all-capable character, can cook, kind, and pretty agressive in chasing Akitsuki ( very bold you can say ) How am I suppose say? well Asahina did have a back story behind her attitude, I heard people bad-mouth like she is rock-hard bitch or something, but it's all settings, it's what the creator has planned to make the character how different they are meant to be, the uniqueness ~\\n\r\nWell, yeah Love Triangle do occurs and some people might say what? 26-ep? will this worth my time? watch a few episodes, it's not interesting, Duh~ stuffs\\n\r\nAnswer: It definitely worth your time except you are the type who enjoy flash love, harem and dramatic type. Oppositely 26 ep really is an advantage, it provide detailed plot, awesome characters' development as well as how the love grows as crystal clear as you can hope for, detailed not equal to boring, Duh~I mean, I am happy about it, I can hear its sweet and heart-moving OST and bgm while I am enjoying this anime and I practically understand it all, leaving no grief or questions bothering me~\\n\r\nWell, for the art, it's fantastic, well cos it's 2007 till now it's 8 year ahead, so don't expect flashy colour, pause-scene emphasizing how a character feels(+ their monologue like Nisekoi), It ain't gonna happen. Its character design really is very viewer-friendly and represent the characters& behavior brought by every character perfectly.\\n\r\nMoreover, the story has its head-start with First-Love that make MC swear to get the girl no matter what it takes, then at development phase, classic events like 1st time hanging out with friends, homestay beside competition area, praying at shrine and lots of them * Sorry, i really can't spoiler , this anime is too good for me to spoil it...\\n\r\nMaybe you may think that I boast a lot , but I really enjoy this anime,( every minutes I watched, I was relaxed, smiling in the heart) it's educative as well, teaching you not to give up, make a move ahead of yourself as nobody gonna help u do that, and etc. Well, sure the plot is packed, they included the hardship they face to begin their relationship, What is right or wrong, Who , and to Whom I love or to give my love to or being loved, Do I really love her/him or something like that.  It creates quite a number of awesome events supporting what leads to development of romance between the characters, just like a staircase, well an elevator actually ( You can say so, it really didn't need u to walk it, the story will walk you, move your heart)\\n\r\nAs I have pinpointed before, Suzuka is clearly easily understandable, so it implicates what? means that they left viewers with no worries and move on feeling what a character may feel and the atmosphere that they give to us + the awesome animation,gestures of characters and well-decorated with smooth & nice art background. Then you have it, It's what Suzuka can give you. And, about the details of characters ( as because what make an anime awesome also quite dedicated by characters' development so, I didn't wanna show you, maybe watch it at someone's review, as the before and after really.. really the character grows and it's nice, very very NiCe ~)\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, the plot and event is packed, nice & comfortable but not flashy and many effects art style, BGm and OSt that can make you Eargasm~ and What & How special a character can be as an individual, Ok, sneak peek abit ( As the story move to after half a series, there is beautiful Firefly scene( very touching, heartwarming) and Omg how Honoka chasing Akitsuki aggressively and story behind Suzuka and how they managed to solve it, How, Why, What happened and Which way they have chosen on, there's plenty of stuffs you can see in there, ( sorry if my review doesn't help much, but No Spoilers, i wanna keep surprise, keep it mystery to anyone who wanna watch this anime and get a glance on my review 1st, I love this anime and so do I hope you to love it too ~ Hontoni Arigatou to see my review, thanks",

            "content": "Suzuka is an anime that initially shows great potential but then slowly ambles its way across the finish line. The drama in this show comes from the troubled romance between the main characters and the complications that they mostly create for themselves. In some cases this can be funny and interesting, particularly when the characters are likable and you want to see them succeed. However, in the case of Suzuka, both of the main leads are highly unlikable people and you sort of want to see them jump off a tall building - preferably together.\r\nThe supporting cast isn't much better, being littered with typical one-dimensionalanime archetypes that seem to exist only as backdrop to occasionally poke Yamato or otherwise torment him. \\n\\n\r\nThe only standout character is Honoka Sakurai, who starts off as a typical anime ingenue and love rival for Yamato's affections, only to grow and mature into a young woman who moves past the indecisive and careless Yamato at practically warp speed. Honoka - wherever you are, you dodged a bullet girl. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, the best part of this anime is the title song by COACH, \"Start Line\".  It's great and really deserves a better anime.\\n",

            "content": "Suzuka is the perfect choice for those who want to break from the action-packed for a while and have a little taste of mellow. This series is both Sports and Romance [odd thing is this is classified as shonen, because the manga was published in a shonen weekly] but it's really like a shoujo anime.\r\nThe animation and art style  is average but this does not mean that it's unappealing. Actually the characters are cute looking [which kinda reminds me of Gravitation for some reason] Good choice of colors...tho I did have to zap it up a notch with some color saturation.\r\nBoth  OP andED are sung in English which was an interesting change of pace for me [which asks the question: is J-POP considered J-POP if sung in English?] but the music was not quite there. I'd almost would like to say I might have liked it if it were sung in Japanese. Because sometimes when you actually hear and understand the words of a song then things like the meaning, significance and sentimentality are received differently. The English Voice actors were top notch, no complaints there.\\n\r\nWith the story I have to say...there is one GLARINGLY unique characteristic this anime has above most other anime of this genre and that is the fact that this is a love story told from the perspective of a boy.....a HETEROSEXUAL boy! I have to admit I have never come across an anime quite like this. Love stories are traditionally shoujo and thusly told from a girls point of view with a female lead. I've also seen sensitive boys but only in the realm of BL stories. Harem, Ecchi and Hentai are not quite love stories [so I'm not going to accept Love Hina or Mahoromatic] I might accept Boys Be  tho. But this is the first genuine love story I've seen where it's the guy who sits in the main seat of emotional angst. If there are other anime like this, by all means feel free to message me or comment on my page. Overall I liked this story and how it was told. I also liked the drama between the characters as well as the tension.\\n\r\nThe two main characters seem to be the most developed: Suzuka and Yamato. Also some of the secondary characters like Honoka, are believable. Of course there was a love triangle Suzuka-Yamato-Honoka [I'm not going to say who won] but I was rooting for Honoka. Because Honoka was nice, pretty and a very sympathetic character. That's why she gets the Best Character award for this series. \\n\\n\r\n**Bishounen Hunter's hottie alert!**\\n\r\nYamato and Yasunobu. Yamato has a very simple look with spiky black hair and large, expressive black/gray eyes. That combined with his simple Asian boy-next-door good looks and his can-do attitude makes him a bishounen hottie. Yasunobu is just a hottie physically, he has the J-POP idol look down pat: the bleached hair, the clothes, the tan. He also has nice eyes. His personality is a bit on the obnoxious side but he is a devoted friend to Yamato.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a lite show that easy to digest. It doesn't get weighted down with cumbersome characters and convoluted plot twists. The story is nicely paced for a \u201cslice of life\u201d anime and I especially love the fact it's a love story told from the viewpoint of a boy.",

I really love each character and the story line seems pretty decent.. I'm hoping for abit more backstory to a few things but let's see how that works out! So far my only problem? Suzuka.. Like damn bitch! This dude is willing to move mountains just for you to say something nice to him and you're being a complete asshole about it... I get that her character is supposed to be heartless or some shit but damn! If I didn't have any emotions(idk?) then as a character she's a really good one but I just hate her.. Art seems a little out of date and could be renewed (pls anime lords) and the sound seems decent at most times! Even character has their own unique story and it's interesting to see them adapt to each other.. I'm enjoying it so far and will update as I go on!\\n\\n\r\nI've now finished the series and have no intention to read the manga so this will not include anything that happens outside of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story line turns out pretty good.. It was basically the exact copy of Kimi no iru machi and It turned out to be a really good copy of it! Each character played their spots well and it was good to see each characters emotions bloom out and develop as they went. even though the ending felt abit off to me due to all that build up just for them to go to a grave and say \"yeah, I like him now\" felt stupid.. I would of much preferred that rain scene with the kissing as the proper ending with a little added on top! Overall the art stayed the same pretty much along with sound.. Each character got to develop their stories and characters pretty well and I just really enjoyed it all together! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're looking for a romance series where you'll hate the female lead all through out? Then stop on by! The series was still really enjoyable and I would recommend it to the 'romance, drama' type genre where you'll think \"wtf! why did this happen\" every 5 minutes! :D",

Suzuka has that feel like no other. The music is amazing, and the layout of Tokyo is beautiful. \r\nThe story is a boy who travels to Tokyo to go to high school there. He lives with his aunt who oparates a womens bath house. While in school Yamato happens upon a girl named Suzuka who he immediately falls for. Only to find out later, she lives right next door to him. the final outcomeis really satisfiying and its a happy one, which I always love in slice of life stories. Suzuka is charming and full of heart, its not something you should go and see right away, but if you get the chance too jump right on it. It's also the perfect anime for a rainy day.",

I suppose it's just mediocre. And not something that will stick with you.\r\nCharacter: 1/10\r\nI liked some of the supporting chars far more then the main chars, unfortunately they didn't get much screen time. The anime mainly focus's on Yamato's feelings and he can bea bit of a moron at times, and even become to be a bit obsessive. Suzuka was a total bi***, She would have these constant mood swings during a nice moment, and flip out. Honestly I think she needs to see a psychologist and get pills for her bi-polarism. She was unbearably annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\npretty much for the reason's I stated above, mainly Suzukas Bi-polar bitchiness is what ruined it for me...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nThis just wasn't my cup of tea.. :/\\n",

People sure can find the ending of this anime satisfying but the real pleasure is reading what comes next. Their is so much more to know about this.\r\nThis is, by far, the best story of a man that can't stop loving a women and who continues to work their relationship to get her telling him YES.\r\nFor the anime only watcher, believe me, even with the last episode of this anime,IT IS NOT OVER. Soo much more happens to then after that.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the reason I gave the story a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nAs of the Art and the Sound, well young people may be unsatisfied, considering the quality we get from our anime in 2014. But I believe you can forget these elements quite easily.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the characters an 8/10 simply because of how mad I was to see them repeat mistakes. It affects you in a way, making you believe there is something that could have been better... but in the end, that's the same mistakes we all make at one point in our life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Well I passed 16 hours watching the anime and then reading the manga. No sleep. Was a bad idea but... well it's something you just CAN'T stop thinking of..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I gave it a 9/10 to make it more realistic to what I just told you. Would make it a 10/10 because it's a story that affected me in a profound way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this if you just got dumped, or said NO, by your best friend (boy or girl). Kinda tear me appart.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the mistakes :)",

            "content": "I remember getting home from wal mart with a DBZ Box set, I loved Dragonball Z, considering the only anime I had ever watched was DBZ and Naruto. Now I Know what you're thinkng - \"This is supposed to be a review of Suzuka, not Dragonball Z.\" Well The point of my story is the ad of other Funimation Anime inside that boxset caught my eye. I decided to try one out, and that anime just happened to be Suzuka. This is the Series I remember as my \"Gateway Anime\". That's why I'm choosing to write my 1st review on it. \r\n TheStory: The story was somewhat average, A country boy moving to the city and falling in love. However, That's not of how I thought of it when I watched it, or when I re-watch it. The story was something that had many twists. I could, and still can, relate to the story, as I'm sure most teens would feel the same way. That's Why I'm Giving the Story a 9.\\n\\n\r\n The Art: The art was Astounding the first time I saw it. Now I know it's not the best artwork ever, but When I look at it today, I still think it's pretty good! However, As  much as I love Anime, I'm not much of a critic on art style. Every Manga Artist is different, that's part of what makes the anime and manga unique. I'm going to give it an 8. \\n\\n\r\n The Sound: I remember not being able to get enough of this Anime's Opening song- The song is called \"Start Line\" and is sung by COACH I believe. The first ending was also Pretty catchy. However, the fact that I had to look these songs up to remember them after all these years brings the overall sound to an 8.5, but I'll put a 9. ;)\\n\\n\r\n The Characters: Now here was my main selling point on This Anime, The Characters. Now most people will probably tell you that the characters aren't very unique, They're just your average teenagers, with raging hormones, trying to figure out what they're good at, what they want, and basically who they are. I don't tend to disagree, but that's not what makes the characters dull, that's what makes them so amazing. They are so relatable, and I think that's a very important aspect of a good character. I'm going to give Yamato, Suzuka, Honaka, and every other character in this anime a 10. \\n\\n\r\n The Enjoyment: I believe you probably understand by now that I enjoyed this Anime a lot. I reccomend it to Anime newcomers and Veterans alike, and giving it a 10 in the entertainment section. What I mainly love about this anime is the twists. I can understand Yamato's actions about 80% of the time, but Dang Girls are unpredictable. lol. (That's not a bad thing for all you ladies out their.) ;)\\n\\n\r\n Overall: I'm going ton give this a 9/10. Although I can't begin to tell u how close I was to giving this anime a 10/10.  In the end I decided not to let the sentimental value of this anime being my first raise the score that much. I'm going to rate it how it is, A very enjoyable Anime. I hope this review convinces somebody out there to watch Suzuka!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok so this is my first ever review, and with the sequel, Fuuka, just dropping I figured now would be as good a time as any to write a review for this show. *Full disclaimer* The main reason I'm writing this is because Suzuka was the first romance anime I ever had the pleasure of watching. I had been into shounen like DBZ and Naruto for years prior, but freshman year of college was a dark time for myself and I found this anime out of the blue, started watching and instantly fell in love with the premise of the romance/slice of life genre. Inshort Suzuka got me through an incredibly trying time in my life and was my gateway to the wonderful anime community as a whole and it will forever hold a special place in my heart because of that! \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, Suzuka is a lovely romance/slice of life anime that throws sports into the mix to make for a very interesting story in my opinion. The use of sports to explore the relationship between two people is nothing new, and there have been many a movie and TV shows that have done it better I can assume, but despite that the story just sticks with ya and I think the MCs' relationship developing around their sporting activities helps with that. While I've seen many a people complain about the contrived nature with which the romance develops in the show, and I can completely understand that point of view, I think that if one looks a little deeper and really tries to get inside the head of the titular character Suzuka, you'll come to have a much more profound understanding of why the romance develops the way it does. Suzuka is great because the feelings presented by the MC Suzuka are so complex, so real that you can feel the conflict that she feels and the way it is presented is quite masterful imo. If you want an anime that will leave you with a huge case of the feels then look no further, and if you are a relative new comer to romance and slice of life and shojo genres, then I think this a perfect gateway anime to get your feet wet, and if you end up wanting to dig a little deeper into it that option is always there as well.",

With an almost fairy-tale like quality to it.\r\nOur main character, Yamato, first sees the heroine of the story (Suzuka) on his way over to his new apartment and instantly develops a crush on her. When, by pure coincidence, Suzuka turns out to be his next-door neighbor and lives in the same block of apartments as him.\r\nThis is where the fairy-tale aspect comes into the show, there's a lot of charming little coincidences like this and this allows us to really look forwardto how the relationship between the main characters develop.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this story wants to be realistic and make the relationship development seem like a struggle. So our two main characters develop strong imperfections out of nowhere. Past episode six, Yamato becomes a thick-headed idiot who can't decide things for himself and follows Suzuka around to an almost stalker-like tendency and Suzuka herself becomes a stubborn, cold-hearted character with more mood swings than any other female character in the anime medium.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes the show become a chore to watch and this only worsens when you realize that by episode twenty-four, they still haven't had any heart-felt moments since episode six. (Which is the episode before everything went wrong, surprise, surprise.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they're nothing important and mostly bland archetypes. Which doesn't help to pull the story along at all. There's also a second love interest for Yamato, who creates a love-triangle, but she mostly serves as padding and nothing is gained with her on-screen presence.\\n\\n\r\nI've left the art and sound till last because they isn't much to say about them. The art is low-budget but not painful to look at and does get you by if can overlook a few odd bits here and there and the sound isn't too good either. The opening music is good, but the sound in the actual show is boring and repetitive as well as just feeling lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'll wrap up this review that by saying that Suzuka starts off as a sweet, romantic anime with potential. But suddenly tries too hard to be realistic after episode six and in doing so, all the imperfections of the characters grow and become more painfully obvious until they are completely unlikable people. I imagine that Suzuka wanted to be like Pride and Prejudice, but was way out of it's league and ended up forgetting the qualities that made it good in the first place.",

A simple plot but will catch the watcher's interest if romance is his or her cup of tea.\r\nThe story is good for many reasons, although sometimes clich\u00e9 when it comes to the twists. Many different romantic feelings are expressed throughout the series, a lot of it being a display of what the characters are thinking. Several relationships go up and down in terms of intensity, commitment, and questioning whether the relationship is healthy.\r\nI will go ahead and say that I thought the story was perfect regarding pace. Nothing ever goes too rushed or too dragged on.Also, each episode will keep watchers wondering what will happen next, in a very natural way.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw about the story was the abundant predictability of it. It didn't bother me much though. I think there is some predictability that is necessary in storytelling, especially if it is relating by any means to romance.\\n\\n\r\nI adored mostly every bit of music in the show, setting the correct mood most of the time. In comedic moments, happy/sad moments, etc. I think it was what is expected for a light romance story.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Yamato, was very interesting to me. He was very determined and joined a sports team mainly for the purpose of winning the heart of Suzuka, who I thought was a likable character as well. This is mainly because of her attitude and clever thinking regarding what Yamato's goal was after all.\\n\\n\r\nI purely enjoyed the series from start to finish. But I give this anime an 8 because it obviously won't appeal to everybody due to some clich\u00e9 drama and events. Personal enjoyment doesn't determine the score",

I was on YouTube just two days ago and Suzuka episode 1 was in my recommendations. I came to this website to read the synopsis and after reading it, I thought I would give it a try.\r\nThe anime seemed interesting from the start. I heard from people that this anime wasn't at all what they expected it to be and that it sucked, but I think that they're wrong. This anime was a really good slice of life and can be well related to someof us. People who like romance, drama, humor, and a good slice of life anime should really give this a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was somewhat of a slow start but it did have a lot of good character build up within the first couple of episodes. It was something I don't really mind because all animes should have character build up so you know who's who and what not.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the story really hit off, the anime got more and more interesting and really drew me in. I kept watching episode after episode to find that I finished the whole series in about nine and a half hours or so. I really thought that this anime was great. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thought that the anime was wonderful. It really got to me at some points. It made me tear up but, that's just me. It was a great romance, had really good drama, some good humorous parts, and some really good touching parts that'll give you some goosebumps. Pretty good \"Slice of Life\" as well.",

This is probably most noticeable when people are running\r\nAs for the story (8/10)... I thought it'd just be the usual in a romance anime -  lead male tries to win over the lead female throughout the entire anime, but I was wrong. The story went into different things such as the lead male actually joining AND making progress in a club. Another thing the story went into, which isthe first time I've seen it in an anime, is a different love interest. This was very interesting and felt like it gave the enjoyment a boost just as the enjoyment might have been peaking. However, this can serve as a distraction to the main plot. I couldn't even support the ending whole-heartedly because of this. Speaking of plot... because the story went into different things it takes until almost the end of the anime before the real route is resumed (like I said.. distraction right?)\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 - Good opening song and the BGM was perfect. The BGM was subtle but it could still emphasize the scenes and make you feel more\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - We've been given a handful of colorful characters here, though not much character development happens. Some of the supporting cast were pretty rounded which was enjoyable. It's silly how important a certain support character is, yet how little impact they made. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 - The anime is very interesting. You should give it a try at the very least.",
